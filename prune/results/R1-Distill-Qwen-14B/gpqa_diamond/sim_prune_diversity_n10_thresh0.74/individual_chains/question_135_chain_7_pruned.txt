Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, that's probably a typo. Oh, I think it's supposed to be something like λ ψ_f(y) X(y) ψ_f(y), but maybe that's more about the interaction form. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. We're asked about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So I need to find all the possible fermion-antifermion pairs that the X boson can decay into.

Okay, kinematics here means that the mass of the X must be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because each fermion and antifermion would have to have energy at least their rest mass. So the decay X → f f-bar is allowed only if 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So first, I need to find out the masses of the known fermions. Let me recall the approximate masses:

- electron (e): negligible, about 0.0005 GeV
- muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- up (u): about 2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
- down (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- strange (s): ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- charm (c): ~1.25 GeV
- bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- top (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair where each is at most 3 GeV would be allowed, since 2m_f must be ≤ 6 GeV. Wait, no. Because 2m_f is the minimum for each pair. So m_f must be ≤ m_X / 2.

m_X is 6 GeV, so m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Looking at each fermion:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → allowed.
- μ: 0.105 → allowed.
- τ: 1.78 → allowed.
- u: 0.0022 → allowed.
- d: 0.0047 → allowed.
- s: 0.1 → allowed.
- c: 1.25 → allowed.
- b: 4.5 → 4.5 *2 =9 GeV >6 → not allowed.
- t: way too heavy, way over.

So X can decay into any fermion pair where each is ≤3 GeV. So the possible decay channels are:

e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Wait, but what about charm? c is 1.25 GeV, so 2c is 2.5 GeV, which is less than 6, so that's allowed. So X can decay into c c-bar.

Looking at the options:

Option A: bb, ss, uu, dd, tau, e. Wait, but also includes e and tau. But what about the others? Let's see.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, mu, e. So includes all except b. Because 4.5 GeV is way above 3 GeV. So option B includes c, which is allowed.

Wait, the options are:

Option A includes b, but b is 4.5 GeV, so 2b is 9 GeV, which is higher than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b-bar because 4.5*2=9>6. So option A is incorrect because it includes b.

Option B: has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all allowed. So that's a possibility.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But X can't decay into t because top is 173 GeV, way bigger than 6. So option C is wrong.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But again, b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B. So the allowed decays are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but looking back. The interaction term given is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I should think about what fermions are involved. The interaction is with ψ_f, which suggests fermions of the same flavor? Or perhaps the term is written in a way that X couples to ψ_f. Wait, perhaps the interaction is Yukawa type. The term is similar to Yukawa coupling. So the fermion is ψ_f, so for each fermion f, the X boson can couple to it.

But regardless, the kinematic limit is about the mass, not the coupling. Because the question asks about allowed decays, which is purely a kinematic question. So as long as m_f ≤ 3 GeV,
