Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and think about what's happening step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclooctatetraene and ending with a product 3. The task is to determine the structure of the major isomer of product 3 from the given options.

First, let me break down each reaction step.

Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene is heated with maleic anhydride in a 1:1 ratio, forming product 1.

Cyclooctatetraene is a eight-membered ring with four double bonds, making it a conjugated diene. Maleic anhydride is a good dienophile, so this sounds like a Diels-Alder reaction. The Diels-Alder reaction is between a conjugated diene (the diene) and a dienophile (like maleic anhydride) to form a six-membered ring with two substituents from the dienophile.

Wait, but cyclooctatetraene isn't a simple diene. Oh, right, cyclooctatetraene is a non-aromatic compound with alternating single and double bonds. However, it can undergo Diels-Alder reactions as it has conjugated double bonds. So, when it reacts with maleic anhydride (dienophile), each molecule would form a bicyclic structure. Since the ratio is 1:1, each cyclooctatetraene would react with one molecule of maleic anhydride.

The product 1 would probably be a bicyclic compound where the maleic anhydride has added across two of the double bonds in the cyclooctatetraene. Wait, but cyclooctatetraene has four double bonds. So maybe the Diels-Alder adds across two of them, forming a bridge structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a [4+2] cycloaddition
