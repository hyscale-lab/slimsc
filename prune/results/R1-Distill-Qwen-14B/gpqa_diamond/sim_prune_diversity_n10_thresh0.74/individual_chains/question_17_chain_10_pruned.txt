Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10, and the pH is ideal, temperature is 25 degrees Celsius.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. The problem gives me the formation constant, K, for the Ca-EDTA complex. The question is asking about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Wait, the formula for the formation constant. I think the formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal ion and EDTA combine to form the complex. So the reaction is something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

And the K for this reaction would be K = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Since the problem gives the K as 5x10^10, which is a very large number, that means the complex is very stable, right? So the reaction favors the formation of the complex, and the concentrations of the free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions are very low.

Now, the solution has a concentration of 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Let me think about this. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But because of the equilibrium, some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Since the reaction is 1:1, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, assuming that the dissociation is from the complex. The concentration of the complex would then be 0.02 - x. But wait, because K is so large, maybe x is very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That simplifies things.

So plugging into the K equation:

K = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) → 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 → Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. Oh wait, x² = 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → x² = 4e-13.

Wait wait, let me recalculate. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 equals (2/5) * 1e-1
