Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, this question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that means exactly. Oh right, a qubit is a two-level system, so maybe the state is represented in a three-dimensional space?

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me think about what this represents. I recall that for a qubit, the Pauli matrices are involved, and sometimes the density matrix can be expressed in terms of them. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write ρ in matrix form and then see how that corresponds to a point in space.

So, let's write out the matrices. The |0⟩ state is [1, 0]^T, and |1⟩ is [0, 1]^T. So |0⟩⟨0| would be a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and 0s elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 in the bottom-right corner. Adding these two gives a matrix that's [[1,0],[0,1]], the identity matrix I. But since it's multiplied by 1/2, ρ becomes (I)/2.

Wait, so ρ is (I)/2. Oh, right, that's the maximally mixed state. I think this state represents a completely mixed qubit, meaning it's in a completely uncertain state between |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I remember that a qubit can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), and the pure states are on the surface, while mixed states are inside. For a maximally mixed state, where does that place it?

Wait, the Bloch vector for a density matrix is a vector r such that ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So let's see: if ρ is (I)/2, then r·σ must be zero because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So r is zero. That would mean the point is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, right? So the coordinates are (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector that determines the position on the Bloch sphere. Comparing this with the given density matrix, we see that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, representing the maximally mixed state.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
