Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

Alright, the question says there are two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. The star's parameters are given: mass is 1.5 times that of the Sun, radius is 1.2 times, and effective temperature 6300 K. Both planets have their own masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth. Both orbits are circular. 

The transit and radial velocity methods detected them. Oh right, transit method looks at the dip in brightness when a planet passes in front, and radial velocity measures Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs and emits. The formula I remember is something like Te = Tstar * sqrt(Rstar/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Oh wait, but albedo is the same for both planets here, right? The question states they have the same albedo, so that part cancels out when taking the ratio.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and the star's radius. Because the formula accounts for the star's luminosity and the distance. The star's luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4πRstar²σTeff⁴. So the planet's equilibrium temperature depends on the star's Teff, the star's radius, and the planet's orbital distance (a). 

But wait, in the problem, they don't give the distance of each planet from the star. Hmm, but maybe I can find the distance using the RV method data. Because the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the mass of the planet and the distance between the star and the planet.

The question says Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. Wait, the forbidden line at 6300 Å is the
