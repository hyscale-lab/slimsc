Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain part of the pp chain stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think this through.

First, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III branch stops, the change in neutrino flux here on Earth would take about 8.5 minutes to be observed. But the question isn't about the timing; it's about the ratio of fluxes in two specific energy bands.

The question is asking about the flux ratio between two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the pp-III branch affects the production of neutrinos in these energy ranges.

I remember that the proton-proton (pp) chain is the primary source of energy in the Sun, producing helium-4. The pp chain has several branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, and then there are other branches like pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, the question specifies stopping the pp-III branch. So what do I know about pp-III?

From what I recall, the pp-III branch involves reactions where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus. So in the pp-III process, a He-3 nucleus (which is a triton, wait no, He-3 is a helium isotope with two protons and one neutron) reacts with a proton. Let me get this right: He-3 + p → He-4 + e+ + ν_e. This produces a positron and a neutrino. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are the ones emitted in this reaction.

So stopping the pp-III branch would mean that this particular source of neutrinos is no longer active. The neutrino energy from this reaction is a specific value. Wait, neutrino energies from the pp-III branch—I think they are around 1.4 MeV, but I might be mixing up the numbers. Alternatively, maybe the neutrinos in this branch have energies in a specific range, perhaps lower?

Wait, let me think again. The pp-I branch is the main one, where two protons fuse via a bor
