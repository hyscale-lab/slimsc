Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to determine how many possible organic products are formed. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about reactions involving benzene rings and dehydrohalogenation. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions. When a benzene ring has a substituent, the base can abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond—so dehydrohalogenation, right?

Wait, the compound here is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, 1-bromo and 2-d... Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Because I've heard of groups like -d in some contexts, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, maybe 'd' stands for something else? Or perhaps it's a typo and should be another substituent. Wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So the benzene ring has a Br at position 1 and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) at position 2. That makes sense because NaNH2 is a strong base, and the dimethylamino group is a strong activating group, which directs incoming electrophiles. But wait, in elimination reactions, the directing effects might change based on the reaction conditions.

Wait, but wait, the reaction is dehydrohalogenation. So in such a reaction, we are eliminating H and Br from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond. But wait, in aromatic substitution reactions, elimination would lead to a ring contraction or expansion? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

No, wait, perhaps I'm thinking of dehydrohalogenation in aliphatic systems. For benzene rings, elimination would lead to forming a new ring, perhaps a cyclohexadiene or something else. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, benzene isn't going to lose a ring; elimination would form a new double bond in the ring, but that's already a fully conjugated system. Or maybe it's about forming a new substituent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, so the Br is attached to a carbon adjacent to another substituent. Let me think about the structure. If the benzene has Br at position 1 and another group at position 2, then when the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2 (since it's adjacent to Br), elimination would occur, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 2. So the benzene would have a double bond between C1 and C2, which is part of the ring, but wait, benzene is already a conjugated ring with alternating double bonds. So adding another double bond isn't possible unless it's in a different position.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2-(dimethylamino)benzene. So the benzene ring has Br at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2.

So, when treated with NaNH2 (a strong base), it's likely an elimination reaction. The base will abstract a proton that's beta to the Br. The Br is at position 1; the adjacent carbons are position 2 and position 6. But wait, the position 2 already has a substituent—the dimethylamino group. So, the H would have to be abstracted from position 6, perhaps.

Wait, but position 2 is occupied by a substituent, so the hydrogen adjacent to Br would be on position 6. So when the base abstracts that H, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. Wait, but position 2 already has a substituent. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a new ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that might not be possible if the substituents are in the way. Wait, another thought: elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but since position 2 already has a substituent, perhaps the structure would rearrange or form a new ring.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the positions. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is Br, position 2 is dimethylamino.

So the structure would be:

Positions: 1 (Br), 2 (-N(CH3)2), 3, 4,5,6.

When the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position adjacent to Br, which is position 2 or 6. Position 2 is already substituted, so the H must come from position 6.

So the H is at position 6 (which is adjacent to Br at 1). When the base removes that H, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. But wait, position 2 has a substituent, so can a double bond form there? Or perhaps the substituent is on C2, which is part of the new double bond.

Wait, but the substituent is at C2, so perhaps the ring becomes a cyclohexadiene ring? No, because the benzene ring is aromatic and doesn't open up that way. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to forming a new ring substituent.

Wait, perhaps the elimination forms a new ring substituent, but I'm not quite getting it. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an aromatic substitution, but more likely, it's an elimination forming a new double bond.

Wait, maybe it's a case of forming a diene. So the benzene ring would have a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's part of the ring, so that would be a conjugated diene. Hmm, but then the substituent at C2 would be on a double bond. Could that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an arenium ion or some kind of ring expansion. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. The reaction is dehydrohalogenation, so perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's not possible in a benzene ring because it's already all double bonds. So maybe the ring becomes a cyclohexene ring? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents rearrange.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a new substituent. Let me think about the mechanism. So the base (NH2^-) abstracts a hydrogen from the carbon next to Br. The Br is at C1, so adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. C2 already has a substituent, so the H must be from C6.

When the H is abstracted from C6, Br- leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. But wait, C2 already has a substituent. So perhaps the substituent is at C2, so the double bond would be between C1 and C2, making the substituent a part of the double bond.

Wait, but substituents can't be on a double bond if they're in a certain position. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at C2, which is part of the new double bond, so the structure becomes a di-substituted ring with a double bond.

Wait, maybe the product is a dienyl group or something. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but in that case, NaNH2 would act as a base, not as a nucleophile. But that's more likely for activating groups.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. The dimethylamino group is a strong activating group, so under basic conditions, the ring is activated for elimination rather than substitution.

Wait, but wait, in aromatic elimination, the mechanism can involve the loss of H and X from adjacent positions, leading to formation of a double bond. So in this case, the Br is at position 1, and the adjacent position is 2. But position 2 has a substituent, so perhaps the hydrogen comes from position 6 (which is adjacent to position 1).

Wait, so when the base abstracts the hydrogen from position 6, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. But position 2 has a substituent, which is the dimethylamino group. So the structure would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and a substituent on C2.

Wait, but is that possible? In benzene rings, substituents are usually on carbons that are part of the ring, so having a substituent on a double bond carbon would make it a disubstituted double bond, but that's allowed.

Wait, but wait, the product would then be a benzene ring where C1 and C2 are double-bonded, and C2 has a dimethylamino group attached. So that would make a structure where C2 is part of the double bond and also has the substituent. But wait, that's possible. So the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2, with a substituent (dimethylamino) on C2.

Wait, but how does that change the ring? The ring would now have a double bond between C1 and C2, so the ring would have another double bond in the structure, which would not be possible because benzene is already a conjugated system. Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds, but if we form an additional double bond, that would require a different structure. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to ring contraction or expansion. But that seems unlikely with such a reaction.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the possible products. If the elimination occurs, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that seems impossible because benzene doesn't have a single bond there. So maybe the benzene loses a carbon, forming a smaller ring. Wait, that doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a styrene-type compound. Wait, but that would require the Br to be on a benzylic position, which it isn't here.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the reaction conditions. NaNH2 in condensed ammonia is a dehydrohalogenation condition. So the reaction is E2 elimination, where a base abstracts a beta hydrogen, and the leaving group (Br-) departs, forming a double bond.

In the case of 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, the Br is at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. C2 has a substituent, so the H must come from C6. So when the base abstracts the H from C6, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. But wait, C2 is already substituted with a dimethylamino group.

So the product would be a benzene ring where C1 and C2 are double-bonded, and C2 has a dimethylamino group. But that would mean that the substituent is on a double bond, which is possible but perhaps leads to a different structure.

Wait, but in that case, the benzene ring would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and another substituent on C2. So the ring would now have a double bond, making it a cyclohexene ring, but that's not the case here because benzene is already a fully conjugated system. Hmm, this is getting a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps the product is not an aromatic compound anymore. If the double bond forms between C1 and C2, the ring could lose its aromaticity, but that's not likely because the ring would then become cyclohexadiene, which is not stable. Alternatively, perhaps the ring remains aromatic, but I'm not sure how the double bonds would rearrange.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond. No, that's not possible because substituents are attached to the ring; the ring's double bonds are part of the ring structure.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures. When NaNH2 is used on a benzene ring with a bromide and another substituent, the reaction typically forms a new substituent via elimination, creating a double bond adjacent to the substituent.

In this case, the substituents are Br at C1 and dimethylamino at C2. The base would abstract a hydrogen from a position adjacent to Br, which is C6. So elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, C2 already has a substituent. So the product would be benzene with a double bond between C1 and C2 and a substituent on C2.

Wait, but that would make the substituent on a double bond carbon, which is okay, but how does that affect the structure? It would form a structure where the ring has a double bond between C1 and C2, and a substituent attached to C2. So the molecule would have a substituent on a double bond position, which is allowed.

But wait, how many such products are possible? Or could there be more than one product due to different possible eliminations?

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, and upon elimination, the Br leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2, resulting in a benzene ring with a substituent on C2 that's part of a double bond. But does that result in more than one product?

Wait, perhaps the substituent could be in two different positions, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure. The benzene ring has Br at C1 and dimethylamino at C2. After elimination, the Br is gone, and there's a double bond between C1 and C2. So the substituent (dimethylamino) is on C2, which is now part of a double bond. So the product would be benzene with a double bond between C1 and C2 and a substituent on C2.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent could also end up in a different position if there's some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe there are multiple possible sites for hydrogen abstraction that lead to different products.

Wait, but in the starting material, the substituents are at C1 and C2. The adjacent carbons to Br are C2 and C6. C2 is substituted, so the only possible H to abstract is from C6. So the elimination can only happen in one way, leading to a single product.

So the product would be benzene with a double bond between C1 and C2, and a substituent on C2. But wait, that's the same as the starting material's substituent, but now it's part of a double bond. So the product would be 2-dimethylamino-1,2-diphenylethylene? Or perhaps it's a new structure altogether.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-dimethylamino-1-phenylethylene. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzene with a double bond.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about what the product would look like. After elimination, the Br is gone, and a double bond is formed between C1 and C2. The substituent (dimethylamino) is on C2, which is now part of the double bond. So the structure would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent attached to C2. So the substituent is on the double bond.

But wait, can a substituent be on a double bond in a benzene ring? That would mean the substituent is either on the same carbon as the double bond, which is possible. For example, a substituent on a carbon that's part of a double bond in a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, but in this case, the ring is benzene, which is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. If the elimination forms a new double bond adjacent to the existing substituent, perhaps it's actually forming a new substituent as part of a ring expansion. Or maybe the ring doesn't expand but just has an additional double bond, which would break aromaticity. But that's unlikely because the ring would become non-aromatic, which is not favorable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces a new substituent outside the ring. Wait, that can't be right because the starting material is a substituted benzene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to a substituted vinyl group. So the benzene ring loses a carbon, but that doesn't make sense with the given reagents.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the reaction more clearly. 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in ammonia. The structure is benzene with Br at position 1 and another substituent (maybe dimethylamino) at position 2.

The reaction is dehydrohalogenation. So the Br leaves, and a proton is abstracted from a position adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since the substituent is at position 2, the H must come from position 6. So the double bond forms between C1 and C2, leading to a structure where C1 and C2 are double-bonded, and there's a substituent on C2.

But now, the substituent is on a double bond. So the structure becomes a substituted ethylene group attached to the benzene. Wait, but that's not possible because the benzene is already a ring. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm getting it wrong. Let me think of the benzene ring as a hexagon. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. If Br is at 1 and substituent at 2, then elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2. So the substituent would be on C2, which is part of the new double bond. So the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and a substituent on C2.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent is on the same carbon as the double bond. That's allowed, but how does that affect the structure? The ring would now have a double bond between C1 and C2, so the ring would have that double bond and some others.

Wait, but benzene has a delocalized pi system. If a double bond is formed between C1 and C2, the existing double bonds would have to adjust. So perhaps the ring remains aromatic, but with a different arrangement of double bonds. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a new substituent with a double bond. For example, forming a styrene-like structure, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a vinyl group. So, the substituent would be CH2- attached, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a double bond, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a new substituent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexene ring with substituents, but that's not the case here.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck, so maybe I should think about the number of possible products. The question is how many products are formed. If the elimination can occur in only one way, then only one product is formed. But if there are multiple possible sites for elimination, leading to different products, then more than one product would form.

In this case, the Br is at position 1, and the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has a substituent, so the H can only be abstracted from position 6. So elimination can only occur in one way, leading to one product.

Therefore, the number of possible organic products is 1. So the answer should be option B) 1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (benzene with a bromine atom at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia, a strong base that facilitates dehydrohalogenation. In this elimination reaction, the base abstracts a β-hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to the bromine atom, and the bromine leaves, forming a double bond.

The bromine is at position 1, and the adjacent carbons are position 2 and position 6. Position 2 already has a substituent (the dimethylamino group), so the β-hydrogen must be abstracted from position 6. This leads to the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2. The resulting product is a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 2 and a dimethylamino group at position 2. Since the elimination can only occur in one way due to the substituent at position 2, only one product is formed.

Thus, the number of possible organic products is **1**.

Answer: B
