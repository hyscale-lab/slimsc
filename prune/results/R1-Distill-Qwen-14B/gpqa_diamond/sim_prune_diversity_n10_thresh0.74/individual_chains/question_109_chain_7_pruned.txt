Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The problem gives an equation involving isospin, angular momentum, and spin: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. And the final state has T(NN) = 0. We need to find which partial wave is not permitted.

First, I think I should recall what each part of the notation means. The initial state is 1S0. The general term is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, 2S+1 is 1, so S is 0, L is S (wait, no, wait. Wait, the term is (2S+1)L J. So S is the total spin. So for 1S0, S is 0, L is 0, and J is 0. Because in 1S0, the S is 0, and L is 0, so J must also be 0, since J = L + S.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the term is 1S0, which implies that the spin S is 0 because 2S+1=1 → S=0. The L here is S? No, wait, the term is written as (2S+1)L J. So 1S0 is (2S+1)=1 → S=0, L is S? Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, L is the orbital angular momentum, written in spectroscopic notation, which is like S, P, D, F, etc., corresponding to L=0,1,2,3, etc. So 1S0 would have S=0 (so spin state is singlet), L=0 (so orbital angular momentum is zero), and J=0. Because J = L + S, so 0 + 0 = 0.

So the initial state is NN in 1S0 → T=0? Wait, no, the initial state is the NN in some state, but they emit a particle X. So the initial state is the two nucleons in 1S0, and then they emit X.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the final state has T(NN) = 0. So the initial state of the NN system was in a certain state, and after emitting X, the final NN state has T=0.

Wait, the problem is about the NN system emitting a particle. So the initial state is the NN system, and the final state is the NN system plus the emitted particle X.

Wait, no, the problem says they emit a particle X. So initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state includes the NN plus X. So the initial state is the NN in 1S0, and the final state is the NN in some other state plus X.

But the problem gives that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So the NN after emission has isospin T=0.

So the problem is about the conservation of angular momentum and parity.

The question is about which partial wave is not allowed. The options are different transitions, each with a different final state and a particle emitted (p, f, s, etc.).

Wait, the options are labeled as 1S0 → something. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is, say, 7D1 + p, etc. So the initial NN state is 1S0, and the final NN state is, for example, 7D1, and a proton is emitted.

Wait, but the particle X is emitted, and its intrinsic parity is -1. So the parity of X is -1.

The problem says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN)
