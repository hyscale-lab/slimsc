Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem has two parts, reactions A and B. I'll tackle each one separately and then see which option matches both.

Starting with the first reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and H+ to give product A.

Hmm, I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. But wait, when they add H+ at the end, maybe it's a way to protonate something after the reaction.

Looking at the starting material, 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the spiro alcohol. The structure has a five-membered ring and a seven-membered ring connected at the same carbon, which is the alcohol's position. There's also a vinyl group (CH2CH2) attached to that same carbon.

When you have an alcohol with a spiro structure and a strong base like KH, what typically happens? Oh right, the base deprotonates the alcohol to form an alkoxide. But wait, the structure has a conjugated double bond (the enol part). Maybe this leads to some kind of elimination or ring-forming reaction.

The spiro structure is strained because of the two rings, so perhaps the base induces an elimination. When the alkoxide forms, the adjacent hydrogen (on the same carbon as the alcohol) can be abstracted, leading to a double bond. But wait, the starting molecule already has a double bond. Maybe it's more about ring expansion or contraction.

Wait, I think this is a case for the Cope elimination or maybe an electrocyclic reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that usually involves vicinal diols. Hmm.

Alternatively, I've heard about the Aldol reaction, but that's more about carbonyl compounds. Wait, but if the alcohol is deprotonated, perhaps it can form a conjugate base and undergo some kind of cyclization.

Wait, I remember that when a spiro alcohol is treated with a strong base, it can undergo a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, which is a type of hydride or alkyl shift. But that's more for carbocation shifts. Or perhaps it's a ring-opening or ring-closing via elimination.

Wait another thought: the starting material has a spiro structure with an alcohol and a double bond. Deproton
