Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed.

Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, the 'd' probably stands for deuterated. So, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2, something else? Wait, no, the formula would be C6H4BrD, I think. So, one bromine and one deuterium on the benzene ring. So the positions are 1 and 2. So the bromine is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, especially with substituted benzene rings, deprotonation can lead to elimination or some kind of ring activation.

Wait, but wait. Benzene is generally not very reactive towards deprotonation under normal conditions because it's pretty stable. But in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the ring becomes deprotonated. But where would the deprotonation occur here?

The structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the ring has Br at position 1 and D (deuterium) at position 2. Now, in such a ring, the deprotonation would occur where the H is acidic enough. But wait, the ring is already substituted with Br and D. Let me think about the possible sites for deprotonation.

The substituents (Br and D) influence the acidity of the protons. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, which makes the adjacent protons more acidic. Deuterium is a heavier isotope, but in this case, the D is at position 2. So, the positions adjacent to Br (positions 2 and 6) would have more acidic protons because of the electron-withdrawing effect of Br.

Wait, but position 2 already has a D. Wait, or does it have a H? Wait, the compound is 1
