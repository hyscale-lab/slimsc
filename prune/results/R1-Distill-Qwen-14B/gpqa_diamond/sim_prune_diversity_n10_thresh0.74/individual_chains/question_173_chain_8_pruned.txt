Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says that an electron is traveling along the x-direction at a speed v of 2 times 10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE, of the electron. The options are from 10^-18 J up to 10^-16 J.

Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is involved here. The principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision. The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but sometimes it's written as Δx Δp ≈ ħ, especially when the ½ factor is neglected for estimation purposes.

So since I'm looking for the uncertainty in energy, I should probably relate this to the uncertainty in momentum. Because energy is related to momentum, right? For a particle moving at non-relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if I find the uncertainty in momentum, I can find the uncertainty in energy.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Using Δx * Δp ≈ ħ, so Δp ≈ ħ / Δx.

2. Then, find the uncertainty in kinetic energy, ΔK. Since K = p²/(2m), the uncertainty ΔK would be (Δp)^2/(2m). But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I should use the derivative approach for uncertainty in energy. Oh wait, the uncertainty in energy is the kinetic energy uncertainty since the potential isn't mentioned here.

Wait, but since we're dealing with the minimum uncertainty, perhaps the product is exactly ħ/2, but I think for an approximate calculation, using Δx * Δp = ħ is sufficient. So let's proceed with that.

First, I'll need the values:

- Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.055 x 10^-34 J·s.

But wait, maybe I can just remember ħ ≈ 1.05e-34 J·s.

Δx is given as 0.1 nm. Oh, 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters.

So Δp ≈ ħ / Δx = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-10 m) = 1.05e-24 kg·m/s.

Wait, because J·s is kg·m²/s, so dividing by m gives kg·m/s, which is the unit of momentum. Right.

So Δp is approximately 1.05e-24 kg·m/s.

Now, the kinetic energy K is p²/(2m). So the uncertainty in K, ΔK, would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m), because if Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, then the uncertainty in p squared is (Δp)^2, and since K is proportional to p², the uncertainty in K is proportional to (Δp)^2.

So let's compute that.

m is the mass of the electron, which
