Okay, so I have this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm. The question is about a diatomic molecule with atoms X and Y. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch it to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, let's break this down. The molecule's in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state in vibration is the ground state, which is the lowest vibrational energy level. For rotation, the fundamental state is the ground rotational state, which is the lowest rotational energy level.

But wait, the question says it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So this is probably considering both rotational and vibrational energy transitions. But the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I'm not sure, but maybe it's talking about the next possible state that's higher in energy but the lowest possible, like the next quantum state. So perhaps it's the first excited state, which could involve a change in either vibrational or rotational energy, whichever requires the least energy.

Wait, but the options are about the momentum of the photon. So the photon's energy would correspond to the energy difference between the initial and final states. Since momentum p is related to energy for a photon, because E = pc for a photon. Because for photons, E = hν and p = E/c, so p = hν/c. Or wait, because p = hν/(c) is the same as E = pc. Oh
