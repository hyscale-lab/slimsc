Okay, so I have this NMR question in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question involves two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 mixture, and their NMR shows specific signals. The molecular formula is C10H14 for both, so each compound must have that formula.

The NMR spectrum has two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each integrating to a 1:1 ratio. Wait, wait, noâ€”actually, the question says two signals at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Oh, wait, wait. Let me read that again. It says two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, that might mean that each singlet has an integration of 1 and 1? Or maybe the two signals together make up a 1:1 ratio between the two compounds. I'm not entirely sure. Oh, wait, the question says there's a 1:1 mixture of two compounds. So each compound contributes signals, and the integrations are in a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet at 6.7 ppm is from a different compound, but their integrations are each 1:1 in the mixture.

Wait, the signals at 6.7 ppm are two singlets, each in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes one singlet each at around 6.7 ppm. That makes sense because each is a singlet, and their integrations sum up to 1:1 in the mixture. So each compound must have a set of equivalent aromatic protons that give a singlet.

Then, looking at the other signals: three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So these are likely from methyl groups attached to something, perhaps the benzene rings. Since the compounds are tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzene.

Wait, the options are all tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. So if one of the compounds is diethyl, then the substituents would be ethyl groups, which are -CH2CH3. But ethyl groups would split into multiple peaks? Or maybe if they're in such a symmetric position that their protons are equivalent, they could be a singlet
