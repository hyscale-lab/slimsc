Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (tau). But how do I get tau from the given parameters?

Oh right, the mean lifetime tau is related to the width Γ. The uncertainty principle tells us that the width Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime. I think the formula is Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, wait. No, uncertainty relation is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for a particle with a width Γ (which is the uncertainty in energy), the lifetime would be roughly τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). So yes, tau is ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, wait, another thought: sometimes the width is given as the total decay width, which is the same as the energy uncertainty. So yeah, Γ = ħ/tau. So tau = ħ / Γ.

So first, I need to calculate the lifetime tau, then multiply by the speed of light c to get the decay distance, because distance is speed multiplied by time. So decay distance L = c * tau.

Wait, but wait another thing. The decay length is L = c * tau * beta, where beta is v/c. Oh, right! Because the particle is moving, so the mean decay distance depends on its velocity. So I have to account for beta.

So beta is v/c. But v is the velocity of the meson. How do I find that? Well, the production energy E is given as 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV. So perhaps I can find the velocity from the energy.

In particle physics, the energy of a relativistic
