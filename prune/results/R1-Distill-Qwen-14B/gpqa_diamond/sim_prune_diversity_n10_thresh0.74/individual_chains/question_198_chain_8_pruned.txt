Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem involves a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when a metal ion complexes with ligands, it forms different complexes with varying degrees of stability, determined by the stability constant (β). The higher the β, the more stable the complex is, meaning it's more likely to form.

The complexes here are probably Co with SCN- as ligands. Let's list the possible complexes. The stability constants are β1 to β4, so that suggests complexes with 1, 2, 3, 4 SCN- ligands, respectively. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the numbering might be different. Or maybe these are for different complexes, like maybe the first complex is Co(SCN)²+, the second is Co(SCN)₂²+, etc. Or could it be that each β corresponds to a different charge or structure? I think each β represents the formation of a complex with a specific number of SCN⁻ ligands.

Wait, but the question is about dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN⁻ ligands, so that's the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex. So the question is asking for the fraction of Co(SCN)₂²+ in the solution.

But wait, the options given are all percentages, so I need to calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex relative to all possible cobalt complexes.

So the approach would be to calculate the distribution of each possible complex, considering the stability constants, and then find the fraction that's the dithiocyanato (Co(SCN)₂²+) complex.

But first, let me think about the possible complexes. The complexes would be:

Co²+ + n SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-2n) ? Wait, no, each SCN⁻ is -1 charge. So for each SCN⁻ added, the charge on the complex decreases by 1. So for a Co²+ with n SCN⁻, the complex would have a charge of 2 - n, because each SCN⁻ contributes -1. So for n=1: [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1), n=2: [Co(SCN)2]^0 (neutral), n=3: [Co(SCN)3]^- (charge -1), n=4: [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

Wait, but the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) having that stability constant.

Wait, but what's the order here? If β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2, etc., then the stability increases up to β3 and then decreases for β4. That's a bit odd, but maybe that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are ordered differently. Hmm, but probably the way to proceed is to model the distribution of each possible complex based on their stability constants.

But the problem is that the number of possible complexes can be high, and the calculation can get complicated. However, perhaps the dominant species are the ones with the highest β values.

Wait, but another approach is to use the concept of the formation of each complex. The fraction of each complex can be found by considering all possible complexes and their respective β values, along with the concentrations of the free ions.

Wait, but in a solution, we can model the distribution of the complexes using the stability constants and the concentrations of the metal and ligand.

But since the problem gives the total cobalt concentration (c_total = 1e-2 M) and the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M), and asks for the percentage of a specific complex, perhaps the approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex by considering the relative stabilities and the ligand concentrations.

So the general approach is:

1. Define all possible complexes, from n=0 (free Co²+) up to n=4 (since β4 is given).

2. For each complex, calculate its fraction based on the β values and the concentrations.

But wait, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration includes all species, so the sum of all [Co species] equals 1e-2 M.

The formation of each complex can be represented as:

Co²+ + n SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) 

The stability constant βn is given by:

βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) ] / ( [Co²+][SCN⁻]^n )

So for each n, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] is βn * [Co²+][SCN⁻]^n.

Let me denote the concentration of free Co²+ as [M]. Then, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all complexes plus [M] = c_total.

So,

c_total = [M] + Σ [Co(SCN)_n] for n=1 to 4.

Each [Co(SCN)_n] is βn [M] [SCN]^n.

So,

c_total = [M] (1 + Σ βn [SCN]^n )

Wait, yes, because [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [M] [SCN]^n.

So,

c_total = [M] ( 1 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

So, [M] = c_total / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Once [M] is known, each [Co(SCN)_n] can be calculated as βn [M] [SCN]^n.

Then, the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] / c_total.

So, the problem is to find the fraction of the n=2 complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2], which is [M][SCN]^2 β2.

But wait, no, because the denominator is [M] (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β4 [SCN]^4).

Wait, let me rephrase. Because c_total is [M] + sum of [Co(SCN)_n], and [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [M] [SCN]^n.

So, sum all [Co(SCN)_n] = [M] * sum ( βn [SCN]^n ).

So,

c_total = [M] ( sum_{n=0}^4 βn [SCN]^n )

Wait, but for n=0, β is 1, since [Co²+] = β0 [M][SCN]^0 → β0=1.

So, sum from n=0 to 4: sum βn [SCN]^n.

Then,

[M] = c_total / ( sum_{n=0}^4 βn [SCN]^n )

So, the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] / c_total = ( βn [M] [SCN]^n ) / c_total.

But since [M] = c_total / sum_{n=0}^4 βn [SCN]^n, substituting:

fraction_n = βn [SCN]^n / sum_{n=0}^4 βn [SCN]^n.

Wait, this is a key point. Because the fraction of each complex is (βn [SCN]^n) / (sum βn [SCN]^n ), times [M], but when we take [Co(SCN)_n]/c_total, the [M] cancels out, leading to
