Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through step by step.

So the question has three parts, A, B, and C, each representing a different Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and the conditions are NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition typically involves a nucleophilic enolate attacking an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, right? It has two ester groups, so when treated with a base like NaOEt, it will form an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the nucleophile is the enolate of dimethyl malonate, and the electrophile is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, I think I might have that wrong. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)O-OCH3? Or is it CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-something? Wait, no, the structure is likely CH2=CH-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it out. The correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent at the gamma position? Or is it at the alpha position?

Wait, maybe I'm
