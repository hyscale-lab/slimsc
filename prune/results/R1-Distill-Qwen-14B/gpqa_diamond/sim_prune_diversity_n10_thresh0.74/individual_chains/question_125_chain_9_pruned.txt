Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The question is about a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, that looks familiar. I remember that this is the potential for a 3D harmonic oscillator. Because Hooke's law is involved, which leads to a potential proportional to r squared.

The question asks for two things: the value of the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that energy eigenvalue. Hmm, right. So I need to find both the energy and the degeneracy (the number of eigenfunctions) for that state.

Let me think about the 3D harmonic oscillator. I think in 3D, the potential is separable into x, y, z parts, each of which is a 1D harmonic oscillator. So each direction contributes independently. The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized and given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ℏω, where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...). 

Wait, but sometimes the principal quantum number is used, which is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. And each energy level depends on this sum. So the energy can also be written as E = (n + 3/2) ℏω, where n is the sum.

Now, the states are degenerate because different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z can give the same n. The degeneracy for each energy level (or shell) is given by the number of ways n_x + n_y + n_z can equal a certain value, say, n. So for a given n, the degeneracy is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2, or something like that. Wait, no, perhaps it's (n + 2 choose 2), which is (n+2)(n+1)/2. Wait, wait. Let me think. For each n, the number of possible states (the degeneracy) is (n + 2)(n + 1)/2 ? Or is it something else?

Wait, I think the formula is (n + 2)(n + 1)/2. Wait, no, perhaps it's (n + 2)(n + 1)/2 when considering the number of ways to distribute n into three non-negative integers. Because for each n, the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n is (n + 3 - 1) choose (3-1) )= (n+2 choose 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2. Yes, that's right. So the degeneracy is (n+2)(n+1)/2 for each level.

Wait, no, wait. Let's take an example. For n=0: n_x + n_y + n_z =0 → only (0,0,0). So degeneracy is 1. Using the formula (0+2)(0+1)/2 → 2*1/2 =1. Correct. For n=1: the possible states are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So 3 states. The formula gives (1+2)(1+1)/2 → 3*2/2=3. Correct. For n=2: possible states are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). That's 6 states. The formula: (2+2)(2+1)/2 =4*3/2=6. Correct. So yes, the degeneracy is (n+2)(n+1)/2.

So the energy level is (n + 3/2) ℏω, and the degeneracy is (n+2)(n+1)/2.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, excited states are counted starting from the ground state. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0. The first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state corresponds to n=3.

So the energy E is (3 + 3/2) ℏω = (9/2) ℏω. So that's the first part.

Now, the degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions with same energy) is (3 + 2)(3 +1)/2 = 5*4/2 = 10. So 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (9/2)ℏω , 10 → this seems correct.

Option C: same energy but 3 functions, which would be for n=1 (as 3 functions), but that's the first excited state.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, when n=3, degeneracy is 10, so option A matches.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) (9/2)ℏω , 10 → correct.

B) 11... which doesn't make sense because the energy is (n + 3/2)ℏω. For n=3, it's 9/2, which is 4.5. B starts with 11 pi^
