Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down. The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, let's start by figuring out the structure of the compound. A 6-membered aromatic ring, so probably benzene. Di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. The total carbons are 8, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons because benzene has 6 carbons. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, so substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent is probably a single carbon, but wait, di-substituted can have two substituents each adding some carbons.

Wait, maybe the substituents are groups like -CH2-CO- something. Wait, but let me think. The IR shows a carbonyl group (C=O), so that must be one substituent. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, like -X where X is halogen (Cl, Br, etc.), which is another substituent.

So, the ring has two substituents: a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe) and a halogen. But wait, carbonyl groups in aromatic rings could be ketones, maybe as in acetophenone? But wait, acetophenone is mono-substituted. Oh wait, maybe it's something like 4-bromoacetophenone? So substituents are at the para positions.

Wait, but 4-bromoacetophenone would have a benzene ring with a Br at one position and a ketone (COCH3) at the para position. Let me count the carbons: benzene (6 carbons) + Br (no carbons) + COCH3 (which is 3 carbons: C from CO, and CH3). Wait, but that's 6 + 3 =9, but the question says 8 carbons total. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, wait. Let me recount. The compound has 8 carbons in total. The benzene ring contributes 6. The substituents contribute 2. So each substituent must be one carbon each because 2 substituents would add 2 carbons. So substituents could be -X and -CO-R, but wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are -X and -COH? No, that's a carbonyl but in an alcohol, which is a hydroxyl. Wait, no, the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe a ketone or an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are -X and -CO-R, but R must be something that adds only one carbon. Wait, but CO-R would bring more carbons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen. Let's think about possible structures. For example, maybe the ring has a substituent like a ketone (like O=C-R) and a halogen. But let me think about the number of carbons.

If the ring has 6 carbons, and substituents add 2 carbons, so substituents are two groups, each with 1 carbon. So substituents could be -Cl and -COCH3? But wait, that would add 3 carbons (COCH3 is 3 carbons: C=O, CH3), so that's more than 2. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a halogen and the other is a carbonyl group that only adds one carbon. For example, maybe a substituent like -CO- attached to another something. Wait, perhaps the substituents are -X and -CHO (an aldehyde group). That would be 1 carbon each: -X is 0 carbons, -CHO is 1 carbon. So total substituents add 1 carbon. But the total carbons in the compound are 8, so 6 (benzene) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (X) = 7, which is less than 8. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's think about it again. The compound has a benzene ring with two substituents. Each substituent adds a certain number of carbons. So, 6 (ring) + substituent1 carbons + substituent2 carbons = 8. So substituent1 + substituent2 = 2 carbons.

So substituent1 is a halogen (like Cl, Br) which contributes 0 carbons. Substituent2 must contribute 2 carbons. So substituent2 is a group with 2 carbons, which includes a carbonyl. What groups have 2 carbons and a carbonyl?

Ah, maybe the substituent is an acetyl group, like -COCH3. But that's 3 carbons (the CO is one, and the CH3 is another). Wait, COCH3 is two carbons after the ring attaching point. Wait, no, the ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is then attached to a methyl group. So, substituent is -COCH3, which is 3 carbons in total (the ring's carbon, then CO, then CH3). Wait, no, the substituent is -COCH3, which is two carbons beyond the ring (the carbonyl C and the CH3). So substituent contributes 2 carbons. So substituent1 is -X (0 carbons), substituent2 is -COCH3 (2 carbons). So 0 + 2 =2, plus 6 ring carbons, total 8. That works.

So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one is a halogen (X) and the other is an acetyl group (COCH3). These substituents are attached to the ring. So it's a di-substituted benzene, perhaps para-substituted.

So the molecule is something like para-bromoacetophenone or para-chloroacetophenone, etc.

So now, let's think about the NMR spectrum.

In the NMR, we should see signals from the aromatic protons, the CH3 group in the acetyl, and any other protons.

In para-substituted benzene derivatives, the aromatic protons are typically split into two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two strong deactivating groups, the ring becomes very symmetrical. So the aromatic protons would be in a para arrangement relative to each substituent.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are -X (halogen) and -COCH3. So the substituents are in para positions. So the ring would have two substituents opposite each other.

So the aromatic protons would be in two sets. Let me imagine. Let's say the ring is benzene with -Br and -COCH3 in para positions. The ring would have two sets of protons: two protons adjacent to the Br, and two protons adjacent to the COCH3.

Wait, no. For a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, the ring protons would be in two sets of two each, as doublets.

So in NMR, you would see two doublets each integrating for 2H. For example, one doublet around 7.8 ppm and another around 7.6 ppm, each 2H. So looking at the options, option C has 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). That fits.

What about the other signals? The acetyl group has a CH3, which would be a singlet if it's attached to a carbonyl. The CH3 would be around 2.1-2.3 ppm as a singlet. Looking at option C, there's a 2.3 (3H, s), which fits.

So option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). That seems to match.

Let me check the other options. Option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is very deshielded. That would be an aldehyde proton, but the IR shows a carbonyl, which could be a ketone or aldehyde. But in the structure I thought of, the ketone wouldn't have an aldehyde proton. So unless it's a different substituent.

Wait, if the substituent was an aldehyde group (-CHO), that would have a proton at around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But in that case, the substituent would contribute one carbon (CHO), plus the halogen substituent (0 carbons). So 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (X) =7, which is less than 8. So that's not matching. So option A's 9.9 ppm would be an aldehyde proton, but that would require substituent -CHO, which leaves the total carbon count at 7, not 8. So that's incorrect.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are around the region for CH2 groups next to oxygen or something. But if the substituents were, say, -OCH2- groups, but that's not matching the IR info of a carbonyl and a halogen.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), which might be a proton on the ring, but in a para-substituted di-substituted benzene, you wouldn't have a singlet for a single proton. Unless it's a meta arrangement, but I thought the substituents are para. Maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The substituents are on the ring: one is a carbonyl group (like COCH3) and the other is a halogen. So the ring has two substituents in para positions. The ring would have two sets of two protons each. So NMR would show two doublets each for 2H. That's what option C has.

Option C's other peak is 2.3 ppm (3H, s), which would be the CH3 of the COCH3 group. So that fits.

So the correct option should be C.


The compound in question is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (-X, such as -Br or -Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, likely an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The total carbon count (6 from the benzene ring + 2 from the substituents) matches the given information.

The structure is likely para-substituted, with the halogen and acetyl group positioned opposite each other on the benzene ring. In such a structure, the aromatic protons would split into two sets of doublets due to the symmetry of the molecule. The acetyl group's methyl (-CH₃) protons would appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, but this does not match the structure since the total carbon count would be 7 (not 8) if the substituent were -CHO. This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Peaks at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest protons near electronegative atoms (e.g., -OCH₂), which is inconsistent with the carbonyl and halogen substituents. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) correspond to aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene, and the singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) matches the methyl group of the acetyl substituent. This option is consistent with the structure.
- **Option D**: A singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H, s) suggests a single aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with the para-substitution pattern. This option is incorrect.

The correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, as it aligns with the expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns for a para-substituted benzene with a halogen and an acetyl group.

Answer: C
