Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has 3 protons normally. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

So, first, I need to find the energy of the ion. I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by its rest mass energy. The gamma factor is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

The formula is E = gamma * m0c². But wait, what's m0 here? Oh right, m0 is the rest mass of the nucleus. So I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 has an atomic mass of about 6.013 atomic mass units (u), I think. Wait, but I should double-check that. Let me think, the exact mass might be important for precision. Alternatively, perhaps I can get the mass from the periodic table. Wait, the standard atomic weight for Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but that's for Li-7. Since this is Li-6, the mass is a bit lower. Oh wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons, so that's Li-6. The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe I should be precise—wait, the problem says the precision is at 1e-4, so I think I need an accurate value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact value. Wait, but in a test scenario, like an exam, I might have a table of masses. Since I'm working this out, I'll note that the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.014 u. Let me think, each atomic mass unit is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy would be 6.014 * 931.5 MeV. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 6.014 * 931.5. Let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589. Then 0.014 *931.5 is about 13.041. So total is approximately 5602.041 MeV, which is 5.602 GeV. But wait, let me double-check that multiplication. 6.014 *931.5:

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589. Then 0.014 *931.5=13.041. So total is 5589 +13.041=5602.041
