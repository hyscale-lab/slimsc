Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

So, the setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knockout mutants and double mutants to test their effects on disease resistance. The resistance levels are given, and I need to figure out the gene interactions.

Alright, the key here is understanding what the resistance levels mean. Higher resistance is better, right? So 100% is fully resistant, 0% is completely susceptible.

From the results:
- g1 has 75% resistance. So it's less resistant than wild type but not totally susceptible.
- g2 has 0% resistance. So knocking out G2 makes the plant super susceptible.
- g3 has 50% resistance. So halfway between wild type and susceptible.
- The double mutants: g1g3 is 10%, g2g3 is 0%, and g1g2 is 0%.

The question also mentions that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So that's probably a key clue.

I remember that in genetic interactions, if a double mutant has a resistance level that's more severe than either single mutant, it's an epistatic interaction. But wait, sometimes the opposite is true. Let me think. If G2 is upstream, maybe it's epistatic to others.

Looking at the double mutants:
- g1g2 has 0% resistance. Both g1 and g2 are affected. Since g2 alone is 0%, maybe G2 is epistatic to G1. Because when both are knocked out, the resistance is same as g2. So the presence of G1 isn't helping when G2 is already knocked out.
- Similarly, g2g3 is 0%. Since g2 alone is 0%, perhaps G3's effect only matters when G2 is present. Hmm, but when G2 is knocked out, G3's function doesn't contribute anything, so their double is same as g2.
- The g1g3 double mutant is 10%. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So each single mutant has their own effect. What does this mean? Maybe they function in the same pathway, but their effects are additive. Or maybe they're in parallel pathways. Wait, but the double mutant is worse than either individual (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, so together 10% is way worse).

But what do these observations imply about their genetic relationships?

So first, looking at which mutants are completely susceptible (0% resistance). g2 and the double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) are all 0%. That suggests that G2 is a critical gene. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes, including G1 and G3.

Wait, if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then knocking it out would disable the expression of its target genes, including perhaps G1 and G3. But wait, in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is less than wild type but not zero. So G1 might not be directly activated by G2, or maybe it's partially regulated.

Let me think about epistasis. If a gene's mutation masks the phenotype of another gene, it's epistatic. So if G2 is epistatic to G1, then the mutation in G2 would determine the phenotype regardless of G1.

Looking at the double mutant g1g2, it's 0% resistance. Since g2 alone is 0%, whether G1 is functional or not doesn't matter when G2 is nonfunctional. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, the double mutant g2g3 is 0% resistance. Since g2 is 0%, again, whether G3 is present or not doesn't change the outcome. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

What about the g1g3 double mutant? It's 10% resistance, which is much lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So in this case, both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, but their effects are additive. Or maybe their functions are redundant, so knocking both out makes it worse.

Wait, but gene redundancy would mean that if either gene is present, the function is okay. So if both are knocked out, the function is lost. But in this case, the single mutants have partial resistance, so maybe they're not entirely redundant, but their functions contribute additively.

So if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, let's see:

G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes can't function.
