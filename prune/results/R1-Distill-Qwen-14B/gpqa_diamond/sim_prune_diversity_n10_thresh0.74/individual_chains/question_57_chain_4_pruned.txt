Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts for different l values, I think. The phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so probably we're focusing up to l=4.

The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, right. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using a sum over angular momentum states. The formula I think is something like:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l + 1) * e^{i δ_l} * sin(δ_l) ) * (sin(δ_l) / (1 + cosθ)) ) ]

Wait, wait, no. The exact form is a bit hazy. Let me think again. Oh right, the scattering amplitude for elastic scattering is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ sin(δ_l) e^{iδ_l} ] * ( (4π/2k) ) * ( (sin(θ/2))^l )

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, no, I can't do that right now, so I'll try to recall. Oh, the formula involves the sum over l of (2l+1) times [sin δ_l e^{i δ_l}] multiplied by some spherical harmonics or associated Legendre polynomials? Or is it more straightforward?

Wait, I think the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ)

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. I remember that the real and imaginary parts come from the phase shifts. The formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{i
