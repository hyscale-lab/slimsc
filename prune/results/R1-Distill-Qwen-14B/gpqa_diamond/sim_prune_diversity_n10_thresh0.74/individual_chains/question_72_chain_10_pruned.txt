Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product. Let me try to work through this step by step. 

The problem involves several reactions, so I think I should break it down into each step to understand what's happening. 

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I'm not super familiar with bicyclo compounds, but I remember that the numbering goes in a way that the bridgeheads are the highest-numbered possible. So, 7-(tert-butoxy) means there's a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7 of this bicyclo structure. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene part means it's a norbornene-like structure with two double bonds. Wait, no, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2,5-diene has two double bonds at positions 2 and 5. So that's a norbornadiene structure with the substituent at position 7.

Next, this compound is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperatures, forming product 1. I'm thinking this is some kind of coupling reaction. Since there's NaI and dibromomethyl groups, maybe it's an elimination or substitution reaction. Oh wait, when you have vicinal dihalides (like two Br on adjacent carbons), they can undergo elimination when treated with a base, but here it's with NaI. Oh, wait, another possibility: Maybe it's a ring-opening or a Diels-Alder type reaction, but considering the substituents, I'm not sure.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So on carbons 5 and 6 of cyclohexa-1,3-diene, there are CH2Br2 groups. So each has two Br atoms on the same carbon. So each of these positions is a CH2Br2 group.

When reacting with the bicyclo compound and NaI, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, the bicyclo compound has an ether group (tert-butoxy). Maybe the bicyclo compound acts
