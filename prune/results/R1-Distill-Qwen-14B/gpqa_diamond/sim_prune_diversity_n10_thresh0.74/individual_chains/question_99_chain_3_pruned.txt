Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about identifying a compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to be some kind of substituted carboxylic acids.

First, looking at the FTIR data. There's a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. For carboxylic acids, the O-H stretch is usually very broad because of the hydrogen bonding. So that makes sense—so the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Also, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids typically show a peak around 1700-1725 cm^-1, so this fits. So, that confirms it's a carboxylic acid.

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR. The question says that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, no double bonds—so all the structures are saturated. Looking at the options, they all have branching but no double bonds, so that's consistent.

The NMR has some complex splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let's think about what kind of splitting that would produce.

In NMR, each neighboring set of protons splits the signal into a multiplet. The number of neighboring protons determines the splitting. For example, a triplet is from two neighboring protons (n+1 rule), so if a proton is next to two equivalent protons, it becomes a triplet.

But when we have a more complex splitting, like a doublet of triplets, that means the proton is next to two different sets of protons. For example, if a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group (two protons) and another CH group (one proton), then the splitting would be a triplet from the CH2 and a doublet from the CH. Multiplying these, it becomes a triplet of doublets, which can also be a doublet of triplets, depending on the order.

Wait, I might be mixing that up. Remember, when you have two different neighboring groups, the splitting is the product of their individual splits. So, for example, if a proton is next to a CH2 (two Hs) and another CH2 (two Hs), each would cause a triplet. The result would be a triplet of triplets, which is a nine-line multiplet. But that's not exactly what's given here. Let me think again.

The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So that's three levels of splitting. Let's break it down: quartet comes from three neighboring protons (n=3, quartet is n+1=4). Then triplet comes from two neighboring protons (n=2). Then doublet comes from one neighboring proton (n=1). So, the splitting is 4 (quartet) × 3 (triplet) × 2 (doublet) = 24 lines? That seems complicated, but maybe it's from a more complex coupling scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is due to being adjacent to multiple sets of protons. Maybe a situation where the proton is next to a group that itself has multiple neighboring groups. Let's think about the structure.

Looking at the options, they all have a carboxylic acid group at the end. Let's draw each structure to get a better idea.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure would be something like:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the central part has two CH groups each attached to a C2H5 group. Or wait, the structure is:

The backbone is CH2-COOH, so the last two carbons are CH2 and COOH. The two carbons before that are each CH attached to C2H5 groups. So the molecule is (CH2CH2...? Wait, no, perhaps it's more like:

The main chain is longer? Let me represent each option.

Option A: Structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, positions are:

Carboxylic acid is at the end (CH2-COOH). The two CH groups are each attached to ethyl groups. So the structure is:

CH2CH2(COOH) is maybe CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, the correct structure would be:

The molecule is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(
