Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. There's also a mention of a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. The substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and particularly its analog is used.

Hmm, let's start by figuring out what each part might be.

First, the gas W: its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each atom in W's molecule must have equal numbers of protons and neutrons, because the molecule as a whole has the same numbers. So, if it's a molecule, maybe it's diatomic. Let's think: possible gases are H2, O2, N2... Wait, but the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule must be equal. So each atom must have the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's see, for example, hydrogen has 1 proton, 0 neutrons in H-1. That doesn't fit. Wait, but maybe the molecule is CO2? No, that's not a gas with equal numbers. Alternatively, maybe it's something like O2. O has atomic number 8, so each O atom has 8 protons. The number of neutrons in O is usually 8 in the common isotope (O-16). So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits the condition: same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. So W is O2? Or wait, another possibility: methane is CH4, but that's not a gas with equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, another possibility is that each molecule is something like H2O. No, because H2O has different numbers. Wait, but wait, the molecule as a whole must have same number of protons and neutrons. So for example, CO2: C has 6 protons, each O has 8. So CO2 has 6 + (2*8) = 22 protons. Neut
