Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that weighs 7.20 grams. They are heated to 200°C without air. Then, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three tubes without cooling.

Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 grams. Tube 2 is a Ca(OH)2 solution, and its weight didn't change. Tube 3 has red-hot copper, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 grams, producing CuO. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

I think the goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Let me think about what's happening here. When salts A and B are heated, they probably undergo thermal decomposition. The gases formed are passed through these tubes, which react with specific substances. Let's consider each tube's reaction.

Starting with tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. When it gains weight, it must be absorbing moisture. Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can form hydrates. So, the gas passing through here likely contains water vapor. The increase in weight (3.60g) would be the mass of water absorbed.

Next, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the weight didn't change, it implies that no gas reacted with it. Gases that react with Ca(OH)2 include CO2, which would form CaCO3 and water. Since the weight didn't change, there must not have been any CO2 or another acid gas like SO3 or HCl. But wait, maybe the gas that passed through was already neutral, like nitrogen or something that doesn't react.

Tube 3 has red-hot copper. The increase in weight is 0.80g, which probably comes from the reaction of a gas with copper. Copper at high temperatures can react with certain gases. For example, SO2 or H2S might react, but more likely, since it's a metal oxide being formed (CuO), the gas is probably H2S, because H2S can be oxidized by CuO. Wait, no, when H2S passes over hot CuO, it would reduce CuO to Cu and produce H2O and S. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO, which can reduce CuO to Cu, but CO itself would be oxidized. Or perhaps it's another gas like NH3, but I don't think that's likely.

Wait, another possibility: if the gas is H2S, it might react with CuO. Let me think. The reaction would be something like H2S + CuO → CuS + H2O. But wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a sulfur-containing compound. Or perhaps it's water vapor, but that was already absorbed by tube 1.

Wait, no— the tube 3 is after tube 1 and 2, so the gas passing through would have already passed through Mg(ClO4)2 and then Ca(OH)2 solution. So, any water would have been absorbed in tube 1, and any acidic gases like CO2 would have been absorbed by tube 2. So, the gas entering tube 3 would have been something else.

But wait, tube 2 didn't react. So the gas must have been non-acidic. Let me think. So, the gas that passed through tube 1 and 2 is something that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2, like N2, O2, Ar, or perhaps some inert gas. But tube 3 is where the reaction occurs, so the gas must be something reactive towards copper.

Wait, maybe
