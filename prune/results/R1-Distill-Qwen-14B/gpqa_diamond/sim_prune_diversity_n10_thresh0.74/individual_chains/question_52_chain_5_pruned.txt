Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it carefully and think through each step. 

The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. Hmm, alright.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The key point here is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—no spots compared to with spots.

Wait, so the ratio is [N1/N2]_no_spots divided by [N1/N2]_with_spots. Or maybe the other way around? Because the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when there are spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor would be the no-spots ratio divided by the spot ratio, which would be a number greater than 1.

But how do I calculate this ratio? Well, I remember that the ratio of populations of two energy levels in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I think that's the wavelength of the emitted photon when an electron transitions from level 2 to level 1. So the energy difference between the levels can be found using the photon's energy. 

E_photon = hc/lambda. 

h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. I'll need to calculate E2 - E1, which is the same as the energy of the photon emitted during the transition. 

Let me note the values I need:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m

So E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Let me compute that. 

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m
So E_photon = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, but energy in terms of eV might be easier for Boltzmann factors. Because k (Boltzmann constant) is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So converting E_photon to eV: 

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So,

E_photon (eV) = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems high. Hmm, maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me re-calculate E_photon:

E_photon = hc / lambda
h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
lambda = 1448e-10 m.

So, hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by lambda: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = let's compute this.

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 ≈ (1.371) * 1e-18 J.

Which is 1.371e-18 J. Convert to eV: 1.371e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's correct. Because 1448 Å is in the near UV range, and Ti lines there are around that wavelength. So 8.5 eV is plausible for such a transition.

So E2 - E1 = 8.56 eV. 

Now, the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), assuming g1/g2 can be considered as 1 for simplicity. Wait, the question doesn't give any information about statistical weights, so I think we can assume g1 = g2, so the ratio is just the exponential term.

Wait, no. The Boltzmann factor is [N2/N1] = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ) ). So [N1/N2] = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But since the problem says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two levels (level 1 and level 2)", so let's define it as N1/N2. If the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that implies that when T decreases (because with spots, Teff is lower), N1/N2 becomes smaller.

Wait, why? Because if temperature decreases, the exponential term (E difference over kT) becomes larger. So [N1/N2] = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the equation right.

The correct Boltzmann factor is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So N1/N2 = [g1/(g2)] * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But if g1 = g2, then N1/N2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when the temperature T decreases, the exponent increases, making N1/N2 larger. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So T is lower. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so exp(...) is larger. So N1/N2 would be higher when T is lower, meaning the ratio would increase when the star has spots. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Maybe the ratio observed is N2/N1, and that's what's decreasing. Because the problem says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy
