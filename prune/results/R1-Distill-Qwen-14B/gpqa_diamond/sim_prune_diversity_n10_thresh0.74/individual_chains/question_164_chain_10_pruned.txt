Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and figure out what's going on.

Alright, the question is about binary star systems and determining which one is more massive. Hmm, binary systems have two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? And they can eclipse each other when their orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The periods given are the time between two primary eclipses, which I think is the orbital period of the binary system.

So the two systems are system_1 and system_2. Their eclipse periods are 2 years and 1 year, respectively. So system_1 has a longer period than system_2. Wait, but I'm not sure how the period relates to the mass yet.

Then, the problem mentions spectroscopic observations showing radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they are 15 and 10 km/s. Radial velocity amplitude is the maximum speed at which the stars are moving towards or away from us. I remember that in a binary system, each star's velocity is related to the mass of the other star. The more massive star moves slower, and the less massive one moves faster. So the RV amplitudes are inversely proportional to their masses.

Wait, the formula I recall is that the velocity amplitude (K) of each star is given by K = (2Ï€G)^(1/3) * (M_secondary sin i) / ( (M_primary + M_secondary)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ), but maybe there's a simpler way when comparing two systems.

Alternatively, I remember that the ratio of the velocities of the two stars in a binary system is inversely proportional to their masses. So if star A has velocity K1 and star B has K2, then M1/M2 = K2/K1. Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, since they have to balance around the center of mass.

Wait, let me think again. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so lower velocity. So if star A has a mass M_A and star B M_B, then M_A/M_B = (v_B)/(v_A), because M_A * v_A = M_B * v_B. So the mass ratio is the inverse of the velocity ratio.

So for system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So the mass ratio for system_1 would be (5/10) = 0.5. Wait, no, wait. Because if star A has velocity 10 and star B 5, then M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A = 5/10 = 0.5. So M_A is half the mass of M_B? Or is it the other way around? Wait, star A's velocity is higher, so it must be the less massive star. So if star A is less massive, then M_B is larger.

Wait, let me clarify: For a binary system, the more massive star moves slower. So the star with larger K (velocity) is
