Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. Hmm, I remember the equation is something to do with the current in a semiconductor device under certain conditions. Let me think.

The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current versus voltage behavior when the device is in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V²/L³). So the variables here are epsilon (dielectric constant), mu (mobility), V (voltage), and L (length of the device).

The question is about the validity conditions for this equation. The options are A to D, each giving different conditions. I need to figure out which statement correctly describes when the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.

I remember that in the SCLC regime, the current is limited by the space charge itself, meaning the accumulation of charge carriers in the vicinity of the electrodes affects the electric field. Oh wait, but what are the conditions required for this equation to hold?

I think the Mott-Gurney equation applies to a single-carrier device. So any option that talks about two-carrier devices (like option D) is probably incorrect. Because in a two-carrier device, both electrons and holes are involved, and their interactions might complicate things. So I can eliminate option D.

Now about the contacts. The equation assumes that there's no significant barrier for carrier injection. Oh, right! Ohmic contacts would allow carriers to flow without much barrier, so maybe that's a condition. Alternatively, Schottky contacts have a barrier, which might complicate things. If the contact isn't Ohmic, like in a Schottky diode, then maybe the current would be limited by tunneling or something else, not just the space charge. So I think the device should have Ohmic contacts. So options A and C have Ohmic and Schottky, respectively. So if it's Ohmic, then option A or B.

Wait, another point: the equation assumes negligible drift current. Wait, no, the equation itself is about the current in the SCLC regime, which is when the current is limited by the space charge. Oh wait, no, SCLC is when the space charge creates a region where the electric field becomes so high that the carriers' velocity is limited by the field (like the Child-Langmuir limit). But in that case, drift is important because the carriers are moving under the electric field.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under certain assumptions. Let me think about the derivation. The SCLC occurs when the electric field is limited by the space charge, so the current is carried by both drift and possibly diffusion, but in the derivation, they assume that the electric field is such that the space charge dominates, leading to a particular velocity profile. So I think the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the current is in the SCLC regime, which is when the space charge is significant and the current is limited by it.

Now, the equation's derivation assumes a certain contact condition. I think it assumes that the injection of carriers is not a limiting factor. So if there's a barrier (like a Schottky contact), then the current would be limited by the barrier height rather than the space charge. So in that case, the Mott-Gurney equation wouldn't apply. Therefore, the device should have no significant injection barriers, meaning Ohmic contacts or something similar.

So among the options, I'm thinking about which options have the right conditions. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.

Wait, but if drift is negligible, wouldn't that affect the current? The Mott-Gurney equation is about drift current, right? Because in the SCLC regime, the current is primarily due to drift under the electric field. So if drift is negligible, then the current wouldn't be as per Mott-Gurney. So I think this option is wrong because it says negligible drift current. Because the equation is about current due to drift being space-charge limited.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.

Wait, no injection barrier would imply Ohmic contacts. And negligible diffusion current would mean that drift is dominant. But in the Mott-Gurney equation, is diffusion considered? Hmm, the derivation I remember is for a single-carrier, no traps, and perhaps assuming that the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion. So the equation might assume negligible diffusion, which is part of the conditions.

Option B says "no carrier injection barrier" and "negligible diffusion current." So if the injection barrier is zero (Ohmic), and diffusion is negligible, then the equation should hold. So that seems plausible.

Option C: Single-carrier, Schottky contact, negligible diffusion. But Schottky has injection barriers, so that would affect the current. So the Mott-Gurney equation isn't valid because the current would be limited by the barrier, not the space charge.

So back to the options. Option B says the device has no carrier injection barrier, so that's Ohmic, but also negligible diffusion current. The equation is for when drift is the main factor, so if diffusion is negligible, that fits.

Option A: Ohmic contact and negligible drift? No, because drift is the main part of the current in SCLC.

So correct conditions are single-carrier, no injection barriers (Ohmic), negligible diffusion (so drift dominates). So that would be option B.

Wait, but looking back, option B says "no carrier injection barrier." So that's Ohmic, which is correct. And "negligible diffusion current," which would mean that the current is mainly drift, which is the case in Mott-Gurney.

Then the correct answer should be option B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation is valid under specific conditions. To determine which statement is correct, we analyze the options:

1. **Option A**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. However, the Mott-Gurney equation applies to the SCLC regime, where drift current is significant and dominates the behavior. Therefore, the condition of "negligible drift current" makes this option invalid.

2. **Option B**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. The absence of a carrier injection barrier implies Ohmic contacts, which is consistent with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation. Additionally, the condition of "negligible diffusion current" aligns with the SCLC regime, where drift current dominates. This option is consistent with the validity conditions of the equation.

3. **Option C**: This states that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contacts introduce injection barriers, which would limit the current due to the barrier rather than the space charge. Therefore, the Mott-Gurney equation does not apply under these conditions, making this option invalid.

4. **Option D**: This states that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, as the presence of both electrons and holes complicates the current behavior. Thus, this option is also invalid.

From the analysis, the correct conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation are described in **Option B**: a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current.

Answer: B
