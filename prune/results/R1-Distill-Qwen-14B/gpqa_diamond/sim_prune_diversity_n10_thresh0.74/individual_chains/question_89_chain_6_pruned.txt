Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then there are three products formed through different reaction conditions. The final question is about the NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

First, let me break down each reaction step.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is noted.

Hmm, what reaction occurs when dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH? KOH is a strong base, and dibromides usually undergo elimination or substitution. Since adamantane is a highly substituted, bridge structure, substitution might not be favorable. Wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh, right! When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction—E2 mechanism—to form an alkene. So, product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene? Or wait, wait, wait. Let me think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent carbons in a diamondoid structure. Eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond between the two adjacent carbons, but wait, in the adamantane structure, each carbon is bonded to three others, so forming a double bond would require a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide? No, because KOH isn't an oxidizing agent in that context. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, when vicinal dihalides react with KOH, they usually form an epoxide, but that's when using something like NaOH and ethylene glycol, or other conditions. Wait, but in this case, it's KOH and heating, so elimination is more likely.

Wait, elimination would form a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form 1,3-adamantadiene? But wait, that would mean a conjugated diene in an adamantane structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a diepoxide, but I don't think so with KOH. Wait, but with KOH, maybe it's a substitution. Wait, but the IR peak is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. Oh wait! Maybe it's an elimination to form a carbonyl? No, wait. Wait, wait, if the product has a carbonyl group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH to form something with a ketone or ester group. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide but that doesn't have a carbonyl. Wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. Let me think: when dihalides react with strong bases, sometimes they can form ketones if the elimination leads to carbonyl formation. Wait, but that's more like the formation via a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an epoxide, but that's not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH. Considering the structure of adamantane, which is a diamondoid, each bridgehead carbon is bonded to three other carbons. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two bridgehead carbons that are adjacent. So, when heated with KOH, perhaps a double elimination occurs, forming a bridge. Wait, another possibility is that each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would require two substitutions, but with KOH and heating, probably elimination is more favorable.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O). So, perhaps the product is a ketone. Wait, if the two bromides are eliminated as Br⁻ and form a carbonyl group. How?

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by another dehydrohalogenation. So, two E2 reactions, each losing HBr, leading to the formation of a double bond. But for a carbonyl, maybe it's a geminal dihal
