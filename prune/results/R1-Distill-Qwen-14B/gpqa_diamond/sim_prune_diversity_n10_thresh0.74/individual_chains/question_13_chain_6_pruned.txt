Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down. So, the starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene in methanol. It's stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. I remember that Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation reactions. Hydrogenation usually adds hydrogen across double bonds, right? So limonene has a double bond; hydrogenation would saturate that.

Wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene. Its structure is a bicyclic compound with a double bond. So when hydrogenated, it becomes a cyclohexane derivative. Since it's R configuration, the hydrogenation might affect the stereochemistry. But wait, where's the double bond in limonene? I think limonene has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (if I'm numbering from the methyl group). So hydrogenation would add two hydrogens there, turning it into a single bond.

So the product after hydrogenation (product 1) would be a cyclohexane ring with some substituents. Limonene is (R)-configuration. So, the hydrogenation would probably lead to a cyclohexane with a methyl group and maybe an isopropyl group attached. Let me think: the structure of limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene. So, when hydrogenated, it becomes a monohydric alcohol? Or wait, no, because it's in methanol, but hydrogenation doesn't involve oxygen. Wait, limonene is a
