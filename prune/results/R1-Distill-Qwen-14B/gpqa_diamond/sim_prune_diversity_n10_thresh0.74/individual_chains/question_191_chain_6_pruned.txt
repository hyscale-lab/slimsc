Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4 step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, I should probably draw its structure. So, cyclohexanone ring with substituents. The 3 position has a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and the 5 position has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group attached at the middle carbon, right? So it's CH2-C(CH2)-something, wait no. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the substituent is on C2. So it would be CH2-C(CH2?) No, maybe it's CH2-C=CH2? Wait, wait. Let me think. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2? No, wait the substituent is on the 2nd carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, so the group is CH2=CHCH2- attached at the middle carbon. Wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- but attached at the 2nd carbon? So maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 where the middle carbon is attached to the cyclohexane, and the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So that's CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond, so it's CH2=CHCH2- attached to the cyclohexane at the middle carbon. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the first and second carbons, making it CH2=CH-CH2- where the CH2 is attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, maybe it's more accurately drawn as CH2=C(CH2-...). No, wait, the IUPAC name
