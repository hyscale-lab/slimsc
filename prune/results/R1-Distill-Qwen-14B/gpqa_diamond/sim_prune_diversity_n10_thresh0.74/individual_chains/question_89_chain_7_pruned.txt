Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still learning the ropes.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a lot like a diamond in structure but with a different arrangement, making it very rigid and unreactive except under certain conditions.

So, the first step is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I think that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation. But wait, wait—adamantane's structure might influence this. Oh right, in the case of adamantane derivatives, when two adjacent bromines are present, heating with a strong base like KOH would likely lead to the formation of an alkene via elimination. Since it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the elimination would produce an allene? Or maybe a diene? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. So, the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, so when KOH is added, each Br would leave, and two adjacent hydrogen would be abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, for elimination, each Br is on adjacent carbons, so each deprotonation would form a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be a diene? Or wait, maybe the product is a mono-alkene. Wait, no. Elimination of two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form a structure with two double bonds? Wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane means that each Br is on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. So when KOH is added, each Br leaves as Br-, and the adjacent hydrogens are abstracted, forming a double bond. But since the molecule is symmetric, perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe it's a mono-
