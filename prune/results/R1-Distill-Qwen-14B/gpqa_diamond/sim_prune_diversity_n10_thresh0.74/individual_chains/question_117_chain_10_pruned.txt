Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? That usually happens when a molecule has a chiral center. Wait, but also, sometimes it's about other types of isomerism like geometric isomerism?

The question gives four different moieties and asks which ones show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one.

1. The first one is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2,2' and 6,6'. The nitro groups are at the 6 positions and the carboxylate groups at 2. So, because it's a biphenyl, the single bond allows for rotation. But wait, does the structure have any symmetry? If the substituents are all in positions that make the molecule asymmetric, maybe it can have enantiomers. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not. Let me visualize the structure. The two benzene rings are connected at 1 and 1', so positions 2 and 2' are on each ring. The nitro groups are on the 6 positions, which are across from the connecting point. So, on each benzene ring, positions 2, 2', 6, and 6' are all substituents. Wait, maybe the molecule is symmetric around the central bond? If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it might not be chiral. Or perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, considering that the substituents are in positions that cause the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, leading to optical isomerism.
