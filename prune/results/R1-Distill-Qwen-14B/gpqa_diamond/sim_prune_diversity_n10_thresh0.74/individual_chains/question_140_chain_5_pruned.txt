Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K, which I think is about 4 degrees Celsius because water freezes at 273 K and 277 is just 4 above. So maybe B is something that's solid at that temperature, like maybe ice? Or perhaps another compound.

The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Hmm, so W is a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons, or maybe the molecule as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons? Wait, the question says "the same number of neutrons and protons" in the gas molecule. So each molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Hydrogen gas (H2) has 1 proton and 1 neutron per H atom on average. Wait, but wait. Hydrogen can have isotopes like protium (H, 1 proton, 0 neutrons), deuterium (2H, 1p,1n), and tritium (3H,1p,2n). But if the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons, each atom would need to have p = n. So for H, each atom has 1p and 1n, so deuterium. So if W is D2 gas, then each molecule has 2*(1p +1n) = 2p and 2n. Wait, but the molecule as a whole would have 4 p and 4 n? No, no. Each molecule has 2 atoms. Each D atom has 1p and 1n. So the molecule would have 2 protons (since each D has 1, two atoms make 2) and 2 neutrons (each D has 1, so total 2). So the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which are equal. So W could be D2 gas, but that's a heavy isotope. Alternatively, maybe another molecule where each atom has p = n. For example, if the molecule is
