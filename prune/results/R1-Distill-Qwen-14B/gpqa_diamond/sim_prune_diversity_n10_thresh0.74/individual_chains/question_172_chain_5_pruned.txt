Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me read it carefully. So, there are two stars, star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Oh, right, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which I think means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. 

I remember from my studies that when atoms are in LTE, their energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the population of different energy levels. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Right, so the formula is (n2)/(n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, I think E is higher for the excited state. So maybe if the energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1, then the ratio would be exp(-ΔE/(k T)). 

In this problem, the excited state population in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, the question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So n1 is twice n2? Or is it the other way around? Let me read again. It says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So n1 (excited) is 2 * n2 (excited). 

Wait, but wait, when we talk about the population ratio, the higher energy level has a lower population because thermal energy isn't infinite. So maybe I should define the ratio correctly. Let's say that the higher energy level is E2, and the lower is E1. So the ratio n2/n1 = exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). 

In star 1, n2 (excited) is twice that of star 2. So for star 1, ratio is (n2_1)/(n1_1) = 2. Wait no, wait: wait, in star_1, the excited state is twice as populated as in star_2
