Okay, so I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both North and South poles; you can't isolate them. So that must have some implications on Maxwell's equations.

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for electricity: divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0.
2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: divergence of B is zero.
3. Faraday's Law of induction: curl of E is negative the time derivative of B.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: curl of H is J + epsilon_0 dE/dt.

In our universe, the divergence of B is zero, which means there are no magnetic monopoles. So equation two is divergence B = 0.

But in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated poles. That suggests that magnetic monopoles exist. So the second equation would change. Because if there are monopoles, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Instead, it would be something like rho_m (magnetic charge density) over some constant, similar to how Gauss's law for electricity works.

So equation two would become divergence B = rho_m / mu_0 or something, depending on the units. So that equation definitely changes.

Wait, but what about the other equations? Do they change as well? Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law involve curls of E and B. If magnetic monopoles exist, I think Maxwell's equations would also adjust for magnetic currents. Let me think.

In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B would be rho_m (like equation 1 for E), and the divergence of E would still be rho_e. Also, the curl of E would involve the time derivative of B plus any current terms? Or wait, I remember in the case of magnetic monopoles, the curl of E would relate to the magnetic current density. Let me think again.

In our equations, the curl of E is - dB/dt. But if there's a magnetic current, maybe the equation would change. Oh wait, the Maxwell equations with magnetic monopoles modify both the divergence equations and some of the curl equations.

Wait, let's recall. When magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations change. The divergence of B is no longer zero, and the curl of E would have an additional term related to the magnetic current density.

Wait, no. Let me think. The standard four equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
