Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the substitution of bromine on different aromatic compounds. There are six substances, numbered 1 to 6, and each undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer's yield.

Wait, so each of these is a benzene derivative, right? So each substituent will affect the position where the bromine adds. The direction of substitution (ortho, meta, para) depends on the substituent's activating or deactivating nature and whether it is a directing group.

I remember that substituents can be activating (like -NH2, -OH) which direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups, like -NO2, direct meta. But wait, some substituents are deactivating but ortho/para directors, like -Cl. Or wait, no, -Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para director because of its electron-withdrawing effect but being an activating group in the sense that it's an electron donor through resonance? Wait, no, I think Cl is deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group (through inductive effect), but it's ortho/para directing because the lone pairs can donate electrons through resonance, making ortho and para positions more activated.

Wait, no, actually, substituents with lone pairs like -OCH3 are activating and ortho/para directors. But -Cl is deactivating (due to inductive effect) but ortho/para directing because the ring's electron density is higher in those positions due to resonance.

So, let's list each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para director. Because alkyl groups are activating (electron donating) through sigma bonds, so they direct ortho and para.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: Wait, no, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Wait, no, that's an ester group. So the substituent is a carbonyl group connected to an ethyl group. Wait, no, the structure is benzene with a COOEt group. So the substituent is -COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl). So that's an ester group. Esters are deactivating (since carbonyl is electron-withdrawing) and meta directors. Because the carbonyl group is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, and the substituent is meta directing.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine attached. As I thought earlier, Cl is deactivating (because of inductive effect, being more electronegative) but ortho/para directing because of resonance (the lone pairs can delocalize into the ring).

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group. Nitro is a strong deactivating group (since it's a strong electron-withdrawing group, both through induction and resonance). And nitro groups are meta directors. So the incoming electrophile will add in the meta positions relative to the nitro group.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethyl group attached. Similar to the methyl group. Alkyl groups are activating, so they are ortho/para directors.

6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group attached. So the substituent is -COOH, a strong electron-withdrawing group. Carboxylic acid is deactivating and meta directing. Because the -COOH has a strong -I effect, which deactivates the ring, and the substituent directs incoming electrophiles to the meta positions.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure: which groups are activating and which are deactivating.

Activating groups increase the ring's electron
