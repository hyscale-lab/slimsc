Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. So, the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is NN plus X. 

The Pauli statistics condition is given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, what does that mean again? Oh right, Pauli's exclusion principle applies because nucleons are fermions. So the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The wavefunction depends on spin, spatial (orbital), and isospin parts. The condition here is about combining these quantum numbers.

The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So their isospin is zero. Let me recall: isospin is a bit like a spin, but for particles like nucleons (protons and neutrons). So T=0 means symmetric under isospin exchange, since the singlet state is symmetric? No, wait, isospin states are more like SU(2) representations. For two nucleons, their isospin can combine to a singlet (T=0) or triplet (T=1). Since T=0 here, that's the singlet state, which is symmetric? Or antisymmetric? I think for identical particles, the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric, so the isospin and spatial parts must combine to compensate for the spin part.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. The 1S0 notation: the 1 comes from (2S+1), so S=0. The L is 0, because S0 is the orbital part. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, so J=0. Now, the system emits a particle X, so the final state is NN plus X. But the problem is about the possible partial waves, so the angular momentum state of X.

The options give various transitions, like 1S0 -> 7D1 + p, etc. Each option has a final state for NN and the emitted particle. We're to determine which partial wave is not permitted.

We need to consider both angular momentum and parity conservation.

So, let's think about the process: the initial state is 1S0, so its parity is (-1)^L. L is 0, so parity is +1.

When they emit particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. The parity of the final state (NN + X) must be the same as the initial state, because parity is conserved in strong interactions (assuming this is an electromagnetic or strong process). Wait, but X is a particle emitted, like a pion or something else. But the intrinsic parity of X is given as -1.

So the initial parity is +1. The final parity must be +1 as well.

The parity of the final system is the product
