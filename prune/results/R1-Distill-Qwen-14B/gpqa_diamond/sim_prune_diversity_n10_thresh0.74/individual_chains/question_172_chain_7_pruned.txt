Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let me try to think it through. 

The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star 1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. Oh wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the temperature. When a star is hotter, more atoms are in higher energy states, right? So star 1 having higher excitation probably means it's hotter than star 2.

The energy difference between the levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that number looks familiar. Oh, yeah! 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference delta E is probably k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So I think this relates to the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann distribution gives the ratio of populations in two energy levels. The formula is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k*T) )

In this case, since both stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), each star's photosphere follows the Boltzmann distribution independently. The ratio of the populations for the excited state to the ground state (or some lower state) would depend on the temperature of each star.

Let's denote the excitation level as the ratio of populations of two energy levels. Let's say for star 1, the ratio is twice that of star 2. Wait, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the population of the excited state in star 1 is twice that of star 2. Or perhaps it's the probability of excitation. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the problem states that the number of excited iron atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that of star_2. Hmm, no, wait, the way it's phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe it's the number of atoms in that excited
