Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw that structure mentally. So, cyclohexanone ring with a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)-, no wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is at position 2, so it's CH2-C(CH2 something). Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be the structure CH2-C=CH2, but attached at the middle carbon. So the substituent is CH2-C(=CH2)-? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is (CH2)2C=CH2? No, wait, let me think. Prop-1-ene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is the group from the double bond. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(=CH2)- attached. Wait, that canâ€™t be right because the numbering would be wrong. Let me think again. The structure is CH2=CHCH3, so the substituent is the part between the double bond. So for prop-1-en-2-yl, the substituent is CH2-C(=CH2)-. No, wait, maybe I should draw it properly. So, the substituent is CH2-C=CH2 attached at the central carbon. So, the group is CH2-C(CH2), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-C(=CH2). So, the group is an allyl group attached at the middle. So, the structure at position 5 is an allyl group, which is CH2-C(=CH2)- attached?

Wait, maybe I should think of prop-1-en-2-yl as (CH2)2C=CH2? No, that's incorrect. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So, to get the substituent, you take the propene and remove a hydrogen from the second carbon. So the substituent is CH2-C(=CH2)-. So the group is CH2-C(=CH2)- attached to the cyclohexane. So position 5 has that substituent.

So the starting molecule is:

Cyclohexanone ring: carbonyl at position 1.

At position 3: CH2OH.

At position 5: CH2-C(=CH2)-, perhaps similar to a vinyl group attached via CH2.

Now, the first reagent is sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide. So sodium hydride is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent, especially for acidic protons like those in alcohols or amines.
