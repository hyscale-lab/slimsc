Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and is 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so maybe m is 0 or ±1? Not sure if that matters right now. We're supposed to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic term) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen.

Wait, transition energy ΔE is related to the wavelength given, λ=0.4861 micrometers. Oh, that's the Balmer series wavelength, right? Red light for hydrogen. The energy of a photon with that wavelength would be E = hc/λ. Let me calculate that.

So, h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters. Plugging in: E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6). Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.089e-19 J. Hmm, but wait, I remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So, 4.089e-19 J is about 4.089 / 1.602 ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, that can't be right because the Balmer transition is about 13.6 eV / (n²) or something? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I'm mixing up things. The Balmer series is the transition from n=2 to n=1, emitting a photon of about 10.2 eV? Or wait, no, wait, the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=2 to n=1, ΔE is E_1 - E_2 = (-13.6) - (-3.4) )= -10.2 eV. But the absolute value is about 10.2 eV. Oh wait, but when you calculate E = hc/λ, you get the energy of the photon, which is 10.2 eV, I think. Wait, but my calculation gave me about 2.55 eV. Did I do that right?

Wait, let me recheck. hc is 1240 eV·nm. Since λ is 0.4861 micrometers = 486.1 nm. So E = 1240 / 486.1 ≈ 2.55 eV. Oh, right, that's the photon energy. So the transition energy ΔE is approximately 2.55 eV. Okay, that's the ΔE for the hydrogen atom.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and the external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but the problem says that m is small, so m is not too large. Let's think about the expectation value of H. Oh, wait, but the paramagnetic term is part of the total Hamiltonian, which also includes the usual hydrogen atom terms. But since the question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value to ΔE, perhaps we're looking at the energy shift due to the magnetic field.

Wait, but the param
