Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the system. So for a given state, the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

Breaking down the operator, it's 10σz plus 5σx. So the expectation value would be the sum of the expectation values of each term. That is, ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Right, so I can calculate each expectation separately and then combine them.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are just their eigenvalues. The σz matrix, if I remember correctly, has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The given state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. To find ⟨σz⟩, I can compute ψ† σz ψ. Alternatively, since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates, I can compute the expectation value directly.

Wait, another approach: for any state written as a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σz is |a|²*(+1) + |b|²*(-1). Because when you measure σz, the possible outcomes are +1 and -1 with probabilities |a|² and |b|² respectively.

So for our state, a is 0.5, so |a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|² is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, let's tackle ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is the Pauli x-matrix, which I think has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But wait, maybe there's a better way.

The expectation value of σx is given by ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. So let's compute that.

Alternatively, σx can be written in terms of the basis states. The matrix form of σx is [[0,1
