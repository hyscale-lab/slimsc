Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

So the question involves two reactions with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. The products are then combined and run on two HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes with mCPBA typically forms epoxides. The reaction is stereospecific, meaning the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the structure of the epoxide.

Wait, but wait. How does the geometry of the starting alkene (E or Z) influence the epoxide structure? Oh right, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide by adding an oxygen across the double bond. The reaction proceeds through a cyclic transition state, leading to the formation of an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So, the E and Z alkenes would form different epoxides.

Let me think about the products. (E)-oct-4-ene has the substituents on opposite sides, so when epoxidized, the resulting epoxide will have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides? Or wait, no, the epoxide formation adds an oxygen bridge, so the configuration depends on the starting double bond.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5. The substituents on each end are (since octene is CH2CH2 on either end but with substituents). Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? Wait no, no, wait. No, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on either side. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the structure.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should recall that when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is an electrocyclic process, so the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, the reaction of mCPBA with an alkene gives an epoxide. The two possible configurations would be cis or trans in the epoxide ring, depending on the starting alkene. Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to say that the reaction leads to the formation of an epoxide where the substituents are on the same face (cis) or opposite faces (trans) relative to each other.

Wait, let me think. For epoxidation, the addition of the oxygen occurs with stereochemistry. So, if the starting alkene is E (trans), then the epoxide would have the two new oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a cis epoxide? Or maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the transition state. mCPBA adds across the double bond in a concerted manner. The peracid (mCPBA) approaches from the same face of the double bond. So in the case of a trans (E) alkene, the substituents are on opposite sides, so the peracid adds across, leading to an epoxide where the two oxygen bridges are on the same face, making a trans epoxide.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me try to visualize. Let's take (E)-oct-4-ene. The groups on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. For example, imagine the structure as CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3 but with the substituents on each end (like CH2CH2) on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it adds an oxygen bridge across the double bond, but the way it adds depends on the geometry.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the reaction leads to cis addition of the oxygen. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the addition of the oxygen bridge would create a trans epoxide, whereas for (Z)-oct-4-ene, it would create a cis epoxide. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Wait, when mCPBA adds to a double bond, the oxygen adds across the double bond in a way that the two new oxygen atoms are added to the same face. So for a trans (E) double bond, the two substituents on either end are on opposite sides. So when the oxygen adds, the resulting epoxide would have the two new oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a cis configuration in the epoxide? Or wait, no.

Wait, maybe I should think about the specific products. When (E)-oct-4
