Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully again.

The question is about isomers and their properties, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. The question has two parts: part A asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B asks which compound shows optical isomerism. There are four options given, each pairing A and B with different compounds.

First, let me break down what each part is asking.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

I need to determine the answers to A and B, then match them with the options provided.

Starting with Part A:

I remember that tautomerism involves the shift of a hydrogen atom and the simultaneous movement of a bond to form a different structure. This usually occurs in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydrogens, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism, for example.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a quinone with a benzene ring. Quinones typically have two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can be 1,4-benzoquinone, which has two ketone groups on opposite positions of the benzene ring. So structure-wise, it's benzene with -O groups in para positions. Alternatively, maybe it's 1,2-benzoquinone, but I think more commonly it's 1,4.

Wait, but the structure of benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. So it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This is a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So three ketone groups equally spaced around the ring.

Now, tautomerism typically happens when there are conjugated double bonds or adjacent electronegative atoms that allow for such shifts. For example, in aromatic compounds, if there are adjacent double bonds or substituents that can shift.

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on the benzene ring. So, does it exhibit tautomerism? Well, benzoquinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but wait. Benzene rings are conjugated, so the lone pairs on the oxygen can delocalize. But for a compound to have tautomerism, like enol and keto forms, it needs to have a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group. Wait, in the case of benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at opposite positions. Each oxygen is on a carbon that's part of the ring, but since they're on opposite sides, maybe they don't have adjacent hydrogens. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. Wait, the carbonyl group is at position 1 and 4. Each carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring, so the ring carbons are each double-bonded to oxygen. So the structure is O=C6H4=O, with each O double-bonded. Each of these carb
