Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking what the energy is when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so this must involve some relativistic mechanics.

Wait, the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Let me thinkâ€”Li is lithium. So the standard lithium isotope is Li-7, which has 3 neutrons and 4 protons. So the nucleus is a Li-7 nucleus. So I need to find the rest mass of that nucleus.

But wait, the rest mass of a nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy. Oh, but for an approximate calculation, maybe I can just use the sum of individual masses? Or perhaps there's a standard value for the mass of a Li nucleus.

Alternatively, maybe I should look up the atomic mass of Li-7. The atomic mass includes electrons too, but since we're dealing with the nucleus, perhaps I can subtract the electrons' mass. Wait, but in this case, since the nucleus is moving as a whole, it's the mass of the nucleus that matters. So the atomic mass of Li-7 is about 7.016003 u, I think. Let me confirm: I remember that for hydrogen (1H), it's about 1.007825 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for
