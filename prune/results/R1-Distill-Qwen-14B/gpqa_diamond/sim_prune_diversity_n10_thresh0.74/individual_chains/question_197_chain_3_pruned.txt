Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. 

First, I should analyze the IR and NMR data to determine the structure of Compound X. Let's break down each part.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are in the regions 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 probably indicates an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid because those usually show strong, broad O-H stretches. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but the 1720 cm-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. So maybe Compound X is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but some other functional groups also have O-H. For example, phenols have O-H stretches around 3200-3600, usually broader. But here, the peak is from 3400-2500, which is a bit lower. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde's O-H? No, aldehydes don't have O-H. Maybe an alcohol? The 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe a ketone or ester. But the broad peak suggests perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then the 1720 cm-1 could also be an ester or maybe a ketone. Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl should be around 1700. So maybe 1720 is a bit higher, which could suggest an ester or maybe a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an acid derivative.

But let's look at the NMR data to get more clues. The 1H NMR shows several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typically an O-H proton. In a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. So that fits. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. So two sets of doublets in the aromatic region probably mean the substituent is at the para position. So maybe the structure is something like para-substituted benzene with another group attached, perhaps a methyl or ethyl group, and a carboxylic acid group.
Wait, but let me think again. Wait, 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm are both doublets, each integrating for 2H. So for a benzene ring, that suggests two sets of equivalent
