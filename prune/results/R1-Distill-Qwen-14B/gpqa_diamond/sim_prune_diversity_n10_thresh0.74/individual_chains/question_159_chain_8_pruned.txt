Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about observations of a quasar's spectrum. The peak is at around 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical range. But before 790 nm, the flux drops a lot. Hmm, I remember that flux dropping at shorter wavelengths could be due to something like the Lyman limit or the Lyman-alpha forest. Wait, the Lyman limit is around 91 nm, right? But that's for hydrogen, and maybe if the quasar's emission is being absorbed by intervening hydrogen, you'd see a drop in flux below a certain wavelength.

Wait, but if the quasar's emission at shorter than 790 nm is dropping, maybe it's because of the Lyman series. Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm. So if the flux drops below 790 nm, that's way longer than Lyman-alpha. Hmm, maybe it's about the Lyman break. Oh right, the Lyman break is when the intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes so optically thick at wavelengths shorter than the Lyman limit (about 91 nm) that light from the quasar is absorbed. But wait, the quasar's spectrum here is dropping below 790 nm, which is way longer than that. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe this is about the quasar's own emission features. Quasars emit a lot of light, including in the optical and near-infrared. If there's a peak at 790 nm, that's in the near-infrared. But why does the flux drop below that? Maybe it's because of some intrinsic feature of the quasar's spectrum. Or perhaps it's related to the redshift of the quasar.

Wait, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. So the key might be to determine the redshift of the quasar, which relates to how far away it is in a universe defined by the Lambda-CDM model.

So, the peak at 790 nmâ€”what emission line is that? Let me think. The Balmer series of hydrogen is in the optical. The Balmer-alpha line (H
