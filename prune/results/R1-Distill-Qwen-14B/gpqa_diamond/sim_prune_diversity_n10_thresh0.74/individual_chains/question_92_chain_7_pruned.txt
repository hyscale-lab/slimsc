Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. Right, so I need to use bond energies to figure this out.

Wait, the compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complicated. Let me try to imagine its structure. Oh wait, maybe I should count the number of each type of bond in the molecule. Because I remember the formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

Enthalpy of formation = Σ (bond energies of reactants) - Σ (bond energies of products)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the enthalpy of formation of a molecule is calculated by considering the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products. Oh, but wait, in this case, the elements are in their standard states, so I think it's calculated by comparing the bond energies in the molecule to the bond energies in the elements as they are (like CO2 from carbon and oxygen, etc.).

Wait, the problem gives me the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, atomization is the process of breaking down a molecule into atoms. So for carbon, the bond energy would relate to the triple bond in graphite or something else, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the formula I think I should use is: 

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in the molecule) - (sum of bond energies in the elements)

Wait, no, maybe I have it reversed. Because when a molecule is formed from its elements, the bonds in the elements are broken, and new bonds are formed in the molecule. So the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the bond energies of the elements' bonds minus the sum of the bond energies of the molecule's bonds. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

Wait, bond energies are typically the energy required to break a bond. So when you form a molecule, you're breaking bonds in the reactants (elements) and forming bonds in the product. So the enthalpy change would be (sum of bonds broken) minus (sum of bonds formed). If the product is more stable, the enthalpy of formation would be negative.

But wait, in this case
