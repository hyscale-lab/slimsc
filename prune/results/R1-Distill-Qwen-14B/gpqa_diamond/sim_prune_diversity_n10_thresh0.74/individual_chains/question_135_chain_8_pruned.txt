Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the decay of a boson field X, right? And the options are about the possible particles it can decay into.

The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that looks a bit confusing. Hmm, I think I should break it down. So, Lagrangian terms usually describe the interactions between fields. Here, it's a bosonic field X interacting with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. I remember that the mass of a particle determines what it can decay into because of conservation laws and energy considerations. For a decay to be possible, the rest mass of the boson must be at least equal to the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. Otherwise, it's kinematically forbidden.

So, the task is to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options list various fermion-antifermion pairs as possible decay products.

First, I need to figure out which fermions are light enough to be produced by X when it decays. Let me list all the fermions and their masses approximately. Wait, but I don't remember all the exact masses. Maybe I can recall the approximate:

- Electron (e): very light, about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.77 GeV
- Up quark (u): around 2-3 MeV (so 0.002-0.003 GeV)
- Down quark (d): similar to u, perhaps a bit heavier, ~3-5 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95-100 MeV (0.095-0.1 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let's think about possible decay channels.

In the decay X → f f̄, the sum of the rest masses of f and f̄ must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, the rest mass of each fermion is about half that. So for a pair, it's 2 * m_f.

Let's go through each option and see which pairs are possible.

Option A: bb̄, ss̄, uū, dđ, τ+τ-, e+e-

Wait, bb̄ would require 2 * m_b. m_b is about 4.5 GeV. So 2*4.5 = 9 GeV. X is only 6 GeV. So m_X =6 GeV < 9 GeV. So that decay isn't allowed. So option A is
