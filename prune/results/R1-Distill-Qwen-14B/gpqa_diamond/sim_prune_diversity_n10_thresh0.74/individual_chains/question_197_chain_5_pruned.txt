Okay, so I need to figure out the compound X and what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's start by looking at the spectroscopic data provided.

First, the IR data: the peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, maybe an O-H stretch. The 1720 cm-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. But wait, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks could be from conjugated carbonyl, maybe aromatic rings with substituents. So maybe the compound is an aromatic ketone or something similar.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 usually suggests an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone? Hmm. Wait, but if the IR has a 1720 peak, which is more like a ketone or ester than a carboxylic acid (which is higher, around 1700 for carboxylic acid but usually broader). But wait, 1720 could also be an ester. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester.

But the NMR at 10.5 is a bit confusing because if it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit, but then the IR would have a very strong O-H stretch, which is usually around 2500-3300, which it does. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, the other data... Let's see.

The NMR has 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The coupling suggests two doublets, which is typical for a para-substituted benzene, maybe with two substituents in the para positions. So the aromatic ring has two substituents, each in positions 1 and 3, or 2 and 4, but given the doublets, it's probably two identical substituents in para positions.

Wait, no. Wait, in para-substituted benzene, you get two doublets. So
