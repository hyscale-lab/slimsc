Okay, so I've got this question about organic compounds and the light they emit or absorb. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a textile dye that emits light with a certain energy, and I need to figure out what color it absorbs. 

Wait, right, I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Oh, right, it's something about complementary colors. Like, if a dye emits green light, it probably absorbed red or something. But wait, I should get the details right.

The energy given is 2.3393 eV. I think I need to find the wavelength corresponding to that energy because the color we see is related to the wavelength of the emitted or absorbed light.

I recall the equation E = hc/λ, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. Right. So I can rearrange this to solve for λ: λ = hc/E.

Plugging in the numbers. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. Speed of light c is approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. And E is 2.3393 eV. Oh wait, but I need to convert eV to joules because the units should match.

1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So E in joules is 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV. Let me calculate that: 2.3393 * 1.
