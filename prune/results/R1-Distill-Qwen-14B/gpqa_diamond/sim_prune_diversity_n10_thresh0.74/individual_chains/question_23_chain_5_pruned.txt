Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question involves reacting a specific compound with hydrogen bromide and then determining the products based on the TLC results. I remember that when alcohols react with HBr, they typically undergo an acid-catalyzed SN1 or SN2 mechanism, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here.

The starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me draw that structure out. So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether group is connected to a butenyl chain. Looking at the butenyl part: it's but-3-en-1-yl, which means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 2 (since it's 3-en). Wait, no, wait: butenyl has four carbons. But the numbering starts from the point of attachment. So, the substituent is on carbon 1. The double bond is between 3 and 4? No, wait, but buten-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but that can't be right because butenyl only has four carbons. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl is actually CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that doesn't make sense for a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me think again. The structure is (CH2CH2C(CH3)2CH2O) attached to benzene? No, wait, no. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, so the butenyl group is:

Buten-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, where's the double bond? Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl is actually CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that doesn't fit. Wait, no. Let's clarify. The structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O attached to benzene? No, wait, but that would be but-1-en-4-yl, perhaps. I think I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So,
