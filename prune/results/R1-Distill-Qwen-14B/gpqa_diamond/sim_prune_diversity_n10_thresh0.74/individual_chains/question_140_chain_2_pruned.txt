Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. So, under normal conditions, what's 277 K in Celsius? Let me think, 273 K is 0°C, so 277 would be about 4°C. Hmm, not sure yet.

Next, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, I'm thinking maybe the product is something like water or an alcohol, but no, wait, it's a product of a keto acid reacting with X. Keto acids are things like acetoacetic acid or something similar. When they react, perhaps via some kind of addition or condensation? Maybe a dehydration reaction?

The question also mentions that X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Common reagents... Maybe something like a strong base or a strong acid. Wait, if it's reacting with a keto acid, which is usually in an acidic environment, maybe X is a base. Or wait—wait, the reaction is violent. What reacts violently with a liquid? Like metals reacting with water, but that's more of a metal and water. Or maybe something like a carbonate reacting with acid, but that's less violent. Alternatively, think of something like a Grignard reagent reacting with water, but Grignard reagents are usually in ether solutions.

Wait, the gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. So, possible for a molecule of gas W to have equal protons and neutrons per atom. Let's think about possible gases: H2O? No, because that's a molecule with H and O. Wait, but the molecule itself. So the molecule must have same number of protons and neutrons in each atom? Or the total for the molecule? The wording says "molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So for the whole molecule, the sum of protons equals the sum of neutrons.

Wait, but in a molecule, each atom has its own protons and neutrons. So, for the molecule, sum of all protons in all atoms equals sum of all neutrons. Let me think of possible gases. Maybe H2O, but let's check. H2O has 2 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). Sum of protons: 2 +8=10. Sum of neutrons: 0+8=8. Not equal. 

Another possibility: CO2. C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons in the most common isotope (C-12). O has 8 each. So CO2 would have 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 + 2*(8)= same as protons. So, 22 each. Oh! So CO2's molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits. So gas W is CO2.

Wait, but wait, the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So, what kind of reaction would produce CO2? Probably a carbonate reacting with an acid, but that produces CO2. Alternatively, maybe a metal reacting with an acid, but that usually gives H2. Or maybe a reaction involving a carbonate. Hmm.

Wait, but X reacts with Y, which is a liquid. If Y is water, and X is something that reacts with water to produce CO2, perhaps X is a carbonate. But if X is a carbonate reacting with water, maybe not. Wait, but if X is a carbonate, it would react with an acid (like perhaps Y is an acid), but the problem says Y is a liquid.

Wait, but maybe Y is a strong acid. So, if X is a carbonate, say Na2CO3, and Y is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), then the reaction would produce CO2, water, and Na2SO4. But that's just a thought.

Alternatively, maybe X is a bicarbonate. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, it forms G, which upon heating gives B. B has a melting point near 277 K (about 4°C). That's very close to the melting point of water (0°C) but a bit higher. Hmm, or maybe another substance. Let me think, what has a melting point around 4°C? Maybe ammonium nitrate? No, because dissolving it can cause the solution to get cold. Wait, no, melting point. Another thought: what if B is something like sodium hydroxide? No, NaOH's melting point is higher. Wait, maybe B is sodium carbonate? Or maybe something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid that when heated from G. Wait, G is a precipitate. Let's say the reaction produces a metal hydroxide, which upon heating gives a metal oxide. For example, if X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, the precipitate could be a metal hydroxide. Wait, but if X is a carbonate reacting with an acid, then the products would be CO2, water, and the corresponding salt of the acid. So, perhaps X is sodium carbonate, Y is sulfuric acid, and then the product is sodium sulfate, and CO2 and water. But that doesn't produce a precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 O atoms. I'm not exactly sure what that refers to. Let me think: a keto
