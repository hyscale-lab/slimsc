Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question gives me the angular size of the event horizon and the distance, and I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy. 

Wait, entropy of a black hole... Oh right, I remember that the entropy (S) of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or wait, sometimes I see it as S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), or something like that. I should get the exact formula right. Oh yeah, it's S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), because the area factor is involved.

So, A is the area of the event horizon, which is a black hole's surface area. The event horizon is a sphere, so A = 4π r^2, where r is the Schwarzschild radius. But I think I can also relate the angular size to the radius. Because the question gives me the angular size θ and the distance d. 

Angular size θ is related to the actual size (like the diameter) through the formula θ ≈ size / distance. But wait, θ is in radians, right? So the formula is θ (in radians) ≈ (diameter)/(distance). Or more precisely, θ ≈ (size)/(distance) when the size is much smaller than the distance, which it is here.

The question states θ is 10^-17 degrees. Oh wait, I need to convert that to radians. Because I remember that 180 degrees is π radians, so 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians would be 1e-17 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees) ≈ (π / 180) * 1e-17.

Let me compute that. 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Because π is about 3.1416, so 3.1416/180 is roughly 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

But wait, the event horizon's size is the diameter, right? Because the angular size θ is the angular diameter. So, θ ≈ (diameter)/(distance). So diameter = θ * distance. But wait, wait, that's only if the distance is much larger than the object, which it is here, so the approximation holds.

So the diameter of the event horizon is approximately θ (in radians) multiplied by the distance d. So:

diameter ≈ θ * d.

But the distance d is given as 1e
