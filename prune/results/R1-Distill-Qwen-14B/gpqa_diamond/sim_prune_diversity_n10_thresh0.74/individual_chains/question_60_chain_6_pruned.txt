Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to relativity, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see what the question is.

So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spaceship that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their average lifetime is about 150 Earth years. But wait, from their astronaut's perspective, who's 22 years old, how long does it take to reach Earth?

Hmm, right. Because the spaceship is moving at such a high speed, relativistic effects must come into play. I remember that from special relativity, time dilation and length contraction are important. So, the astronaut's own time (proper time) will be less than the time observed from Earth.

Wait, the spaceship is going from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. I think the distance isn't given, but maybe I can find the time experienced by the astronaut using time dilation.

I think the formula for time dilation is that the proper time (tau) is equal to the time measured in the Earth's frame (t) multiplied by the square root of (1 - v squared over c squared). Because from the spaceship's frame, Earth is moving, so the distance is contracted, making the trip shorter.

But wait, let me think. The spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c, which is super close to the speed of light. So, the gamma factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is
