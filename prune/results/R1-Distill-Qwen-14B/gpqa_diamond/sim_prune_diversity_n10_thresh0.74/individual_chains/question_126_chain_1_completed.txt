Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see... The question involves two reactions and then analyzing the products using HPLC. Hmm, I need to think through each step carefully.

Alright, the first reaction is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH and then an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. Hexan-3-one is a ketone, so I think it would be reduced to an alcohol. Wait, but it's (S)-configured, so the stereochemistry might matter.

Wait, LAH is LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would have the ketone group at position 3. Reducing that would add two hydrogens: the carbonyl oxygen becomes an OH group. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, wait... Oh, wait, no, the configuration. LAH is a bulky reducing agent, but wait, in the case of ketones, the reaction typically doesn't proceed via a carbocation, right? Because ketones are less reactive than aldehydes. So maybe the reduction of a ketone with LAH would proceed through a single mechanism without any carbocation formation, so the configuration of the starting material would influence the product.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. The starting material is a ketone, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let me draw the structure. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3, but with a methoxy group on the fifth carbon. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, wait, no. Let me count. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, hexane has six carbons, so 3-ketone would be:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH2-
Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2CO, followed by three more CH2 groups. Wait, maybe that's not right. Hmm, maybe it's CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. So, the molecule is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but where's the methoxy group? The compound is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Oh, so the methoxy is on carbon 5. Wait, hexan-3-one has the ketone at position 3, and the methoxy is at position 5. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: OCH3 attached to this carbon
Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, perhaps it's better to number it as:

1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: C(=O)-
4: CH2-
5: CH(OCH3)-
6: CH2CH3?

Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO, then the remaining three carbons. So positions 4,5,6. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, because hexane only has six carbons. So maybe it's CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. So, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH2-
Carbon 6: CH3?

But wait, that's hexan-3-one. Now, the 5-methoxy would be on carbon 5. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? Wait, because after the ketone at carbon 3, carbon 4 is CH2, then carbon 5 is CH(OCH3), and carbon 6 is CH3? Maybe that's correct.

Now, when you reduce this ketone with LAH, you get a secondary alcohol. So the ketone at C3 becomes an -OH group. So the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The configuration S is given, so the alcohol's configuration might depend on the starting material. Wait, but when you reduce a ketone, the product is a secondary alcohol, and the configuration depends on the starting material's configuration because the reduction is stereospecific. Wait, but ketones are planar, so the reduction can lead to either R or S configuration in the product. Wait, but the starting material is (S)-configured, but wait, the starting material is a ketone, which is planar, so the configuration of the starting material may not influence the configuration of the product. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, the starting material is a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which implies that the molecule has a chiral center at C5. Because the methoxy is attached to C5, and the ketone is at C3. So, the molecule would have the structure:

Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 5: attached to OMe and two other groups. So, the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps that's more accurate. So, the C5 is CH(OCH3), then followed by CH2CH3? Or maybe it's CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one would be (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3, but when the methoxy is at position 5, which is the second carbon after the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3? No, that's more than six carbons. Hmm, maybe it's (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one as:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but that's seven carbons. Wait, hexan means six carbons in total. So maybe it's:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)
Carbon 6: CH2CH3? No, that can't be right because that would be seven carbons. Oh wait, no, hexan is six carbons. So perhaps the structure is:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? Wait, that would be six carbons? Let me count:

1: CH3,
2: CH2,
3: C=O,
4: CH2,
5: CH(OCH3),
6: CH3.

Wait, that's six carbons. So yes, hexan-3-one with a methoxy at C5 (which is the fifth carbon). So the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So when this is reduced with LAH, the ketone at C3 becomes an alcohol. So the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait—when you reduce a ketone, you get a secondary alcohol. So the product is a secondary alcohol at C3, and the C5 has the methoxy group.

But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. So the product will have the same configuration at C5 as the starting material, right? Because the reduction doesn't affect that center. So the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has a secondary alcohol at C3 and a methoxy group at C5.

Wait, but wait, when you reduce a ketone, the resulting alcohol is a secondary alcohol. The configuration at the new center (the former ketone) depends on the reducing agent. LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to a syn addition. But wait, ketones are not like aldehydes; they don't have a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl that's part of the carbonyl group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ketones have two R groups adjacent to the carbonyl. So upon reduction, the addition of H- occurs from both sides—wait, no, in ketone reduction, LAH would add hydride and proton in a certain way.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The main point is that the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with the configuration at C3 being the new stereocenter. Wait, no, because the starting material (the ketone) is not a chiral center. The starting material's chirality is at C5 (the methoxy is on C5, which has four different groups: two CH2 groups, the OMe, and the adjacent carbons). So, when we reduce the ketone at C3, we create a new stereocenter at C3. The LAH would add hydride in a certain way, but for a ketone, the reduction is typically not stereoselective because ketones are not as sensitive to that as aldehydes. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a race between the two faces, but for a symmetrical ketone, but this isn't symmetrical.

Wait, but in any case, the product's configuration at C3 will be a new stereocenter. Since the starting material's C5 is S, but the reduction at C3 could create a new stereocenter. But wait, perhaps the product is racemic? Or maybe it's just a single enantiomer because the starting material has a certain configuration.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the reaction is performed with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent, and the workup is acidic. So the ketone is converted into a secondary alcohol. But the configuration of that new stereocenter (at C3) depends on the mechanism. Since ketones are planar, the hydride can attack from either side, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the environment around the ketone is not symmetrical, so maybe the reduction leads to a specific configuration.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the C5 has four different groups: the methoxy, a CH2 from C4, a CH2 from C6, and the C3 (which is a carbonyl group). So when we reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, we're adding two hydrogens. The addition would be from the same face (syn addition) because LAH typically adds hydride and proton in a syn fashion. Wait, but for ketones, the reduction usually leads to a single product, but with possible racemization if the new stereocenter is present.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer. Alternatively, maybe I'm making this too complicated. Maybe the product is a secondary alcohol at C3, and the configuration at C3 is R or S depending on how it's formed. But since the starting material has a specific configuration at C5, and the reduction happens at C3, which is a different center, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has two stereocenters: the original C5 (S) and the new C3, which could be R or S. So the product would be a diastereomer or a pair of enantiomers, depending on whether the new center is a stereocenter.

Wait, but let's consider this: the product after reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters: C3 and C5. But wait, no, in the starting material, the C5 is a stereocenter because the groups are OMe, two CH2 groups, and the adjacent C4 (which is a carbonyl group). When you reduce the ketone, the C3 becomes a stereocenter. So the product will have stereocenters at C3 and C5.

Wait, but does the reduction of the ketone create a new stereocenter at C3? Yes, because the carbon was trigonal (sp²) and becomes tetrahedral (sp³) with four different groups: two CH2 groups, the OH, and the adjacent C4 (which is now a CH₂ group). So the product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Wait, but the starting material has an S configuration at C5. After reduction, C3 becomes a new stereocenter. So the product is a diastereomer with C3 and C5 stereocenters.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps whether the product is a single diastereomer or a racemic mixture isn't directly relevant, as the question is about the number of peaks in the HPLC. So perhaps the product is a single compound with two stereocenters, making it a diastereomer.

Wait, but perhaps the product is a single enantiomer, which would have two stereocenters. But regardless, let's move on to reaction II.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)COCH2COCH3, right? Wait, no, the structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-C(O)-CH3. So it's a diketone, with ketones at positions 2 and 4.

Now, NaBH4 is a reducing agent, but it's a milder agent compared to LAH. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. However, in the presence of excess NaBH4, perhaps both ketones are reduced. Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, it might reduce both, but maybe not under certain conditions. Wait, but pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups. So when treated with excess NaBH4, both ketones will be reduced.

So each ketone would become a secondary alcohol. So the product would be HOCH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? Wait, no, no, let me structure it correctly. Pentane-2,4-dione is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So it's a five-carbon chain with ketones at C2 and C4.

So when reduced with NaBH4, each ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product would be:

CH3-C(OH)H-CH2-C(OH)H-CH3. Wait, no, each ketone (C=O) becomes CH(OH). So the structure is:

HOCH2-C(OH)CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, no, perhaps more accurately:

The structure would be HOCH2-C(OH)CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, no. Let me think. Each ketone (C=O) is at C2 and C4. So after reduction, each becomes a secondary alcohol. So:

At C2: the structure becomes CH(OH).
At C4: the structure becomes CH(OH).

So the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, but that would have two secondary alcohols on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's more accurately written as HOCH2-C(OH)CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2-OHCH2CH3? No, I think I'm getting tangled up. The correct product would be 2,4-pentanediol. So the molecule has two alcohol groups at positions 2 and 4.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione becomes pentane-2,4-diol upon reduction. So the product is (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S,4S), (2R,4S), or (2S,4R), depending on the reduction conditions. But since NaBH4 is a reducing agent that typically adds hydride to the less substituted side, but wait, in ketones, the hydride comes from the less hindered side. Wait, but in this case, both ketones are identical, so the reduction would lead to the same configuration at both centers.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is symmetric, so both ketones are equivalent. So when reduced, each would form an alcohol. But the reduction of a ketone with NaBH4 typically gives a single enantiomer if the starting ketone has a plane of symmetry. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is symmetrical. So when each ketone is reduced, the resulting diol would have both OH groups on the same side, leading to a meso compound. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4.

So the product is a meso compound, which is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry. So the product is (2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is the same as (2S,4R), but because of the internal symmetry, it's a meso compound, hence not chiral.

So reaction II produces a single meso compound, which is achiral.

Now, the products from both reactions are combined. Let's outline the products:

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This compound has two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When reduced, the ketone at C3 becomes an alcohol, creating a new stereocenter at C3. The original C5 is a stereocenter and remains as such. So the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters. But wait, that's a molecule with two stereocenters, so it could be a diastereomer or an enantiomer.

Wait, but when you reduce a ketone, the product's configuration depends on the mechanism. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product will be a single diastereomer. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a single diastereomer because the reduction leads to a specific configuration based on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, but perhaps the reduction of the ketone in (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one leads to a specific configuration at C3. Because the starting material's C5 is S, and the reaction is occurring at C3, perhaps the new stereocenter's configuration is determined by the attack of the hydride from a specific face. But since the ketone is planar, the hydride could attack from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, no, that's for aldehydes. For ketones, the hydride can attack from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, if the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the environment around the ketone is such that the attack is more favorable from one face, leading to a specific configuration.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure, so maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the product from reaction I is a single compound with two stereocenters—so it's a diastereomer, perhaps a single enantiomer.

But wait, the product from reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no, the starting material is (S) at C5, but the ketone is at C3. The product has an OH at C3, which is a new stereocenter. So the product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5. Are these both chiral centers?

Yes. C3: because after reduction, it's connected to four different groups—two CH2 groups, the OH, and the adjacent C4. C5: attached to OMe, two CH2 groups, and the adjacent C4. So both are stereocenters.

So the product from reaction I is a diastereomer with two stereocenters. So it's a single diastereomer, perhaps, if the reduction leads to a specific configuration. But if the reduction leads to a racemic mixture, then we'd have equal amounts of two enantiomers, but that's unlikely because the starting material was a single enantiomer. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to a single enantiomer at C3, so the product would have two stereocenters, and thus four possible stereoisomers. But in reality, the product would be a single diastereomer because the starting material's configuration at C5 and the reaction conditions would lead to a specific configuration at C3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that reaction I gives a single product with two stereocenters, making it a diastereomer. So, a single diastereomer.

But now, the products from both reactions are combined. So reaction I gives a diastereomer, and reaction II gives a meso compound, which is a single, achiral product.

Wait, so reaction I's product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is a single diastereomer with two stereocenters. Reaction II's product is the meso diol, which is a single compound, achiral.

So when these are combined, we have:

- From reaction I: 1 diastereomer (with two stereocenters)
- From reaction II: 1 meso compound

Now, the products are run on both a normal-phase HPLC and a chiral HPLC column.

In normal-phase HPLC, the stationary phase is polar, and the mobile phase is non-polar. The separation is based on the polarity of the compounds. So if two compounds are enantiomers, they would have the same polarity and thus elute together in normal-phase HPLC. However, if they are diastereomers, they would have different physical properties and would elute at different times.

But wait, reaction I's product is a single diastereomer, and reaction II's product is a meso compound. So the combined products are:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (with two stereocenters, a single diastereomer)
2. pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound, single product)

So how many peaks would each HPLC show?

In normal-phase HPLC, the number of peaks corresponds to the number of different compounds, regardless of their chirality. So if two compounds are present, you would get two peaks. But wait, are (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and the meso diol different in terms of their polarity? Yes, because they have different structures. So in normal-phase HPLC, they would elute at different times, resulting in two peaks.

Wait, but wait, reaction I's product is a single diastereomer, so it's one compound. Reaction II's product is another single compound, the meso diol. So in total, two compounds, so two peaks on normal-phase HPLC.

But wait, I thought earlier that reaction I's product might be a pair of enantiomers, but no, I think I concluded it's a single diastereomer, so only one peak.

Wait, but let me think again. Reaction I's product has two stereocenters. So it's a diastereomer, but is it a single enantiomer or a racemic mixture? Wait, if the reduction leads to a racemic mixture, then reaction I's product would have two enantiomers, leading to two peaks on chiral HPLC and one peak on normal-phase HPLC. But since the starting material was a single enantiomer, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, leading to one peak on normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me summarize:

- Reaction I produces (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters. So it's a diastereomer, but whether it's a single enantiomer or a racemic mixture depends on the reaction's stereochemistry. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product may be a single diastereomer, leading to one peak in normal-phase HPLC.

- Reaction II produces a meso compound, which is a single, achiral product. So it would be one peak in normal-phase HPLC.

So combining these, two peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Now, for the chiral HPLC. Chiral HPLC columns can separate enantiomers. If a compound is chiral, it would produce two peaks (enantiomers), while an achiral compound would produce one peak.

So reaction I's product is a diastereomer with two stereocenters. Wait, but if the product is a single diastereomer, is it chiral? Let's see: if the molecule has two stereocenters and no internal plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. The product from reaction I, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, has two stereocenters. Do these create a chiral molecule?

Yes, because there's no internal plane of symmetry. So the molecule is chiral, and thus would have an enantiomer. But in reaction I, if the product is a single enantiomer, then in the chiral HPLC, it would show as one peak. But wait, no—if the product is a single enantiomer, then it's one peak in chiral HPLC. But if the product is a racemic mixture, then two peaks.

But wait, reaction I's product from a single enantiomer starting material, how many stereoisomers does it form? If the reduction of the ketone creates a new stereocenter, and the starting material was a single enantiomer, then the product would be a single diastereomer with two stereocenters. But wait, the product is a diastereomer with two stereocenters, which makes it a chiral molecule. So how many enantiomers does it have?

Each chiral center adds a possibility. So the product could have four stereoisomers (2^2), but in reality, it's a single diastereomer because the starting material was a single enantiomer. Hmm, perhaps no. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of reaction I is a single enantiomer, so when run on a chiral HPLC, it would show as one peak, because it's a single enantiomer. But wait, no, because a chiral HPLC would separate enantiomers, so if the compound is chiral and you have a single enantiomer, it would elute as a single peak.

Wait, but reaction I's product is a diastereomer, which is a single compound, so it's a single enantiomer. So on a chiral column, it would show as one peak. But wait, no, because the diastereomer's configuration would matter. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer, so on chiral HPLC, it would be one peak.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it this way: reaction I's product is a diastereomer with two stereocenters, making it a chiral molecule. If the product is a single enantiomer, then on a chiral HPLC, it would appear as one peak because there's only one enantiomer present. However, if the product is a racemic mixture, then two peaks. But in this case, reaction I's starting material is a single enantiomer; the reduction at C3 may create a specific configuration, leading to a single enantiomer.

So, reaction I's product is a single enantiomer, so on a chiral column, it would give one peak. Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is achiral, so it would give one peak on the chiral column as well. So in total, the chiral HPLC would show two peaks.

Wait, but wait, no. If reaction I's product is a single enantiomer, it's a single peak on the chiral column. Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is achiral, so it would also give a single peak. So the chiral HPLC would show two peaks.

Wait, but the reaction I's product is diastereomer, which is a single compound, but with two stereocenters. So it's chiral and a single enantiomer. So on chiral HPLC, one peak.

Reaction II's product is a meso diol, which is achiral, so on chiral HPLC, one peak.

So the chiral HPLC would have two peaks: one from reaction I's product (single enantiomer) and one from reaction II's product (meso, which is a single compound).

Wait, but the meso compound is achiral, so it would appear as a single peak on both normal and chiral HPLC. Because the chiral column doesn't separate achiral compounds.

So in the chiral HPLC, reaction I's product (chiral, single enantiomer) would be one peak, and reaction II's product (achiral) would be another peak. So total peaks: 2.

But wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think of each product again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This has two stereocenters (C3 and C5). The configuration at C3 may be R or S, depending on the reduction. But since the starting material is S at C5, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, which is a single enantiomer, making it a chiral molecule. So on a chiral column, it would be one peak.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-diol (meso). This is achiral, so on a chiral column, it would be one peak.

So the chiral HPLC would show two peaks: one for reaction I's product and one for reaction II's product.

Now, the normal-phase HPLC doesn't care about chirality; it's based on polarity. So the two products are structurally different, so each would elute at a different time, leading to two peaks.

Wait, but wait, reaction I's product is a diastereomer with two stereocenters, and reaction II's product is a meso diol. So in normal-phase HPLC, each would be a distinct compound, leading to two peaks.

So in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. In chiral HPLC, two peaks as well.

Wait, but the options given are:

Option D: 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.

Option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps reaction I's product is a racemic mixture. No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer. But if the reaction leads to a racemic mixture, then reaction I's product would have two enantiomers, leading to two peaks on chiral HPLC and one peak on normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, but I thought reaction I's product is a single diastereomer, so reaction I is a single compound. So in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks (from reaction I and reaction II). On chiral HPLC, reaction I's product is a single enantiomer, so one peak, and reaction II's product is achiral, so one peak. So two peaks in both columns.

Wait, but none of the options match that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 in normal-phase → Unlikely.

B) 3 and 2 → Not sure.

C) 4 and 2 → No, probably not.

D) 3 in both → Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereocenters in reaction I's product. Let me re-examine that.

Reaction I's starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After reduction, the ketone at C3 becomes an alcohol, creating a new stereocenter at C3. The original C5 is still a stereocenter. So the product has two stereocenters, making it a diastereomer.

But how many enantiomers does that product have? Each stereocenter contributes to the possible enantiomers. So the product could be either R,R; R,S; S,R; or S,S. But since the starting material is S at C5, perhaps the product's configuration at C5 remains S, so the product's stereocenters are C3 (could be R or S) and C5 (S). So the possible diastereomers would be R,S and S,S (if the product at C3 is R or S, but perhaps only one is formed because of the starting material's configuration).

Wait, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer with two stereocenters, making it a chiral molecule. So on a chiral HPLC, it would elute as a single peak. Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which elutes as a single peak on the chiral HPLC. So chiral HPLC: two peaks.

On normal-phase HPLC, two peaks as well, one for each product.

But looking at the options, none have 2 peaks in both. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction I's product is a racemic mixture, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC and one peak in normal-phase.

Wait, but if reaction I's product is a racemic mixture, then on a chiral HPLC, it would show two peaks (enantiomers), and on normal-phase, one peak because both enantiomers have the same polarity. Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is achiral, so one peak on normal-phase and one on chiral. So normal-phase HPLC would have two peaks (racemic product and meso compound). Chiral HPLC would have three peaks: two from the racemic product (enantiomers) and one from the meso product. So total three on chiral, two on normal-phase.

This would match option B: 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase.

But why would reaction I's product be a racemic mixture? Because the reduction of the ketone leads to equal amounts of R and S configurations at C3, making the product a racemic mixture.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) at C5, so perhaps the product at C3 could be a specific configuration, leading to a single diastereomer, not a racemic mixture. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction of the ketone in (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one leads to a racemic mixture at C3, giving two enantiomers, each with C5 being S. So each would have a different configuration at C3, leading to two diastereomers.

Wait, but if the product has two stereocenters, and the starting material has one, perhaps the product's configuration at C3 is a racemic mixture, leading to two diastereomers. That would mean reaction I's product is a racemic mixture, giving two enantiomers, each with C5 as S and C3 as R or S.

But wait, no, that's not correct. Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, perhaps not racemic.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer with two stereocenters, leading to a single peak on normal-phase HPLC and one peak on chiral HPLC. Reaction II's product is a meso compound, leading to another peak on both columns. So total peaks: 2 in normal-phase, 2 in chiral.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters. Is this product chiral? Yes. So it would have two enantiomers. But if the starting material is a single enantiomer, would the product be a single enantiomer or a racemic mixture?

Wait, the starting material is (S)-configured at C5, and the ketone at C3 is planar. So when the ketone is reduced, the hydride could attack from either face, leading to a racemic mixture at C3, but since C5 is already a stereocenter, perhaps the product would have two stereocenters, but not necessarily a racemic mixture.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer. Hmm.

This is getting too tangled. Let's look at the options again.

Option D says both HPLC methods show 3 peaks. How could that happen?

If reaction I's product is a racemic mixture, leading to two peaks on chiral HPLC, and reaction II's product is a single peak on both. So chiral HPLC would have three peaks: two from reaction I and one from reaction II.

Wait, but reaction I's product would be two enantiomers (racemic), leading to two peaks on chiral HPLC. Reaction II's product is a meso compound, leading to one peak. So chiral HPLC would have three peaks. On the normal-phase HPLC, reaction I's product (racemic) would give one peak (since enantiomers have same polarity), and reaction II's product gives another. So two peaks on normal-phase.

Which would make the answer option B: 3 peaks in chiral, 2 in normal-phase.

But earlier I thought reaction I's product is a single diastereomer, but perhaps it's a racemic mixture.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction I's product is a single diastereomer, which is a single enantiomer, so one peak on chiral and one on normal-phase. Reaction II's product is a single peak on both. So two peaks on both. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe reaction I's product is a diastereomer but also a meso compound. No, because if it has two stereocenters and no plane of symmetry, it's chiral.

Wait, perhaps the product from reaction I has two stereocenters and is a single diastereomer, leading to a chiral molecule. So on chiral HPLC, it's one peak. Reaction II's product is a meso compound, leading to one peak on both HPLC. So total two peaks on both columns. But that's not an option.

Hmm. Another angle: perhaps reaction I's product is a diastereomer with two stereocenters, and reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is another diastereomer. So, in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. In chiral HPLC, how many? If reaction I's product is a single enantiomer, then one peak, and reaction II's product is a meso, which is a single peak. So two peaks on both columns.

But that's not matching the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps reaction I's product is a diastereomer with two stereocenters, leading to two possible enantiomers. So if the product is a racemic mixture, reaction I would give two enantiomers, leading to two peaks on the chiral HPLC and one peak on the normal-phase HPLC.

Reaction II's product is a meso compound, leading to one peak on both columns.

So overall:

- Chiral HPLC: reaction I's two enantiomers (2 peaks) + reaction II's meso (1 peak) → 3 peaks.

- Normal-phase HPLC: reaction I's racemic (1 peak) + reaction II's meso (1 peak) → 2 peaks.

Which matches option B: 3 peaks in chiral, 2 in normal-phase.

But earlier I thought reaction I's product would be a single diastereomer, not a racemic mixture. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction of the ketone in reaction I leads to a racemic mixture, so reaction I's product has two enantiomers, each with two stereocenters. So on chiral HPLC, each enantiomer would be separated, leading to two peaks. Reaction II's product is meso, leading to one peak on both columns. So chiral HPLC shows three peaks (two from reaction I and one from II). Normal-phase shows two peaks (racemic I as one, meso II as another).

Thus, the correct answer would be option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

But wait, the options don't include option B as the correct answer. Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 5 and 4

B) 3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and3

Hmm, so option B is 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase.

So the answer would be option B.


The problem involves two reactions and analyzing the products using HPLC. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction I:
The starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, is a chiral ketone with a stereocenter at C5. When treated with LAH, the ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, creating a new stereocenter at C3. The product, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, has two stereocenters (C3 and C5) and is chiral. The reduction mechanism can lead to a racemic mixture at C3, resulting in two enantiomers of the product. Thus, reaction I produces two enantiomers.

### Reaction II:
Pentane-2,4-dione, a symmetric diketone, is reduced with excess NaBH4. Both ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the product is a meso compound, which is achiral.

### Combined Products:
- **From Reaction I**: Two enantiomers of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
- **From Reaction II**: A single achiral meso compound (pentane-2,4-diol).

### HPLC Analysis:
1. **Chiral HPLC**:  
   - The two enantiomers from Reaction I will separate into two distinct peaks.  
   - The meso compound from Reaction II is achiral and will appear as a single peak.  
   - **Total peaks in chiral HPLC**: 3.

2. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:  
   - The two enantiomers from Reaction I will not separate because normal-phase HPLC does not distinguish between enantiomers. They will appear as a single peak.  
   - The meso compound from Reaction II will appear as a separate peak.  
   - **Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC**: 2.

### Conclusion:
The chiral HPLC shows 3 peaks (two from the enantiomers of Reaction I and one from the meso compound of Reaction II), while the normal-phase HPLC shows 2 peaks (one from the racemic mixture of Reaction I and one from the meso compound of Reaction II).
