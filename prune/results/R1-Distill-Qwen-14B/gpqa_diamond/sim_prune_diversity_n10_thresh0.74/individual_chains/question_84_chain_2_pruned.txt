Okay, so I have this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite differences and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that allows converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one by approximating the matrix exponential function with a fractional approximation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that solving partial differential equations numerically often involves discretizing the equations into a system of linear equations. For heat equations, finite difference methods are common. Higher-dimensional problems add more variables, making the system potentially large and complicated.

Matrix exponential functions come into play when solving systems that can be represented in matrix form. Like, if you have a system du/dt = Au, the solution is u(t) = e^(At)u0. But calculating e^A directly can be computationally intensive, especially for large matrices. So approximations are needed, and the question is about using a fractional approximation.

The question is about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. So, what allows for parallel computation in this context? I think that in sequential methods, you might process each step one after another, perhaps using something like a time-stepping approach where each time step depends on the previous one. But for parallel processing, you'd want to break the problem into parts that can be computed simultaneously.

I remember that matrix exponentials can sometimes be split into smaller exponentials if the matrices commute. The idea is that if you have A = A1 + A2, and A1 and A2 commute (meaning A1A2 = A2A1), then e^A = e^A1 * e^A2. This decomposition allows for parallel computation because each part can be exponentiated separately and then multiplied together. This is the basis for the method of splitting the solution into parallelizable steps.

So the key factor here is probably something about the ability to split the matrices into parts that can be computed in parallel. But the question mentions "fractional approximation" which I'm not entirely clear on. Fractional approximations might refer to methods like Pad√© approximants, which approximate functions (like e^z) as a fraction of polynomials, potentially allowing for efficient computation.

Wait, but the question is about the key factor in converting the algorithm to be parallel. So, what allows the matrix exponential to be split into parts that can be handled in parallel? It's likely about the structure of the approximation. If the approximation can be decomposed into non-interacting subproblems, each handled by a processor, that would enable parallelism.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Stability analysis. That's about ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up or become inaccurate. Not sure how it relates to parallelism directly.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal conditions might complicate the system, but I'm not sure how that affects parallelism. Maybe nonlocal conditions require more communication between parts, which could be a problem for parallelism, but I'm not sure if that's the key factor for the conversion.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Hmm, complex roots might affect the stability or the form of the solution, but how does that enable parallel splitting? Maybe not directly related.

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Oh wait, partial fractions are
