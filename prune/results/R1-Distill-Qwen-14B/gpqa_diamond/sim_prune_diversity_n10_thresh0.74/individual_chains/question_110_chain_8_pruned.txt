Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The question gives me information about each star, and I need to determine which ones meet the brightness requirements for both instruments.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star as seen from Earth is measured by its apparent magnitude. The lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. But absolute magnitude is different—it's how bright the star would appear at a standard distance (10 pc). But for this question, I think we need to consider the apparent V magnitude because the spectrographs' detectability depends on how bright the star appears to us.

ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So, they can see stars up to 17 mag. Wait, actually, if it's brighter than 17, that means the apparent magnitude must be less than 17 because lower magnitudes are brighter. Oh wait, no—wait, the way it's worded is 'brighter than 17 mag'. Wait, in astronomy, a lower apparent magnitude means a brighter object. So, if a star has an apparent V magnitude of 16, it's brighter than one with 17. So, for ESPRESSO, it's saying that stars with V mag brighter than (i.e., less than) 17 can be observed. So, any star with apparent V mag ≤17 would be detectable.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, for HIRES, the apparent V mag must be ≤16.

So, the stars must be detectable by both. So, each star's apparent V mag must be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). Wait, no. Because if a star can be seen by HIRES, it must have apparent V mag ≤16. But to be seen by ESPRESSO, it must be ≤17. So for both, the star's apparent V must be ≤16, because 16 is stricter than 17.

Wait, but wait. Let me see the exact figures. The text says: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. Hmm, but that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, the way it's written: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Brighter than means lower magnitude. So, if a star's V is 16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But for HIRES, it's stars brighter than 16, which would be V mag ≤16.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

If a star's V mag is 17, it's at the limit for ESPRESSO. So, only stars with V mag <17 can be detected by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, stars with V mag <16 can be detected.

So for a star to be detected by both, it must have V mag <16. Because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, but let me think again
