Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about vector fields and divergence. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on vector calculus, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of f inside a sphere of radius R.

Wait, so what's the divergence of a vector field? Right, divergence measures how much the field is spreading out or converging at a point. For a vector field that only has a radial component, the divergence formula in spherical coordinates is simpler.

In spherical coordinates, if the vector field A has only the radial component A_r and no angular parts, the divergence is (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² A_r). Oh right, because the standard formula in spherical coords is (1/(r²)) [d(r² A_r)/dr] + ... but the other terms are zero here since A_θ and A_φ are zero.

So for our field f(r), which is radial and magnitude 1/r². Wait, but wait, the vector field has magnitude 1/r². Does that mean A_r = 1/r²? Or is it a vector with magnitude 1/r² in the radial direction? I think yes, because in spherical coordinates, the unit vectors are functions of position. So the vector field can be written as f(r) r̂, where f(r) = 1
