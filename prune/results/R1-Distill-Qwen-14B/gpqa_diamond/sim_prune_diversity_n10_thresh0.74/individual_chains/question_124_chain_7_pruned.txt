Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking: What Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls?

Hmm, okay. So I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls versus their lifetime. Because if a particle decays before it reaches the wall, it won't be detected. But if it's moving fast enough, it can reach the wall before decaying.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the particles are fast-decaying. So their lifetime is very short. The key here might be the concept of time dilation and how the particles' lifetime appears in the lab frame versus their own rest frame.

Let me think about the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the particles' lifetime, and the distance they travel.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). For ultra-relativistic particles, v is very close to c, so gamma is large.

The lifetime of the particle in its rest frame is, say, tau. In the lab frame, due to time dilation, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

So the particle will travel a distance L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame. So L = v * gamma tau.

But wait, in the lab frame, the particle is moving at speed v. So the time it has before decaying is gamma tau, so the distance it can cover is v * gamma tau.

The detector has a radius of 30 meters, so the maximum distance the particle has to travel is 30 meters.

But wait, the problem is about the fraction of particles that reach the wall. So the fraction depends on how much time they have to reach the wall before decaying.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The particles are produced at the center, so they have to travel 30 meters to reach the inner walls.

In the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau. So the time it
