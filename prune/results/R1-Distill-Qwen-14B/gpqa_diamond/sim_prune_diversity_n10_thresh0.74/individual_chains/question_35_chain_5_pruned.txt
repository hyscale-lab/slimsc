Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question says that the operator A_y (Ay) is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, let me write that down to visualize it better.

S matrix:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So, Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), that factors in front of the matrix.

Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Wait, but before that, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So I need to think about what the eigenvalues and eigenvectors would look like and then see which option matches.

Let's think about the process. To find eigenvalues, we solve the equation Ay φ = a φ, which is the same as (Ay - a I)φ = 0. The determinant of (Ay - a I) should be zero for non-trivial solutions.

So, let me compute Ay. Since Ay = c * S, substituting S gives:

Ay = c * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So, plugging in c = h/(4π), each element of S is multiplied by this constant.

So, Ay becomes:

[ [0, -i * h/(4π) ],
  [i * h/(4π), 0 ] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, we can look at the matrix and see if it's proportional to a Pauli matrix. Wait a second, the S matrix looks familiar. Oh right, S is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something? Let me think. The Pauli Y matrix is usually written as:

σ_y = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So, S is exactly σ_y. So, S = σ_y. Therefore, Ay = c * σ_y.

The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So, the eigenvalues of σ_y are +1 and -1. Therefore, when multiplied by a constant c, the eigenvalues would be c*(+1) and c*(-1).

Wait, let me verify. Because if I have a matrix M = a * σ_y, then the eigenvalues of M are a*(eigenvalues of σ_y) which are a*1 and a*(-1). So in this case, c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues should be h/(4π) and -h/(4π). But wait, wait. Wait, I might have made a mistake here because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, but what's the dimension here? Oh, wait, the muon's spin is 1/2, so yeah, 2x2 matrices make sense.

Wait, but another thought: the spin component matrices are usually (like for spin-1/2 particles) S_x, S_y, S_z, each of which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Because the spin matrices are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Let's see, S = ħ/2 * σ. So, if Ay = c * S, and S is the spin operator, then wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the problem is not about the spin operator but about another operator. Let's get back to the problem.

The problem states that the operator is A_y = c * S, where S is the given matrix.

So, what's the eigenvalues of Ay? Let's compute them mathematically.

The matrix Ay is:

[ 0          (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  0          ]

To find the eigenvalues, calculate the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix (Ay - a I) would be:

[ -a         (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -a         ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h)/(4π) * (i h)/(4π) ) ].

Compute each part:

(-a)(-a) = a².

The second term:

[ (-i h)/(4π) ] * [ (i h)/(4π) ) ] = (-i)(i) * (h²/(4π)^2) 

Since (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So that term becomes (1) * h²/(16 π² ) = h²/(16 π² )

So the determinant equation is:

a² - ( h²/(16 π² ) ) = 0.

So, a² = h²/(16 π² )

Therefore, a = ± h
