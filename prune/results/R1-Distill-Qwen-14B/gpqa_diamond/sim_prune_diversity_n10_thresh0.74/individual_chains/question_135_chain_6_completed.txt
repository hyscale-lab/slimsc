Alright, let's tackle this physics problem. So, the question is about the allowed decays of a boson X. Hmm, okay, I remember from my studies that when a particle decays, the energy and mass of the decay products must be considered. 

The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Wait, that looks a bit confusing. Oh right, the interaction term probably involves the coupling between the boson X and the fermions. But wait, I think the structure is more like L = λ ψ† (y) X(y) ψ(y), or something similar, which would imply that X couples to fermions. 

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, when X decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs. The key here is to determine which fermion pairs have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because for a decay to be kinematically allowed, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle.

Let me list out all the possible fermions and their masses:

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): similar, like 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): around 1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV (negligible)
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are even lighter, but they are leptons, but in this case, the problem is about decays into quarks and charged leptons.

Wait, but the question is about the X boson decaying into fermion pairs. So possible pairs are quark-antiquark or charged lepton-antilepton.

So let's go through each option.

First, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any pair whose combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV can be produced.

Let's check each fermion pair:

1. b quark pair: each b is ~4.5 GeV. So 2*4.5 = 9 GeV. That's more than 6 GeV. So b bbar is not allowed. So any option that includes b bbar would be incorrect. Looking at the options:

Option A includes b bbar. So A is probably wrong.

Options B, C, D: let's see. B doesn't have b. C has b? Wait, no. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-
But wait, that's not possible for b because 2*4.5=9 GeV >6 GeV. So the decay into b bbar is not allowed. So option A is wrong.

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
c's mass is about 1.3 GeV. So 2*1.3=2.6 GeV ≤6 GeV. So c cbar is allowed.

s: 95 MeV, so 2*0.095=0.19 GeV. Allowed.

u: 2.2 MeV, 0.0044 GeV. Allowed.

d: 4.7 MeV, 0.0094 GeV. Allowed.

Tau is 1.78 GeV each, so 3.56 GeV <6 GeV. So tau+tau- is allowed.

mu: 0.105 GeV each, so 0.21 <6. Allowed.

e: negligible, so allowed.

So in option B, the fermions are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all their pairs are allowed.

Wait, what about the top quark? But top is 173 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV, so can't be produced. So any option including top is invalid.

Looking at the options, option C includes t tbar. So that's impossible. So option C is wrong.

So options left are B and D.

Wait, what about the tau pair? Tau is 1.78 GeV, so two taus is about 3.56 GeV. That's allowed since 3.56 <6 GeV.

But let's look at the options again.

Option D: includes b, so that's not possible. So option D is out.

Wait, option D is:

X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But as we saw, b bbar is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B?

Wait, but let me recheck the options. Let me read the options again.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all allowed. But wait, what about the bottom quark? Because 4.5 *2 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV, so no.

So why is option B correct?

But wait, let me think: the interaction term given in the problem is L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, no, probably it's a typo. Wait, the correct interaction term would be λ ψ† X ψ, but the given L is a bit confusing. Or perhaps it's written as L= -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I should think about what particles are being coupled.

Wait, but the problem states it's a bosonic field X interacting with fermions. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the energy is sufficient. So the question is about which fermions can be produced.

So the fermion masses are:

Light quarks: u (2.2 MeV), d (4.7 MeV), s (95 MeV) — all very light.

c quark: ~1.3 GeV.

b quark: ~4.5 GeV.

t quark: too heavy.

Leptons: e (0.5 MeV), mu (105.7 MeV), tau (1.78 GeV).

So for X (6 GeV) to decay into a pair, 2*m_fermion <=6 GeV.

So:

- e+ e-: 2*0.5 MeV <<6 GeV. Allowed.

- mu+ mu-: 2*105 MeV = 210 MeV <<6 GeV. Allowed.

- tau+ tau-: 2*1.78 GeV = 3.56 GeV <6 GeV. Allowed.

- u ubar: 2*2.2 MeV. Allowed.

- d dbar: 2*4.7 MeV. Allowed.

- s sbar: 2*95 MeV = 190 MeV. Allowed.

- c cbar: 2*1.3 GeV = 2.6 GeV. Allowed.

- b bbar: 2*4.5 GeV =9 GeV>6 GeV. Not allowed.

- t tbar: way too heavy.

So the possible decay channels are into e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ubar, d dbar, s sbar, c cbar.

So the possible options are B and D, but D includes b which is not allowed.

So the correct option is B, which includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but option D includes b which is not allowed, so D is wrong.

So the correct answer is option B.
