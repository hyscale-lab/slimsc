Okay, so I've got this question about binary star systems, and I'm supposed to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit a common center of mass, and their velocities relate to their masses. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that both systems have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, the period of the eclipses is the same as the orbital period of the stars, right? Because eclipses happen when the stars pass in front of each other from our point of view. So the orbital period is 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2.

Then, the radial velocity (RV) variations are sinusoidal. The amplitudes given are for each star in the system. In system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. Oh, wait, RV amplitude is the maximum speed at which the star moves toward or away from us. The bigger the amplitude, the more massive the companion, I think, because more massive stars would cause a larger Doppler shift.

But how do I relate the RV amplitudes to the masses? I recall that the mass ratio q is the ratio of the secondary mass to the primary mass. Also, the RV amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So if star A has a larger RV amplitude, it's less massive because it's moving more due to the gravitational pull of a more massive star.

Wait, another thought: The velocity of each star in the binary system is inversely proportional to their mass. Because the center of mass is the balance point. So m1 * v1 = m2 * v2. So the ratio of velocities is inversely proportional to the masses. So (v1 / v2) = (m2 / m1).

But in the question, the RV amplitudes are given for each star. So for system_1, the two stars have velocities of 10 and 5 km/s. So their masses must be in the inverse ratio. So m1/m2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 is half of m2. So the total mass of system_1 is m1 + m2 = m2 (0.5 + 1) )= 1.5 m2.

Wait, no. Wait, in system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes 10 and 5. So for star A, velocity is 10 km/s, star B is 5. So their masses are in a ratio of m_A : m_B = v_B : v_A. Because m_A * v_A = m_B * v_B (since they orbit the same center of mass, their momentum must be equal and opposite). So m_A / m_B = v_B / v_A = 5 /10 = 0.5. So m_A is half of m_B. So the total mass of system_1 is m_A + m_B = 0.5 m_B
