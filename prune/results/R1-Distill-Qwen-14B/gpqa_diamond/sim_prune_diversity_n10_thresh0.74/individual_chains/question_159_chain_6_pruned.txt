Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. Below that, the flux drops a lot. So I remember that quasars have emission lines, and the peak in the spectrum could be due to a specific emission line. Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha line is in the ultraviolet, right? But if the quasar is distant, that line might be redshifted into the optical or infrared.

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. That's in the near infrared. Lyman-alpha is about 121 nm. So the redshift would be (790 / 121) - 1. Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.528. So 6.528 minus 1 is 5.528. So z is about 5.5. Or maybe I should check other lines. Another possibility is the Lyman break. But I think the peak here is more likely an emission line.

So z is approximately 5.5. Now the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance D_C for a given redshift in a flat universe is calculated using the integral from 0 to z of c/(H(a)) da. But for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the Hubble parameter H(a) is given by H(a) = H0 * sqrt(Ω_matter * a^(-3) + Ω_lambda * a^(-3*(1+w))), but wait, dark energy is usually modeled with a constant equation of state w=-1, so a^(-3*(1+w))=a^0=1. So H(a)=H0 * sqrt(Ω_m a^{-3} + Ω_lambda).

So for a flat universe, Ω_m + Ω_lambda = 1. So the integral becomes D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ω_m*(1 + z')^3 + Ω_lambda)] dz', where z' is the variable of integration from
