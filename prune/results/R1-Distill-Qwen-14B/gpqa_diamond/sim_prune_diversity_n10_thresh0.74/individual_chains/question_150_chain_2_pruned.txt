Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and we need to determine the structure based on that. Then, it undergoes a series of reactions, and we have to find the final product from the options provided.

Let me start by analyzing the NMR data. The 1H NMR peaks are:
- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Hmm, I remember that aromatic protons usually appear between 6.5-8.5 ppm. The triplet at 9.72 is quite upfield for an aromatic proton, but wait, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H, so that must be a single proton, like an aldehyde group.

So maybe the structure has an aldehyde group. Let me think about the other peaks. The doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 could be from a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which often happens in para-substituted benzene rings. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are split into two doublets when there's a substituent.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad singlet could suggest some exchange, perhaps an -OH group, but integrating to 2H, so maybe two -OH groups, but that's unusual. Alternatively, maybe it's a double bond adjacent to an oxygen, like an enol. Wait, or maybe it's a conjugated diene. Alternatively, the protons could be on a vinyl group near an oxygen, like a ketone or something else. Hmm.

Looking at the peak at 3.66 ppm, a doublet of 2H. That's probably a CH2 group next to something. Maybe an OCH2 group, like in an ether or an ester. Or perhaps an adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like R-O-CH2-CH2-..., or maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like in a secondary alcohol or something else.

Let me try to imagine the structure. Let's start with the aldehyde group. The aldehyde proton is at 9.72, so that's the first part. Then, there's a benzene ring with substituents. The two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 suggest that the ring has two substituents. If it's para-substituted, the two doublets would be each 2H, which fits. So maybe the benzene ring is para-substituted with another group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. C8: so the structure has 8 carbons. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe the compound is a diphenyl compound, since two benzene rings would account for 6 carbons. Then, the remaining 2 carbons would be from the aldehyde and maybe a CH2 group.

Wait, diphenyl butenone or something else. Let's think. If there's an aldehyde group, maybe it's attached to a chain that connects two benzene rings. Like diphenylbutanal or something similar.

Looking at the options, the products after reaction are various enals and such. Wait, the reaction steps: first NaNO2 and HCl, then water, then aqueous KOH and heat. That sounds familiar. The first reagent is nitrous acid conditions, which are often used for
