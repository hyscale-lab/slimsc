Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

First, I'll read the problem again. The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, which is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the state, and tau is that of a Gaussian reference state.

Wait, but I remember that non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, like coherent states or squeezed states. The cat state is a superposition of coherent states, so it's definitely non-Gaussian. But how does that relate to the relative entropy?

I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian the state is. The formula is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state and that of the most Gaussian reference state. But wait, in this case, tau is a Gaussian state, so maybe tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho in some sense.

Wait, the formula for del_b is S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. Because von Neumann entropy is trace(rho ln rho). So del_b is the entropy of the state minus the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

But I'm a bit confused. How do I find tau? Because tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian state that's the closest to rho. Oh wait, but maybe in the case of the cat state, the reference Gaussian state could be the maximally mixed state? Or is it the state that's the best Gaussian approximation?

Alternatively, maybe the reference state is the state with the same first and second moments as rho. Because Gaussian states are fully described by their first and second moments. So the reference Gaussian state tau would have the same mean (like alpha) and same covariance matrix as the state |psi>.

Wait, but wait—coherent states are Gaussian. So if the state is a superposition
