Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked. The question says the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length a. When a monochromatic light (wavelength λ) falls vertically on this aperture, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh wait, and we can approximate tanθ as θ because the angles are small.

Alright, let me break this down. First, the shape is a regular N-gon because all apothems are equal. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the side length and the number of sides. But when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? So in that case, the problem simplifies to a circular aperture.

Wait, but the question isn't about a circle. Or is it? Because when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be that of a circular aperture. Oh, but wait, I'm not so sure. Because the problem mentions an N-sided polygon, and for a polygon, the diffraction pattern would be a bit different than a circle. Or am I mixing things up?

Wait
