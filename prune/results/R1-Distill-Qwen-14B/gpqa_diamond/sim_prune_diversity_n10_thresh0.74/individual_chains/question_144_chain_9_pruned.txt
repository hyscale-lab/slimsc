Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the decay width is related to the lifetime of a particle. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (which is the width Γ) and the time uncertainty (the lifetime τ) is approximately ħ/2. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ/2. So τ ≈ ħ/(2Γ).

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the decay distance. The decay distance is the average speed of the particle multiplied by its lifetime. So, distance L = v * τ.

But wait, what's the speed here? The particle is a meson, which is a boson, so it's a composite particle, but when considering its decay, we can treat it as a point particle. To find its speed, I might need to calculate its velocity based on its energy and mass.

Wait, alternatively, I remember that the mean path is given by L = c * τ * γ * β, where γ is the Lorentz factor and β is v/c. But since the particle is moving relativistically, perhaps we can approximate its velocity as the speed of light. But wait, let me think again. The energy E of the particle is given as 8 GeV, and its mass is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is E - m c², but perhaps we can find the velocity from the total energy.

Alternatively, since E is much larger than m (8 GeV vs 1.2 GeV), the particle is moving at a very high speed, close to c. So maybe we can approximate v ≈ c. That would simplify the calculation.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ ≈ ħ / (2Γ)
2. Calculate the velocity v (approximated as c since E >> m)
3. Compute the decay distance L = v * τ.

Wait, but let me double-check the formulas. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ, but wait, no. The uncertainty principle gives Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Oh wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because Γ is the width, which is the energy uncertainty, so Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, let me get this right. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy and Δt is the uncertainty in time. For a resonance, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy (ΔE
