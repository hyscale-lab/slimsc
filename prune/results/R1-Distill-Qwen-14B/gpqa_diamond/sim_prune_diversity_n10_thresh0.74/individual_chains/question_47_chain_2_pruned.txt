Okay, so I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. Let me start by going through each piece of information step by step.

The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to see what kind of structure we're dealing with. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so:

DoU = (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So 5 degrees. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU), plus maybe an amide group or ester or something else contributing the remaining 2 DoU.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Since there are two bands, maybe it's an amide, which typically has two peaks due to the two N-H groups in the amide. But wait, another possibility could be an amine, which usually has a broad peak around there. But the question is whether it's a primary amine or an amide.

The IR also shows a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For amides, the carbonyl is usually around 1680-1700, but esters are higher, around 1720-1750. So maybe it's an ester. But wait, the options include both amides and esters. Let me hold that thought.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, likely a CH2CH3 group, so ethyl group attached to something that causes the triplet. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, could be NH2 protons, but amines usually show up around 1-5 ppm. Wait, but for an amide, the NH is usually a singlet around 7-8 ppm, but if it's a secondary amide, the NH might be different. Alternatively, if it's an ethyl group adjacent to something else, maybe an OCH2 group. Wait, but 4.0 ppm, broadâ€”maybe that's an amide NH? No, because amide NH is usually higher. Or maybe it's an OCH2 group, like in an ester. Wait, looking at the options: some have ethoxy groups.

Wait, in the options, the compounds are:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy at position 3.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide (like HCONHR) with ethoxy at para position.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a propionyl group attached to benzene in para position with an amino group attached to the benzene.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So benzoate ester with ethyl group, and an amino group on the benzene ring.

So, considering the 1H NMR:

The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) is the ethyl group. Then, 4.0 ppm (2H, broad singlet). Maybe this is an OCH2 group, like in an ester. For example, in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 group would have the CH2 next to O at ~4 ppm as a quartet, but wait, in this data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's consider each option's structure and how their NMR would look.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is OEt-O-CO-PhNH2, where Ph is para-substituted.

So, the ester group would have the ethyl group as CH2CH3. The ester OCH2 would be split into a quartet, but wait, in the NMR, it's a singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, D's structure would have an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) attached to the carbonyl. The OCH2 would be adjacent to O, so the protons on OCH2 would be split as a quartet. But the NMR shows a singlet for 2H at 4.0. Maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the NH2 group as a broad singlet. But in D, the amine is on the benzene ring, so it's a secondary amine. But I'm not sure about that.

Looking at the NMR again: 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). A quartet, 2H. So that's likely an OCH2 group attached to something. For example, in an ester, the OCH2 would couple with the adjacent CH3, giving a quartet. So if the quartet is around 4.5, that suggests that the OCH2 is next to a CH3, like in an ethyl ester. So that's a good sign.

Wait, the triplet at 1.20 ppm is 3H. So that would be the CH2CH3 group. So, the ethyl ester would have the CH2CH3 as triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH2), and the OCH2 as quartet. So in the NMR, the
