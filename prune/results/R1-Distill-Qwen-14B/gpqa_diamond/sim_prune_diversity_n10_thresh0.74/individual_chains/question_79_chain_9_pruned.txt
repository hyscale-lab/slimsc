Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound X is. Let's take it step by step.

The question says that compound X, with the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Hofmann elimination reaction. Hofmann elimination typically occurs in amines, especially in quaternary ammonium salts, to form alkenes by eliminating a molecule of water (or similar), producing an alkene.

So, if the reaction is Hofmann elimination, that suggests that compound X is a quaternary ammonium salt. But wait, the options don't seem to mention ammonium salts. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, another possibility is that the reaction is an acid-catalyzed elimination. Wait, but the reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, which is a strong base. So Hofmann elimination is probably the right way to go.

Let me think about the structure of the product. Hofmann elimination typically gives the less substituted alkene because the amine (after elimination) is a better leaving group in the Hofmann condition. Wait, no, Hofmann is for elimination from amines, leading to alkenes. So if the product is an alkene, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide that's opened.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide. But the reagent is this diazabicyclooctane, which is a base. Hmm. Another thought: the reaction is an epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions. Diazabicyclooctane is a kind of base that can deprotonate things, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction is a ring-opening to form a diol? But no, that would require an acid or a base catalyst, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the product's NMR. The 1H NMR has several signals. Looking at the multiplets: a singlet at 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each integrating to 3H. Singlets for three H's each probably indicate methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split the signal, like adjacent to an electronegative atom or a quaternary carbon. 

Then, in the aromatic region, a doublet at 6.75, another doublet at 7.08 (2H), another at 7.68, and another at 7.71 (2H). These suggest a conjugated system, maybe a styrene or similar structure. Let's think about the coupling. The two doublets (each 2H) might be a para-substituted aromatic ring, or perhaps a conjugated diene or styryl group.

Looking at the 13C NMR: carbons at 21.3 and 28.4 ppm. Those are probably the two methyl groups. 21.3 is a bit upfield for a CH3, maybe attached to an oxygen (like an epoxide oxygen) or another group. 28.4 could be another methyl, perhaps attached to a quaternary carbon.

The rest of the 13C NMR is in the aromatic and carbonyl regions. The 126-130 region suggests sp2 carbons, possibly in a benzene ring or a conjugated system. The 141.5 and 144.1 ppm are probably carbons attached to substituents, like para to substituents in a benzene ring. The 197.7 ppm is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester, but wait, in the product, could it be an epoxide? Or maybe a carbonyl from somewhere else.

Wait, but the product is from an elimination reaction, which would form a double bond. Alternatively, the product could have a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting material is compound X. The reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, which is a base, so maybe it's an elimination. Let's suppose that X is an epoxide. Epoxides can undergo various ring-opening reactions under basic conditions. For example, in a basic condition, an epoxide could open to form a diol, but I don't think that's the case here because the product's NMR doesn't show any broad OH signals. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide under basic conditions rearranges or undergoes elimination.

Wait, another thought: if X is an epoxide with adjacent substituents,
