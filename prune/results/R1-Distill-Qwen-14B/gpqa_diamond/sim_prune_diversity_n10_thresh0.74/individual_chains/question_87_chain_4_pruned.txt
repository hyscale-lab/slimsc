Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a specific compound based on the given information.

First, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. So, let me think: a benzene ring is 6 carbons, right? Di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. So 6 plus 2 substituents equals 8 carbons total. That makes sense.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like -X, where X is Cl, Br, etc.). So the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait. A carbonyl group can be part of different functional groups. For example, ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. Since the compound is an aromatic ring with substituents, probably the substituents are -COOR (like an ester) or a ketone like -COR. Hmm, but wait, if the substituent is a carbonyl, and the molecule is di-substituted, then the two groups on the ring are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, wait, no. Because the question says the FTIR indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen (like Cl, Br, I). So the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an -X (halogen), and the other is a carbonyl group, which could be something like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.

But wait, a carbonyl group would typically be part of a substituent. For instance, a ketone would be a -CO- group attached to the ring. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, then it's a -CHO group, but that's less likely because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but in this case, the aromatic ring substitution might affect that.

So, the substituents are -X and -COR (where R is an alkyl group or another substituent). Wait, but
