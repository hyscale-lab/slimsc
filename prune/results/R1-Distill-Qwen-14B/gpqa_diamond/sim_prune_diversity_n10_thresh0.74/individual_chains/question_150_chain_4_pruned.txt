Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might take some wrong turns, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a series of reactions. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's break that down. The molecular formula has 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Wait, so maybe an aromatic ring with some substituents? Because the presence of N and O suggests perhaps an amine or a nitro group, or maybe an amide or something else.

The NMR data is given. Let me look at that. The 1H-NMR shows several signals:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift. Could be an aldehyde proton, maybe. Or perhaps an acidic proton, like from a phenol or something else. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, so that could fit.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. Aromatic protons perhaps. If it's a doublet, maybe they're adjacent to something else, like in a para-substituted ring or part of a conjugated system.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. Maybe a meta or para arrangement.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests exchangeable, maybe -OH protons? But wait, it's a singlet. Or maybe some vinyl protons? Or perhaps protons on an aromatic ring that are deshielded but not exchanging.

- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. This seems like a CH2 group. Maybe adjacent to something electronegative, like oxygen. For example, an OCH2 group, as in a methylene next to an oxygen. Or maybe it's part of an aldehyde or ketone. Wait, but the integration is 2H, so probably a CH2 connected to something else.

Alright, let's think about the structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. X is 0, N is 1, O is 1. So, plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and maybe an aldehyde (another double bond, but aldehyde is a carbonyl, which is a double bond). So maybe a benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and another double bond or ring?

Wait, another way: benzene ring (3), a carbonyl (1), and maybe an additional double bond or another ring. Alternatively, maybe the structure incorporates a benzaldehyde group and some substituents.

Looking at the NMR data, the aldehyde proton is likely at 9.72. So a benzaldehyde structure maybe. But the integration is 1H, so only one aldehyde group. So the structure might have a benzaldehyde part.

The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets suggest maybe para-substituted aromatic rings. For example, a para-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions. Each doublet integrates to 2H, so perhaps two substituents on the ring.

The 6.27 region, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, could these be protons adjacent to an oxygen? Like in a vinyl group next to an oxygen, or maybe an -O-CH2- group. Or maybe they're part of an aromatic ring with substituents that deshield them, but that doesn't fit the broadness.

Wait, another thought: maybe those are protons on a carbonyl group, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe they're from a conjugated system, like an enol tautomer. Or perhaps those are -OH groups on an aromatic ring, but then I would expect a broad peak. But the integration is 2H, so two -OH protons? Or perhaps something else.

Looking at the other peak at 3.66 ppm, doublet,
