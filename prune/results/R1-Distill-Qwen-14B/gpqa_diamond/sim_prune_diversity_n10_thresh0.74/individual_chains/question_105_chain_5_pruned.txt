Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with some dark spots on one hemisphere. These spots have a filling factor of 20%, which I think refers to the area covered by the spots compared to the hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K. The setup is that when the star rotates, these spots come into view, causing brightness variations. The interesting part is that this could look like an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a planet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots?

So, I need to find Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the square of the planet's radius over the star's radius. The formula is (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? Because the area blocked is proportional to the area of the planet compared to the star.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. So what's happening here? The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star's brightness is a bit lower. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the observed brightness changes because different parts of the star's surface are at different temperatures.

The problem says that the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the same as if a planet were transiting. So I need to calculate the equivalent change in brightness for the spots and set it equal to the change from a planet.

First, let's model the effect of the spots on the star's brightness. The star emits with a certain total luminosity, but the spots are cooler, so when they're visible, the total emitted light is less.

The star's total luminosity without any spots is L = 4πRstar² σ Teff^4. But when there are spots, part of the star's surface is emitting less.

The filling factor is 20%, so each hemisphere has 20% spots. Wait, the question says 'one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%'. So in the hemisphere facing us, 20% is covered in spots. When the star rotates, the other hemisphere comes into view, which has no spots. So the brightness variation would be when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, and when it's not.

Wait, actually, when the star is face-on, we see all the spots. As it rotates, the spots would come into and out of view. But the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So perhaps when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower, and when it's the other hemisphere, it's higher? Or is it that the spots are on the side, so the brightness change depends on how much of the spots are visible as the star rotates?

Alternatively, maybe the star is rotating such that the spots come into and out of view. Wait, the problem says it's periodic due to rotation modulation—so as the star spins, the spots rotate into and out of our view, causing the brightness to dip when the spots are more visible.

But in any case, the variation in brightness would be due to the difference in temperature between the spotted and unspotted regions.

So the brightness variation amplitude (delta L) is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness. The maximum brightness would be when the entire star is emitting at Teff, and the minimum when as much as possible of the spots are visible.

Wait, no. Since the spots are cooler, when more spots are visible, the star's brightness would be lower. So the maximum
