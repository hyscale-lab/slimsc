Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. Hmm, I remember from my solid-state devices class that this equation relates the current to the voltage in certain conditions. Let me think.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * V² / L³. I think the Mott-Gurney equation is used for the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) region. So what does that imply about the conditions?

I recall that in SCLC, the current is limited by the electric field generated by the space charge itself. This usually happens when the device isn't in the ohmic or the diffusion-limited regions. So the conditions for this equation to hold are specific.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, Ohmic contact would mean that the built-in potential is zero, right? So the electric field at the contact is zero. But if there's an Ohmic contact, wouldn't the current be in the ohmic region, not SCLC? Because SCLC is when the voltage is high enough that you're in the non-linear, space-charge-limited area. So if it's Ohmic, probably not the SCLC. Unless Ohmic is a condition here. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, the SCLC occurs when the voltage is beyond the point where the built-in field is negligible, so the contact type might not matter. Or maybe it does. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier would mean it's like an ideal contact, perhaps. So if there's no barrier, then the carriers can move easily into the device. Also, negligible diffusion current implies that the current is mainly drift, but wait, in SCLC, the current is limited by the space charge, which is a result of the drift. So if diffusion is negligible, it's a good fit. So B says no injection barrier and negligible diffusion. But wait, in the Mott-Gurney case, I think the dominant current is drift, and for SCLC, the condition is that the space charge creates a field that limits the current. So if the device is trap-free and single-carrier, and no injection barrier, maybe that's correct.

Option C: Single-car
