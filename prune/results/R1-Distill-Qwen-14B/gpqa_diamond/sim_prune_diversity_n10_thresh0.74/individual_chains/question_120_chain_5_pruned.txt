Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think this through.

Parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, actually, the parallax decreases with distance. Because parallax is the apparent shift in position when viewed from different points (like Earth's orbit), so closer stars have a larger parallax. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their actual density in space is uniform. So the number density (stars per volume) is constant.

Wait, but parallax relates to distance, so I need to relate the number of stars to the parallax. Let me think in terms of volume and parallax.

Parallax (plx) is related to distance (d) by the formula plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / (d in parsecs). So d = 1 / plx.

Now, if I consider a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, what is the corresponding range in distance? Since d = 1/plx, a small change in plx (dplx) would correspond to a change in distance. Let me compute that.

Let me denote plx as p for simplicity. So p = 1/d. Then, dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = -d² dp. Since d is 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. But the negative just indicates the direction of change, so the range in distance is proportional to (1/p²) dp.

Wait, I'm trying to find the number of stars between p and p + dp. So in terms of distance, that would be from d to d - delta_d, because as p increases, d decreases. But for small dp, the distance change is approx delta_d = (1/p²) dp.

The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness delta_d is 4π d² delta_d. Since the number density of stars is uniform, say n stars per cubic parsec, then the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π d² delta_d.

Substituting delta_d = (1/p²) dp, and since d = 1/p, then:

Number of stars dN =
