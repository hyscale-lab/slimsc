Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to how much light a planet absorbs and how much it radiates back. The formula, I think, is something like T = T_star * ( (L/L_sun) / (a^2) )^(1/4), but wait, maybe I mixed something up. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is T = T_eff (star) * ( (1 - albedo) / (2) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 / a) )^(1/2), where a is the orbital distance.

Wait, but wait, the question says the planets are in orbital resonance and their periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 has 2*P1, Planet_3 2.5*P1, Planet_4 3.5*P1, and Planet_5 5*P1.

But we're comparing Planet_4 and Planet_2. So their periods are P4 = 3.5 P1, P2 = 2 P1.

Since the orbits are circular, I can assume Kepler's third law applies, which says that P^2 is proportional to a^3. So a = ( G*M*P^2 / (4π²) )^(1/3), but in terms of proportionality, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So the ratio of their distances will be (P4 / P2)^(2/3).

So P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75. So a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute that. 1.75 is 7/4, so (7/4)^(2/3). Hmm, cube root of (7²)/(4²) = cube root of 49/16. Let me approximate that.

Cube root of 49 is about 3.65, because 3.65^3 is about 48.6, close to 49. Cube root of 16 is about 2.52, since 2.52^3 is around 16. So 3.65 / 2.52 ≈ 1.448. So a4 is about 1.448 times a2. So a4 is larger than a2, which makes sense since P4 is longer.

Now, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So T is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2). So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2).

Wait, because T is inversely proportional to a^(1/2), so T4 = T2 * (a2 / a4)^(1/2).

So substituting a4/a2 = 1.448, so a2/a4 = 1/1.448 ≈ 0.691. Taking the square root of that gives sqrt(0.691) ≈ 0.831.

Wait, so T4 is about 0.831 * T2. So the ratio of Planet4's temperature to Planet2's would be approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait! The question says the same albedo. So the (1 - albedo)/2 term is the same for both. So the only factor is the distance. So our calculation should hold.

So looking at the options, C is ~0.83. But wait, let me double-check the exponents. Because the period ratio is 3.5/2, so a4/a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3). Let me compute (3.5/2) = 1.75. 1.75^(2/3). Let me think of 1.75 as (7/4). So (7/4)^(2/3) is same as (7^2)^(1/3) / (4^2)^(1/3) ) = (49)^(1/3) / (16)^(1/3). 49^(1/3) is about 3.65, 16^(1/3) is about 2.5198. 3.65/2.5198 ≈ 1.448.

So a4 is 1.448 times a2. Therefore, a2/a4 = 1/1.448 ≈ 0.691. Square root is 0.831.

So the ratio T4/T2 is 0.831, so the answer would be option C, which is ~0.83.

Wait, but let me think if I made
