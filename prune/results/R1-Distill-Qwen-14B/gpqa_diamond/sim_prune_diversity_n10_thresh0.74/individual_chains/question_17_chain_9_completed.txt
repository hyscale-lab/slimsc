Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on EDTA complexes, but let me think through this.

The problem says we have a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex without any issues. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects much here. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. They're asking for the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, so when EDTA complexes with a metal ion like Ca²+, the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- or something like that. The K for the complex formation is the formation constant, Kf, which is given as 5e10.

Wait, I think I should write the formation reaction. Let me get that right. EDTA is usually in the form H4Y, but under high pH, it's deprotonated to Y^4-. The reaction is Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²−. The formation constant Kf is given by [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4-}).

So in this case, the solution has the complex CaY²− at a concentration of 0.02 M. But wait, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaY²−] = 0.02 M.

But we're supposed to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. So we can use the formation constant equation to find [Ca²+].

Wait, but the K is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low, right? Because most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex.

So the formation constant equation is Kf = [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][Y^4−] )

But wait, in this solution, I'm assuming that all the Ca is in the form of the complex. So initially, the solution has 0.02 M CaY²−. But EDTA might come from another source? Or is the solution only containing the complex?

Wait, if the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, then that's the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA in solution. Because the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but no, the complex is CaY²−, so when it dissociates, it gives Ca²+ and Y^4−. So in solution, we have [CaY²−] = 0.02 M, and some small concentrations of [Ca²+] and [Y^4−].

But wait, the total concentration of EDTA is not just [Y^4−], because the complex also contains EDTA. Let's think about it.

The total EDTA comes from the complex and the free Y^4−. But wait, in a solution that's only the complex, the EDTA is part of the complex. So the total EDTA species would be [Y^4−] + [CaY²−]. But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, so perhaps the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the rest is the free ions.

But in this case, the EDTA comes only from the complex dissociation. So I need to write the equilibrium expression.

Let me define the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions. Then, the concentration of Y^4− would also be x because each Ca²+ releases one Y^4− from the complex. So [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4−] = x, and [CaY²−] = 0.02 - x. But wait, since Kf is so large (5e10), x should be really small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So 5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / 5e10 → x² = 2e-12 → x = sqrt(2e-12) ≈ 4.47e-6 M.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are: A) 2e-2, B)5e-3, C)6.3e-7, D)1e-2.

Hmm, none of these are around 4.5e-6. So maybe I made a mistake in my assumptions.

Wait, perhaps I missed that the initial concentration is only the complex. So [CaY²−] is 0.02 M, and the solution is in equilibrium. So the formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + Y^4− ↔ CaY²−, Kf = 5e10.

So at equilibrium, [CaY²−] = 0.02, [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4−] = y.

But since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4−, the total moles from the complex would be x = [Ca²+], and y = [Y^4−]. So, Kf = [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][Y^4−} ) → 5e10 = 0.02/(x*y).

But wait, in the solution, the only source of Y^4− is the dissociation of the complex. So initially, the solution has 0.02 M CaY²−. Upon dissociation, each mole gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y^4−. So, the total Y^4− is y, and the total Ca²+ is x.

But wait, the initial concentration of EDTA is the same as the concentration of the complex. So, the total EDTA species = [Y^4−] + [CaY²−] = y + 0.02.

But perhaps in this case, y is much smaller than 0.02, so [Y^4−] ≈ y = x.

So, Kf = 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10 → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → x^2 = 2e-13 → x = sqrt(2e-13) ≈ approx 4.47e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 4.47e-7. Let's calculate that: sqrt(2e-13) is sqrt(2)*1e-6.5 → wait, sqrt(2) is ~1.414, so 1.414 * 1e-6.5 is approximately 1.414e-6.5 is about 4.47e-7.

So x ≈ 4.47e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. Hmm, close but not exactly the same. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me recalculate.

Kf = [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][Y^4−} )

Assuming [Ca²+] = [Y^4−} ] = x, then:

5e10 = 0.02/(x * x) → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → 2e-6.5 is 2/(1e6.5) → 1e6.5 is 3.16e6, so 2/3.16e6 ≈ 6.32e-7. Oh! So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Ah, that's about 6.3e-7, which matches option C.

Wait, why did I get a different number before? Oh, I think I messed up the exponents earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2e-2) /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → because sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5.

So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7, which is 6.3e-7, which is option C.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the formation constant \( K_f \), which is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaY}^{2-}, \quad K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

### Assumptions:
1. The concentration of the complex \([\text{CaY}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M.
2. The dissociation of the complex into \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) is small due to the large \( K_f \), so \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x\), and \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02\) M.

### Step 1: Substitute into the equilibrium expression
\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]
\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( x \)
\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]
\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]
\[
x \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Conclusion:
The concentration of free calcium ions \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
