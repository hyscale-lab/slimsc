Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, let me read the question again.

Alright, we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about what the different β values correspond to. I think βn is the stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^0, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or maybe I have the charges wrong, but I think the key is that each βn represents the formation of a complex with n SCN- ligands.

So, the problem is about finding the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. So that's the β2=40 case. We need to calculate the fraction of Co that's in the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ form relative to all possible forms.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with stability constants and multiple complexes, we can model the distribution of the metal species using these constants. The general approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, each time using the previous concentration.

Let me think about the steps. The initial concentration of Co^2+ is 1e-2 M, and SCN^- is 0.1 M, which is quite high. The stability constants are given in order, so I think the complexes form in a sequence where each β is for adding another SCN- to the previous complex.

So, for each complex, the concentration can be found by multiplying the previous concentration by β and the ratio of [SCN^-] to the appropriate factor. Let's model this.

I think the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the free Co^2+ ion. The total concentration of all Co species is the sum of all these fractions times the initial concentration.

Wait, but another way is to consider the fraction of each complex as a function of the overall formation constants and the ligand concentration.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Define the possible complexes and their stability constants.
   - Co^2+ (free ion)
   - [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1) with β1 =9
   - [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (n=2) with β2=40
   - [Co(SCN)_3]^0 (n=3) with β3=63
   - [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (n=4) with β4=16

Wait, wait— stability constants are cumulative. Each βn is the equilibrium constant for the nth step. So, the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, no, actually, I think each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. For example, β1 is [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]), β2 is [Co(SCN)_2^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2), and so on.

So, the formation of each complex is a stepwise process. But for the distribution, we can think of each complex as being formed from the previous one. The concentrations of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration.

Alternatively, the fraction of each complex can be found using the stepwise formation constants, but I might be mixing things up a bit.

Another approach is to consider each complex in terms of the overall formation constants
