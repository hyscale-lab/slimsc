Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident about all the details, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Let's read the question again. It's about a series of reactions, and the question is about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups, right. I remember that these relate to the point groups in molecular symmetry.

So, let's break down the reactions given. The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, C reacting with water reforms A and produces two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. Lastly, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Wait, the key here is to figure out what each of these compounds is. Let's see. Let's try to identify A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

Starting with reaction one: A + 8 B → C. Since B is a gas and reacts with A in 8 equivalents, maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2 or something. Let's think about reactions that form bright red products. Oh, maybe C is something like SO3 or another compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal compound. Wait, solid A reacting with a gas—could A be a metal?

Wait, another thought: if C is a compound that when reacted with water gives back A and two acids, one strong and one weak. So, perhaps C is a salt. Let's think: when a salt reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into a metal hydroxide and an acid. So, if C is a salt of a weak base and a strong acid, maybe. Wait, but let's think about the products. F is strong, G is weak.

So, if C is something like NaNO3 or another nitrate. Wait, but when C reacts with water, maybe it forms a metal hydroxide and a nitric acid? Wait, nitric acid is a strong acid, but if the other acid is weak, then perhaps the salt comes from a strong acid and a weak base. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate or another salt. Let me think about the reactions.

Wait, let's think about product E. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of D, E is formed. E is extremely hazardous. Hmm. E could be something like phosgene (but that's more from CO), or perhaps a cyanide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is something like SO2 or NO2, but those are gases. Wait, but D is a gas as well.

Wait, let me think about the reaction where D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, etc. But D and B reacting 1:1... Hmm. Let's say B is O2. Then D could be something else. Wait, but if B is O2, then D plus O2 forms H as a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: If H is a solvent, maybe it's a common one like ethanol. But how would D and B combine to make ethanol? That would require D to be something like CO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe H is something like HCl or another acid, but that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, H could be something like H2O, but that's a product of another reaction. Wait, perhaps H is something like NH3, but again, not sure. Wait, maybe D is a gas that when reacts with B (like Cl2) gives HCl, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, not likely.

Wait, perhaps D is Cl2 and B is something else. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2, but reacting 1:1 would form H2O, which is a solvent. Ah, that's a possibility. So, D is H2 gas, B is O2. Then, D + B → H2
