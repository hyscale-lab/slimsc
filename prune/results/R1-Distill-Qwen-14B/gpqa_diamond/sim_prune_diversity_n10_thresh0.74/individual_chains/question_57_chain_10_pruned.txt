Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me some phase shifts: δ0 is 90 degrees, δ1 is 67, δ2 is 55, δ3 is 30, and δ4 is 13. They say to ignore the rest, so I guess I only consider up to δ4. The energy is 50 MeV electrons, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) can be expressed in terms of partial waves. Oh right, the formula is something like f = sum over l of ( (2l+1)/(4π) ) * ( e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ) * ( ( (1 - cosθ)/(2) )^l ) * e^{i l φ} ). But wait, since the problem asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, wait, along the beam direction, which would be θ=0 degrees, right? Because the beam is going along the z-axis, so scattering angle θ=0 would mean the same direction as before. But wait, in scattering, the amplitude at θ=0 is different, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the phase shifts are given. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. I think the imaginary part is given by (1/(2k)) times the sum over l
