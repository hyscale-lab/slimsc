Okay, let's try to work through this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

So the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So the electron's gamma is 4, the positron's gamma is 2. Since they're moving towards each other, their velocities are opposite directions.

First, I think I should calculate their energies. Because when they annihilate, energy needs to be conserved. But wait, electrons and positrons have rest mass, so their total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies.

The rest mass energy of an electron is m*c². For an electron and positron, each has the same mass. So the electron's total energy is gamma * m c², same for the positron. So let's compute their energies.

Gamma for electron is 4, so energy E_e = 4 m c². Positron gamma 2, so E_p = 2 m c². So total energy is 4 + 2 = 6 m c².

Wait, but wait a second. Since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is opposite the electron's. So when calculating total momentum, I have to consider their directions.

Momentum p_e for electron is gamma m v. Similarly for positron, p_p is gamma m v_p. But their velocities are in opposite directions. So let me think in terms of vectors.

Wait, but to calculate momentum, maybe I should use relativistic momentum formula. Remember, p = gamma m v. But I can also write p = gamma m u, where u is the velocity vector.

Alternatively, since I know gamma, maybe I can find beta (v/c), and then calculate the momentum in terms of beta and gamma.

Beta is v/c. So for the electron, gamma is 4, so gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_e²). Let me solve for beta_e.

Gamma_e =
