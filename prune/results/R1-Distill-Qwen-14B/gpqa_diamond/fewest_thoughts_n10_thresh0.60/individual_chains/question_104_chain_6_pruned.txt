Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's motion towards or away from us.

The question says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to our Sun. Each has a planet, both Neptune-like in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the stars are identical, and the planets are similar in mass but different in the RV signal.

The RV shifts are given: planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 caused 7 milliangstrom. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the RV method gives us the velocity of the star, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Let me think about the formula. From what I remember, the RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) )? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me recall the correct formula.

Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(2/3) ) ) ] * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) )

But wait, when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, which is usually the case, M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1. And since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the equation simplifies.

So, the simplified formula for K when e=0 and M_p << M_* is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe
