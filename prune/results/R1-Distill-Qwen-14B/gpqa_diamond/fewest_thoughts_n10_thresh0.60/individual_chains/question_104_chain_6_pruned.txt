Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. The question involves exoplanets detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star move slightly.

So, the setup is that two stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet, both with masses like Neptune. So their masses are similar, but the RV measurements are different. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods. They ask how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1.

I think the key here is understanding the relationship between the RV signal and the planet's orbital period. The RV method detects the velocity of the star's movement towards and away from us. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is what's measured here, right? The shift in the spectral line corresponds to the star's velocity.

I remember that the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P/(2π)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, I think there's a simpler way when considering that both stars have the same mass and the planet masses are similar. Since both planet masses are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun's mass, M_planet << M_star. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, which is the same for both stars. So that part cancels out in the ratio.

So the formula for K (the velocity semi-amplitude) is approximately proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ). Wait, maybe I should think about the formula again.

The correct formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ] / ( (P/(2π)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, I think another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2
