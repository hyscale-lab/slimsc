Okay, I'm trying to tackle this quantum field theory problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. So the question is about a Lagrangian given by L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The question is asking about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

Hmm, right. I remember that in QFT, the mass dimension of a coupling constant helps determine renormalizability. The theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimensions. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the interaction terms must have coupling constants with mass dimension less than or equal to 4 (since in 4 spacetime dimensions). Because each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4 (since the action is dimensionless, and the integral is d^4x, which is dimension 4).

So, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So, the term L_int must have [L_int]_M = 4. Let's figure out the dimensions of each part.

The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So, let's break it down.

First, what's the dimension of ψ?
