Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A, and it forms 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, when ketones react with cyanide ions, I remember that a nucleophilic addition usually happens. But wait, what conditions are needed for that? Oh right, the cyanide ion is a nucleophile, so the ketone would undergo nucleophilic addition.

Wait, but ketones typically form enolates when treated with strong bases, but in this case, the reagent is NaCN. So maybe it's a simple addition. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, but when you have a ketone reacting with a cyanide, under certain conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. Right, the formation of a cyanohydrin involves adding HCN to the carbonyl group. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, the reaction would be butan-2-one reacting with NaCN to form a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but the product in the first reaction is that, right. So how does this happen? The reaction is between the ketone and the cyanide. But the presence of an acid catalyst is usually involved. Because the CN- is a weak nucleophile? Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the cyanide acting as a base, but in this scenario, maybe acid is needed.

Wait, so in the formation of cyanohydrin, you usually have an acid catalyst. For example, HCN is a weak acid, but in the presence of a stronger acid, it can protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. So, perhaps the reaction of butan-2-one with NaCN in the presence of an acid like H3O+ would form the cyanohydrin. So that would make reagent A as H3O+.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A and B have A as H3O+. So that's possible. Now, what about the second reaction?

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For example, under strong acidic conditions with H2O, heating, and maybe some catalyst, the nitrile can be converted to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, in basic conditions, it might form a sodium salt which is then acidified.

Wait, but the reagent B is given as H2O, along with B. So the reaction is probably a hydrolysis. The reagents in the second step are B and H2O. So what is B here?

So, nitrile hydrolysis can be done in acidic or basic conditions. Let's think about the conditions. For example, using a strong acid like HCl with H2O and heat can hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using a base like NaOH and H2O would give a carboxylate, which upon acidification gives the carboxylic acid.

Wait, the product is the carboxylic acid, so perhaps the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions. So reagent B would be an acid, like HCl.

Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl. Option C has B as HCl as well. So let's see.

Wait, but what's the reaction in the second step? The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is becoming a COOH group. So that's a hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

So the conditions for that would usually involve strong acid and heat. So reagent B would be HCl. Because in the presence of H2O and HCl, the nitrile would undergo hydrolysis to the acid.

So for the second step, reagent B should be HCl. Looking back at the options, let's see which options have A and B as H3O+ and HCl respectively.

Looking at the options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So if A is H3O+ for the first reaction and B is HCl for the second, option A would be correct.

But wait, another thought: in the first reaction, is the reagent A H3O+ or something else? Because the reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, and the product is a cyanohydrin. So the reaction would proceed via acid catalysis. So H3O+ is the acid, which would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, allowing the CN- to attack.

So the first step uses H3O+ (like HCl, maybe?), and the second uses HCl. So option A would have A as H3O+ and B as HCl.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, for the first step, perhaps the reagent is NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ and SO3^- (sulfate). But I'm not sure about that. Does the cyanohydrin formation require an acid like H3O+ or can it be another acid?

Wait, I think that the acid used for cyanohydrin formation is typically a strong acid. So H3O+ (like from H2SO4 or HCl) is common. So reagent A would be H3O+.

So looking at the options, option A and B have A as H3O+. Option A has B as HCl, and option B has B as acetic acid.

But the second reaction requires B to be HCl because it's a hydrolysis to the acid. So option A has B as HCl.

But wait, another angle: what is the first reagent? In the first reaction, butanone + NaCN with A gives the cyanohydrin. So the reagent could be H3O+ (so option A or B) or NaHSO3 (option C and D). Wait, does the formation of cyanohydrin require HCN? Or is it a direct addition of CN-?

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So the mechanism is that the CN- acts as a nucleophile. But for the addition, the carbonyl group is activated. So in the presence of an acid catalyst, H+ would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack.

So the acid catalyst is necessary. So the reagent A is an acid, like H3O+. So in the options, A and B have A as H3O+.

But the second reaction, as discussed, needs B to be HCl. So then option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

So the correct option would be option A.

Wait but wait, let me think about the second reaction again. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So after hydrolysis, we get 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid.

The conditions for this conversion are typically hydrolysis with strong acid, like HCl, in H2O under heat, or sometimes with a base followed by acid workup. But in this case, the reagent is B and H2O. So if B is HCl, then it's an acidic hydrolysis.

So the option where B is HCl would be correct.

Thus, looking back at the options, the first part needs H3O+ (so A is H3O+), and the second part needs HCl (B is HCl). So option A matches that.


The problem involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. 

1. **First Reaction**: The reaction of butan-2-one with NaCN and reagent A produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin. For this reaction, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for CN⁻ to attack. The acid catalyst is identified as H₃O⁺ (from HCl or similar strong acids).

2. **Second Reaction**: The reaction of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B and H₂O produces 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions, and HCl is a suitable reagent for this transformation.

From the options provided:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it does not provide the necessary acid catalysis for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
