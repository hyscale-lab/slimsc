Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see what the question is.

So, there's this uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. Now, the question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and from the cavity's center, it's at a distance l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, and the angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions. I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges inside cavities, the concept of electrostatic shielding or the method of images might come into play. Wait, but since the conductor is uncharged, I think the charges inside the cavity might induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part near the cavity) must have an induced -q charge because the conductor must remain neutral overall. But wait, the conductor is neutral, so putting a charge inside the cavity would cause the inner surface to have an induced charge equal and opposite to q. So the inner surface would have -q. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out, right? Because the total charge of the conductor before was zero; putting +q inside the cavity would require the conductor to have a net charge, but wait no, the conductor was uncharged. Wait, no. Let's think again.

No, the conductor is a conductor, so any excess charge would reside on the outer surface. But wait, in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged. When you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the cavity is inside the conductor, so the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor must remain neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Wait no, because conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surface charges. So if the conductor was neutral, and the inner surface has -q, then the outer must have +q so that the total is zero. Hmm, but wait, that might not be correct. Oh wait, no. Because the conductor was uncharged. So if the inner surface has -q, then the outer surface must have +q to keep the conductor's net charge zero. Because the conductor's total charge is the sum of the inner and outer surface charges. So conductor's charge is (inner) -q + (outer) +q = 0. So yes, that makes sense.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at point P would be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, right? Because the electric fields inside the conductor (the material) are zero. So for a point outside, we can consider the conductor as a shell with charge +q on the outside.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere. Wait, the conductor itself is a sphere of radius R, and the cavity is inside, radius r. But the charge in the cavity is +q. So the inner surface of the conductor (cavity's wall) must have an induced -q. Then, since the conductor's total charge was zero, the outer surface must have +q.

So the conductor behaves as if it has a charge +q on the outer surface. So, for any point outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center. So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because for a sphere, the field outside is like a point charge at the center.

Wait, but wait. The conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R. So any point outside, regardless of where it is, the field would be as if the charge is at the center. So in this case, P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That makes option B look correct because option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². But wait, let me look at the options again.

Option B is exactly that. Option D is q / l². Hmm, but why would l be involved? Oh, because the charge is placed off-center in the cavity, but when considering the external field, the conductor's induced charges redistribute to ensure that the external field is same as a point charge at the center. So regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity, the external field depends only on the distance from the conductor's center.

Wait, but there's a catch here. Because the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, which is offset by s from the conductor's center. So, the geometry might affect the field. But wait, no. Because the conductor's induced charges will arrange themselves such that the field inside the conductor (and outside) behaves as if the charge is at the center of the conductor, regardless of where the internal charge is placed. So the field outside only depends on the distance from the conductor's center.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The cavity is off-center, so the charge is at a point that's a distance s from the conductor's center. So the induced charges on the inner surface of the conductor would be such that the field inside the conductor is zero. But the presence of the charge inside the cavity, which is off-center, would cause the inner surface to have an induced charge distribution that's not spherically symmetric. But the outer surface would then have a charge distribution that is spherically symmetric, as the conductor allows charge to move freely. So the field outside would be as if the charge is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, because any internal displacement of the charge within the cavity would cause the inner surface to have a non-uniform charge distribution, but the outer surface would still be uniform because the conductor's material allows charges to move, ensuring that the outer surface is symmetric. So the total charge on the outer surface is +q, and it's uniformly distributed. So the external field would be as if the charge is at the center.

So for point P, which is outside the conductor, the electric field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

So looking at the options, option B is exactly that. Let me check the other options:

Option A: It's (l - s cosθ) squared. That would come into play if the field was due to the point charge inside the cavity, without considering the induced charges. But the point P is outside the conductor, so the field is due to the outer induced charge, not the inner charge.

Option C: (l + s cosθ)^2... Hmm, not sure, but again, that's more like a field calculation considering the displacement of the charge, but perhaps as part of image charges.

Option D: 1/(4πε₀) * q / l². That would be the case if the field was from the charge inside the cavity, but without considering the conductor's effect. But in reality, the conductor's outer surface charge creates the field outside, which depends on L, not l.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor remains neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$ to balance the system.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor. The induced charges on the inner surface do not contribute to the external field because their effects cancel out outside the conductor. Thus, the electric field at any point outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Field at Point $P$**:  
   The point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Using the formula for the electric field due to a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which might describe the field due to the charge inside the cavity if there were no conductor. However, this does not apply here because the field outside the conductor is determined by the outer surface charge, not the internal charge distribution.  
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived expression for the field outside the conductor, as it depends only on $L$, the distance from the center of the conductor to $P$.  
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the external field.  
   - **Option D**: Suggests the field depends on $l$, the distance from the cavity's center to $P$. This would only be valid if the field were due to the charge inside the cavity, but the conductor's outer surface charge dominates the external field.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as the electric field at $P$ is determined by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center.

Answer: B
