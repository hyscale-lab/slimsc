Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. The question gives a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in the qubit space.

The given density matrix ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out in matrix form to visualize it better. The standard basis states |0> and |1> are [1,0] and [0,1] respectively. So, |0><0| would be a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0 on the diagonal, and |1><1| would be diagonal with 0 and 1. Adding them together gives:

|0><0| + |1><1| = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]

So when I multiply by 1/2, the density matrix becomes:

ρ = (1/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]] = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on how density matrices relate to geometrical positions in qubit space. Oh right, for a single qubit, the space is a Bloch sphere, right? The density matrix can be represented as a point on this sphere, or inside it for mixed states.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is:

ρ = [[a, b], [c, d]]

But it must satisfy certain conditions. For a valid density matrix, the trace should be 1 (which it is here, since 1/2 + 1/2 = 1), and it should be positive semi-definite (all eigenvalues non-negative). Our ρ has eigenvalues 1/2 and 1/2, so it's a valid density matrix.

The Bloch sphere representation is for pure states, but this ρ is a mixed state because it's a probabilistic mixture of |0> and |1> states. Wait, no, actually, the given ρ is a diagonal matrix with equal probabilities on |0> and |1>, which is a mixed state, not a pure state.

Wait, but how do you represent a mixed state on the Bloch sphere? I think the Bloch sphere is for pure states, and mixed states are represented as points inside the sphere. Or perhaps as statistical mixtures of pure states on the sphere.

Alternatively, I remember the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. The general density matrix for a single qubit can be expressed as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2

Where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). So let's expand that.

The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So,

(I + r·σ) / 2 = (1/2) * [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
                          [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ]

Wait, let me compute that. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So I + r·σ would be:

[[1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
 [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z]]

Divided by 2, that becomes:

[[ (1 + r_z)/2, (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
 [ (r_x + i r_y)/2, (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

Compare this with our given ρ:

ρ = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]

So let's set the elements equal.

From the (1,1) element: (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2
From the (2,2) element: (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2

So both equations:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → same result, r_z=0.

Now look at the off-diagonal elements. Our ρ has 0s there. The off-diagonal elements of the general form are (r_x - i r_y)/2 and (r_x + i r_y)/2. So setting them equal to 0:

(r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). That's the origin in the Bloch sphere, which makes sense because the state is a completely mixed state. For a pure state, the Bloch vector would have length 1, but for a maximally mixed state, it's at the origin.

Now looking at the options:

Option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. A general single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector. Expanding this, we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \( \rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \), we match the elements:

1. From the (1,1) element: \( \frac{1 + r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \), which gives \( r_z = 0 \).
2. From the (2,2) element: \( \frac{1 - r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \), which also gives \( r_z = 0 \).
3. From the off-diagonal elements: \( \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} = 0 \) and \( \frac{r_x + i r_y}{2} = 0 \), which imply \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents the maximally mixed state.

From the options provided:

- **A)** \( r = (1,1,0) \): Incorrect, as this does not match the derived Bloch vector.
- **B)** \( r = (0,0,1) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state, not the maximally mixed state.
- **C)** \( r = (0,0,0) \): Correct, as this matches the derived Bloch vector.
- **D)** \( r = (1,1,1) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

The correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix represents the maximally mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
