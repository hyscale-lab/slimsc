Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. Let's look at the options again.

Option a says it's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? Because Earth is mostly rock and metal, so that's what I remember.

Option b is a planet with twice Earth's mass and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but if the density is already given as 5.5, that's the same as Earth. But wait, mass is twice Earth's. So if density is same, then the radius must have adjusted accordingly. Because density (d) = mass (m) / volume (V), and volume is (4/3)πr³. So if mass doubles, and density stays same, radius would increase by cube root of 2. So radius would be a bit larger than Earth. But the question is about density, so this one has density 5.5, same as Earth.

Option c: same composition as Earth but five times more massive. Wait, same composition implies same density? Because density is based on what it's made of. So if it's same composition, density should be the same as Earth. So if Earth has density 5.5, then this would too. But wait, Earth's mass is about 5.97e24 kg. If this planet is five times Earth's mass, same density, so radius would be larger. But since the question is about density, this one also has 5.5.

Option d: same composition as Earth, but half the mass. If same composition, same density. So again 5.5. But wait, mass is half, so radius would be smaller. But density remains same.

Wait, but now I look back. Option b says it's a planet with 2 Earth masses and density approximately 5.5. So same as Earth's density. So all options a, b, c, d, except perhaps a, have same or similar?

Wait no, option a is Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So its density is same as Earth, which is 5.5. So all the options except maybe some have same density. But wait, let me read the options again.

Wait, option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius.
