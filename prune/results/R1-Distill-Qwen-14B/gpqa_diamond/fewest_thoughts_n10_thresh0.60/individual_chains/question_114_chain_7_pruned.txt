Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to find the suitable reagents for each step. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving choices for reagents A and B.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (with H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I need to find what A and B are. The options are combinations of H3O+, NaHSO3, HCl, and CH3COOH.

Let me tackle the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN and another reagent A, it forms 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I think this is a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Wait, but butanone is a ketone. Oh wait, wait, NaCN is a nucleophile, but ketones are not as reactive as aldehydes towards nucleophilic addition. Unless it's under certain conditions.

Wait, maybe it's a substitution. But butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If it's reacting with NaCN, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition followed by something else. Alternatively, maybe the CN- is acting as a nucleophile in a substitution, but butanone isn't a good substrate for SN2 because of the carbonyl group. But wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, perhaps this is a condensation reaction? Or maybe it's an example of the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Ah, right! Cyanohydrin formation. That's when a ketone reacts with CN- in a base to form a cyanohydrin. So the reaction is (CH3)2CO + CN- → (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

But wait, how does that work? Cyanohydrin formation typically occurs under basic conditions. The mechanism involves the attack of the cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon, followed by deprotonation. But in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Because butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but wait, wait. Let me draw the structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO.

Cyanohydrin formation would add a CN group and a hydroxyl group to the same carbon. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Because the formula is CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-? Wait no, wait. Let me think. The product's IUPAC name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when we form a cyanohydrin, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. Because the chain would be three carbons: the central C has two CH3, OH, and CN groups. So maybe the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the question says butanenitrile. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, wait. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons.
