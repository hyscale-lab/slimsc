Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about selecting the suitable reagents for two reactions. Hmm, okay, let me read through it again.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct reagents from the options A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let me break it down into the two reactions.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure of butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with a nitrile, what's the typical reaction?

Oh right! I remember that the nucleophilic addition to ketones can happen. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. But wait, under what conditions does this addition occur? Maybe it's a basic condition?

Wait, no. Or wait, another thought—maybe it's a hydrocyanation reaction? Or could it be a substitution? No, substitution doesn't seem right here because ketones don't typically undergo SN reactions.

Wait no, the product has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would presumably add to the carbonyl group. So the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be NC-C(CH3)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait no—let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile has four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2
