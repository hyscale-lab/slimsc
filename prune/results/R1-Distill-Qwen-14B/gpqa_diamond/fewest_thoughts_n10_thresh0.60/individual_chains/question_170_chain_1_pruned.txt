Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4), and they've provided the sigma_y matrix. Hmm, I remember sigma matrices are related to Pauli matrices, which are used in spin operators.

Wait, the state is given as a vector (3i, 4). So that's a two-component spinor. Right, because electrons are spin-1/2 particles, their spin states are represented by two-component vectors. The spin operator S along y is given by (ħ/2) multiplied by sigma_y, right? Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±ħ/2.

So sigma_y is the matrix:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

And S_y would be (ħ/2) times this matrix. Now, the expectation value is given by the bra-ket notation: <ψ| S_y |ψ> divided by <ψ|ψ>, wait no, wait. Wait, expectation value is <S_y> = (ψ| S_y |ψ). But wait, no; the expectation value is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, multiplied by the state vector again. So for a vector ψ = [a, b], it's ψ† S_y ψ.

Wait, but wait, the state is (3i, 4), which is a column vector. So to compute <S_y>, I think the formula is ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ. Because S_y is an operator, and the expectation is the inner product.

So let me write down the steps. First, compute the conjugate transpose of the state vector. The state is [3i, 4], so the conjugate would be [-3i, 4], right? Because the conjugate of 3i is -3i (since (3i)* = -3i if we're using i as the imaginary unit, but wait, wait: actually, i is the imaginary unit, so (3i)* is -3i. Because (a + bi)* is a - bi. So 3i is 0 + 3i, so its conjugate is 0 -3i, which is -3i. Wait no, wait, (3i)* is -3i? No, wait, no. Wait, (3i)* is -3i, because the conjugate of i is -i. So 3i → 3*(-i) = -3i. Yes, that's right. So the conjugate of the vector is [-3i, 4], and the transpose would make it a row vector, so ψ† is [-3i, 4].

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]. Then, S_y is (ħ/2) * sigma_y. So let me compute ψ† sigma_y ψ, then multiply by ħ/2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute without the ħ/2 factor first and then include it at the end.

Let's compute ψ† sigma_y ψ. So sigma_y is the 2x2 matrix:

[0  -i
