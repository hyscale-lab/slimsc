Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators. But wait, what symmetries do these operators need to obey?

The question gives four options: Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The question is asking which of these must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Let me think about each symmetry. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Since SMEFT is a relativistic theory, Lorentz symmetry must definitely be respected. So any operator in SMEFT should transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. That means option 1 is a yes.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time). So if the theory already has Lorentz symmetry, does it automatically have Poincare? I think so. Because the generators for translations (momentum and energy) are part of the Poincare group. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. So if the SM respects Poincare, so does SMEFT. So option 2, Poincare, should also be respected.

CP symmetry is another matter. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry because of certain processes like kaon and B-meson oscillations. But in SMEFT, are all operators required to respect CP? Hmm, not necessarily. The SMEFT framework usually includes operators that can break CP because the Standard Model itself doesn't have CP conservation. So option 3 might not be required for all operators. Wait, but do the SMEFT operators have to be CP-symmetric? I think not. Because the effective operators can include terms that violate CP. So option 3 is probably not a must.

CPT symmetry is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and so does SMEFT because it's an effective theory built on top of the SM. So any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is a yes.

Wait, wait, but some sources I've read before said that in SMEFT, operators can violate CP but must respect CPT. So the operators don't have to preserve CP individually, but the overall theory must respect CPT. So, the operators themselves might violate CP, but when combined with others, the theory remains CPT invariant. Therefore, individual operators can break CP, but the whole theory doesn't. So option 3 is not a must; operators can violate CP, but CPT must be maintained.

So putting it all together: Operator must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. So the correct options are 1,2,4.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 1 and 2. But wait, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer is C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators must respect certain symmetries. Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is fundamental to relativistic theories, and since SMEFT is relativistic, all operators must respect it. Poincaré symmetry (option 2), which includes Lorentz symmetry and spacetime translations, is also automatically respected because SMEFT is built on the framework of the Standard Model, which already respects Poincaré symmetry.

CP symmetry (option 3), however, is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT. The Standard Model itself does not conserve CP symmetry, and SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP. Therefore, operators in SMEFT do not need to individually preserve CP symmetry. 

CPT symmetry (option 4), on the other hand, must be respected by the theory as a whole. While individual operators may violate CP, the overall theory remains CPT invariant. Thus, CPT symmetry is a required symmetry for SMEFT.

From this analysis, the symmetries that all operators in SMEFT must respect are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct answer is:

Answer: C
