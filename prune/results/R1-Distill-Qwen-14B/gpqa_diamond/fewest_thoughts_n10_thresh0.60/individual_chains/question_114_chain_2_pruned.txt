Okay, so I've got this question here about organic chemistry reactions, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question has two reactions. The first one is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (along with H2O) to form a carboxylic acid, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. Let me start by thinking about each reaction separately.

For the first reaction: butan-2-one is a ketone, right? And it's reacting with NaCN. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. So NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. But wait, ketones reacting with cyanide usually form cyanohydrins. A cyanohydrin is where the CN adds to the carbonyl, and OH (from water?) adds to the adjacent carbon. Wait, but where does the OH come from? Oh, maybe it's from water acting as a proton source or something.

Wait, but in the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me structure that. The starting material is (CH3)2CO (butan-2-one), which is (CH3)2C=O. When it reacts with CN-, it would form a cyanohydrin: (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, is that correct? Yes, because the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen picks up a proton, leading to the hydroxyl group.

So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The conditions needed for thatâ€”usually, you need an acid catalyst. Because the carbonyl is not very reactive without it. So the reagent A in the first reaction is likely an acid. The options given for A are H3O+ (which is HCl, H2SO4, etc.), NaHSO3, or other possibilities.

Wait, looking at the options for A: options A and B have H3O+; C and D have NaHSO3 as A. So which is correct?
