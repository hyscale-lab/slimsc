Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. And the options are A to D, each giving possible A and B reagents.

Hmm. Right, so I think this involves some kind of nucleophilic substitution or addition. Let me break it down.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The product's structure seems like it's a nitrile with a hydroxyl and methyl group on the same carbon. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. So when a ketone reacts with a nitrile, what happens?

Oh wait, maybe it's a condensation reaction. I think that when ketones react with something like a cyanide, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions
