Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read it again carefully.

The problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct pair.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when titrated with a strong base like NaOH, it forms its conjugate base, acetate. So the reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻ Na+ + H2O.

First, I think I need to calculate the initial concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and concentration 0.05 M. When we add another 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the dilution factor is 2 (since 20 +20 =40, which is double). So the new concentration would be 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait, when you mix two solutions, you have to consider the moles. Let me double-check that. Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L (20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles. Then, after adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, the titration part. The titrant is 0.1 M NaOH. So I need to find two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Let me think about the equivalence point first. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid present.

Moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001.

Volume of NaOH needed for equivalence: moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³.

So at equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution will contain sodium acetate as the solute. Sodium is a spectator ion, so the solution will be a solution of CH3COO⁻ in water. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, the solution will be basic. So pH should be greater than 7.

To find the pH at equivalence, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions and then find the pH using the Kb.

The acetate concentration comes from the sodium acetate,
