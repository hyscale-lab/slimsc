Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem is about titrating acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid like acetic acid, the pH changes because the concentration affects how much it dissociates. Also, during titration, especially with a strong base like NaOH, the equivalence point is where the moles of base equal the moles of acid.

Let me break this down into parts. First, let me find out the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution before titration. Then, I'll handle the 25% titration point and the equivalence point.

So, the initial solution is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting this with 20 mL of water makes the total volume 40 mL. Using the dilution formula, M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 mL) / 40 mL. Let me calculate that.

M2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = (1)/40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, 0.05 *20 is 1 millimole, divided by 40 mL gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but when you dilute a weak acid, does it dissociate more? Yes, because the concentration is lower, so the degree of dissociation increases, which would make the pH higher than before dilution. So initial pH of the diluted acetic acid is something I need to find, but the question is about 25% titration and equivalence point.

Next, titration with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's find out the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.

The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

Moles of acetic acid initially: volume is 40 mL, concentration 0.025 M. Moles = M * V (in liters). So 0.025 mol/L * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: same as moles of acetic acid, 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL.

So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

Now, the first part is the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the way to the equivalence point. Since the equivalence point is 10 mL, 25% is 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the equivalence point is 10 mL, so 25% would be 2.5 mL of NaOH added. Let me double-check. 25% of the total NaOH needed is 2.5 mL, yes.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, sodium acetate. So the solution is a buffer solution, a mixture of acetic acid and its conjugate base.

I should calculate the concentrations after adding 2.5 mL of NaOH. Let's find out how much acetic acid has reacted.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. So moles of acetic acid after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: same as moles of NaOH added, 0.00025 mol.

The total volume at this point is initial solution (40 mL) plus 2.5 mL NaOH: 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are
