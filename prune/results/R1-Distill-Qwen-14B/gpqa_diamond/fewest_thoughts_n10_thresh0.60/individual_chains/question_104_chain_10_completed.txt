Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So, the setups are pretty similar except for something related to the spectral line shifts.

Planet #1 has a spectral line shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's host shows a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravity making the star move. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by something like K = (v * sin i) / (1 + (M_p/M_*)) ), but wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and other parameters.

Wait, another approach: the RV method's measured velocity (K) depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit, and the star's mass. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, but the velocities (shifts) are different. Also, the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the orbital period? Or is it related to the orbital period in some way?

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The orbital period is the time the planet takes to orbit the star. The RV method measures how much the star moves in response to the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3) * ( sin i )

But since both planets are in circular orbits, e is 0, so the (1/(1-e²))^(1/2) term is 1. Also, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, which is about the mass of the Sun, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So, the formula simplifies.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, I think the formula for K can be written as:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) ) )^(something) ) * ( P/(2 pi) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, maybe another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because the formula for K involves the period P. Let me try to write the formula correctly.

The correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = [ ( (G * P) / (2 * pi * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]

Wait, maybe better to write the exact formula. Let me recall:

K = ( (G * (M_p) sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * ( (1/(2 pi)) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²))) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think of the relation between K and the orbital period P.

I remember that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because in the formula, P is in the denominator with an exponent of 1/3. So if K is smaller, that would imply a larger P, because as K decreases, P increases.

Wait, so if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then P2/P1 would be (K1/K2)^3.

Wait no, let me think again. Because K ∝ (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ), assuming M_p << M_*, which it is here since M_p is Neptune mass and M_* is solar.

So, K ∝ (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

But wait, the M_p is the same for both planets, as both have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p is same, M_* is same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, let's see. If K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), then K1 = A * (1/P1^(1/3)) ), K2 = A * (1/P2^(1/3)) ), where A is a proportionality constant.

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

But wait, wait. Let me rearrange. Let me write K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is the same for both because M_p and M_* are same.

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

We can rearrange this to find (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, let me see:

K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Dividing both equations:

K1/K2 = [ (C / P1^(1/3)) ] / [ (C / P2^(1/3)) ] = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So, P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, but wait, because if K is the semi-amplitude, and K1 is smaller than K2, then (K1/K2) <1, so (K1/K2)^3 <1, which would mean P2 < P1. But that doesn't make sense because if a planet causes a smaller RV shift, it could be because it's either less massive (but same here) or farther away (longer period) or orbital inclination, but inclination is same (sin i is same, assuming i is same for both, which the question doesn't say, but perhaps we assume i is same because the shifts are measured as up to 5 and 7... well, but the question doesn't mention inclination, so perhaps we can assume that it's the same for both, so sin i is same, so it can be neglected in the ratio.

So, in any case, from the formula, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

So, the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Given that K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7.

So, K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

Then, (5/7)^3 is (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So, P2/P1 ≈ 0.364.

Which means, P2 is approximately 0.36 times the period of P1. Or, in other words, planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, planet #2's period is shorter.

Wait, but the question is asking: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1?

So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's. So, it's shorter, not longer. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which is less than 1.

But the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. So, if P2 is shorter, the factor would be less than 1. But in the options, option A is ~0.36, which is the value we get.

Wait, but let me think again. K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, if K1 is smaller than K2, that implies that P1 is larger than P2. Because K decreases as P increases. So P1 > P2. So, P2 is shorter than P1. So, P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So, planet #2's period is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be option A, which is ~0.36.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So, the question asks how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1.

So, if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter, so the factor is 0.36 times, meaning it's about 0.36 times as long, so the period is 0.36 times as long. So the answer is A.

Wait, but wait, maybe I got the ratio the other way. Let me recalculate.

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So, K1 = K2 * (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, let's think of it as K is proportional to (M_p)/(P^(1/3) * M_*^(2/3))

So, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 =5/7.

So, 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

So, the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, it's shorter. So, how many times longer is it? It's 0.36 times as long. So, P2 is 0.36 * P1, meaning P2 is about 36% the length of P1. So, it's shorter. So, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, the factor is 0.36.

So the answer is option A.


The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given that both planets were detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging, the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's by a factor of ~0.36. 

The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Since \( P_2 \) is shorter than \( P_1 \), the factor is less than 1, and the correct answer is **A) ~0.36**.
