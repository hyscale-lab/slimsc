Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, I think I need to determine what reagents A and B are from the given options.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, or (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what's that product structure? Let me sketch it out.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, which I think is a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, ketones typically don't undergo nucleophilic substitution easily because the carbonyl group is electron-deficient, but in the presence of a strong acid, maybe? Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution where the carbonyl is converted into an enol, allowing the cyanide to attack.

Wait, but in the product, the ketone is converted into a
