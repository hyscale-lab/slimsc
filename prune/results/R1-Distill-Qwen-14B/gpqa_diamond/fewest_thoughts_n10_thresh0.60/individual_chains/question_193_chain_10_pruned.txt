Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. But wait, I think the exact formula is plx in arcseconds is equal to 1 parsec divided by the distance in parsecs. Oh right, plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to find N as a function of distance r. Let me write down what I know:

N ∝ 1/plx^5
But since plx = 1/d, substituting that in:

N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so it's the change in N with respect to r, not N itself. So, the number of stars per unit distance (maybe like a density) would be how N changes as you go from r to r+dr. 

Wait, that might be a bit more complicated.
