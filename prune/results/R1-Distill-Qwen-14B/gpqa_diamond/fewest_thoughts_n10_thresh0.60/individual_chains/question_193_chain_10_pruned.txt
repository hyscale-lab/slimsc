Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each with some power of r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. Parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. Wait, no, actually, parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So if the distance r increases, the parallax decreases.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx as 1/r, that would make N proportional to r^5. Because 1/(1/r)^5 is r^5. So N = k * r^5 where k is some constant.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes per unit range of distance. So maybe it's the differential, like dN/dr. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. But wait, the options don't have r^4 as an option for the overall change. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps
