Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me read the question again and think through it step by step.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian:

L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y)

Hmm, wait. I think the notation might be a bit confusing. The standard form for a Yukawa interaction is something like L = λ ψ̄ ψ X, where ψ is a fermion field. So maybe this Lagrangian is describing a Yukawa coupling between X and various fermions. The term λf would be a coupling constant for each fermion species f.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

Well, for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the energy of the fermions must be less than the mass of the boson. Since X is at rest when decaying, the total energy available is the mass of X. Each fermion must have energy at least equal to its rest mass. So for a decay into two particles, each must have energy less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV per particle). So the rest mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, but which particles have rest masses less than 3 GeV? Let me recall the masses of known fermions.

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). But wait, the top quark is really heavy, around 173 GeV, so way over 3 GeV. The bottom is about 4.5 GeV, also over 3. So the quarks that are allowed are u, d, s, c. Wait no, c is about 1.5 GeV, right? So that's under 3. So u, d, s, c quarks are possible.

But wait, can X decay into quark-antiquark pairs? Because in the Standard Model, bosons like the W and Z can decay into quarks if their masses are low enough. But X being a boson, perhaps a scalar, would decay into fermion pairs if the masses allow.

But wait, the Lagrangian's interaction term is given. The interaction term would determine which fermions are coupled to X. The term is proportional to λf times the fermion fields. So for each fermion type f, there's a coupling. So the X can decay into any fermion pair f f̄ provided the mass is sufficient.

So, X can decay into any fermion pair where the sum of their rest masses is less than or equal to X's mass. Since each is produced at rest, each must have mass m ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, no, the sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of X, because the rest mass is the minimal energy needed to produce them. So for X to decay into two particles, each must have m ≤ 3 GeV. So the combined rest mass is 2m ≤ 6 GeV, which is exactly X's mass. So the maximum allowed mass for each fermion is 3 GeV.

Which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV? Let me list the known fermions:

- Electron (e⁻): ~0.511 MeV → way under 3 GeV.
- Muon (μ⁻): ~105.7 MeV → under.
- Tau (τ⁻): ~1.78 GeV → under 3 GeV.
- Up quark (u): ~2.2 MeV → under.
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV → under.
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV → under.
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV → under.
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV → over 3 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way over.

So, the fermions allowed are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but in the options, I see things like b and t. But their masses are above 3 GeV, so X (6 GeV) can't decay into b or t quarks because each would require more than 3 GeV. So options mentioning b or t decays would be invalid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.
But b is ~4.5 GeV, so X can't decay into b bbar because each b is 4.5, which is more than 3 GeV. So Option A is wrong.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.
c is 1.5 GeV, which is allowed. So all these fermions are under 3 GeV. So this could be a possibility.

Option C: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.
But top quark is 173 GeV, way over. So decay into t tbar is not allowed. So Option C is wrong.

Option D: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.
Again, b is too heavy. So D is wrong.

Wait, but let me double-check. For a decay into a pair, the sum of the rest masses must be ≤ X's mass. For example, if X were 3 GeV, could it decay into two 1.5 GeV particles? Yes. So in this case, each fermion must have mass ≤3 GeV.

So the allowed fermion pairs are:

e⁺e⁻: yes, since 0.511 MeV each. Sum is ~1 MeV <<6 GeV.

mu⁺mu⁻: same, about 0.2 GeV each. So sum 0.4 GeV <6 GeV.

tau⁺tau⁻: each is ~1.78 GeV. So sum is ~3.56 GeV <6 GeV. So yes, allowed.

u and d quarks: each very light, so their sum is negligible.

s quarks: each about 100 MeV, sum 0.2 GeV, which is fine.

c quarks: each ~1.5 GeV, sum 3 GeV, which is exactly the limit. So allowed.

But what about the b quark? Each is ~4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So sum would be ~9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So decay into b and anti-b is not allowed.

So the allowed decay products are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. So looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all the allowed ones.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So the correct option is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the rest mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to half the boson's mass, i.e., \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This ensures that the total rest mass of the fermion pair does not exceed the boson's mass.

The rest masses of known fermions are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From this, the fermions with masses \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). Therefore, the boson \( X \) can decay into the following fermion pairs: \( e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \).

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because the bottom quark mass (\( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)) exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because the top quark mass (\( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) is far greater than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. Hence, this option is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \).

Answer: B
