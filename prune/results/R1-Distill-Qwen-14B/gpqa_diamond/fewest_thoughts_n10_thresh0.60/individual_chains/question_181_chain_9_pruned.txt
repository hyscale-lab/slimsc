Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that neutrinos are produced in various nuclear reactions in the Sun, especially the proton-proton chain. The question is about the pp-III branch suddenly stopping, and how that affects the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch again? I think the proton-proton (pp) chain is the main source of energy in the Sun, right? And it has several branches. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, I believe, producing a lot of high-energy neutrinos. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches, which are less significant. Oh wait, the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce lower-energy neutrinos compared to the others, maybe?

So the question says that the pp-III branch stops. All other reactions continue normally. We need to find the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, neutrinos from the pp chain... The main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos with higher energies, around 1-2 MeV, right? Because the reaction is something like two protons fusing into deuterium, and then emitting a positron and a neutrino. Those neutrinos are in the higher energy range.

The pp-II and pp-III branches produce lower energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, that would reduce the number of lower
