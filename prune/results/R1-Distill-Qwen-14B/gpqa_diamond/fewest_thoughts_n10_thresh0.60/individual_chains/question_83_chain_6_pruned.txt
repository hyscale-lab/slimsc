Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. Since we're mixing equal volumes of acetic acid and water, the new concentration should be half, right? But wait, wait. Let me calculate that properly.

The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding another 20 cm³. So the total volume is 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume. Oh, right! Molarity is in moles per liter. So 0.05 M is 0.05 moles per liter. The volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 liters. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. So the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base). The neutralization reaction would produce the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water. The reaction equation is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So I need to find out how much NaOH has been added and see how that affects the concentrations.

Wait, to find the point during titration, I should calculate the moles of acetic acid and the moles of NaOH added, and then see what's left.

So initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 moles (as calculated earlier).

At 25% titration, 25% of this has reacted. So moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of CH3COOH remaining would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles, and moles of CH3COO^- formed would be 0.00025 moles.
