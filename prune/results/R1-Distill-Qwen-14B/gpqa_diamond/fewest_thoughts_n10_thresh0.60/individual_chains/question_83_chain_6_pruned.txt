Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and titrations can get a bit tricky, but let's take it step by step. Alright, let me read the question again.

The question says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should figure out the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Oh right, because when you mix two solutions, the moles dilute. So the initial volume is 20 cm³ and the concentration is 0.05 M. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

Wait, wait, let me get that right. The initial solution is 20 cm³, then adding 20 cm³ water. So total volume is 40. So the new concentration would be (volume1 * conc1) / total volume. So (20 * 0.05)/40. Let me calculate that.

20 * 0.05 is 1 mmol (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, 0.02 * 0.05 = 0.001 mol, which is 1 mmol). Then dividing by 40 cm³ (0.04 liters) gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait a second. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. When you dilute to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of what volume? I think it refers to 25% of the equivalence point volume. So I'll need to find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point first, then take 25% of that.

Wait, but what's the equivalence point here? The equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present. So the initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 0.025 M = 0.025 mol/L, and 0.04 L is 40 mL. 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol. So the volume is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, during the titration, the acetic acid (CH3COOH) will react with NaOH (which provides OH- and Na+). The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So this is a classic acid-base titration. At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the mo
