Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

So the scenario is that I've synthesized a small peptidic compound, and I'm looking at its 1H NMR spectrum. The spectrum mostly matches what's expected, but there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts but roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. The question mentions that coupling isn't an issue because the coupling pattern rules that out. Also, when they did LC-MS at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass as expected.

Hmm, what could cause these observations? Let's think about each part.

First, the NMR part. Two peaks for the same proton. The integral adds up to 1H, so it's not like there's a splitting into multiple peaks due to coupling. But the question says coupling is ruled out. So maybe it's something else causing the splitting. Wait, but wait, if the two peaks are for the same proton, that doesn't make sense because each proton should appear as a single peak unless there's some kind of diastereotopic situation.

Wait, diastereotopic protons are a thing. They are in different environments but in the same molecule. For example, in a meso compound, you can have protons that are equivalent by symmetry but split into two peaks because the environments are different. But wait, in such cases, the integral would add up to the number of equivalent protons. So if it's the same H, but split into two, but that would usually be coupling, which is ruled out here.

Alternatively, maybe the compound isn't pure. Maybe it's a mixture of something else. Let's see the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, that would have a different molecular weight. But the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected molecule. So the mass is correct. So a precursor would have a higher mass, probably. So option A might not fit, unless the precursor has the same mass, which I don't think is possible in a typical synthesis. So maybe not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties except for optical activity
