Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Oh yeah, the formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a larger parallax means the star is closer. 

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed usually means that the number density is the same everywhere. But how does that translate when we're looking at the number per unit parallax?

Let me think. If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number of stars in a given volume is the same everywhere. So if I take a volume element, the number of stars in it depends on the size of the volume. 

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. So, for a small change in parallax, d plx, what's the corresponding change in distance d? Let's see. d plx = -d (1/d^2) dd. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differentiating plx with respect to d. Plx = 1/d, so d plx/d d = -1/d². So the change in plx is - (1/d²) times the change in d. Or maybe it's better to express the volume in terms of plx.

If I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume of that shell is 4πd² dd. Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional
