Okay, so I've got this question about stars' distribution in the sky and how their number per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me break this down.

Wait, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? Oh right, probably uniformly in space, meaning their density is the same throughout the volume. So, same number of stars per unit volume everywhere.

Parallax is a measure of distance. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Right, the formula is distance (d) in parsecs is 1 over parallax (d = 1/plx). So higher parallax means closer stars.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, how does N (number of stars) change with plx? Let's think about it.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume depends on the volume. The volume between two distances depends on those distances cubed? Wait, because volume is proportional to radius cubed. So, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd would be proportional to d² * dd. Because the surface area of a sphere is 4πr², so the number of stars in a shell is 4πr² * (density) * dr. So for each shell, the number of stars is proportional to r² dr.

But parallax is 1/d. So let's make a substitution. Let plx = p, so d = 1/p. So, when plx increases, distance decreases. We're looking at the number of stars per unit change in plx, so dN/dp.

Wait, but parallax isn't a radial measure. Oh, right, maybe I should express the number of stars in a range of parallax. Let's think in terms of plx.

The number of stars with parallax between p and p + dp would depend on how much volume corresponds to that range. Parallax p corresponds to distance d = 1/p. The volume between d and d + dd (where dd is the change in distance) is the volume of a thin shell: 4πd² dd.

But we need to express this in terms of p. Since d = 1/p, then dd = -1/p² dp. Because if p increases, d decreases. So, the volume element in terms of p would be:

dV = 4π (1/p)² * ( -1/p² dp )

Wait, the negative
