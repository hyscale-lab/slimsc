Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A through D, each with different values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the lifetime of the particle and the velocity at which it travels. Oh right, the formula is something like distance L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. But wait, how do I find τ from the given parameters?

I think the mean lifetime τ is related to the particle's width Γ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and τ is the uncertainty in time. So Γ ≈ ħ/τ, which gives τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units of GeV·s or something like that. I need to be careful with the units.

Wait, let's get the units straight. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ. Let me compute that.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV
