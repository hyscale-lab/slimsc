Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to work through this step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance, and there are four options to choose from.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula for the mean decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βγ, since particles are relativistic). So the formula should be L = c * τ * βγ.

But how do I find τ? Oh, right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy (Γ) and the uncertainty in time (τ) are inversely related. So τ is approximately ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula for the lifetime is actually τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the lifetime. So yeah, that's correct.

So first, let's compute τ. Oh, but I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let me see:

Γ is given as 320 MeV. But ħ is usually given in units of GeV·s or something like that. Wait, Planck constant
