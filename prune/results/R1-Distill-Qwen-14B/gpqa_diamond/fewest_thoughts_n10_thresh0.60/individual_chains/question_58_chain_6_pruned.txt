Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization when the energies are high. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like when calculations give infinite results. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle these infinities temporarily before they're canceled out by renormalization. Right, so regularization is needed when the theory has these divergences that can't be handled otherwise.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a bit different from the usual particle theories. Instead of point particles, it uses strings, and it incorporates supersymmetry. Strings have different modes of vibration, and I remember that string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences as, say, quantum electrodynamics. Wait, do they even need regularization? I think string theories, especially superstring theories, don't have the same issues because their perturbative expansions are better behaved. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD uses a method called lattice regularization, or maybe it's another type. Also, QCD is known to be a theory that's non-perturbatively solvable in some ways because of things like confinement and asymptotic freedom. But I'm pretty sure that QCD calculations, especially in perturbation theory, do require regularization. Like, when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergences that need to be handled. So QCD would need regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, electrons, and photons. I'm certain that QED definitely requires regularization. The early days of QED had issues with infinities in electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. These were handled by renormalization techniques, which require you to first regularize the theory—like using a cutoff, dimensional regularization, Pauli-Villars, etc. So QED definitely needs regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't have the same divergences as quantum ones, right? Because in classical E&M, you don't have issues like charge or current distributions leading to infinite fields or anything like that. In quantum theories, point particles cause problems because their charge densities are undefined at the point, leading to infinities. But in classical theory, even if you have point charges, the math might not lead to the same divergences. Or maybe in some classical cases, like point charges in classical E&M, you can have issues with the fields being singular at the charge's location. But wait, in classical physics, these infinities are more about the mathematical model's limitations rather than requiring regularization. Regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So classical electrodynamics doesn't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory.

So the question is: which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So I need to find the theory that doesn't have these divergences that require regularization.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Superstring theory is a quantum theory, right? So in that case, it's a quantum theory but perhaps doesn't require regularization because it's free from divergences. Or is it?

I remember that in string theory, the perturbative expansion (like the series of Feynman diagrams but for strings) doesn't have the same divergences as in point particle theories. Each term in the string perturbation series is finite, I think. So superstring theories, being background-dependent and having higher-dimensional objects, somehow avoid the usual divergences. So they don't require regularization because they're already finite.

So putting it all together:

- A: Superstring Theory doesn't require regularization because it's finite.
- B: QCD does require regularization.
- C: QED does require.
- D: Classical ED is classical, so no regularization needed because regularization
