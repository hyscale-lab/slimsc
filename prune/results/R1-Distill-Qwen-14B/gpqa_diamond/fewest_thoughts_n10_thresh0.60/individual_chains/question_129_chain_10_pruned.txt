Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a reaction scheme that starts with compound A and goes through several reactions to form compound E. I need to identify what E is based on the given options.

Let me break down the steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E.

There are also some hints provided. Hints a and b, so I shouldn't ignore them.

Starting with the first reaction: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN is typically a nucleophile. Since A is reacting with HCN, maybe A is a ketone. Because the reaction of a ketone with HCN forms a cyanohydrin. So, if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with an -OH and a -CN group on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but another possibility is if A is an aldehyde. Aldehydes can also react with HCN to form cyanohydrins. But the second reaction is B being reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is a catalyst, so it's probably hydrogenation. So maybe B has a triple bond or a cyano group that gets reduced.

Wait, let's think again. If A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would add the CN and OH groups. Then when B is reduced, maybe the cyano group converts to an amine? Wait, no, H2 and Pd usually reduces triple bonds to single bonds. So, if B is a cyanohydrin, perhaps the CN group is converted to CH2NH2 or something else? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is reduced to an amine. But wait, if B is a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group, hydrogenation would reduce the nitrile to an amine, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction isn't a cyanohydrin. Another possibility is that if A is a cyclic ketone, reacting with HCN could form a ring expansion. Or maybe A is a cyclopropane.

Wait, another thought: The second step is reduction with H2 and Pd. This is a hydrogenation catalyst, so it might reduce triple bonds or maybe double bonds. So if B has a triple bond, C would be an alkane. But if B is a nitrile, then H2 in presence of Pd would reduce it to an amine. Hmm.

Wait, let's consider the hint a). It says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. So A must have a carbonyl group because Wittig reagents react with carbonyls to form alkenes.

So, the product of the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The structure of that would be a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. Let me try to draw it mentally. Position 1 and 2 have methyl groups, and position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-C(CH3)=.

Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentane with substituents. So the Wittig reaction adds an alkene. So, when A reacts with the ylide, it forms a double bond. So A must have a carbonyl group, because that's what the Wittig reacts with.

So, A is a ketone. Because the product after Wittig is an alkene. So, if A is a cyclopentanone derivative,
