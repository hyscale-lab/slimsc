Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, let's see. I remember that eigenvalues and eigenvectors are solutions to the equation (P - λI)|v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

Wait, but the operator here is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. That probably means it's a spin operator, like for a spin-1/2 particle, maybe a muon. Oh right, because muons are fermions with spin 1/2.

So the operator P is a vector operator with components Px, Py, Pz. Each component is given as (ħ/2) times a 2x2 matrix. For example, Px has the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so the operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by that. Similarly for Py and Pz.

I think the operator we're interested in is P·n hat, the component of P along the direction n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be expressed as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, a direction in the x-z plane would have φ=0, right? Because the x-z plane is φ=0 and φ=π, I think. So maybe φ is zero here, so cosφ=1, sinφ=0. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since it's in the x-z plane.

Wait, maybe not. Let me get this right. The direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so its y-component is zero. So n = (nx, 0, nz). And since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² =1. Let's say n makes an angle θ with the z-axis. So nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ. Because when θ=0, it's along +z, and θ=90 would be along +x.

So the operator P·n would be P_x * nx + P_z * nz. Because since the direction is in x-z, the y-component of n is zero, so Py
