Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on eigenvectors and operators, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that for a spin-½ particle, the Pauli matrices represent the spin operators. The general operator for spin along a direction n is given by the dot product of the Pauli vector (σx, σy, σz) with the direction vector n. Oh right, the spin operator is S = (ħ/2) * (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz).

In this case, the operator P is along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n would have components (nx, 0, nz). Since it's in the x-z plane, ny is zero. Also, since it's a direction, nx² + nz² = 1.

The eigenvector we're looking for is one where P acting on it gives (ħ/2) times the same vector. So, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Let me write out the operator P. Since n is in x-z plane, P = (ħ/2)(n_x σx + nz σz). So the matrix form of P is [ (ħ/2)nz * I_z + (ħ/2) n_x σx ].

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, the matrix for P would be:

P = (ħ/2) [ nz * σz + n_x σx ]

Which becomes:

(ħ/2) * [[nz, n_x], [n_x, -nz]]

Because σz is diagonal, and σx swaps the off-diagonal elements.

So,

P = [[ (ħ/2)nz, (ħ/2)n_x ],
     [ (ħ/2)n_x, -(ħ/2)nz ] ]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the equation is (P - (ħ/2)I) |v> = 0.

Wait, the eigenvalue λ is +ħ/2. So the matrix equation is (P - λ I) v = 0.

Plugging in P and λ:

[ [ (ħ/2)nz - (ħ/2), (ħ/2)n_x ],
  [ (ħ/2)n_x, -(ħ/2)nz - (ħ/2) ] ] * [v1; v2] = 0.

Let me factor out ħ/2:

(ħ/2) [ [ nz - 1, n_x ],
          [n_x, -nz -1 ] ] * [v1; v2] = 0.

Since we can ignore the scalar factor,
