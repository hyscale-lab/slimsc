Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I know that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They want to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm. So, the stars are treated as black bodies here. I remember that black body radiation has some specific properties. The peak wavelength (the one where they appear brightest) is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, the problem says their wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So lambda_max for both stars is the same. According to Wien's Law, that means their temperatures must be the same because the lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature. Oh, right, so T1 = T2.

Now, I need to compute their luminosities. Luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4. Since they're black bodies, this applies. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, I thought that for stars, the luminosity can also be related to mass. Oh, but in this problem, they're giving the radius and mass. But from the problem, the masses are 1.5 times each other, but since the temperatures are the same, maybe the mass doesn't directly come into play here. Or does it?

Wait, no. The problem says that the luminosity is being computed based on black body radiation. So the formula would be the Stefan-Boltzmann formula. So let's focus on that.

So Star_1's luminosity L1 is 4π (R1)^2 σ (T1)^4. Similarly for Star_2, L2 =4π (R2)^2 σ (T2)^4.

But we found that T1 = T2. So T
