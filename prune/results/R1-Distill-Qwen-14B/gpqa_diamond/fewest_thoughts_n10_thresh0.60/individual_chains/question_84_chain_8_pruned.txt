Alright, I'm trying to tackle this question about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one for solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and matrix exponentials. Okay, let's break it down.

So the question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm to a parallel one when using higher-order finite differences and parallel splitting. The options are A through D, each relating to different aspects of the problem.

First, I remember that in solving PDEs like the heat equation, especially in higher dimensions, the matrix exponential often comes into play when dealing with the time evolution of the system. The matrix exponential method involves representing the solution as e^(At), where A is a matrix derived from the spatial discretization. 

In a sequential approach, you compute this matrix exponential step by step, perhaps using methods like diagonalization or Krylov subspace techniques, which are inherently sequential because each step depends on the previous one.

Now, when moving to a parallel algorithm, the idea is to break down the computation into parts that can be executed simultaneously. One approach for parallelizing the matrix exponential is using techniques like Parallel Diagonalization or more commonly, splitting the matrix into smaller blocks that can be processed in parallel. Alternatively, methods like the Parallel Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method might be used for higher-dimensional PDEs, which splits the computation along different dimensions.

Wait, but the question mentions "parallel splitting," which makes me think about algorithms that decompose the problem into subproblems that can be solved concurrently. For instance, in the context of domain decomposition methods, the problem is split into smaller regions, each handled by a different processor, then the solutions are combined. Another possibility is the use of fractional approximation methods for the matrix exponential, which might allow for a more efficient or parallelizable computation.

The key factor in converting the algorithm to parallel would likely involve how the matrix operations can be distributed or computed in parallel. Stability analysis (Option A) is important but more about ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up; it's not the main factor for parallelism. Nonlocal boundary conditions (Option B) might complicate things but aren't directly tied to the parallel conversion process.

Options C and D are about fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods are techniques used to approximate the matrix exponential efficiently, sometimes using rational functions or other approximations that can be computed more efficiently, perhaps in a way that allows for parallel computation.

Option C says "Complex roots of fractional approximation." Hmm, complex roots might influence the stability or choice of approximation method, but I'm not sure how they directly relate to parallelism. 

Option D is "Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation." Linear partial fractions involve breaking a rational function into simpler fractions, which could allow for each part to be computed independently. If the approximation decomposes the matrix exponential into terms that can be computed in parallel—like each term being a separate exponential that doesn't interfere with others—then that would enable parallel splitting.

Wait, the method of partial fractions (like using something like e^(A) = f(A), where f is a polynomial or a rational function) might decompose into terms that can be computed in parallel. For example, if the approximation can be written as a sum of terms each involving different powers of A, these could potentially be computed simultaneously if the powers are independent in some way.

Alternatively, when dealing with matrix functions, a partial fraction decomposition can sometimes be used to express the exponential as a sum of simpler functions, each of which can be computed independently, thus allowing for parallel processing. For instance, if the approximation method leads to a sum where each term is a function of A that can be evaluated separately, then each term's computation can be parallelized.

So, the key factor might be whether the fractional approximation can be broken down into linear partial fractions, allowing each part to be computed in parallel. That would align with option D.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky on how exactly the partial fractions contribute to parallelism. Another angle: when solving the heat equation
