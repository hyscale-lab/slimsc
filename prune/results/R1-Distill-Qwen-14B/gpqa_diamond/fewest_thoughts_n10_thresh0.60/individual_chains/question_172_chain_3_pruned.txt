Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, okay, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. They're asking which equation correctly relates the effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Okay, so I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in different energy states is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor gives the ratio of populations in two energy levels. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. They observed that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. I think that means the ratio n_i/n_j for star_1 is 2, and for star_2, it's 1/2? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as in star_2. So, for the same energy level, star_1's population is twice that of star_2. Or perhaps it's the ratio of excited to lower level that's twice.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's denote the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state (or another state) as r. So for star_1, r1 = 2 * r2, where r2 is the ratio for star_2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, r = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, because they're the same element (iron) in the same energy levels. So g_i/g_j would be the same for both stars.

Wait, but the question says the energy difference is the same for both stars because they're considering the same energy levels. So ΔE is fixed. So the ratio of r1
