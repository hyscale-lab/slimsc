Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). We need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T_1 and T_2.

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the populations of energy levels are determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given, so E_i - E_j is 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote this as ΔE. So ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J.

The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So I think that means the population of the higher energy level (say level i) relative to the lower (level j) is twice as much in star_1 as it is in star_2.

Wait, or maybe it's that the excitation is twice. Let me think: the excitation of a specific level could refer to the population in that level. So if star_1 has twice the excitation (n_i) compared to star_2 for the same level, then maybe (n_i)_1 = 2 * (n_i)_2.

But wait, no, because the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So for star_1, n_i is higher. So the ratio (n_i / n_j) for star_1 is higher than that for star_2.

Wait, the ratio. Let's define for each star:

For star 1: (n_i / n_j)_1 = 2 * (n_i / n_j)_2

Wait, or is it that the excitation (n_i) in star_1 is twice that in star_2? Or is it that the ratio of n_i to n_j is twice as
