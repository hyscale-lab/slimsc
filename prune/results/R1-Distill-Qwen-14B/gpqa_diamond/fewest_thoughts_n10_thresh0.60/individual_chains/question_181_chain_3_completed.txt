Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this neutrino flux question. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped 8 and a half minutes ago. And we need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D.

Wait, first, I should probably remember what the pp-III branch is. I think the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. There are different stages. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh right, the pp-I is the initial reaction where two protons fuse to form deuterium, then another proton combines to make helium-3. Then in pp-II, two helium-3 nuclei fuse into helium-4 plus two protons. But wait, pp-III... wasn't that a part where maybe a helium-3 captures two protons? Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, right, the pp-III branch involves a helium-3 capturing a proton to form helium-4, but wait, that might be part of the overall process. Or maybe I'm confusing with the CNO cycle. Hmm, no, the CNO cycle is a different fusion process.

Wait, I remember that the pp-III branch is a part where, after some steps, a helium-3 nucleus captures two protons. But wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, I think that the pp-III branch is a side reaction that actually produces more neutrons or something, but not the main fusion path. Or maybe it's a reaction that produces higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, let me think about the neutrinos produced in the Sun. Most solar neutrinos come from the pp chain, particularly the pp-I branch. The main neutrino emission is from the decay of boron-8, which emits a neutrino when it decays into carbon-8. That neutrino has an energy around 15-20 keV. Are there higher energy neutrinos? Oh, right, there are also neutrinos from other processes, like in the CNO cycle, but their flux is much lower.

Wait, but the question is about the pp-III branch. So if it stops, what happens to the neutrino flux? The pp-III must produce some neutrinos. So the question is about the flux in two specific energy bands.

Wait, the pp chain has different stages, and each may produce different neutrino energies. So, the question is, when the pp-III branch stops, how does that affect the flux in those two bands.

Wait, let me recap. The proton-proton chain starts with two protons fusing to form deuterium. Then another proton combines, making helium-3. The pp-I branch is up to this point. Then, in the pp-II branch, two helium-3 nuclei (each with two protons and one neutron) fuse to form helium-4 and two protons. But in the pp-III branch, one of the helium-3 captures a proton, creating helium-4 and releasing a positron and a neutrino. Oh, that's right! So, the pp-III reaction is:

He-3 + p → He-4 + e+ + νe

And this reaction emits a neutrino with higher energy than the ones from the main pp-I reactions. Because the pp-I neutrinos are from the decay of boron-8 (B^8 → C^8 + e- + ν), which are around 15 keV. But the pp-III reactions emit higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps in the hundreds of keV range. So if the pp-III branch stops, those higher-energy neutrinos would suddenly stop being produced, right?

Wait, but the time it stopped was 8.5 minutes ago. So, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch that were produced before that time would still be traveling towards Earth. But since the Sun is about 8 light minutes away from Earth (since light takes about 8 minutes to reach us from the Sun), any neutrinos emitted 8.5 minutes ago would be just arriving now. So, neutrinos emitted before that would have already arrived. So, if the pp-III branch stops 8.5 minutes ago, then the neutrinos from that process would stop being emitted from that point on. But the neutrinos in transit would still reach us. Wait, but the question is about the current flux, i.e., how many are arriving now. Hmm, maybe the time since the stoppage is such that the neutrinos from pp-III have stopped arriving, but I'm not sure. Wait, neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, so any neutrinos emitted 8.5 minutes ago would have already reached Earth. So, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would no longer be arriving after that. So, the current flux (right now) would be the same as before, but only for a certain period. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux in two bands. So, if the pp-III branch stops, the flux in higher energy neutrinos (from pp-III) would drop, while the lower energy ones (from pp-I) wouldn't be affected. So, the question is, what is the ratio between band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV), assuming that the pp-III branch stopped.

Wait, if the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in band 2 (800-900 keV), then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2, while leaving band 1 (assuming band 1 is from another source) or perhaps band 1 is also from pp-III but in a lower part of their spectrum.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again.

In the Sun, the main neutrinos come from the pp-I branch, which produce boron-8, which decays and emits a neutrino of about 15 keV. Then there are the pp-III reactions, which produce higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps like 500 keV or more. So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, the flux of higher-energy neutrinos would drop.

So, the question is about two bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. If the pp-III branch is the main source of neutrinos in the 700-900 keV range, then stopping it would affect both bands. But perhaps the 800-900 keV band is entirely from pp-III, while the 700-800 band might have other contributions or perhaps a different fraction from pp-III.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are in the higher end, say above 800 keV, then band 2 would be more affected. So, if the pp-III neutrinos stopped, the flux in band 2 would drop to almost zero, while band 1 might remain the same.

Wait, but in the actual Sun, the neutrino spectrum from pp-III is a tail extending up to a few MeV. So, the 700-800 keV band might have some contribution from pp-III, and the 800-900 keV band even more. So if pp-III stops, both bands would decrease, but the higher band would be more affected.

Wait, but how does the flux in these bands compare? Before the pp-III stopped, what was the flux ratio?

Wait, the flux from the pp-III is a small fraction compared to the main pp-I. The total neutrino flux from the pp chain is dominated by the low-energy ones (like 15 keV) from pp-I. The pp-III contributes a smaller number but higher energy neutrinos. So, the number of neutrinos in the higher energy bands is less than in the lower ones.

But if the pp-III branch stops, the high-energy neutrinos (band 2) would drop, but band 1 would also drop if it was mainly from pp-III.

Wait, but in the question, the pp-III branch has stopped. So, for band 1 (700-800), if some of the neutrinos came from pp-III, stopping it would reduce band 1. Band 2 would be more affected because all its neutrinos came from pp-III.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact energy ranges. I think that the pp-III neutrinos have energies a bit lower than the CNO neutrinos. Wait, CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, like a few MeV. So, if pp-III is around, say, 500-1000 keV, then the 800-900 band would be entirely from pp-III. So, stopping pp-III would eliminate all neutrinos in band 2, while band 1 (700-800) might have some contribution from pp-III as well, but perhaps also from other sources?

Wait, but another possibility: the main neutrinos are from the pp-I, which are low energy. The pp-III produces a smaller number of higher-energy neutrinos. So, the majority of neutrinos in the 700-800 band might be from pp-III if that's where they peak. Alternatively, perhaps the 700-800 band contains some pp-III neutrinos, and the 800-900 band contains the tail of the pp-III distribution.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's approach this differently. If the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino flux in different energy bands?

- The main neutrino source (pp-I) is unaffected, so the low-energy neutrinos (like 15 keV) continue as before.
- The pp-III neutrinos, which are higher energy, stop being produced.

So, the flux in band 1 (700-800) would be a mix: perhaps only the pp-III neutrinos contribute to this band, or maybe some other process? Wait, but the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, but their flux is much lower. So, the main neutrino flux in the 700-800 and 800-900 bands comes from the pp-III.

Wait, no, I think the CNO neutrinos are in even higher energy ranges. So, perhaps the mid-energy bands (like 700-800 keV) are dominated by the pp-III, and the higher bands (800-900) are as well. But if pp-III stops, the flux in both bands would drop. But what was the original flux ratio between band 1 and band 2?

Wait, the number of neutrinos depends on the reaction rates. The pp-III reactions are less frequent than the pp-I reactions. So, the number of higher-energy neutrinos (pp-III) is less than the lower-energy ones (pp-I). So, the flux in each band depends on both the number of neutrinos and their energy.

Wait, but the question is about flux, which is neutrinos per cm² per second. So, it's the number of neutrinos in each band. So, if pp-III neutrinos are higher energy, then in the 800-900 band, the majority (if not all) neutrinos come from pp-III. Similarly, the 700-800 band may have a lower contribution from pp-III but perhaps a higher fraction.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the neutrino energy spectrum. The main pp-I neutrinos are about 15 keV, so their flux is in the lower keV range. The pp-III neutrinos have a higher energy spectrum. So, the 700-800 keV band would have some contribution from pp-III, while the 800-900 would be mostly pp-III.

So, suppose that before the pp-III stopped, the flux in band 1 was a combination of some pp-III and perhaps some other processes. The flux in band 2 was almost entirely from pp-III.

After the pp-III stops, band 2's flux would drop to zero, while band 1's flux might remain the same if it's from another source. But wait, if band 1 was dominated by pp-III, then stopping it would cause both bands to drop, but perhaps band 2 drops more.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the 700-800 band has a higher flux than the 800-900 band before the pp-III stops. Because the flux distribution tends to fall off at higher energies. So, if the pp-III neutrinos contribute to both bands, but more to the higher one.

Wait, let's model it. Suppose that the pp-III neutrinos have an energy spectrum that peaks around, say, 700 keV. So, the 700-800 band would have a high flux, and the 800-900 band would have a lower flux (but still significant). So, if pp-III stops, the 700-800 flux would drop by a certain amount, and the 800-900 flux would drop more.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact numbers. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the flux ratio before and after the pp-III stops.

Wait, the question is about the current flux ratio. After 8.5 minutes, all the pp-III neutrinos that were emitted before the stoppage have already reached Earth. So, the neutrinos emitted after the stoppage wouldn't be coming. So, the flux from pp-III would have dropped to zero, because the production has stopped. Therefore, the current flux is only what was produced before the stoppage, but since neutrinos are arriving continuously, the flux would depend on how long the pp-III has been stopped.

Wait, but the neutrinos take about 8 minutes to reach us. So, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos emitted during the last 8.5 minutes of pp-III operation would still be on their way. But wait, the emission stopped, so the neutrinos emitted in the last 8.5 minutes would have already left the Sun and are traveling to Earth. So, from Earth's perspective, the neutrino flux from pp-III would drop to zero, because all the emitted neutrinos are already en route, and no new ones are being produced.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the Sun is about 8 light minutes away, so any neutrino emitted 8.5 minutes ago would have just arrived. Neutrinos emitted before that would have arrived earlier. So, the flux from pp-III would drop to zero right when the stoppage happened, because the neutrinos emitted before that time would have already arrived. Wait, that doesn't make sense, because the stoppage happens at time t0, and neutrinos before t0-8.5 minutes would have arrived.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the neutrinos are emitted in the Sun's core, and take about 8 minutes to reach Earth. So, if the pp-III stopped at time t0, the last neutrino emitted was at t0. That neutrino would travel for 8 minutes and reach Earth at t0 +8 minutes. So, after t0, no new pp-III neutrinos are emitted. So, the flux of pp-III neutrinos would drop to zero at t0, but the neutrinos emitted before t0 would still arrive during the next 8 minutes. Wait, no, the neutrinos emitted at t0 would arrive at t0 +8 minutes, and those emitted before t0 would arrive earlier.

So, for example, the neutrino emitted at t0 - x minutes would arrive at (t0 - x) +8 minutes. So, the flux of pp-III neutrinos would drop to zero only at t0 +8 minutes, because that's when the last pp-III neutrino arrives.

So, in this question, the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So, the last pp-III neutrino would arrive 8.5 minutes after the stoppage, which is now (assuming the question is being asked at the current moment). So, the neutrino flux from pp-III would have been present until now, but from now on, it's zero.

Wait, but the question is about the current flux ratio. So, the pp-III neutrinos are no longer being emitted, so their flux would have dropped to zero. Oh wait, no. Because the neutrinos take 8 minutes to reach us, so the last pp-III neutrino was emitted 8.5 minutes ago and arrives now. So, the flux from pp-III would have stopped right after the stoppage, but the neutrinos emitted before that are still arriving for the next 8.5 minutes. So, the neutrino flux from pp-III would be present for about 8.5 minutes after the stoppage, but then drop to zero.

But the question is about the current flux, which is as of 8.5 minutes after the stoppage. So, the neutrinos emitted during the last 8.5 minutes of pp-III operation are still arriving. So, the flux from pp-III is still present, but perhaps at a lower rate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the pp-III has stopped and all the neutrinos have been emitted, so the flux from pp-III is now zero. That's probably a simplifying assumption for the problem.

So, assuming that the pp-III has stopped, and all its neutrinos have stopped arriving, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would drop, while band 1 (700-800 keV) might also drop, but perhaps less if other processes contribute to band 1.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of band1 to band2. So, if both bands are affected by the pp-III stoppage, but band 2 is more affected, the ratio would decrease.

Alternatively, if band1 is entirely from pp-III, and band2 is also entirely from pp-III, then the ratio would depend on the number of neutrinos in each band relative to each other. So, if the pp-III neutrino spectrum is such that the 700-800 band has more neutrinos than the 800-900 band, then the ratio would be greater than 1.

But I'm not sure about that. Let me think about the shape of the neutrino spectrum. Typically, the number of neutrinos decreases with increasing energy. So, higher energy bands have fewer neutrinos. So, if the pp-III neutrinos contribute to both band1 and band2, the flux in band1 is greater than band2.

So, in this case, the ratio (band1/band2) would be greater than 1. If both bands are losing the same fraction of their flux (like 100% since pp-III is the only source), then the ratio would stay the same as before. But if band1 has a higher contribution from pp-III, then the ratio would decrease.

Wait, but if both bands are entirely from pp-III, then the flux in each band drops to zero. But that can't be, because the problem states that other reactions remain as they were. So, maybe the pp-III is a minor source to band1, but a major source to band2. Alternatively, perhaps the main source for band1 is another process, like the CNO cycle, but I thought CNO neutrinos are higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the main neutrino flux comes from pp-I, which are low energy. The higher bands (like 700-900 keV) are from other processes, such as the electron capture in heavier isotopes, or perhaps the decay of heavier nuclei.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the main sources of solar neutrinos. The majority come from the pp chain, specifically the decay of boron-8 (pp-I), which is about 15 keV. The next significant source is the CNO cycle, which produces higher-energy neutrinos (a few MeV), but their flux is much lower than the pp neutrinos. Then, there's the pp-III branch, which emits neutrinos in the MeV range as well, but again perhaps a smaller flux than the pp-I.

So, the 700-800 keV band would be dominated by the pp-III neutrinos, but perhaps the CNO neutrinos might also contribute a bit. The 800-900 band would also be dominated by pp-III.

If the pp-III stops, the flux in both bands would drop, but since the CNO neutrinos are less in number, the drop would be more significant in the higher band. Wait, but the CNO neutrinos are much fewer than the pp ones, so their contribution is minimal.

So, if the pp-III branch is the main contributor to both bands, stopping it would cause both fluxes to drop, but with the higher band (800-900) being more affected. So, the ratio (band1 / band2) would increase, because band1's flux decreases less than band2's. For example, if band1 had 90% from pp-III and band2 had 100% from pp-III, then after pp-III stops, band1 would lose 90% of its flux, and band2 would lose 100%. So, the ratio would change from 0.9/1 = 0.9 to (0.1 / 0) which is undefined, but that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute to band2 but not as much to band1. Let's say, for example, that band1 has 10% contribution from pp-III, and band2 has 90% from pp-III. Then, when pp-III stops, band1 flux drops by 10%, and band2 by 90%.

So, the original ratio was (0.1 + 0.9) / (0.9 + 0.9?), no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's model it as:

Let F1 = F_ppIII_1 + F_ppI_1 + F_other_1.

Similarly, F2 = F_ppIII_2 + F_ppI_2 + F_other_2.

But F_ppI_1 and F_ppI_2 would be the contributions from pp-I to each band, which are negligible because pp-I neutrinos are around 15 keV. So, F_ppI_1 and F_ppI_2 are zero.

F_other_1 and F_other_2 are contributions from other processes, like CNO or others.

Assuming that the main contribution to bands 1 and 2 comes from pp-III, except for maybe a small fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are in higher bands, so for 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands, the main sources are pp-III.

So, when pp-III stops, both F1 and F2 drop. But if the pp-III spectrum is such that more neutrinos are in band1 than band2, then F1 would be higher than F2. So, the ratio F1/F2 would be greater than 1.

But without knowing the exact distribution, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have a spectrum where F1 and F2 are similar, but in reality, the number of neutrinos decreases with increasing energy. So, band2 would have fewer neutrinos than band1.

So, if pp-III is the main source for both bands, then when it stops, both F1 and F2 drop to zero. But that can't be because pp-III is just one part of the Sun's fusion.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remained as they were. So, only pp-III stopped. So, the pp-I and CNO processes continue.

But the pp-I neutrinos are at 15 keV, so they don't contribute to the 700-800 or 800-900 bands. The CNO neutrinos are higher energy, but their flux is much lower.

So, maybe the only source for the 700-800 and 800-900 bands is the pp-III branch. If that's the case, then when pp-III stops, both F1 and F2 drop to zero. But that would make their ratio zero, which isn't an option.

Hmm, but that can't be, because the options don't include zero. So, perhaps the 700-800 band has some contribution from other sources, such as the decay of heavier isotopes or other reactions.

Wait, another possibility: the pp-III neutrinos contribute to the higher bands, but the main neutrino flux in the lower part of the MeV range comes from the decay of heavier isotopes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are all above 800 keV, meaning that band2 (800-900 keV) is entirely from pp-III, and band1 (700-800 keV) is from another process (like the CNO cycle or other). If that's the case, then stopping pp-III would leave band1 as it was, and eliminate band2. So, the ratio would be F1/F2 = (same as before)/0, which is undefined. But that's not possible because the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are all in the 800-900 keV range. So, F2 is entirely from pp-III. The 700-800 band (band1) has negligible contribution from pp-III and comes from other processes. So, if pp-III stops, F2 drops to zero, while F1 remains the same. So, the ratio F1/F2 would be infinity, which isn't an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the 700-800 band has a small contribution from pp-III, and the 800-900 is mainly from pp-III. So, when pp-III stops, F2 drops more than F1.

So, for example, let's say F1 was 100 neutrinos/s/cm², 10 from pp-III and 90 from others. F2 was 100, all from pp-III. Then, after pp-III stops, F1 becomes 90, and F2 becomes 0. So the ratio is 90/0, which is undefined, but perhaps in reality, the ratio would be (let's say, the pp-III contributed a small part to band1):

If F1 was 90 (from others) + 10 (pp-III). F2 was 20 (others) + 80 (pp-III).

So, initial ratio: (90+10)/(20+80) = 100/100 =1.

After pp-III stops:

F1=90, F2=20.

Ratio: 90/20=4.5.

But that's not one of the options. Hmm, maybe the other way: band2 has higher contribution from pp-III, so the ratio F1/F2 would decrease.

Wait, another approach. In reality, the pp-III neutrinos are a small fraction of the total neutrino flux. So, the majority of neutrinos in the 700-800 KeV band come from other sources (like the CNO cycle). But wait, the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos (a few MeV), so maybe their contribution is minimal in these bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the 700-800 band has a negligible contribution from pp-III, and the 800-900 band has a significant contribution. So, if pp-III stops, band2's flux drops, while band1 remains the same. So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase because F2 has dropped.

But without knowing the exact numbers, it's tricky.

Wait, let's think about the problem statement again. The question says that the pp-III branch has stopped, so the flux from pp-III is no longer arriving. So, any neutrinos in the 700-800 and 800-900 bands that were produced by pp-III would no longer contribute.

If the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for band2, then F2 would drop to almost zero, while band1's flux remains roughly the same (if it has other sources).

So, F1/F2 would become very large. But the options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

Wait, but in the options, the only option higher than 1 is A (10), but in our example earlier, the ratio could be 4.5, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps band1 is entirely from pp-III, and band2 is also from pp-III, but with a lower flux.

Wait, perhaps the neutrino spectrum from pp-III has a peak in the 700-800 keV range, so the flux in band1 is higher than in band2. So, when pp-III stops, both fluxes drop, but band1's flux is higher, so F1/F2 could be 10, as option A.

Alternatively, if the flux was the same in both bands before the stoppage, then the ratio is 1, but that's only if the pp-III emission was flat between these two bands, which is unlikely.

Wait, but another point: the pp-III branch's contribution to the neutrino flux is much smaller than the pp-I. So, even if the pp-III stopped, the flux in the higher bands would drop by a factor of 100 or so.

Wait, wait. The pp-III is a small branch, so the number of neutrinos it produces is much less than the pp-I. So, the number of neutrinos in the 700-800 and 800-900 bands from pp-III is much smaller than the total from pp-I. But the pp-I neutrinos are at 15 keV, so they don't contribute to these bands.

Therefore, the 700-800 and 800-900 bands have a small number of neutrinos from pp-III and perhaps a negligible number from other sources. So, when the pp-III stops, both fluxes drop, but perhaps only by a small factor.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are the majority in both bands, then the flux would drop, but the exact ratio depends on their energy distribution.

Wait, I'm getting myself into circles here. Maybe I should think of it in terms of the branching ratio. The pp-III branch contributes a certain number of neutrinos. If we stop it, the flux from that branch drops. So, the neutrino flux in the higher energy bands (like 800-900) would drop more than in the lower ones (700-800), because maybe the pp-III neutrinos peak in the higher end.

So, the ratio F1/F2 would be higher than before. So, if before the stoppage, F1 was larger than F2, the ratio was, say, 2, after the stoppage, F1 might be F1_prev - some amount, and F2_prev - more. So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

But without exact numbers, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the flux in both bands was dominated by pp-III, so their ratio is roughly similar. Then, the ratio would be close to 1, option C.

Wait, but the options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the pp-III branch is a small contributor, so stopping it would cause a small change in the flux. So, the ratio would remain approximately 1.

But that doesn't fit because the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for those higher energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio was 1 before the stoppage, and remains 1 after, because both bands are equally affected. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino flux in band1 is entirely from pp-III and band2 is too, but with a lower flux. So, the ratio would be the same as the intrinsic distribution of pp-III in those bands.

Wait, but without knowing the distribution, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the other way around: the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for band2, and only a small fraction for band1. So, when pp-III stops, F2 drops a lot, while F1 doesn't change much. So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase. If F2 was similar to F1 before, then the ratio would become larger than 1.

But all this is speculative.

Wait, perhaps I should remember that the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy, so the 800-900 band is dominated by them. The 700-800 band might have a mix.

So, if pp-III stops, the 800-900 band's flux drops to zero (assuming pp-III was the only source), while the 700-800 band's flux remains, perhaps from other sources. But if the 700-800 band had a negligible contribution from pp-III, then F1 remains the same and F2 drops to zero, making the ratio F1/F2 very large, which isn't an option. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute more to band1 than band2. So, if pp-III stopped, band1's flux would drop more than band2's, making the ratio smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino spectrum falls off with energy, meaning there are fewer neutrinos in higher bands.

So, the number of neutrinos in band1 is higher than in band2. So, if pp-III neutrinos are the main source for both bands, then F1 was higher than F2. So, when pp-III stops, F1 and F2 drop, but since F1 was higher, the ratio F1/F2 would remain about the same.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have a peak in the 800 keV range, so the 800-900 band has fewer neutrinos than the 700-800 band. So, F1 > F2.

In that case, after the pp-III stops, both F1 and F2 drop, but F1 drops less than F2. So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

But without knowing the exact distribution, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B) 0.01, which is 10^-2. That would imply that F1 is 1% of F2. But why would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributor to band2, and only a small part to band1. So, when pp-III stops, F2 drops to almost zero, while F1 remains roughly the same. So, F1/F2 would be about F1/(F2_ppIII). But if F2_ppIII was very small, F1/F2 could be large.

Alternatively, maybe the opposite: the pp-III contributes more to band1 than band2, so F1 drops more, making the ratio smaller.

But again, without the exact numbers, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for both bands, but the flux in band1 is about 10 times higher than in band2. So, when they stop, the ratio F1/F2 would be 10, option A.

Hmm, that's a possibility.

Wait, another approach: the pp-III neutrinos are produced in a reaction that emits a neutrino with energy around 500-700 keV. So, the 700-800 band would have a tail of these neutrinos, and the 800-900 band would have very few.

In that case, when pp-III stops, F1 would drop a bit, and F2 would drop a lot. So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

If F1 was, say, 90% from pp-III and F2 was 90% from pp-III as well, but with F1 being a higher energy band, which would have fewer neutrinos, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in the 700-800 band, so F1 is from pp-III, and F2 is negligible. So, when pp-III stops, F1 drops, and F2 remains the same. So, the ratio F1/F2 becomes (0)/(F2) which is zero, but that’s not an option.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The question asks for the ratio F1/F2. If the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for both bands, but higher energy bands (like F2) have fewer neutrinos, then the ratio F1/F2 would be greater than 1.

But looking at the options, the only option greater than 1 is A) 10.

Alternatively, another reasoning: the pp-III neutrinos are a minor part of the total neutrino flux. So, stopping them would lead to a small change in the flux. Therefore, the ratio would remain approximately 1, option C.

But I'm not confident. Another angle: if the pp-III neutrinos are the only source for band2, and a minor source for band1, then when they stop, F2 drops to zero while F1 remains. So, the ratio would be very high, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the only source for both bands. So, F1 and F2 are both from pp-III. So, when pp-III stops, both F1 and F2 drop to zero. But that's impossible, as the options don't include zero.

Hmm. I think I'll have to make a guess. The correct answer is likely option B) 0.01, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, option D) 0.1.

Wait, another angle: the pp-III neutrinos are the dominant source for band2, and a minor source for band1. So, when pp-III stops, F2 drops by a large factor, but F1 doesn't change much. So, F1/F2 would be higher than before. If F1 was, say, 1% of F2, then F1/F2 would be 0.01, option B.

But why would F1 be 1% of F2?

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are more likely to be in the higher energy band. So, the majority of pp-III neutrinos are in band2. So, F2 is mainly from pp-III, and F1 has a small contribution. So, when pp-III stops, F2 drops to zero, and F1 remains. So, F1/F2 would be infinity, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the pp-III neutrino flux is much smaller than the pp-I, so even if it stops, the change is small. So, the ratio remains about 1.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the flux in band1 is from pp-III and the CNO cycle, while band2 is mostly from pp-III. So, when pp-III stops, band2 drops, but band1's CNO component remains. So, if CNO contributes a small amount to band1, the ratio would be (CNO_flux) / (pp-III_flux).

If CNO_flux is negligible, then the ratio would be zero. But if CNO_flux is, say, 1% of pp-III_flux, then the ratio would be 0.01, option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO cycle produces some neutrinos in the 700-800 band, and none in the 800-900 band. So, when pp-III stops, F1 is CNO_flux, and F2 is zero. So, the ratio would be infinity, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO cycle produces neutrinos in both bands, but with much lower flux than pp-III. So, when pp-III stops, F1 drops to CNO_flux_band1, and F2 drops to CNO_flux_band2.

If CNO_flux_band1 is much larger than CNO_flux_band2, the ratio would be higher than 1. If CNO_flux_band2 is larger, the ratio would be less than 1.

But I don't know the exact distribution.

Given all this, I think the intended answer is option B) 0.01, implying that the flux in band1 is much smaller than band2 after the pp-III stops. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, the correct answer is C) 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the pp-III neutrinos are produced in a reaction that emits a neutrino when a helium-3 captures a proton. The energy of these neutrinos is higher than the pp-I. The exact energy depends on the reaction. If the neutrinos from pp-III are around 500-700 keV, then the 700-800 band would have some, and the 800-900 would have very few. So, the flux in band1 (700-800) would be higher than band2 (800-900). If pp-III stops, both drop, but band1 drops less.

So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase. If before the stoppage, F1 was 10 times F2, then after, F1 could be 9 times something smaller, but without the exact numbers, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band1 is similar to band2, so the ratio remains 1.

I think I'm going around in circles. Given the time I've spent, I'll make a guess that the ratio is 1, so option C.


The question involves analyzing the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos compared to the pp-I branch, which produces lower-energy neutrinos around 15 keV. The pp-III neutrinos are thought to have energies in the range of hundreds of keV to a few MeV, making them relevant to the specified energy bands.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Sources in the Sun**:
   - The pp-I branch produces the majority of solar neutrinos, but they are low-energy (~15 keV) and do not contribute significantly to the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands.
   - The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, which are the primary contributors to the specified energy bands.
   - The CNO cycle produces even higher-energy neutrinos, but their flux is much smaller compared to the pp-I and pp-III branches.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - The pp-III branch is the dominant source of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands. Stopping it would significantly reduce the flux in these bands.
   - The 700-800 keV band may have a slightly higher flux than the 800-900 keV band due to the general trend of decreasing neutrino flux with increasing energy.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After the Stoppage**:
   - Before the stoppage, the flux in both bands was dominated by pp-III neutrinos. The ratio of fluxes (F1/F2) between the two bands depends on the energy distribution of pp-III neutrinos.
   - After the stoppage, the flux in both bands decreases, but the higher-energy band (800-900 keV) is more affected because it contains fewer neutrinos overall.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (10)**: This would imply that the flux in the 700-800 keV band is significantly higher than in the 800-900 keV band after the stoppage. This is plausible if the pp-III neutrinos are distributed such that the 700-800 keV band has a higher flux.
   - **Option B (0.01)**: This would imply that the flux in the 700-800 keV band is only 1% of the flux in the 800-900 keV band, which is unlikely given the general trend of decreasing flux with increasing energy.
   - **Option C (1)**: This would imply that the flux ratio remains approximately 1, which is plausible if the pp-III neutrinos are evenly distributed between the two bands.
   - **Option D (0.1)**: This would imply that the flux in the 700-800 keV band is 10% of the flux in the 800-900 keV band, which is less likely given the expected distribution of pp-III neutrinos.

### Conclusion:
The most reasonable assumption, based on the general trend of decreasing neutrino flux with increasing energy and the dominance of pp-III neutrinos in both bands, is that the flux ratio remains approximately 1 after the stoppage. This aligns with **Option C**.
