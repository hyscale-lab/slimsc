Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully and then think through each part.

So, the question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are a few steps involved, and some hints given. Let me break it down.

First, let's list the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And the options are four cyclo compounds with ketone groups.

The hints are:
a) Compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR peaks: A has a peak around 1750 cm^-1, E around 1715 cm^-1.

Hmm. So, I need to figure out what A is first, then trace through each step.

Starting with hint a. When A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms a specific compound. Wait, phosphorous ylides are usually used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction typically converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with ylides.

The product given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure.

The name suggests a cyclopentane ring. At position 4, there's a substituent which is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)= , right? So it's a methylene group (CH2) attached to a cyclopentane, and the substituents are at positions 1 and 2.

Wait, the structure would be cyclopentane with substituents at 1 and 2. Let me think: position 1 has a methyl, position 2 has a methyl, and position 4 (which is adjacent to 3 and 5, if the ring is numbered) has a propan-2-ylidene group.

Wait, but the product is from
