Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a thermal distribution. The formula I remember is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and n_i and n_j are populations of the two energy levels.

In this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So for star_1, the ratio of excited to lower state would be higher. Let me denote the excited state as level i and the lower as level j. So for star_1, the ratio is n1_i/n1_j = 2. For star_2, it's n2_i/n2_j = let's see, because the question says star_1's atoms are twice as excited, so maybe star_2 is half as excited? Or wait, the question says the excitation is twice as high, so for star_2, the ratio would be 1, because they're less excited. Wait, no, I need to think carefully.

Wait, the problem states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So that means the population in the higher energy level (excited state) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, n1_i / n1_j = 2, and for star_2, n2_i / n2_j = 1. Because star_2's ratio is less (since they're less excited), so their excited state population is lower.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe not. Because the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So for star_1, the ratio of (n_i)/(n_j) is 2, and star_2's ratio
