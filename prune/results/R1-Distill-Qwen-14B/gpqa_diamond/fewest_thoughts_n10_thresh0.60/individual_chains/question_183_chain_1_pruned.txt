Alright, I have a chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is calculated using the formula: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C +2 - H - X + N]/2. Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. But in this case, the compound is reacting, so I need to find the product first.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, the main ring is a cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond. The numbering would be such that the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, I think. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (which is a CHO) attached. And at position 5, there's a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? Wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH–). So, the structure is cyclohex-3-ene with substituents at positions 2 and 5.

Wait, so the cyclohexene has substituents: at C2, a formyl (CHO), and at C5, a vinyl (CH₂CH₂?), but wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH–. So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond at 3, and substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (CH₂CH₂– ? Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH– attached to the ring).

So the structure is cyclohexene with substituents: at C2, CHO; at C5, CH₂CH₂– but with a double bond, so it's CH₂=CH–. So the substituents themselves might have double bonds. So the starting molecule has the ring double bond (cyc
