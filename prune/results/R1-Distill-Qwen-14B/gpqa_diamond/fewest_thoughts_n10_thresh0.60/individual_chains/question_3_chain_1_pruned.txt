Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the expectation value of a certain operator for a given spin-half particle in a specific state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve calculating the average outcome of an observable over many measurements on the system.

The particle's state is given as a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. Wait, I should check if the coefficients are normalized. Let me square them and add. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1.0, so yeah, the state is normalized. Good, no issues there.

The operator in question is 10σz +5σx. Oh right, σz and σx are the Pauli matrices. I think σz is diagonal, while σx is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the states.

The expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. So I'll need to compute this for O being 10σz +5σx.

Wait, I can separate this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Because expectation values are linear, so that's easier.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value is straightforward. The state ψ is a linear combination, so when you compute ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩, each term will be the product of the coefficients squared times the corresponding eigenvalue.

I think the eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩? Or wait, is it the other way around? No, wait: σz |↑⟩ = +|↑⟩, σz |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩. So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

So let me compute ⟨σz⟩. The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. Then ⟨σz⟩ = |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1).

Wait, |a|^2 is 0.25, and |b|^2 is 3/4 which is 0.75. So 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Next, find ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is a bit trickier. I remember that σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], so it's the Pauli X matrix. To compute ⟨σx⟩, I can use the expectation value formula for spin in the x-direction.

Alternatively, since the state is in the σz basis, maybe I can express it in terms of the σx eigenstates. But I'm not sure. Another approach: express σx in terms of the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ states.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Alternatively, I can use the formula for expectation values of
