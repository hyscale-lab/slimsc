Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think this means that the state is a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, wait. So the operator has a matrix where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. Let me visualize the matrix. For a spin-1/2 particle, the basis would be |up> and |down>, so the matrix would be 2x2. So, the matrix A would look like:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Because for i≠j, it's hbar/2, and for i=j, it's zero. So, the operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Now, for such an operator, I need to find its eigenstates. Because the question is about measuring in the eigenbasis of A. The probabilities will be the square of the amplitudes of the state |alpha> in each eigenstate of A.

Wait, but wait a second. The measurement is in the eigenstates of operator A. So, |alpha> is expressed in the original basis (z basis), but the measurement is in the A basis. So, perhaps I need to change the basis.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize operator A first to find its eigenstates, express |alpha> in that basis, and then compute probabilities.

Let me think about operator A. Its matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So, to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [b, a]] are a + b and a - b, but wait, in this case, a is zero and b is hbar/2. So, the matrix is [[0, b], [b, 0]].

The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So,

| -λ      b     |
| b      -λ    |  = λ² - b² = 0 → λ² = b² → λ = ±b.

Since b is hbar/2, the eigenvalues are ±hbar/2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute it correctly. The determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ² - (hbar/2)^2. So, the determinant equation is λ² - (hbar/2)^2 = 0 → λ = ±
