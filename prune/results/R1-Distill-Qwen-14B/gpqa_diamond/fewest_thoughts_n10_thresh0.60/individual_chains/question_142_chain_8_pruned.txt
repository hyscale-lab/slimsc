Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a density matrix is. From what I remember, a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. It's a way to describe the statistical state of a system, especially when it's in a mixed state rather than a pure state.

The given density matrix is rho equals 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, so rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|) divided by 2. Let me write that out in matrix form to visualize it better.

The |0> state is [1, 0]^T, so |0><0| would be a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the top left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is [0, 0; 0, 1]. So adding those two matrices together, I get [1 0; 0 1], which is the identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2, rho becomes (1/2) * I, where I is the identity matrix. So rho is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on what exactly that refers to. I think qubit space is often represented using the Bloch sphere, which is a geometric representation of qubit states. But wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? How does this apply to a mixed state like rho here?

Oh right, for a single qubit, the state can be pure or mixed. A pure state lies on the surface of the Bloch sphere, while a mixed state lies inside. So how do we represent a mixed state like rho in the Bloch sphere?

I remember that any single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of Bloch vectors. The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector. So r is like a vector in three-dimensional space. If I can express the given rho in that form, I can find the components of r.

Let me write that equation down. The given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|) / 2. Let's compute each
