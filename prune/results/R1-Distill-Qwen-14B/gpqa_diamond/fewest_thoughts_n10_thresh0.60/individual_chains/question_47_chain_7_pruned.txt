Okay, so I have this problem where I need to identify an organic compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me start by looking at the options given and the spectral data provided.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of possible structures. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2. So it's (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. That's (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees: could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds or 3 rings), a carbonyl group, maybe an amide or ester, and perhaps an ether or something else.

The IR data shows strong absorption around 3400-3300 cm-1. Those are usually N-H or O-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group (like an amide, ester, ketone, or maybe an acid). But considering the options, it's more likely an ester or amide since those are common in the given compounds.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure is benzamide (so a benzene ring with an amide group). The substituents would be ethoxy and amide in the meta position.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Formamide has a formyl group (HCONH2, but attached to a benzene ring with an ethoxy group at para position).

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This would be a benzene ring with an amino group and a propionate ester. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, but structure would be O=C-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene with an NH2 group.

Wait, no. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so it's -O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene. Wait, no, propionate is a propionyl group, so the ester would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the benzene ring would have an amino group and an ester group, perhaps in the para positions.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Structure is 4-aminobenzoic acid esterified with ethanol. So the benzene has an amino group and a COOEt group, para to each other.

Now, let's look at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely from a CH2CH3 group. Ethyl groups usually show this. The triplet for the CH2 connected to something else.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Maybe an NH2 group? Or maybe an OCH2 group. But the broadness could suggest exchange with NH protons, but I'm not sure.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet. The splitting suggests coupling with two protons. So perhaps a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2CO something. The quartet integrating to 2H could be adjacent to an OCH2CH3 group. Or maybe a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2 connected to another CH2. Wait, ethyl esters typically have a triplet around 4.1-4.3 for the OCH2 and a quartet at 1.2 for the CH2CH3.

Wait, in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 would split into a quartet at around 1.2, but here the triplet is at 1.2 for 3H, which fits with the CH2CH3. But what about the quartet at 4.5? Maybe that's the OCH
