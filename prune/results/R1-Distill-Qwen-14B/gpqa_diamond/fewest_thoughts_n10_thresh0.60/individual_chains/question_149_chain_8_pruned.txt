Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read it through again.

The scenario is that I've got a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly like what we expect, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, each is about half the integral? Hmm, but they integrate together to 1H, which is what we expect. So maybe each is 0.5H? Or maybe the peaks are overlapping but not perfectly, so the integrals aren't exact. But the key point is that the total is 1H.

The question says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out because the coupling pattern doesn't explain it. Now, for spin-spin coupling, like between two protons, you'd usually see a splitting, like a doublet or something. But the two peaks are the same alpha-proton. Wait, alpha protons are typically adjacent to the carbonyl, right? So if the same proton is showing two peaks, perhaps it's due to some kind of diastereotopicity or something else.

Then, looking at the LC-MS. They ran it at elevated temperature and saw two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So the same mass but two peaks. At higher temps, usually, if it's a diastereomer, they might separate. Enantiomers wouldn't separate because they have the same mass and the same retention time on a normal HPLC column unless using chiral columns. But in this case, the LC-MS shows two peaks, so the molecules are different enough to separate. But the mass is same, so same molecular weight. So, same molecular formula, which suggests maybe diastereomers.

Wait, if it's a mixture of enantiomers, then the NMR would show the same pattern because enantiomers have identical NMR spectra. So in the NMR, you wouldn't see any splitting due to being a racemic mixture. But here, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, which can't be from enantiomers because their NMR would be the same. So option B is probably not the answer.

What about diastereomers? Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they'd have different NMR spectra. But wait, in this case, the NMR has two peaks for the same proton, which is in the same environment in both diastereomers? Or maybe each diastereomer has a different environment for that proton, so each has a different shift. But wait, the problem states that the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So each diastereomer has that proton, but in different environments. So in the mixture, you'd see both peaks. That makes sense. But then, the integral would add up to 2H? Or wait, each diastereomer contributes one proton, so total would be 1H per diastereomer. But in the NMR, the integral adds to 1H, which is confusing. Hmm.

Wait, no. If the mixture has two diastereomers, each with one alpha-proton, then the NMR would see each proton. So for each diastereomer, that alpha-proton would show a different shift. So in the NMR, you'd see two peaks, each integrating to 0.5H (if each diastereomer is present in equal amounts). Because the total integral would be 1H, which matches the expected 1H for that proton. Oh, that makes sense. So each diastereomer contributes half the signal.

But wait, diastereomers would have different coupling patterns as well. The question says that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So if each peak is from a different diastereomer, the coupling might be different for each, but maybe it's not so much that the coupling is causing the split. Or perhaps the coupling is from another source.

Alternatively, think about the options. Option D is diastereomers. So the NMR would
