Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's interesting. I remember that metrics describe the geometry of spacetime, and the form here looks like it's two-dimensional, maybe like a surface in some higher-dimensional space.

The question is asking about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a hyperbolic sphere. In two dimensions, it's a surface where every point has the same negative Gaussian curvature.

Wait, the metric here—the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That looks a bit like the metric for the hyperbolic plane. Let me think. The standard metric for the hyperbolic plane in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = (dr² + dz²)/z², but maybe that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, the metric could be rewritten in terms of a coordinate system where r is involved. Let me see: the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which can be written as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So, maybe if I let r² = x² + y², the denominator becomes 4(1 - r²/4), so 4(1 - (r²)/(4)).

The metric then becomes ds² = [32/(
