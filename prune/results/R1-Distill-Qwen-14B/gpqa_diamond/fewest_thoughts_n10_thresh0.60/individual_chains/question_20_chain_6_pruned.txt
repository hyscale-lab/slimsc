Okay, so I've got this question about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I remember that the impulse approximation is an assumption made in many-body problems where nucleons are treated as if they're free. Let me think about what that entails.

The question asks which four assumptions imply this "impulse" approximation. There are four given statements, numbered 1 to 4, and I need to pick the correct combination from the options A to D.

First, I'll try to recall what the impulse approximation is all about. From what I remember, the impulse approximation assumes that when two nucleons interact, they do so as if they were free particles, not considering the rest of the nucleus. So the idea is that each nucleon feels an average potential from the others but treats their interactions as instantaneous impulses. So the main points are probably that each nucleon is treated individually, the interactions are short enough that the rest of the nucleus can be ignored during the interaction, and maybe the internal structure of the nucleons (like quarks) doesn't matter much.

Let's look at the four statements:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
   This sounds like it's saying the interaction is with individual particles, not pairs or anything else. So each nucleon is treated separately, which fits the impulse idea.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
   Hmm, transparent... I think this refers to the idea that the other nucleons don't affect the interaction much. Like, when a nucleon interacts, the rest of the nucleus is considered transparent, so the interaction is only with that single nucleon. So this would mean the others don't contribute to the interaction, implying the interaction is treated as an impulse.

3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
   Wait, quarks being non-relativistic. Well, in the impulse approximation, maybe the internal structure of the nucleon (like its quarks) isn't considered in detail. If the quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps it implies that their motion is treated classically, which would simplify the calculation. But I'm not sure if this is a necessary condition for the impulse approximation. I thought the approximation mainly deals with treating the nucleon as a point particle without considering their internal structure. So if internal quarks are non-relativistic, maybe it's part of treating the nucleon as a simple entity, but I'm not certain.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.
   Oh, this makes sense. If the nucleon is experiencing no binding forces during the interaction, it's treated as free. So the binding within the nucleus is ignored, which is a key part of the impulse approximation.

So now I need to see which of these statements must be true for the impulse approximation.

The impulse approximation assumes that each nucleon interacts as a free particle, that the rest of the nucleus doesn't interfere during the interaction (like a very short time so the nucleus doesn't move much), and that the nucleon's internal structure isn't considered (or is treated simply). 

Looking at the statements again:

1. Yes, because the interaction is only with individual nucleons, not others.

2. Yes, because the nucleus is transparent, meaning only the selected nucleon interacts, others are ignored.

3. Not sure. Does the internal structure of the nucleon matter? I think in the impulse approximation, the nucleon is treated as a point particle, so perhaps it's assuming that the internal quarks don't play a significant role. But statement 3 says the quarks are non-relativistic. Wait, if they're non-relativistic, that might imply that their motion isn't too complicated. But I'm not sure if this is part of the assumptions. Maybe this isn't a necessary condition for the approximation. So perhaps statement 3 isn't required.

4. Yes, because the nucleon is treated as if it's not bound, so no forces from the nucleus during the interaction.

So the required statements are 1,2,4. Let me check the options.

Option A says 1,2,4. That's one of the options. Option B is 2,3,4. Option C is 1,2,3. Option D is 1,3,4.

Wait, but do I have to include statement 3?

The impulse approximation assumes that the internal structure of the nucleon doesn't affect the interaction. So maybe statement 3, which is about the internal quarks, is a separate assumption. Alternatively, maybe statement 3 is a different assumption about the nucleon's behavior. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think. The impulse approximation is mainly about treating each nucleon as a free particle, and the rest of the nucleus as an average potential. So the key points are:

- Each interaction is treated as a single nucleon interacting (statement 1)
- The nucleus is transparent, so only the selected nucleon is
