Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reagents to get from ethynylcyclohexane to this compound called 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, I think that's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a methyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Wait, maybe it's more like a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group, which is then connected to the main cyclohexane. And on that same carbon (the 1 position), there's a carbonyl group—so it's an aldehyde.

Wait, let me think. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so the aldehyde is on a cyclohexane. And the 1-position has another substituent, which is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, that substituent would be a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is something like cyclohexane with an aldehyde group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the same carbon.

Now, starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (which is a triple bond to CH2, so like CH2C≡CH). Wait, no, ethynyl is C≡C- attached to the ring. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡C- group. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or maybe cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2-CH3? No, ethynyl is the group —C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a C≡CH substituent. So the molecule is cyclohexane with a triple bond attached, as in cyclohexene but with a triple bond.

I'm
