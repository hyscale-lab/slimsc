Okay, so I've just started this job in a structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein using E. coli BL21. The Principal Investigator gave me the amino acid sequence, and I'm given four plasmid options to choose from. I need to figure out which plasmid is the correct one to use.

Hmm, let me think. To produce a protein in E. coli, the plasmid needs to have the correct coding sequence for the protein, right? So the plasmid should contain the gene that encodes the Human P53 protein. But wait, I remember that when you clone a gene into a plasmid for expression in E. coli, you often use a plasmid with a strong promoter, like the T7 promoter, because E. coli BL21 strains are usually T7 RNA polymerase deficient. Oh wait, no, wait, BL21 strains are often used with the T7 promoter because they have the T7 RNA polymerase under an inducible promoter, usually by IPTG. So the plasmid should have a T7 promoter before the gene.

Looking at the options, I need to check the DNA sequences of the plasmids. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a long DNA sequence. Each starts with ATG, which is the start codon. But wait, the first part might contain the promoter and other regulatory sequences.

Wait, the sequence given is the amino acid sequence of P53, so the plasmid's DNA sequence should be
