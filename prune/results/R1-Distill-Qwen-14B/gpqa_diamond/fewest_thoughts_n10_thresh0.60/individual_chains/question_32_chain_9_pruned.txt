Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy it provides to a nucleus. Hmm, the question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 maybe? Wait, no, because Li typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. Now, I need to calculate the energy of the RHIC. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so I think it's about relativistic energy here. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma times m c squared, right? So E = γ m c².

But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). The speed v is given as 0.96c, so let me compute gamma first.

So let's compute beta (β) first, which is v/c. That's 0.96. So beta is 0.96. Then, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta squared is 0.96^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.96 * 0.96. 96 * 96 is 9216, so 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714286.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Let me see: 0.0784 is exactly 784/10000, which
