Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question says that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, and I need to find the energy. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I need to understand what nucleus X is. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Lithium typically has an atomic number of 3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 because the atomic number is 3 and the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So Li-6 nucleus.

Next, I remember that the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0 * c². But since we're dealing with units where c is often factored out, maybe I can work in natural units where c=1, but I'll have to be careful with units here.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v/c = 0.96. Let's compute beta (β) as v/c, which is 0.96.

Beta squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - beta squared is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 28*28 is 784, so yes. So 1 - beta squared is 0.0784, sqrt is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². But wait, more accurately, the proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c² and neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². But maybe for this problem, using approximate values is okay, but I'll try to be precise.

Wait, but let me think: For a nucleus, the mass is the sum of the individual nucleons minus some binding energy. However, in particle physics, when calculating the rest mass, the binding energy is already considered, so we can use the atomic mass for the nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass
