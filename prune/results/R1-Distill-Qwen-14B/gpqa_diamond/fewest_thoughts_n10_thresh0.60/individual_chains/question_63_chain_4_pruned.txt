Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon, causing it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the rigid rotor model is for rotation, and non-rigid includes some vibration too. But here, the question mentions both rotation and vibration, so I think the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For a diatomic molecule, B is related to the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, r is the bond length.

Vibrational energy levels are quantized as well. The fundamental vibrational state is the lowest energy state, which is n=0. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it can either transition within the vibrational levels or change rotational levels, but in this case, it's moving to the next state with the lowest energy. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh wait, in the rotational model, the ground state is J=0. If the molecule is in the fundamental state, perhaps that refers to the vibrational ground state (n=0) and the rotational ground state (J=0
