Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state. The given data includes the masses of the atoms, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration.

Wait, wait. I remember that for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are quantized in both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state in vibration, right? So the molecule is at its lowest vibrational state and possibly in some rotational state.

Wait, but the question says it's in the "fundamental state." Oh, wait, in spectroscopy terms, the fundamental vibrational state is the lowest one, n=0. So the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, n=0. Now, it can also have rotational energy levels. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule will transition to a higher state. But the question is about the next lowest possible energy state. So what's the next state after the fundamental?

Hmm, the next state could be either a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (like J=1). But which change would result in the smallest energy difference? Because the photon's momentum would relate to the energy difference, I think.

Wait, the question asks about the lowest possible energy for the next state. So the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or its rotational state. But
