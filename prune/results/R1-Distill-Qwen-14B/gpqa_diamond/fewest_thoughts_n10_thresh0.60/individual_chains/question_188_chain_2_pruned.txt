Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have a specific structure where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distance, d, is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices and the lattice parameters. Oh wait, the formula is d = a/(sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ)), but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Oh right, the correct formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, angles, and plane (hkl) is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos γ - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos α}}} 

Wait, but wait, the exact formula might vary based on the type of crystal system. Because in cubic systems, the formula is simpler, but for rhombohedral, which is a special case of hexagonal? No, wait, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system? Or is it a separate system?

Wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of Bravais lattice.
