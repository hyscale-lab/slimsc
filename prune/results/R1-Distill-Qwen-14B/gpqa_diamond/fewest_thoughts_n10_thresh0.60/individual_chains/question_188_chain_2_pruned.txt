Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm.

Wait, what do I remember about rhombohedral crystals? Oh right, a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal too. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice parameter, right? So the lattice parameter 'a' would be 10 Angstroms.

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. I think interatomic distance in a crystal is the distance between nearest neighboring atoms. In a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter a is the same as the interatomic distance. But rhombohedral is more complex. Wait, no, in a cubic system, the lattice parameter is the edge length. In a rhombohedral, it's the same, but all angles are the same. So for a rhombohedral, a = b = c, and all angles are equal. So in this case, a is 10 Angstroms.

But wait, the question says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So yeah, a is 10 Angstrom.

The question is about the interplanar distance. I remember that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given
