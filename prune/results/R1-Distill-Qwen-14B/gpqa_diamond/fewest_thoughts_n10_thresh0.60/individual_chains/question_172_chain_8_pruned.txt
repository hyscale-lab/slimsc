Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, right, the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state. So, the ratio of excited atoms would depend on the thermal energies of the stars.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I remember that this is related to the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the population ratio between two energy states. The formula is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -Î”E / (k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

Wait, in this case, for star_1, the ratio is 2. Let me model this. Let's say for star_1, n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2. For star_2, it's n_upper2 / n_lower2 = 1 (since it's half of star_1? Or wait, no, the question says star_1's atoms are twice as excited. So maybe it's the other way around. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 times (n_upper2
