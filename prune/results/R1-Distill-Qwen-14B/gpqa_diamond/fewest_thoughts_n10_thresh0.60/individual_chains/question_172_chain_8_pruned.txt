Okay, so I've got this astrophysics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: Two stars are being studied. Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in LTE. I need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Hmm, right. So I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy states. The formula is something like n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, in the problem, it says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think that means the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is different for each star. Let me clarify.

Let me denote for star 1: the population ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 (since twice as excited). For star 2, the ratio would be n2_upper / n2_lower. The problem states that star_1's atoms are twice as excited as star_2's, so maybe n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). Wait, no, the way the question is phrased might be different. Oh, wait, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are "twice as excited" in a specific energy level. So maybe the population in the excited state is twice that in star_2's excited state? Or perhaps the ratio n_upper/n_lower is twice as much? Hmm.

Wait, the exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think that implies that the ratio of excited to non-excited (like ground state) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). But wait, no, maybe it's that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. Or perhaps the excitation is higher, so the ratio is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should model it using the Boltzmann factor. Let's say for each star, the ratio of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) to the ground state (n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, the ratio is (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), and for star 2, (n_upper2)/(n_lower2) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

But the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) is twice as high as (n_upper2)/(n_lower2). Wait
