Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions allowed by certain symmetries, up to higher dimension. The Standard Model itself respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT maintains those unless they're broken by the operators we add.

Wait, so which symmetries are these? I think the Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Poincaré symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries, so that's a bigger symmetry. Then there's the CPT symmetry, which is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal.

But wait, in SMEFT, when you write down effective operators, you have to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. So all operators must maintain Lorentz symmetry because that's a fundamental part of how the Standard Model works. Oh, wait, but the question is about what must be respected. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they transform in a way that's consistent with the Lorentz group. So option 1 is definitely included.

What about Poincaré symmetry? Poincaré includes translations as well. So when you have operators
