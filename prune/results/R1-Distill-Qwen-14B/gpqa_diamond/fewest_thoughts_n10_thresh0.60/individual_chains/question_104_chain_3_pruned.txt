Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in a star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. So the star moves a bit, and that causes the spectral lines to shift wavelengths periodically. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as each other and similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets have circular orbits. So the main variables here are the Doppler shifts observed for each star—5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. 

Wait, the question is about the orbital periods. How does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period? Hmm, I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star, which is affected by the planet's mass and the orbital period. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K equals ( (G*M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) / (2π * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) ) / ( (P) )^(1/3) ), but wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I think there's a simpler relation when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, so M_p << M_star. Then M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

Wait, but in the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (sin i) / ( (2π)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, and e is zero (circular orbit), this simplifies. Let me see. Maybe I can write K as proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps K is directly proportional to (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but the problem says the stars have the same mass, and both planets have similar masses (Neptune), so M_p is same for both. Also, since the orbits are circular, eccentricity e is zero, so the denominator terms involving e can be ignored. Also, since the inclination i is the same as detected—assuming both are edge-on (sin i = 1), which is the case when the maximum Doppler shift is observed. So, the Doppler shift amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ] * (1 / (2π)^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But since
