Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the setup: two stars with the same mass as the Sun, each having a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets, and they gave different shifts in the spectral lines. Planet 1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet 2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms.

The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet 2 is compared to Planet 1. The options are A through D, with different ratios.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The star moves in response to the planet's orbit, and this motion shifts the spectral lines. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the distance from the star.

Wait, but both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have similar masses to Neptune, so their masses are roughly the same. So the difference in the spectral line shifts must relate to other factors, like the orbital period or the size of the orbit.

Wait, no, actually, the RV method actually measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. The formula I think is something like the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (a) )^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / (2π)) ), but I might be mixing up the exact formula here. Alternatively, I remember that the maximum velocity of the star (K) is related to the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination angle (which I think is 90 degrees for maximum effect, since planets in edge-on orbits give the highest Doppler shifts).

Wait, maybe a better approach is to recall the Doppler formula. The RV method depends on the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) * (P) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π)) ) 

Wait,
