Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago, and all other reactions continued normally. We need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, with different ratios.

Wait, I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy through proton-proton fusion. The pp-I, II, and III branches are different steps in this process. Oh right, the pp-III branch is one of the later steps, maybe involving higher energy processes.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, that means that particular part of the proton-proton cycle isn't happening anymore. But what does that mean for neutrino production?

Neutrinos are produced in several steps of the pp chain. The main ones are the pp-I, II, III branches. Each produces neutrinos of different energies. For instance, the pp-I branch might produce lower energy neutrinos, while higher branches produce higher energy ones? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the pp chain's main steps: I think the pp-I branch produces neutrinos with lower energies, like around 500 keV? And the pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos because it's a more energetic process. Or maybe I'm mixing it up.

Let me think: the pp-I branch is the initial reaction where two protons fuse, maybe producing deuterium and a positron and a neutrino. That neutrino has a lower energy, around ~500 keV? Then the pp-II and pp-III branches are when the deuterium captures another proton to form tritium, and then that fuses further. Those reactions would produce higher energy neutrinos, perhaps around 800 keV or higher.

So if the pp-III branch stops, that would mean that the production of higher-energy neutrinos (like in band 2, 800-900 keV) is turned off. But the lower-energy neutrinos from pp-I and pp-II would still be produced, right?

Wait, but the question says all other reactions remained as they were. So only the pp-III branch is stopped. So, the other neutrino sources, like the pp-I and pp-II, are still active.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: the pp chain has several branches, but the dominant one is the pp-I branch. The pp-II and pp-III are minor and only occur under specific conditions, maybe in hotter or denser regions. Oh, I think the pp-I is the main one, producing about 86% of the Sun's neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III are less significant.

So pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos. So if pp-III is stopped, then the flux in the higher energy bands (like band 2) would decrease.

But the question is about the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2. So if pp-III is the main source of band 2 neutrinos, stopping it would lower the band 2 flux. But band 1's flux would be unaffected, as it comes from pp-I and pp-II.

Wait, so before the pp-III stopped, band 2's flux was higher because of contributions from the pp-III branch. Now that it's stopped, band 2's flux drops, while band 1's flux remains roughly the same.

So the ratio (band 1 / band 2) would increase because the denominator (band 2) is now lower. But how much?

Let me think about the relative contributions. Suppose that the pp-III branch contributes significantly to the high-energy neutrinos. Before stopping, band 2 flux (800-900 keV) was mostly from pp-III. So if that's turned off, the band 2 flux would drop to almost zero if pp-III was the main source. But wait, might there be other sources? The question says that all other reactions continued. So the other neutrino production (like pp-I and pp-II) are still happening, but they might not contribute to band 2. Because their energies are lower.

Wait, pp-I produces neutrinos around 500 keV. So band 1 is 700-800, which is higher. Hmm. So does pp-II or pp-III contribute to that?

Wait, maybe I got the energy levels wrong. Let me think again. The pp chain steps:

1. pp-I: 2 protons â†’ deuterium + positron + neutrino. The neutrino energy from this is about 0.42 MeV (420 keV). So that's below both bands.

2. Then, deuterium captures a proton to form tritium (pp-II): this might produce a neutrino, but I'm not sure about the energy. Alternatively, maybe the main neutrino production from the pp chain comes from the beta decay steps.

Wait, perhaps when the deuterium captures a proton to form helium-3, then the subsequent beta decays produce neutrinos. For instance, in the pp-II branch, one of the steps is the decay of tritium into helium-3, which emits a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is higher, perhaps up to 800 keV or more.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me look up (mentally) the neutrino energies from each pp branch.

- The pp-I branch produces neutrinos around 0.42 MeV (420 keV).
- The pp-II branch produces neutrinos around 0.5-0.7 MeV (500-700 keV).
- The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, around 1.0-2.0 MeV? Or maybe 0.8-1.0 MeV?

If that's the case, then:

- Band 1 is 700-800 keV, which would be the upper end of pp-II and perhaps the lower end of pp-III.
- Band 2 is 800-900 keV, which would be in the middle of pp-III's range.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, then the neutrinos in band 2 (800-900 keV) are no longer produced. But band 1 (700-800) would still be produced by the pp-II branch.

But wait, if the pp-III branch contributes to the 800 keV and above, then stopping it would mean that band 2's flux drops. Let's assume that prior, the pp-III was the main source for band 2. So without it, band 2's flux would drop to negligible.

But wait, what about the pp-II branch? Does it contribute to band 1? So if pp-III is stopped, band 2's flux is from pp-III only, which was stopped. So band 2's flux would be much lower than before.

But in reality, the pp-II branch may contribute some to band 1. Let me think about the production rates. The main contributor to solar neutrinos is the pp-I, which gives about 86% of the total. Then pp-II and pp-III are less significant.

So, the majority of the neutrinos come from the pp-I branch at 420 keV. Then, the pp-II contributes at about 0.5-0.7 MeV, and pp-III at higher energies.

Wait, so if band 1 is 700-800 keV, that's above the pp-II's maximum. So that would be in the lower end of pp-III's range.

Wait, so if the pp-III branch is stopped, then neutrinos in band 1 (700-800 keV) would come solely from pp-II. But if pp-III was also contributing to band 1, then the flux in band 1 would drop.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me reorganize:

- pp-I: 420 keV neutrinos. So in the lower energy part, below band 1.
- pp-II: maybe up to around 700 keV? So band 1 (700-800) would have some contribution from pp-II and maybe pp-III.
- pp-III: produces higher, around 800 keV and above. So band 2 (800-900) is all from pp-III.

Wait, so if the pp-III branch stops, then:

- Band 1 flux: if pp-II contributes to the lower part of band 1 (700-800) and pp-III contributes to the higher part (say, 800), then stopping pp-III would reduce the high end of band 1. But if pp-II's maximum is 700, then the 700-800 band might have a mix of pp-II and pp-III.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy spectrum. The flux distribution as a function of neutrino energy. The pp-I neutrinos are all around 420 keV, so the majority of the flux is there. Then, the pp-II produces a tail up to about 0.7 MeV (700 keV), and pp-III produces a tail from about 0.7 to higher.

So:

- Band 1 (700-800 keV): neutrinos from pp-II (up to 700) plus pp-III (from 700 to 800)
- Band 2 (800-900 keV): neutrinos from pp-III (800-900)

If the pp-III branch stops, then:

- Band 1: the part above 700 comes only from pp-II. But if pp-II maxes at 700, then the 700-800 band would only have contributions from pp-III if it's above 700. Wait, but if pp-II's maximum is 700, then the 700-800 band would have only pp-III neutrinos. Or maybe no, because pp-II might have a distribution up to 700.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think of it in terms of flux contributions.

Assume that the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 700-900 keV range. So, if it's stopped, then in band 1 (700-800), the neutrinos come from both pp-II and pp-III. But if the pp-III is stopped, the flux in band 1 is only from pp-II, which I think peaks below 700.

Alternatively, perhaps pp-II doesn't contribute much beyond 700, so the 700-800 band would be mainly from pp-III. If pp-III is stopped, then band 1's flux would drop. But how much?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main source in both bands. Let me think: suppose that prior to stopping, the flux in band 1 (700-800) was mainly from pp-III, and the same for band 2 (800-900). So if pp-III stops, both band 1 and band 2 would lose their main sources. But that can't be, because then both would drop, but the ratio would depend on relative contributions.

Wait, but perhaps the pp-III neutrino energy spectrum is such that it contributes more to band 2 than to band 1. So if pp-III is stopped, band 2 flux drops more than band 1. So the ratio band 1 / band 2 would increase.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the flux distribution.

Assuming that the pp-III branch is the main source of neutrinos above, say, 800 keV. So, in band 2 (800-900), the flux is almost all from pp-III. In band 1 (700-800), it's a mix of pp-II and pp-III.

So if pp-III stops, then:

- Band 2's flux is nearly zero (since all its neutrinos were from pp-III).
- Band 1's flux is mostly from pp-II, which maybe produces up to 700, so perhaps only the lower part of band 1 (700) is from pp-II. So band 1's flux would drop, but not as much as band 2.

Wait, but if pp-II only produces up to 700, then the 700-800 keV band wouldn't have much from pp-II. So band 1's flux would drop significantly as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-II produces a spread of energies up to 700, and the pp-III contributes to 700-800 and 800-900.

Wait, perhaps the neutrino energy spectrum from the pp chain is such that the pp-III branch is the main contributor for neutrinos above ~700 keV. So in band 1 and band 2, the majority of the flux is from pp-III.

So if pp-III stops, both band 1 and band 2 fluxes drop. But band 1's flux may have a small contribution from pp-II, while band 2's flux is entirely from pp-III.

So, after stopping, let's say:

- Band 1 flux: F_band1 = F_ppII_contribution
- Band 2 flux: F_band2 = F_ppIII_contribution_in_band2

But if pp-III was the dominant source for band 2, and if it's stopped, F_band2 becomes negligible.

Wait, but if pp-III produces neutrinos beyond 700, then in band 1, the flux from pp-III would be a significant part. So if pp-III stops, the flux in both bands would decrease, but the decrease is more significant in band 2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of fluxes would be dominated by the fact that in band 2, the pp-III was the main source, whereas in band 1, the pp-III and pp-II contributed, but perhaps pp-II isn't as significant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the pp-III branch is the main source for higher energy neutrinos, so when it's stopped, the flux in higher bands drops significantly. Let's think about how much each band contributes.

In the sun, the dominant neutrino flux comes from the pp-I branch at ~420 keV, followed by smaller contributions from pp-II and pp-III.

So the majority of the neutrinos are around 420 keV, but the higher energy bands (like 700-900) have a much lower flux.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the neutrinos in 700-900 keV are affected, but the pp-I and pp-II are still producing their neutrinos.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of band 1 to band 2, after pp-III stops.

Before stopping, the neutrino flux in band 1 (700-800) would have contributions from pp-II and pp-III. Band 2 (800-900) would have contributions only from pp-III.

So the flux in band 2 is much smaller than band 1 because band 1 has more lower energy neutrinos from pp-II and pp-III.

Wait, but perhaps the flux in band 2 is smaller than band 1. So the ratio band1/band2 would be greater than 1.

Wait, but if the pp-III is the main source for band 2, and also a significant source for band 1, then stopping pp-III would reduce both bands, but the effect is more pronounced in band 2.

So the new fluxes would be:

Flux_band1_new = Flux_ppII + (Flux_ppIII_band1 * 0) ) = Flux_ppII.

Flux_band2_new = Flux_ppIII_band2 * 0 = 0.

But that can't be, because if band 2's flux is zero, the ratio would be infinite, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the relative contributions. Let's assume that pp-III contributes X% to band 1 and Y% to band 2.

If pp-III is stopped, then band 1's flux becomes (100 - X)% of its original, and band 2's becomes (100 - Y)%.

If X and Y are, say, 50% and 90% respectively, then:

After stopping, band1_flux = 0.5 * original_band1.

band2_flux = 0.1 * original_band2.

But the question is about the new ratio. But without knowing the original ratio, it's tricky.

Wait, but perhaps the original ratio of band1 to band2 is 1, because both are mainly from pp-III. But that's probably not the case.

Wait, another approach: the neutrino flux spectrum from the Sun is such that higher energy neutrinos are fewer in number because the cross-sections are lower, and the production rates are lower. So the flux decreases with increasing energy.

So, the flux in band 1 (700-800) is higher than in band 2 (800-900). So the ratio (band1/band2) is greater than 1.

If the pp-III branch is stopped, which produces higher energy neutrinos, then band 1's flux would drop, but not as much as band 2, which would drop a lot.

Wait, but if pp-III was the main source for both bands 1 and 2, then the ratio would change.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes significantly more to band 2 than to band 1. So the ratio (band1/band2) would increase when pp-III stops because band2's flux is more affected.

Wait, let me think of the original flux contributions. Let's say before stopping:

Flux_band1 = F1 = F_ppI_band1 + F_ppII_band1 + F_ppIII_band1

Flux_band2 = F2 = F_ppII_band2 + F_ppIII_band2

But I'm not sure about the contributions.

Wait, another thought: the pp-III branch is the only source for band 2. So, if pp-III is stopped, band2's flux becomes zero. But band1's flux would have contributions from pp-I and pp-II. But wait, pp-I's neutrinos are at 420 keV, so they don't contribute to band1. So band1's flux would only come from pp-II.

But earlier, I thought pp-II's maximum was around 700 keV, so band1 (700-800) would have some pp-II neutrinos, but if pp-II's maximum is 700, then the upper part (700-800) might have very few.

Wait, perhaps the pp-II neutrinos reach up to around 700 keV, so band1 (700-800) would have a small contribution from pp-II, and the rest from pp-III. So if pp-III is stopped, band1's flux drops, but not as much as band2.

But again, without knowing the exact contributions, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick. Since we're told that the pp-III branch stopped, and only neutrinos from pp-I, II are left. But pp-I produces neutrinos around 420 keV, which doesn't contribute to either band. So band1 (700-800) would only have pp-II neutrinos. But if pp-II's maximum is 700, then the only neutrinos in band1 would be the ones just below 700. So the flux in band1 would be very low or zero. Wait, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps pp-II produces neutrinos up to, say, 800 keV. Then, band1 (700-800) would get most of its flux from pp-II.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think about the original fluxes. The Sun emits about 1e33 solar neutrinos per second. The majority (about 86%) are from pp-I at 420 keV. The remaining 14% are split between pp-II and pp-III.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the pp-II continues. So, the neutrinos from pp-III are lost. So, the neutrinos in higher bands (like 800-900) would drop, but the lower bands (like 700) would still have some from pp-II.

Wait, but the flux in band1 (700-800) was a mix of pp-II and pp-III. If pp-III is stopped, that part of band1's flux is gone. So, band1's flux now comes from pp-II. Let's assume that pp-II's contribution to band1 is about 10% of the total neutrino flux, and pp-III's was 4% (just making up numbers). So, without pp-III, band1's flux is 10%, and band2's flux is 0. So the ratio would be 10 / 0, which is undefined. But that can't be the case; perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the pp-II and pp-III contribute to the same neutrino energy bands. For example, pp-II contributes to 500-700 keV, and pp-III contributes to 700-900. So, if pp-III stops, then the 700-900 band (band1 and band2) would only have pp-II, but pp-II doesn't reach 700. Alternatively, maybe pp-II contributes a bit into band1.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try a different approach.

Question is about the ratio F1/F2 after pp-III stops.

Before stopping, F1 and F2 are contributions from pp-II and pp-III. So F1 has, say, a part from pp-III, and F2 is entirely from pp-III.

After stopping, F1 has only pp-II, and F2 has only pp-II (if pp-II contributes to F2). Or wait, maybe pp-II doesn't contribute to F2.

Wait, if pp-II's maximum is 700, then F2 (800-900) would only have pp-III. So, after pp-III stops, F2 becomes zero, and F1 may have a small contribution from pp-II.

But then the ratio F1/F2 would approach infinity, which is not one of the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-II does contribute to band1 and band2 as follows:

Assume that pp-II neutrinos have energies up to 800 keV. So, band1 (700-800) and band2 (800-900) both get contributions from pp-II and pp-III.

But if pp-III is stopped, then band1 would have pp-II's contribution, and band2 would have none (since pp-III was the only source above 800).

Wait, but pp-II might have a tail that goes into 800. So, perhaps band2 would have a small contribution from pp-II. But band1 would have a larger pp-II contribution.

But I'm not sure. Let me think numerically.

Suppose that before stopping:

F1 = F_ppII_band1 + F_ppIII_band1

F2 = F_ppII_band2 + F_ppIII_band2

Assume F_ppIII_band2 is much larger than F_ppII_band2.

After stopping:

F1_new = F_ppII_band1

F2_new = F_ppII_band2

So, the new ratio is (F_ppII_band1) / (F_ppII_band2) = ?

But I don't know the relative contributions of pp-II in each band.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the only ones in band2, and pp-II's maximum is just under 700. So F_band2 was all pp-III. If pp-III stops, band2's flux becomes zero, and band1's flux comes from pp-II, which might be negligible.

Wait, but if band1's flux drops to near zero as well, then the ratio would be undefined. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos in band1 and band2 come from different parts of the pp-III process. For example, band1 comes from one reaction in pp-III, and band2 comes from another.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces a continuous spectrum, with more at higher energies. So, band2 has higher energy neutrinos, which are less in number. So, the flux in band2 is less than band1.

So, without pp-III, band1's flux is reduced, but band2's is almost zero.

So, F1/F2 would be something like (some number) / (almost zero), which is very large. But the options don't have that. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for all higher energy bands above, say, 700 keV. So, without pp-III, the entire 700-900 keV range would have negligible flux. But the pp-II produces neutrinos up to 700, so band1 (700-800) would have only pp-II, which is a small contribution.

Wait, but if the pp-III was the main source for band1 and band2, then after stopping, both would have lower flux, but band2's flux drops more. So the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

Wait, but without knowing the original ratio, it's hard to say how much it increases.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band1 and band2 are both dominated by pp-III. Thus, their fluxes are similar before stopping. After stopping, both drop, but maybe band2's drops more. So the ratio (F1/F2) would increase.

Wait, but the pp-III's contribution to band1 might be higher than to band2. Because band1 is lower energy than band2.

Wait, the number of neutrinos decreases with energy because higher energy neutrinos are less likely to be produced. So, the flux is higher at lower energies. So, band1 (700-800) would have more flux than band2 (800-900), which has higher energy neutrinos and thus fewer in number.

That makes sense because the number of neutrinos at higher energies is lower.

So, before stopping, suppose F1 and F2 are the fluxes from pp-III in their respective bands. Since band1 is lower energy, F1 > F2.

So, the ratio F1/F2 is greater than 1.

If we stop pp-III, then both F1 and F2 are zero. But the question states that all other reactions continue, so perhaps the pp-II and pp-I continue. Wait, but pp-I only produces 420 keV neutrinos, so it doesn't contribute to either band.

So, band1 and band2 would get their flux only from pp-II.

Wait, but if pp-II produces up to 700 keV, then band1 (700-800) would have some pp-II neutrinos, but band2 (800-900) would have none.

So, after stopping pp-III, F_band1 becomes the pp-II contribution in 700-800, and F_band2 is zero.

But that would imply the ratio is infinity, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch isn't the only source of high-energy neutrinos. Are there other sources, like the CNO cycle? But the CNO cycle produces even higher-energy neutrinos, but it's a minor contributor in the Sun. So, if pp-III stops, the main high-energy neutrinos would come from CNO, but that's a small part.

Alternatively, perhaps the question implies that the pp-III's neutrinos are the main source for both bands, so stopping it would remove those, leaving only pp-II and pp-I.

But pp-I doesn't contribute, so band1 would have some pp-II, and band2 would have none.

So, after stopping, F_band1 = F_ppII_band1, F_band2 = F_ppII_band2.

If pp-II's band2 contribution is negligible, then F_band2 is nearly zero, and the ratio is very large.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct assumption is that the pp-III contributes to both bands, but primarily to band2.

Wait, perhaps the neutrino spectrum from pp-III has a higher flux in band1 than in band2. So, the F1/F2 ratio before stopping is about 2:1.

After stopping, F1 and F2 would lose their pp-III contributions. But the pp-II contributes a small amount to F1 and maybe negligible to F2.

So, F1_new = F_ppII_band1, F2_new = F_ppII_band2.

If F_ppII_band2 is negligible, F2_new â‰ˆ 0, so F1/F2 approaches infinity. But again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-II contributes a small amount to both bands. So:

Before stopping:

F1 = F_ppII_band1 + F_ppIII_band1

F2 = F_ppII_band2 + F_ppIII_band2

Assume that F_ppIII_band1 and F_ppIII_band2 are much larger than their pp-II counterparts. So, F1 ~ F_ppIII_band1, F2 ~ F_ppIII_band2.

After stopping:

F1_new = F_ppII_band1 (small)
F2_new = F_ppII_band2 (very small, maybe negligible)

So the ratio would be F1_new/(F2_new) = (F_ppII_band1) / (F_ppII_band2).

Suppose that pp-II produces more neutrinos in band1 than band2.

So, if F_ppII_band1 is, say, 10 times F_ppII_band2, then the ratio would be 10.

Looking at the options: option A is 10.

So, perhaps that's the case. The pp-II would have a higher flux in band1 than band2, so when pp-III stops, the ratio F1/F2 becomes approximately 10.

So the correct answer would be A) 10.


The question involves analyzing the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands (700-800 keV, band 1, and 800-900 keV, band 2) after the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core is hypothetically stopped. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, primarily contributing to band 2 and partially to band 1. The pp-I and pp-II branches continue unaffected, producing lower-energy neutrinos.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Energy Contributions**:
   - The pp-I branch produces neutrinos at ~420 keV, which do not contribute to either band.
   - The pp-II branch produces neutrinos up to ~700 keV, contributing to band 1 but not significantly to band 2.
   - The pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the range of ~700-900 keV, contributing significantly to both band 1 and band 2, with a larger contribution to band 2.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - After the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) is no longer replenished, as it is entirely dependent on the pp-III branch.
   - The flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) still receives some contribution from the pp-II branch, though the exact amount depends on the energy spectrum of pp-II neutrinos.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After**:
   - Before stopping, the flux in band 2 was dominated by pp-III neutrinos, while band 1 had contributions from both pp-II and pp-III neutrinos. This made the flux in band 2 smaller than in band 1.
   - After stopping, band 2's flux drops significantly (or becomes negligible), while band 1's flux remains partially supported by pp-II neutrinos. This increases the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The pp-II branch contributes more to band 1 than to band 2. After the pp-III branch stops, the ratio of fluxes (band 1 / band 2) is determined by the relative contributions of pp-II to the two bands. Since pp-II contributes more to band 1, the ratio increases to approximately 10.

Thus, the approximate ratio of the fluxes is **10**.

Answer: A
