Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra, which should help in determining the structure of Compound X.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But more precisely, the broad range suggests maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but in the NMR, I see a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet. That's a really high chemical shift, which often corresponds to a carboxylic acid proton or maybe an aldehyde. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but more importantly, their protons are split into specific patterns. Wait, a singlet at 10.5 might be the -COOH proton. Because in a carboxylic acid, the H is usually a broad singlet, so that fits.

Then, looking further, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. But since I see a broad peak in IR from 3400-2500, which is a strong O-H stretch, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, the O-H in a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak around 2500-3300. So the 3400-2500 might be the O-H, and the 1720 is the C=O of the carboxylic acid.

Another IR peak is 1610 cm-1. That's in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. Also, 1450 cm-1 is likely the C-O-C stretching in an ester or maybe another type of aromatic substituent.

Now, looking at the NMR data. Let's go through each peak:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): As I thought earlier, this is probably the -COOH proton.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region, a doublet. So maybe two protons in a para-substituted benzene ring.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, same as above but maybe in a different position, so the two sets of doublets suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring, perhaps with a substituent that causes splitting. 

Then, 2.9 ppm (m,1H): This is a multiplet, maybe a CH group attached to something else, like an adjacent CH2.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps two protons that are part of a CH2 group adjacent to a CH or something else.

1.4 ppm (d,3H): A triplet of three protons as a doublet, perhaps a methyl group
