Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid. Because acid chlorides react with HI in the presence of phosphorus to give the corresponding carboxylic acid. Alternatively, sometimes they're used for the dehydrohalogenation, but I think in this case, it's more about the hydrolysis of an acid chloride.

So, the first step is to figure out what Compound X is. The data given are IR and H NMR spectra. Let me look at the IR data first.

The IR shows strong absorption around 3400-2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, which probably indicates O-H stretchâ€”like from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is an N-H stretch, but I don't think that's relevant here since the options are about aromatic compounds with substituents.

Looking further, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl group. Now, where do we see 1720? For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, but maybe a bit higher. For esters, it's around 1735-1745. Wait, 1720 could be an ester or perhaps a ketone, but more likely ester or acid. Hmm.

Then there's a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Now the H NMR. Let's break it down.

Protons are split into several signals:

1. 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's a strong indicator of an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Because in the carboxylic acid, the -OH proton is usually around 10
