Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I remember about symmetries in SMEFT? I think SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators consistent with the Standard Model (SM) symmetries. So SMEFT extends the SM by adding higher-dimensional operators, but these operators must still respect the same symmetries as the SM.

So, what symmetries does the SM respect? The Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, which is the combination of rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is biggerâ€”it includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's the full symmetry of special relativity. Wait, but in SMEFT, do all operators automatically respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, in the effective theory approach, the operators are built from the SM fields, and the SM fields transform under Poincare. But in SMEFT, when you write operators, they are required to be Lorentz-invariant. Because the SM already has Lorentz invariance, any operator you add must also be Lorentz-invariant. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must. But what about Poincare?

Wait, Poincare includes not just Lore
