Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's try to break this down.

First, I need to understand the requirements for each spectrograph. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, that means any star with V mag ≤17 is observable by ESPRESSO. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V mag ≤16 for HIRES.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's phrased is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. But wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, a star that's magnitude 17 is fainter than one that's 16. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, which would be V mag <=17. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, so V mag <=16. So, a star needs to be detectable by both, so it must be observable by both. That means its apparent V magnitude must be <=16 because that's the stricter condition. Because if it's <=16, it's definitely <=17, so ESPRESSO can see it. If it's only <=17 but greater than 16, then HIRES can't.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star's apparent V magnitude has to be <=16 because that's the limit for HIRES, and since ESPRESSO's limit is higher (brighter than 17 means fainter than 17 mag), which is a more lenient condition. So the star must have V mag <=16 for both to detect it.

So now I need to compute the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which ones are <=16.

Let's go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5 mag, distance 10 pc.

Apparent magnitude (m) is calculated as m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs.

So M is
