Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me, and I need to figure out which of the stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star determines whether it can be observed with a particular spectrograph. Each instrument has its own magnitude limit. The question says that ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can go down to 16. So any star with V mag ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, but HIRES requires V mag ≤16.5 or so, because if the apparent magnitude is higher than that, it's too faint.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's worded: "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So "brighter than 17" would mean apparent V magnitude less than 17. Because the scale is inverted. So a star with apparent magnitude 16 is brighter than 17, so it can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, "brighter than 16 V mag" → apparent V ≤16.

Wait, no, no. Let me think again. The way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Since apparent magnitude is how bright it appears, and lower numbers mean brighter. So if a star has an apparent magnitude of 16, that's brighter than 17, so it can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 16 can be observed, which means apparent V magnitude ≤16.

So the star must satisfy two conditions: it must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 for HIRES, because both are necessary. Because the question says which stars can be detected with both. So the star must have apparent V magnitude ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if it's ≤16, it can be observed by both. Because ESPRESSO goes up to 17, so anything ≤17 works for ESPRESSO, but for HIRES, only
