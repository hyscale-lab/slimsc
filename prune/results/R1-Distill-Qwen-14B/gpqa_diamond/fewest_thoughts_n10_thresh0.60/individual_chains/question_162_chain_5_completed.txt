Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But here, I think it's probably a 2-dimensional space because it's only got dx and dy terms. Oh wait, no, actually, the metric is written as a 2-dimensional line element, but maybe embedded in a higher dimension?

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. I think a pseudosphere is like a surface of constant negative curvature. The term pseudosphere might be a bit confusing, but I remember that in geometry, a pseudosphere is a surface with infinite extent but finite area. Oh right, like the tractricoid, which is the surface of a pseudosphere.

So, the area of a pseudosphere with radius r is known, right? I think the formula is something like 4πr², but wait, no. Wait, wait, for a regular sphere, the area is 4πr². But a pseudosphere has negative curvature, so maybe it's different.

Wait, wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and I think its Gaussian curvature is negative. But when it comes to the area, does that affect the result? Or maybe the area is still finite despite being infinitely large.

Wait, actually, I think the area of a pseudosphere is 4πr², same as a sphere, but that can't be right because the pseudosphere is non-compact. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. For a sphere, the area is 4πr², and the Gaussian curvature is positive. For a pseudosphere, which is a surface of revolution of a tractrix, the curvature is negative.

But what about the area? I'm a bit confused now. Wait, maybe the metric given can help me find the area.

The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the line element is in terms of x and y, but this looks like a 2D metric. Wait, but the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that when x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up. So maybe this is a coordinate system that's only valid outside a certain radius.

Wait, perhaps this represents a surface of revolution. Hmm, or maybe it's a 2D surface in higher dimensions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metric on a spacetime with two spatial dimensions?

But the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a 2D surface with a specific metric. I'm trying to remember: the pseudosphere metric is often written in terms of coordinates that cover the entire surface except for a point at infinity.

Wait, another approach: to find the area, I can integrate the area element over the surface.

The area element in a 2D metric is given by sqrt(g_xy) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Wait, no, the area element is the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. Wait, or wait, in 2D, the metric is diagonal if it's written as ds² = A dx² + B dy², then the determinant is A*B, so the area element is sqrt(A*B) dx dy.

In this case, the metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] for both dx² and dy². So the determinant g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. So the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, which is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

So the total area would be the integral over all x and y of (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. But wait, what are the limits? Because the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), that suggests that x² + y² < 4, otherwise the metric isn't defined (since the denominator would be zero or negative, but the metric would have issues). So the region of integration is the disk where x² + y² < 4.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So maybe the radius here is 2, so the region is a disk of radius 2. So the area would be the integral over x² + y² < 4 of (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Hmm, that integral looks a bit tricky. Let me switch to polar coordinates, because x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute that. The integral over θ is straightforward: it's 2π. So the area becomes 32 * 2π * ∫ (from 0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

So that's 64π ∫ (r / (4 - r²)) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-du/2) = r dr. So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [ r dr/(4 - r²) ] = ∫ (from 4 to 0) [ (-du/2)/u ].

Which is the same as (-1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) du. That becomes (-1/2) [ln |u| ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but wait, when u approaches 0 from the positive side (since r approaches 2 from below), 4 - r² approaches 0 from above. So u is positive, so the integral is ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du. But wait, we can switch the limits and drop the negative sign: ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du.

Wait, no, let me recheck. Let me re-express:

The substitution gives r dr = (-du/2). So when r increases from 0 to 2, u decreases from 4 to 0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [ (-du/2) / u ].

Which is the same as (-1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 du/u.

Which is the same as (1/2) ∫ from 0 to4 du/u.

So (1/2) [ln u] evaluated from 0 to4. Hmm, but ln u as u approaches 0 is negative infinity. So this integral would diverge. Wait, but that can't be right because the pseudosphere should have a finite area.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the integral. Because the metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, perhaps when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, which would make the line element blow up, implying that the surface extends infinitely in that direction. But in reality, the pseudosphere is a surface with finite area but infinite extent, like a horn.

So the area we're trying to compute might actually be infinite. Wait, but the integral I computed seems to be diverging. Let me see:

The integral ∫ (from 0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches 0. The integrand behaves like [r/(4 - r^2)] which near r=2 is approximately 2/(4-4 + something small). Wait, no, more accurately, let me set r = 2 - ε, where ε is small. So 4 - r² = 4 - (4 -4ε + ε²) ) ≈ 4ε. So the integrand near r=2 is approximately (2 - ε)/ (4ε) ≈ (2)/(4ε) = 1/(2ε).

So as ε approaches zero (r approaches 2), the integrand behaves like 1/(2ε), which when integrated over dr from, say, 2-ε to 2, gives ∫ (1/(2ε)) dε = (1/(2ε)) * ε) ) = 1/2. But wait, that's the contribution near r=2. So the integral from 0 to 2 is convergent?

Wait, no. Wait, let's recompute the integral ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²).

Let me make u substitution: u = 4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)] = ∫ (-du/2)/u = (-1/2) ∫ (du/u) = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

Evaluating from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2, u=0 → ln(0) is negative infinity.

Wait, so ( -1/2 [ ln(u) ] ) from 4 to 0 → [ (-1/2)(ln 0) ) - (-1/2)(ln 4) ) ] → [ ( -1/2 * (-infty) ) ) + (1/2 ln4) ) ] → which is positive infinity.

Wait, so that means the integral diverges. So the area would be infinite? But that can't be right because I thought the pseudosphere has a finite area. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in interpreting the metric. Let me think again. The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)](dx² + dy²).

Wait, perhaps this is a metric in two dimensions, but the area might not be computed in the same way. Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are not the standard polar coordinates, or maybe I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another thought: the line element given might be similar to that of the hyperbolic plane, which has negative curvature. The hyperbolic plane has infinite area, but a pseudosphere is a finite area surface with constant negative curvature, sort of like a " horn" shape.

Wait, but in the case of the hyperbolic plane, the metric is usually written in terms of (dr² + (a^2 sinh²(r/a)) dθ²), which doesn't directly look like this. Alternatively, perhaps this metric is for a hyperbolic space, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about what a pseudosphere is. It's a surface in 3D space with constant negative curvature, and it's topologically equivalent to a sphere with a point removed (like a sphere with a "north pole" missing). It has finite area but is infinitely long in one direction.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere is given by 4πr², but I'm not sure. Wait, no, no, that's the area of a regular sphere. For a pseudosphere, which is a surface of revolution of a tractrix, the area is 4πr². Or wait, maybe it's 8πr²? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is zero because it's a pseudosphere. No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the area is infinite because the integral diverges, which would make the area infinite.

Wait, but in the calculation above, the area integral came out to be infinite. So the area would be infinite. Looking back at the options, option D says +infty.

But wait, another thought: the metric given could be that of a pseudosphere with a specific radius. So, perhaps the area is 4πr², but r=2, so 16π. But wait, the options don't have that. Let me look again:

Options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

Wait, so the area is either zero, some function of x and y, or infinite. So in our calculation, the integral diverges, so the area is infinite, which would point to option D.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the metric given is for a compact surface, but I don't think so because the denominator (4 -x² -y²) in the metric suggests that as x² + y² approaches 4, the metric becomes singular. So the region is up to radius 2, but the integral over that region diverges, leading to infinite area.

So the area of the pseudosphere in this case would be infinite, which would correspond to option D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute the area, we use the area element in a 2D metric, which is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( g \) is the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant of the metric tensor is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The total area is obtained by integrating \( dA \) over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) suggests that the region of integration is the disk \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), corresponding to a radius of 2. Converting to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) is straightforward, yielding \( 2\pi \). Thus:

\[
A = 64\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln|u|\right]_4^0 = \frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(0) - \ln(4)\right].
\]

As \( \ln(0) \) approaches \( -\infty \), the integral diverges. This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D) \( +\infty \)**.
