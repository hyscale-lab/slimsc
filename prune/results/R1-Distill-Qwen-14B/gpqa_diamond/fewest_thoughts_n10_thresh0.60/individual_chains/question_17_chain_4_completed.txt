Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the formation constant (Kf) plays a big role. The Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, but EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so in solution, it usually exists in different protonated forms. Oh, right, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so I don't need to worry about that. Maybe the pH is such that EDTA is in its deprotonated form, Y^4-, so the reaction is straightforward.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So, the total concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

The formation constant Kf is given by the formula:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Wait, but in this case, I think [EDTA^4-] is the concentration of free EDTA. Let me think about the initial setup.

We have the complex CaEDTA^2- at 0.02 M. So, at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's let the concentration of free Ca²+ be x, and the concentration of free EDTA be y. So, according to the Kf expression:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * y)

But wait, I have two variables here, x and y. How can I solve for x with just one equation? Oh, right! Because in the solution, the total concentration of EDTA species is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. But wait, EDTA is a ligand that can form complexes, but here the solution only contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA (y) and the complex (0.02). Wait, no, because EDTA is part of the complex. So actually, the total EDTA in solution is the sum of free EDTA (y) and the EDTA bound in the complex (which is 0.02 M). So:

Total EDTA = y + 0.02 M.

But wait, the initial concentration of EDTA would be that total. Wait a second—this is a bit confusing. Let me try to frame this properly.

Wait, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the total EDTA in solution is 0.02 M because all the EDTA is tied up in the complex. Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand that forms a 1:1 complex with Ca²+ here. So, if the complex is 0.02 M, then the total EDTA is 0.02 M, since each complex has one EDTA.

Wait no, that's not right. Because the EDTA comes from a solution where some is free and some is in the complex. Oh, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the dissociation of the complex. The complex dissociates as CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The Kf for this reaction is 5e10. So, Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-]

Which rearranges to [Ca²+] = (Kf * [CaEDTA^2-]) / [EDTA^4-].

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let's consider the expression again.

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

We know Kf is 5e10, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. So,

5e10 = 0.02 / (x * y), where x is [Ca²+] and y is [EDTA^4-].

So, x*y = 0.02 / 5e10.

x*y = 4e-13.

But, wait, what's the relationship between x and y? For every mole of complex that dissociates, it produces 1 mole of Ca²+ and 1 mole of EDTA^4-. But we started with 0.02 M complex, which is the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in solution.

Wait, no, because the solution is prepared with the complex. So, initially, all the EDTA is in the complex. Then, some of it dissociates. Let me model the dissociation.

Let’s let s be the degree of dissociation. Then:

[Ca²+] = s * 0.02

[EDTA^4-] = s * 0.02

And the concentration of the complex is 0.02 - s*0.02 = 0.02 (1 - s)

But for such a large Kf, which is 5e10, the dissociation of the complex will be very small. So s is very small. Hence, (1 - s) ≈ 1. So, [Ca²+] ≈ s*0.02, [EDTA^4-] ≈ s*0.02, and [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02.

So, substituting into the Kf expression:

Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]

= (s * 0.02) * (s * 0.02) / 0.02

= (s² * 0.0004) / 0.02

= s² * 0.02

So,

5e10 = 0.02 * s²

s² = 5e10 / 0.02

s² = 5e10 / 2e-2 = (5/2) * 1e12 = 2.5e12.

Wait, that can't be right because s is a small number (since Kf is large, dissociation is minimal). But s² is 2.5e12, which would make s about sqrt(2.5e12) ≈ 5e6. That's way larger than 1, which contradicts our assumption that s is small.

Hmm, that suggests that the assumption s is small is incorrect, which means we need a different approach. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the problem.

Alternative approach: Let’s consider that the concentration of free Ca²+ is x, and the concentration of free EDTA is y. But the total concentration of EDTA is (y + 0.02 M) because the EDTA comes from the complex. Wait, no, that's not correct. The EDTA in solution is the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA in the complex. So,

Total EDTA = y + 0.02 M.

But wait, the original solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex, so the initial EDTA concentration is 0.02 M. But some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the total EDTA is 0.02 M, because the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, no. The initial solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So, when it dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the total concentration of EDTA species (free and in complex) is 0.02 M.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The initial solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So when it dissociates, the total EDTA is 0.02 M because each complex has one EDTA.

So, [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

But [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M (as given), so [EDTA^4-] must be 0. So that can't be right because then [Ca²+] would be zero, but that's not possible.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The solution is 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of EDTA is 0.02 M because each complex contains one EDTA. So, the amount of free EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + other protonated forms, but the problem says pH is ideal, so it's in the Y^4- form, I think.

Wait, no, the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I can assume that all the EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So, [EDTA^4-] is the same as the free EDTA concentration.

So the setup is:

Total EDTA = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

So,

[EDTA^4-] = 0.02 - [CaEDTA^2-]

But [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, so that would imply [EDTA^4-] is zero, which can't be right. That suggests that the assumption is incorrect, which can't be possible. So, I must have made a mistake in how I set up the problem.

Wait wait, perhaps the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 0.02 M. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. When it dissociates, some of the complex breaks into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, let me let the change be as follows:

Let’s define the dissociation as:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

Let’s let s be the concentration that dissociates. So,

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02 (since Kf is large, s will be very small, so 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02).

[Ca²+] = s

[EDTA^4-] = s

So substituting into the Kf expression:

Kf = ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) / [CaEDTA^2-]

= (s * s) / (0.02)

So,

5e10 = s² / 0.02

s² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9

s = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 3e4 M is way higher than the concentration of the solution. That's impossible. So, this suggests that the assumption that s is very small is invalid. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So, the amount of free Ca²+ is x, and the amount of free EDTA is y.

So:

x = concentration of Ca²+ = [Ca²+] = ?

y = [EDTA^4-] = ?

The Kf equation is:

Kf = (x * y) / (0.02 - x - y) )

Wait, but since Kf is so large, the denominator (0.02 - x - y) must be approximately 0.02, because x and y are very small compared to 0.02. So, we can approximate:

Kf = (x * y) / 0.02 ≈ 5e10

So,

x * y ≈ 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9.

But now, what's the relationship between x and y? Since each mole of complex that dissociates gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-, the concentrations x and y should be equal. Because for every s that dissociates, x = s and y = s.

So, if x ≈ y ≈ s, then:

x² ≈ 1e9 → x ≈ sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M.

But that's again impossible because the solution can't have such a high concentration. This suggests that my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, that can't be. So perhaps I'm not considering that the concentration of EDTA comes from the complex, but when it dissociates, the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex.

Wait, let me model it properly.

Let’s say the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is C = 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, some of it dissociates, so:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

Let’s say the amount dissociated is x. So:

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

[CaEDTA^2-] = C - x ≈ C, since x is much smaller than C.

So, Kf = (x * x) / (C - x) ≈ (x²) / C.

So,

x² = Kf * C.

x = sqrt(Kf * C)

Wait, that makes sense.

So, plugging in the numbers:

Kf = 5e10, C = 0.02 M.

x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9.

x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M.

Wait, that's 31,623 M, which is way higher than 0.02 M. That can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the Kf expression again.

Wait, Kf is the formation constant for the complex. The correct expression is:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

So, rearranged, [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] = [CaEDTA^2-]/Kf.

Ah, that's it. So,

x * x = [CaEDTA^2-]/Kf → x² = (0.02) / (5e10) → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 2e-6.5?

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7, so 2e-6.5 is around 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 10^(-6.5) = 2 * (10^0.5 * 10^-7) ) = 2 * (3.16 * 10^-7) ) → approximately 6.32e-7 M.

So, that's around 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of free calcium ions be \( x \). At equilibrium, the concentration of free EDTA ions will also be \( x \), and the concentration of the complex will remain approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \) because \( K_f \) is very large, making dissociation minimal.

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
