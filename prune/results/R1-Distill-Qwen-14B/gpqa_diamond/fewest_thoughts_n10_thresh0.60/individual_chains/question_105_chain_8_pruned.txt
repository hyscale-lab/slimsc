Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when we observe the star's brightness over time, it'll vary periodically as the star rotates. The problem says this situation can mimic an exoplanet's effect on the star's light curve. The question is asking, to produce the same amplitude in brightness variation, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star's radius, assuming no spots?

Hmm. So, I think I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to the variation caused by a planet transiting in front of the star. The amplitude of the dip in brightness (the change in flux) depends on the size of the blocking object relative to the star. But wait, the spots are not black; they are just cooler, so they emit less light. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing the total brightness to dip and rise again. Similarly, a planet transiting in front of the star blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness.

Wait, the problem says, "if the star was not covered by spots!" So we're comparing the brightness variation due to the spots (as if it were a planet) to an actual planet. But I'm a bit confused. Let's clarify.

First, when the star has spots, its brightness varies as the spots rotate into and out of view. The amplitude of this variation depends on the spots' coverage and their temperature difference compared to the rest of the star. Alternatively, a planet would cause a dip in brightness when it transits in front of the star. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.

The problem says that the observed brightness variation from the spots is similar to what an exoplanet would cause. So, we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do. So, we can compute the relative brightness change from the spots and set that equal to the
