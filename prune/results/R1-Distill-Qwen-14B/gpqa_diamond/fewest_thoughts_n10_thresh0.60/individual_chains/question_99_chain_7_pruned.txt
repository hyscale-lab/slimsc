Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question gives me information from two characterization techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. Let's look at each piece of data and see what they can tell us about the structure.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak suggests hydrogen bonding, which is typical of carboxylic acids because their -OH groups are more acidic and tend to form strong hydrogen bonds, leading to a broad peak. So, this makes me think the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Another strong absorption is at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have strong absorption around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹, so that fits with the earlier thought about the compound being a carboxylic acid. So, the presence of both the broad peak and the strong absorption around 1700 confirms that the compound has a carboxylic acid functional group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. The question states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, typically appearing in the range of 4.5-7 ppm as multiplets. The absence of such signals suggests that the compound doesn't have any double bonds, meaning it's probably a saturated molecule. So, no alkenes or aromatic rings here.

Now, looking at the splitting patterns in the NMR. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Splitting patterns can give information about the neighboring protons and the structure around them.

Let me think about each splitting term. A doublet means each proton is split into two by one neighboring set of protons. A triplet is splitting into three, which usually comes from two neighboring protons, like in an ethyl group (CH2CH3). A quartet is four peaks, which comes from three neighboring protons.

So, a doublet of triplets would be a signal split first into a doublet (by one neighbor) and then each of those split into triplets (by another set of two neighbors). So, that's two different coupling constants, perhaps from different groups of protons.

Similarly, a doublet of triplets of triplets is more complex. That would mean first a doublet (one neighbor), then each of those splits into triplets (another neighbor), and then each of those splits again into another triplet (third neighbor). That's getting complicated, but maybe it's due to vicinal (adjacent) coupling with multiple sets of protons.

Let me consider the possible structures given in the options. The options are varying in terms of branching and substituents around the carboxylic acid group.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, this looks like a structure with two ethyl groups attached to a central carbon, and another ethyl group attached to another carbon adjacent to the COOH. Wait, maybe it's pentyl or something else? Hmm, wait, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, the central two carbons each have a CH attached to two ethyl groups, and then a CH2 leading to COOH. So, this seems like a gem-dimethyl (but gem-diethyl) situation, but perhaps in a four-carbon chain leading to COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So, this structure has a -CH2CH2- group, and then a central carbon with substituents. Wait, more accurately: The structure is CH3-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the central two carbons each
