Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The problem states: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm. First, I think I should recall how relative velocity works in special relativity. Unlike classical mechanics where you just subtract the speeds, relativity has a different formula because of the speed limit c. The formula for relative velocity u between two objects moving at u1 and u2 relative to a stationary observer is u = (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1 u2)/c²). 

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Actually, I think the formula is u = (u1 - u2) / [1 - (u1 u2)/(c²)]. So if both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference divided by 1 minus the product over c squared. Right.

So in this case, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both in the positive x. So from astronaut 2's frame, astronaut 1's speed would be u = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - ( (0.6c * 0.5c) ) / c².

Wait, (0.6c * 0.5c) is 0.3 c². Divided by c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u = 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.142857...c. Approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. That would match options C and D for the relative speed part.

Now, for the total energy of the system. Hmm. The total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So each astronaut's energy would be:

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) 

0.6 squared is 0.36. So sqrt(1 - 0.36) = sqrt(0.64) = 0.8.

So gamma1 = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Thus E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly, for the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) 

0.5 squared is 0.25. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² = approximately 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel is 0.14c and E is 5.96 mc². Option D has E=5mc², which is less than our calculation. So the correct total energy is about 5.96 mc².

So the relative speed is 0.14c and E is about 5.96 mc². That's option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. Because sometimes I get confused about the direction. Oh wait, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed is correct. So yes, 0.14c.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative velocity between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u_1 - u_2}{1 - \frac{u_1 u_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u_1 = 0.6c \) and \( u_2 = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
u = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

The numerator is \( 0.1c \), and the denominator is:

\[
1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus, the relative velocity is:

\[
u = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

From the calculations, the relative velocity is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy is \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.

Answer: C
