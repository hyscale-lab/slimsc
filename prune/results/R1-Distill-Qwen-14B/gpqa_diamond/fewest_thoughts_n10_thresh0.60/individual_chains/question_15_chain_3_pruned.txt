Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let's try to break this down. 

So the situation is, there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits, which probably means their orbital planes are more aligned, affecting the transit probability. 

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting. Oh wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but same radius. So same radius for both stars.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. The formula I think is P = (R_star / a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_planet^2 / R_star^2)) )... Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Or wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R*/a) multiplied by (something about the inclination). Oh, right, the probability for a planet to transit is roughly (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis). Because the transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on, which is a fraction of the possible orientations. 

Wait, so the probability P is approximately (R*/a) multiplied by (1 / (something else?)). Oh wait, another thought: the transit probability, P, is given by (R*/(a*(1 - e^2)^0.5)) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 + (m_planet/m_star)^2)) ), but since e is zero here (circ orbits), that part becomes 1. Also, since the planet masses are the same but the stars have different masses, the (1 / sqrt(1 + (m_p/m_s)^2)) would be the same for both, because the mass ratio m_p/m_s is the same if m_p is same and m_s varies. Wait, no: Planet_1's host is more massive. So m_p is same, but m
