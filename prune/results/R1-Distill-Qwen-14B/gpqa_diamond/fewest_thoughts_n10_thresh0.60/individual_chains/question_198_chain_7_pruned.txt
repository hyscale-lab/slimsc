Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, so I remember that stability constants are used to determine the concentration of metal-ligand complexes in solution. The higher the stability constant, the more stable the complex.

Wait, what's a dithiocyanato complex? Oh right, that's a complex with two SCN- ligands. So forCo(II), the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]^-, and [Co(SCN)4]^2-. Since the stability constants are given in order β1 to β4, I think each β corresponds to the complex with n ligands where n is the subscript. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂], β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]^-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

Wait, but wait, the way β is defined is important. I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So the formation reaction would be Co²+ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n). So βn is [ [Co(SCN)_n^(2−n)] ] / ( [Co²+][SCN⁻]^n ).

So the total cobalt concentration c(Co) is the sum of all the species: [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]. Wait, but wait, the question says "the blue dithiocyanato" which is probably the [Co(SCN)2] complex, which I think is the blue one. So the percentage we're looking for is the concentration of [
