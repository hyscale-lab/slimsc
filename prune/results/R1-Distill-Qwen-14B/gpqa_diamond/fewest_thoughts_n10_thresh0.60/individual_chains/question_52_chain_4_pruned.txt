Okay, so here's the question I'm trying to solve. Let me read it carefully and break it down.

Astronomers are studying a star with 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (levels 1 and 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, so the ratio N1/N2 when there are no spots is higher than when there are spots. The question is asking for the factor, which would be (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

Wait, the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so (N1/N2)_noSp / (N1/N2)_withSp = some factor greater than 1.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), right? The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature.

The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy. So, the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) / (g2/g1). Or wait, wait. Let me get the formula right.

The ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Alternatively, sometimes the equation is written as N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So N1/N2 would then be the inverse of that.

But wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet. So the energy difference between the two levels is related to the photon's energy, which is E = hc/λ. So I can compute the energy difference.

But first, let's figure out what temperature we're using. The star's overall Teff is 5500 K when it has spots. But wait, the spots are cooler. Wait, no, the effective temperature is the overall blackbody emission, considering the spots. So the star's photosphere not covered by spots is at 6000 K, and spots are darker, implying lower temperature.

But wait, the question says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the Teff is an average, but the photosphere of the spots themselves must be at a lower temperature. But for the problem, the question only deals with the photosphere. So when the spots are present, the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Or wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. No, the effective temperature is an overall measure, so the presence of
