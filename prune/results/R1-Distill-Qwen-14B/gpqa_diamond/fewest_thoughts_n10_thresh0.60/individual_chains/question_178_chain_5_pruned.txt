Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian given, and I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

The Lagrangian is L_int = κ \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) times the commutator of the gamma matrices, [γ_μ, γ_ν]. Oh wait, right, σ_{μν} is antisymmetric because the commutator is antisymmetric, I think.

So first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should probably determine the mass dimensions of each field and term in the Lagrangian and see what that implies for κ.

In quantum field theory, the mass dimension of an operator is important because the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions since the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ=c=1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Let's consider each part:

The fields involved are ψ (the fermion field) and F^{μν} (the field strength tensor, which is for a boson field, maybe like the electromagnetic field). Wait, but this Lagrangian looks more like an interaction term, perhaps between a fermion and a gauge field. Oh right, because F is the field strength, which is the derivative of the gauge field, A.

So first, I need to recall the mass dimensions of these fields.

In four dimensions, the fermion field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because for a Dirac spinor, the field ψ has dimension (d-1)/2, where d is the spacetime dimensions. So in d=4, (4-1)/2=3/2.

The field strength tensor F^{μν} for a gauge field (like the photon in electromagnetism) has mass dimension 2. Because F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, and A has dimension 1 (since it's a gauge field, which is a vector potential, so [A]_M = 1). Therefore, each derivative ∂ has dimension 1, so F has dimension 1 + 1 = 2.

Now, looking at the term σ_{μν}: since it's made from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (they're just matrices), the structure σ_{μν} is a dimensionless object. So the term σ_{μν} doesn't contribute to the mass dimension.

So the term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by the product of ψ, σ, ψ, and F. Let me write that out:

κ * ψ^† σ ψ F.

Wait, no, in the Lagrangian it's \bar{ψ} σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So the term is \bar{ψ} (which is ψ^† γ^0) multiplied by σ_{μν} ψ, then multiplied by F^{μν}.

So each ψ has dimension 3/2, so two ψs give 3/2 *
