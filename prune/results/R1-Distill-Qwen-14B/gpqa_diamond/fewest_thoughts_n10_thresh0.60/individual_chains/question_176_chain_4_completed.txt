Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state of a system is described by a vector, and observables are represented by matrices. The problem is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence.

The state vector at time t is given as (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, wait, I think in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors, meaning their length (or norm) is 1. Let me check: the square of the magnitude is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so this vector isn't normalized. I should probably normalize it before proceeding. Because when you calculate probabilities, you need the normalized state.

So the normalized state would be the original vector divided by the square root of 6. So the state vector becomes ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ). Let me make a note of that.

Now, the first operator is P, and the second is Q. The measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q. The question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and Q first.

Let me look at the matrix for P. It's a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, to find the eigenvalues, I might need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0. But that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix has some symmetry that can help.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the possible eigenvalues by looking for patterns. Let me think: P looks like it's a symmetric matrix, so real eigenvalues.

Wait, what about the structure of the matrix. The diagonal elements are zero except the middle element is zero as well. The off-diagonal elements are 1/sqrt(2) in certain positions.

Wait, perhaps P is a symmetric matrix with a particular structure. Let me write it out:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Hmm, I wonder if this matrix has a particular eigenvalue structure. Maybe it's a circulant matrix or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the trace and determinant for the characteristic equation.

The trace of P is 0, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The determinant is a bit more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find eigenvectors by assuming that the eigenvectors have certain symmetries.

Another approach: perhaps P is a combination of Pauli matrices, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 or something similar, but scaled.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the eigenvalues numerically. Let's try.

The characteristic equation is:

| P - λ I | = 0

So the determinant of:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]
[0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Let me compute this determinant.

Expanding along the first row:

-λ * det [ -λ, 1/√2 ]
          [1/√2, -λ ]

Minus (1/√2) * det [1/√2, 1/√2 ]
                   [0, -λ ]

Plus 0 * something.

So the determinant becomes:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ]

Simplify each part:

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: -(1/√2) [ (-λ)/√2 - 0 ] = -(1/√2)(-λ/√2) = (λ)/(2)

So the determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/(2) = 0

Let me expand that:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + λ/2 = 0

Simplify: -λ^3 + λ = 0

Factor: λ (-λ^2 + 1) = 0 → λ (λ^2 -1 )=0 → λ = 0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, that's a relief. So possible outcomes when measuring P are 1, 0, and -1.

Similarly, for operator Q, the matrix is diagonal: 

Row 1: [1, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row3: [0, 0, -1]

So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 as well, since the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues.

Wait, no: the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are just the diagonal entries. So Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

Wait, no, no, the diagonal entries are 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1. But wait, the middle entry is 0, so one of the eigenvalues is zero. So measuring Q can give outcomes 1, 0, or -1.

But in the problem, the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, the measurements are done first P, then Q. But since Q's measurement is done after P, the state will be in an eigenstate of P, and then upon measuring Q, the state is projected into the eigenstate of P, and then the expectation is found for Q in that state.

But perhaps, since P and Q are not necessarily commuting, their measurements are not independent, and the state after measuring P will affect the possible outcomes of Q.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvectors of P and Q and then compute the probabilities.

Wait, but another approach is to compute the probability that measuring P gives 0, and then in that resulting state, measuring Q gives -1.

So the process is:

1. Find the eigenvectors of P for the eigenvalue 0.

2. Project the initial state onto this eigenvector to get the probability of measuring 0 for P.

3. Then, in this projected state (which is an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0), calculate the probability of measuring Q to be -1.

Multiply these probabilities to get the combined probability.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

So, the initial state is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1) / sqrt(6). Let's write it as a column vector.

When you measure P, the possible outcomes are eigenvalues of P: 1,0,-1. The state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the measured eigenvalue.

So, first, I need to find the eigenvector(s) of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.

Earlier, the eigenvalues of P are 0,1,-1.

So, find eigenvectors for λ=0.

The equation (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So, solving P |v> = 0.

The matrix P is:

Row1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row2:1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row3:0, 1/√2, 0

The system of equations is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0

(1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 =0

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → which gives v2=0 (same as first equation)

So, from first equation, v2=0. From second, v1 = -v3.

Let me choose v3 as a parameter. Let v3 = a. So v1 = -a. So the eigenvector is proportional to (-1, 0, 1). Let me write it as ( -1, 0, 1 ). To make it a unit vector, the norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2 )=sqrt(2), so the unit eigenvector is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ).

So, the eigenvector for P=0 is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Wait, but wait, could there be other eigenvectors for λ=0? No, because the matrix P is 3x3, and the eigenvalue 0 has algebraic multiplicity 1 (since the characteristic equation was λ^3 - λ =0, so each root is simple except when there are multiplicities, but here each λ is a single root. So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by that vector.

So, to find the probability of measuring 0 for P, we compute the inner product between the initial state and the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0.

The initial state is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6). The eigenvector is |v> = ( -1, 0, 1 ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, let me correct: the eigenvector is ( -1, 0, 1 ) divided by sqrt(2), because the vector is of length sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 )= sqrt(2).

So the inner product is <v|ψ> = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ] * [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6)

Calculating the dot product:

( (-1)(-1) )/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) + (0 * 2) + ( (1)(1) )/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )

So that's (1 + 1)/(sqrt(12)) ) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3)

So the probability of measuring P=0 is | <v|ψ> |^2 = (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

Okay, so that's the first part: getting P=0 has a probability of 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |v>, which is ( -1, 0, 1 ) / sqrt(2).

Now, we measure Q. The operator Q has matrix:

[1,0,0
0,0,0
0,0,-1]

So, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, the diagonal elements are 1,0,-1. So the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So, the eigenvectors for Q are:

For eigenvalue 1: (1,0,0)^T

For eigenvalue 0: any vector in the plane orthogonal to (1,0,0) and (0,0,1). But since the matrix is diagonal, the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

Wait, for Q, the matrix is diagonal, so each standard basis vector is an eigenvector.

So, the eigenvalue 1 corresponds to (1,0,0), eigenvalue 0 corresponds to (0,1,0), and eigenvalue -1 corresponds to (0,0,1).

So, the state after measuring P=0 is |v> = ( -1, 0, 1 ) / sqrt(2).

We need to find the probability of measuring Q=-1.

So, the eigenvector for Q=-1 is (0,0,1). So, the inner product between |v> and this vector is the third component of |v>, which is 1/sqrt(2).

So the probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product: (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Wait, but let me double-check.

The eigenvectors for Q are:

|q1> = (1,0,0) for eigenvalue 1,

|q2> = (0,1,0) for eigenvalue 0,

|q3> = (0,0,1) for eigenvalue -1.

So, the state after P is |v> = (-1, 0, 1)/sqrt(2).

To find the probability of measuring Q=-1, we compute | <q3|v> |^2.

The inner product is (0,0,1) * ( -1, 0, 1 ) / sqrt(2) = (0* -1 + 0 * 0 + 1 * 1 ) / sqrt(2) = 1 / sqrt(2).

So the probability is (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

Wait, but wait: the state after P is |v> = (-1,0,1)/sqrt(2). So when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projections onto the corresponding eigenvectors.

So, the probability of Q=-1 is the square of the component of |v> along |q3> = (0,0,1). Which is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So, the overall probability is the product of the probability of P=0 (1/3) and the probability of Q=-1 given P=0 (1/2), so 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. Is this correct? Because when you measure P first, the state collapses to |v>, which is an eigenstate of P. Then, when measuring Q, you're in that state, and the probabilities are based on that.

So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

Let me recap:

1. Initial state: ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

2. P matrix: eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

3. P=0 eigenvector: (-1,0,1)/sqrt(2).

4. Inner product with initial state: [ (-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) = (1 +0 +1)/sqrt(12) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3). So probability 1/3.

5. After P=0, state is |v> = (-1,0,1)/sqrt(2).

6. Measuring Q=-1: inner product with (0,0,1) is 1/sqrt(2). Squared is 1/2.

7. Multiply probabilities: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Yes, that seems correct.


The problem involves measuring two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), in sequence on a quantum system. The initial state of the system is given as \( \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), which is not normalized. Its normalized form is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The matrix for \( P \) is:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( 1, 0, -1 \) by solving the characteristic equation. For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the inner product between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |v\rangle \):

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Calculating the dot product:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( (-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

Thus, the probability of \( P = 0 \) is:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \langle v | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the system collapses to the eigenstate \( |v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 4: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( Q \)
The matrix for \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors:

\[
|q_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |q_2\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |q_3\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the inner product between \( |v\rangle \) and \( |q_3\rangle \):

\[
\langle q_3 | v \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Thus, the probability of \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(Q=-1) = \left| \langle q_3 | v \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Combined probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
