Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's see.

First, I remember that the operator P is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each component is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, the overall operator P is in the direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. That means the direction can be parameterized using angles θ and φ, but since it's in x-z, maybe φ is zero? Wait, no, because any direction in x-z plane can be represented with some angle θ from the z-axis and φ=0, but wait, more accurately, the direction vector n would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). No, wait, if it's in x-z, then the y-component is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right?

Wait, but the question says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator P can be written as P = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in x-z, n_y = 0. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each component of P is given as (ħ/2) times their respective matrices.

So, P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, the operator P along direction n is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Since n is in x-z, n has components n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ (assuming polar coordinates with θ from the z-axis). So, substituting, P = sinθ (P_x) + cosθ (P_z).

Wait no, wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x = sinθ cosφ, but since it's in x-z plane, φ=0, so n_x = sinθ. So P = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z.

So let me compute that matrix.

Compute P = sinθ*(P_x) + cosθ*(P_z).

P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by ħ/2.

P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So,

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute each term:

sinθ part:
[[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]

cosθ part:
[[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these together:
