Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

First, I remember that for spin-½ particles like a muon, the Pauli matrices are involved. The operator P here is a vector operator, so I think it's related to the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Each component (P_x, P_y, P_z) is given as ħ/2 multiplied by some 2x2 matrix.

Wait, the question gives each component's matrix. So P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

But the operator in question is P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, since n is in the x-z plane, the direction vector has components (nx, 0, nz). So any direction in the x-z plane can be parameterized by an angle θ from the z-axis, perhaps. Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle, which would be 0 along z and 90 along x if n is in x-z.

Wait, but
