Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, a spin-half particle in a superposition state, and I need to find the expectation value of an operator. Spin-half particles... oh right, like electrons, their spin can be up or down.

The state given is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And the operator is 10σz +5σx. Oh, σz and σx are the Pauli matrices. I remember σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. And σx is a bit trickier; I think its eigenstates are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Wait, expectation value is the average outcome if you measured the operator many times on systems in this state. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩.

Let me break this down. The expectation value of an operator is linear, so I can split it into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That might make it easier.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, it's straightforward. The expectation value is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me square their magnitudes to get probabilities. (0.5)^2 is 0.25 and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So the probability of spin-up is 0.25 and spin-down is 0.75.

For σz, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So the first part is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, onto the second part: ⟨σx⟩. This is a bit more involved. I think σx doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. Instead, I need to compute the expectation value using the state ψ.

σx is the Pauli X matrix, which in matrix form is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So when you apply σx to a state, it swaps the spin-up and spin-down components.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ψ† σx ψ. Let me write this out.

The state ψ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. The adjoint (ψ†) is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Multiplying ψ† by σx gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then multiply by ψ: [sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5] + [0.5 * sqrt(3)/2].

Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. So ψ† σx is
