Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which exoplanet has the highest density out of the four options given. Hmm, let's see. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? So the key here is to calculate each planet's density and compare them.

Let me start by recalling the formula for density. Density (ρ) equals mass (m) divided by volume (V), so ρ = m/V. But wait, for planets, since they're spheres, the volume formula is (4/3)πr³. So the density depends on both the mass and the radius of the planet.

Looking at the options:

Option a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known, right? I think Earth's density is around 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet would have the same density as Earth.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, this one is given with a density, so I don't need to calculate it. It's 5.5, same as Earth. But wait, it's twice the mass. Oh, wait no, because density is given, so the actual density is 5.5. So this planet's density is 5.5.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Composition affects density because it's about the material it's made of. Same composition as Earth implies same density, right? Because density is a material property. So Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet should have the same density as Earth. But wait, mass is 5 times more. But if the composition is the same, the density remains the same. So their density is 5.5.

Option d) A planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition, same density, so 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, that can't be right because all options a, b, c, d have the same density? But that's not possible. Let me read the options again.

Wait option a is Earth mass and radius. So same as Earth, which is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, but the density is 5.5. So what's its radius? Well, if the density is 5.5, then mass is 2 Earth masses. Let me compute. Let's denote Earth's mass as
