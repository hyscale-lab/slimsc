Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are two planets orbiting a star. Both have been detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times the Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. 

The planets are Planet1 and Planet2. Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits. 

The transit and RV methods give us information about their masses and sizes. The RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The question gives specific shifts for each planet: Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. 

But wait, the question is about equilibrium temperatures. So I need to figure out the equilibrium temperature ratio of Planet1 to Planet2.

I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo (which they say is the same for both). The formula, if I recall correctly, is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star^2 / (4 * a^2) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is:

T_eq = T_star * ( ( L_star / (16πσ a^2) ) )^(1/4)

But wait, L_star is the star's luminosity. Alternatively, since the star's luminosity is L = 4πR_star²σTeff⁴, we can substitute that in.

So another version of the formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think. The equilibrium temperature is determined by the energy balance: the incoming flux from the star equals the outgoing flux (which depends on the planet's temperature and emissivity). The formula
