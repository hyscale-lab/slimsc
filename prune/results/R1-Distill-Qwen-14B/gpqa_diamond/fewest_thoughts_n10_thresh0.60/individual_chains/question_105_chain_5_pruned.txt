Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The setup is that when only one hemisphere is spotted, photometric observations show brightness variations due to the star's rotation. The kicker is that this situation can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve if the star wasn't spotted?

Hmm. So the problem is about comparing the photometric signal caused by spots on the star to that of a transiting exoplanet. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.

Wait, but in this case, the star has spots. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The brightness variation comes from the spots being cooler and thus dimmer than the rest of the star. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the star appears slightly dimmer than when the other hemisphere is facing us.

So the problem is basically comparing the brightness variation caused by these spots to the variation caused by a planet. The goal is to find the planet's radius relative to the star such that the brightness variation (amplitude) is the same in both cases.

Let me break it down into steps.

First, let's model each scenario: the star with spots and the star with a planet.

For the spotted star:

The brightness variation occurs because when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the star emits less light. The brightness change is due to the difference in flux from the spots compared to the rest of the star.

The star's total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible will be the sum of the flux from the unspotted hemisphere plus the flux from the spotted hemisphere. But wait, no, the star is a sphere, and each hemisphere is a part of the surface. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is less than when the other hemisphere (the unspotted) is visible.

Wait, but the star's rotation makes the spots come into view. So the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: one with spots (covering 20% of the hemisphere's area) and the other without. Or wait, fill factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, right? So 20% of the star's visible hemisphere is spots.

Wait, maybe I should clarify that. The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, which means that 20% of the area of the hemisphere is covered by spots. So if the hemisphere is a spherical cap, the area is 2πR² (for a sphere, each hemisphere is 2πR² in area). So 20% of that is the
