Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The setup is that the star's brightness variations, due to these spots, mimic those from a planet transiting in front of the star. The question is asking what the radius of such a planet would need to be, relative to the star's radius, to produce the same brightness dip as the spots.

Hmm, I remember that the brightness variation when a planet transits a star is given by the formula (Rp/Rstar)^2. Because the planet blocks a part of the star's light proportional to the square of its radius relative to the star. But wait, in this case, the spots cause a brightness variation because when the star rotates, the spots come into and go out of view. So the modulation is due to the spots being on one side as the star spins. 

Wait, no. Wait, the star has one hemisphere with spots. So as it rotates, the spots become visible and then hidden. So the brightness variation would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature relative to the star's. 

Let me think. The star's total brightness is related to its surface area and temperature. The spots are cooler, so when they are facing us, the star appears a bit dimmer than when the other side is facing us because the spots are less bright. 

But the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. Oh wait, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into view as it spins. So the star's brightness would vary as the spots rotate into and out of our line of sight. 

Wait, but the problem states that the situation resembles an exoplanet transit. So when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The problem is asking, what planet radius would cause the same dip as the spot-induced variations.

So to find Rpl/Rstar, we need to calculate the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and set that equal to the fraction caused by the planet blocking light, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but the spots cause
