Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light is going through the glass which is itself moving. I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, it's more complicated than just adding velocities because light's speed in a medium isn't just v = c/n. But wait, no, in the medium's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n. But when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's motion relative to the observer. Oh wait, I think in this case, the glass is moving, so we have to consider the Doppler effect or something like that. Or maybe it's about relativistic velocity addition. Oh, right, because if the glass is moving, the speed of the light as observed in the lab would depend on the relative motion.

Wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So I think we need to transform the velocities. But how?

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula for relativistic velocity addition is (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, that's when you have a velocity u in a frame S, and the frame itself is moving at velocity v relative to another frame S'. So the velocity in S' would be (u + v)/(1 + uv/(c²)).

But wait, in this case, the light's speed in the glass's frame is u = c/n. But the glass is moving at v in the lab frame. So the lab frame is moving at -v relative to the glass.

Wait, no, the glass is moving at v towards the observer. So if the glass is moving at v, then from the glass's frame, the lab is moving at -v. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass's frame, the light has speed c/n. But from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light.

So the lab frame wants to know the speed of the light. So in this case, the light's speed in the lab frame would be u' = [u + v] / [1 + (u v)/(c²)].

But wait, does this apply here? Because the medium itself is moving. Oh, wait, no—this formula is for when you're transforming velocities between frames. So if the glass is moving at v, and in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n, then in the lab frame, the light's speed would be (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because when the medium is moving, the refractive index might affect the velocity addition. Or is the refractive index already accounted for in u?

So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. So u is c/n. Then, applying the velocity addition formula:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²))

Substituting u = c/n:

u' = (c/n + v) / [1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator:

Denominator becomes 1 + (v * c / (n c²)) ) = 1 + v/(n c)

So u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + v/(n c))

Hmm, let's factor c from numerator and denominator perhaps.

Wait, maybe factor out 1/c from numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me try:

u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + v/(n c)) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate the denominators inside:

Numerator: (c/n + v) * n c = c^2 + n c v

Denominator: (1 + v/(n c)) * n c = n c + v

So u' = [c² + n c v ] / (n c + v )

We can factor out c from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: c (n + v / c) )? Wait, no, denominator is n c + v.

Wait, c² + n c v = c (c + n v )

Denominator: n c + v = c (n + v/c )

Wait, but that's not the same. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out c from denominator:

n c + v = c (n) + v = c (n) + v * (1) = c (n) + v (1)

Not sure if that helps.

Wait, regardless, the expression becomes:

u' = [c(c + n v)] / (n c + v )

But I'm trying to express this as a function of c, since the answer options don't have c. Wait, but the options are:

A) (1 + n v )/(n + v )

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Wait, but in all options, c is taken as 1, as per the question: "Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1."

So substituting c=1, the expression becomes:

u' = [1 + n v ] / [n + v ]

Which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, in the velocity addition formula, the denominator is 1 + (u v)/c². When I substituted c=1, that becomes 1 + u v.

So let me recalculate with c=1.

u = 1/n.

u' = (u + v) / (1 + u v )

Substituting u = 1/n:

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Which is option A.

But wait, why does the formula apply here? Because when we're transforming velocities, the velocity addition formula is correct only when the speeds are non-relativistic, but if v is comparable to c, which is 1 in our case, then we have to consider relativistic effects. But in the problem statement, the options don't include any c terms beyond 1, so probably the approach is correct.

But wait, I'm assuming that the speed of light in the glass is u = c/n in the glass's frame. But in reality, is that the case? Because the refractive index is n, which implies that in the medium's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n.

Yes. So in the glass's frame, speed is c/n. Then the lab frame sees it as u' = (u + v)/(1 + u v), which gives (1 + n v)/(n + v) with c=1.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( u = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. Since the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem), we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- Option B (\( 1 \)) is incorrect because the speed of light in the glass is not equal to \( c \) in the laboratory frame.
- Option C (\( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \)) is incorrect because the denominator does not match the relativistic velocity addition formula.
- Option D (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \)) is incorrect because the numerator does not match the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
