Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a reaction scheme leading to compound E, and I need to identify it from the options given. There are several steps involved, so I'll break them down one by one.

Starting with compound A. The first reaction is with HCN to produce compound B. HCN is a nucleophile, right? So when it reacts with a carbonyl group, it usually adds to it. For example, it might form a cyanohydrin if A is a ketone. But wait, I also have a hint here. The IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm-1. That's typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. So A is probably a cyclic ketone because the options for E are all cyclic ketones.

Next, compound B is formed by reacting A with HCN. So if A is a ketone and HCN adds to it, B would likely be a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins have the structure where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a -CN and a -OH group on adjacent carbons. But wait, I also have hint a. It mentions that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So if A is reacting with a ylide to form that product, A must have a carbonyl group that's adjacent to two methyl groups. Because the product has substituents at positions 1,2,4. Let me think about the structure. The product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. So maybe A is a cyclopentanone derivative.

Wait, the Wittig reaction adds an alkene to the carbonyl. So in this case, the product has a propenylidene group (propan-2-ylidene) attached. So the ylide must be something like Ph3P=CH-C(CH3)2, right? Because the product has
