Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). The options are four points in 3D space, so I need to find which of these corresponds to ρ.

First, I remember that a density matrix for a qubit is a 2x2 matrix. The general form for a qubit density matrix is ρ = [[a, b], [c, d]], where a, b, c, d are complex numbers and the matrix is positive semi-definite with trace 1.

Wait, the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. Let me compute that. 

The |0><0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements 1/2.

Now, I think about how a density matrix represents a state in the Bloch sphere. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a vector in 3D space, called the Bloch vector. The Bloch vector is given by r = (x, y, z), where z is the expectation value of the Pauli Z operator, and similarly for x and y with X and Y.

The density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So, I = identity matrix, and σ = [[σx, σy, σz]], each being their respective Pauli matrices.

Let me write that out. The identity matrix I for 2x2 is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the dot product r·σ would be r_x σx + r_y
