Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base. The problem gives the volumes and concentrations for each solution and asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think through the steps.

First, the initial solution: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. So that's a total volume of 40 cm³. I should calculate the new concentration after dilution. Since concentration times volume should be constant, the initial moles of acetic acid would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³, so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Got it, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, right? So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then, adding 20 cm³ makes the total 40 cm³, so 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, correct.

Now, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So, moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

So, at 25% titration, what's the pH? Let's approach this step by step.

At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acid has been neutralized. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO-Na+ + H2O.

So, the initial moles are 0.001 mol acetic acid. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO⁻ formed = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume at this point is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So, concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).

Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Wait, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate it. Let's see:

1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is ~4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute that ratio. 0.005882/0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26. Hmm, that's one of the options.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Let me compute [A⁻]/[HA] = (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) = (0.00025 / 0.00075) = 1/3.

So log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 = 4.256, about 4.26. So the first part is 4.26, which matches option A's first value. But let's not jump yet. Let's check the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to form acetate ions. So, we have a solution of sodium acetate in water.

The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

But wait, sodium acetate dissociates completely, so the solution is of CH3COO⁻ in water. CH3COO⁻ is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will
