Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base, right? Let's see what the question says.

The question says we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D with different pH pairs.

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, the reaction will form acetate ions and water. The equivalence point should be where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

First, let me figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Initially, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with 20 cm³ water makes the total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Because concentration is moles over volume, and since both volumes are same, it's 0.05/2 = 0.025 M.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH, what's the volume at 25% titration?

Wait, 25% of what? Oh, it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. So I need to find the equivalence point volume first.

Moles of acetic acid initially: concentration * volume. Wait, but after dilution, it's 0.025 M in 40 cm³. So moles are 0.025 mol/L * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added should equal moles of acetic acid. So moles NaOH = 0.001 mol. Since concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So equivalence point is
