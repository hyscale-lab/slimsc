Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the products for each part. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's see if I can work through this.

Alright, the question has three parts: (A), (B), and (C). Each involves a Michael addition reaction. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for each part. I'll need to tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with part (A): The reactants are dimethyl malonate, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and NaOEt in EtOH. So, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack by an enolate on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form a strong enolate. When the enolate attacks the beta position of another alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, like the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that's the Michael donor and acceptor respectively, I think. Wait, wait. No, the donor is the one that has the enolate, which is the nucleophile. So dimethyl malonate is the donor, and the acrylate is the acceptor.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the CH2. Wait, no, the formula is a bit different. Let me think: the acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or maybe the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylic acid methyl ester. So, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 2. So structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but as an E isomer, so trans. Wait, actually, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be where the substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides. But maybe the exact sterechemistry isn't crucial for the product structure.

When the enolate of dimethyl malonate
