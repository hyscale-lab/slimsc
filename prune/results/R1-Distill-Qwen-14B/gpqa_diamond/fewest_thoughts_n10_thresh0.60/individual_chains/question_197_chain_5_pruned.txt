Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm. Alright, let's break it down.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe in a carboxylic acid because that's a broad peak. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which sounds like a carbonyl group (C=O). Oh wait, that's a strong peak, so maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. But since we have the O-H as well, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because the carbonyl in that would be around 1700 cm⁻¹. But wait, sometimes esters have higher carbonyl stretching. Hmm, but the 1720 is a bit higher than typical carboxylic acids. Wait, maybe it's an ester or maybe a ketone? Let me think. Another IR peak is at 1610 cm⁻¹, which is in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. The 1450 cm⁻¹ is possibly another aromatic peak, maybe para-substituted because the peaks are often around 1480-1450 for that.

Now, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). A broad singlet around 10.5 is likely an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid's -OH. So that's consistent with the IR O-H. Then, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. The downfield shift suggests that the substituent is electron-withdrawing. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid group, that would be a strong EWG, which would make the ring protons deshielded. Alternatively, maybe a nitro group, but the IR doesn't show a strong nitro peak. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is another group, but wait, the 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl from a ketone or ester, but the presence of a broad O-H is more likely a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) - that's a multiplet, maybe a CH adjacent to something. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) - the doublet at 1.4 with 3H suggests a methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a terminal methyl group, like an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the compound is a substituted benzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group and some alkyl chain.

Wait, another thought: benzoic acid derivatives. So the IR has the C=O at 1720, O-H at 3400-2500 (broad), and the aromatic peaks. The NMR has the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2, which are consistent with para-substituted benzene. So perhaps the substituent is a carboxylic acid group with an alkyl chain attached.

Looking at the NMR, the singlet at 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which aligns with a carboxylic acid. Then, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, indicating that the substituent is in the para position
