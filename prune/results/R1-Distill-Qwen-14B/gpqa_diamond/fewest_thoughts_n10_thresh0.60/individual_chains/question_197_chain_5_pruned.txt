Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that reaction involves something called the hydroboration-oxidation maybe? Or wait, red phosphorus and HI is used in the formation of ylides for the Wittig reaction. Oh right, the Wittig reaction uses a ylide to react with aldehydes or ketones to form alkenes. But wait, in this case, is Compound X an aldehyde or a ketone?

Looking at the IR data first. The IR shows strong peaks. Let's see, the big peaks around 3400-2500 cm-1 usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches, but since this is an organic compound, maybe it's an aldehyde's O-H? Or wait, maybe a carboxylic acid? But wait, the peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong one. Oh, that's usually a carbonyl group. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around where aromatic C=C stretches are.

Looking at the NMR. The 1H NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating to 1H. That's pretty upfield, but wait, usually aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, that peak is a singlet and maybe it's an aldehyde proton. But wait, in the NMR data, there's also a 1720 in IR, which could be a ketone. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad around 10-12 ppm, but the IR would show a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-1. Wait, the IR data has a stretch from 3400-2500, which might include an O-H or maybe an amine. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak. That's likely a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone or an aldehyde. The 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet with 1H. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but in the NMR, sometimes deshielded protons like those in carboxylic acids are higher. Wait, but a carboxylic acid O-H would usually be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, and in the IR, there would be a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-1 as well. But the IR here shows 3400â€“2500, which could include an O-H stretch. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but let's look at the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which might not be an aldehyde because aldehyde protons are usually sharp. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like in an enol. Or maybe a ketone? Wait, no, ketones don't have protons attached. So maybe it's an aldehyde.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, but if it's an aldehyde, it's usually a triplet or a singlet? I think it depends on neighboring protons. But in any case, if the IR has a carbonyl, that's the main point.

Looking further, the NMR shows a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Those look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para-substituted benzene, the protons are in two sets of doublets. So if you have a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, the H NMR would show two doublets.

So the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene, maybe with electron-withdrawing groups that deshield the protons.

Next, the other peaks in the NMR. At 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), that's a multiplet. That could be a methylene or methine group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe.

At 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), that's another multiplet, perhaps a CH2 group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet, maybe a CH3 group attached to something, perhaps an oxygen or a carbon adjacent to another CH2.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet, which is a terminal CH3, possibly from an ethyl group.

Putting that together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with some substituents.

Wait, the IR has peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has a benzene ring.

So the structure probably has a benzene ring with substituents, perhaps an aldehyde group and another group.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are used to form
