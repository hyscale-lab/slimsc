Okay, so I've got this question about cellular biology and mitochondrial function, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about a new anti-diabetes drug and whether certain experiments can help determine if the drug affects mitochondria. The task is to find out which experiment won't help. The options are A through D.

First, I need to understand what each experiment is doing. I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A: Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit. 
Hmm, differential centrifugation is a method to isolate organelles like mitochondria. So they extract mitochondria and then use a glucose uptake assay. Wait, glucose uptake is related to how cells take in glucose, right? But wait, mitochondria are involved in breaking down glucose eventually through the electron transport chain. Or is it more about the cell's overall glucose uptake? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Also, the colorimetric assay probably measures the amount of glucose consumed, which would indicate mitochondrial activity if they're using it for energy. But I'm not sure. Maybe this assay is more about cellular respiration, so it could relate to mitochondria.

Option B: Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after adding 5 μM luciferin. 
Luciferase is an enzyme used in reporter genes, like firefly luciferase, which emits light when it reacts with luciferin. But how does that relate to mitochondria? Oh wait, wait. If they transform the cells with a recombinant luciferase, perhaps it's under the control of a promoter that's active in mitochondria? Or maybe the luciferase is localized in the mitochondria. Alternatively, maybe the assay is measuring ATP levels since luciferase activity depends on ATP. Because the mitochondria are the main source of ATP. So if the drug affects mitochondrial ATP production, the luminometer would show changes in light (which is the enzyme activity). So this experiment could indicate mitochondrial function by measuring ATP levels.

Option C: Flow cytometry after labeling with 2.5 μM 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenz
