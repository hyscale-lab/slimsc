Okay, so I need to figure out which experiment won't help determine the mitochondrial role of a new anti-diabetes drug. Let's go through each option one by one.

The question is about a drug that affects mitochondria. The setup is using HEK293 cells, which are a common cell line for such studies. The goal is to find which experiment doesn't contribute to understanding mitochondrial function or changes.

Option A: Differential centrifugation to extract mitochondria and then using a Glucose Uptake Assay. Wait, differential centrifugation is a method to isolate mitochondria because they're heavier and pellet under certain speeds. So if you extract mitochondria, you can test their function. The glucose uptake assay... Well, glucose uptake is often related to insulin signaling and cellular energy status. In diabetes, mitochondrial function affects insulin sensitivity. If the drug affects mitochondria, it might alter glucose uptake. So this assay would measure whether the drug affects mitochondrial-related glucose transport. So this experiment would help, so it's not the answer.

Option B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after adding luciferin. Hmm. Luciferase is an enzyme used in reporter assays, often for measuring gene expression. But how does that relate to mitochondria? Unless they're using it to measure ATP levels. Because luciferase requires ATP to发光 (light). So if you add luciferin, and measure luminescence, the amount of light would indicate ATP levels. Mitochondria are the main source of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. So if the drug affects mitochondrial ATP production, this assay would pick
