Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about finding the value of 'a' in a wave function. Each particle is in a system, and when we measure their positions, they're only found between x=1 and x=3. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but the wave function should probably be a complex function because it's a solution to the Schrödinger equation, right? So the 'i' is the imaginary unit.

But when we measure position, the probability is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function. Oh right, because the probability density is |ψ(x)|². So the wave function's real and imaginary parts contribute to this.

Wait, the wave function is ψ(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x) - 0.5i. Hmm, so the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the absolute square would be the sum of squares of real and imaginary parts. So |ψ|² = (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2.

Wait, because when you have a complex number like A + Bi, the absolute value squared is A² + B². So here, A is a/sqrt(1+x), B is -0.5, so B squared is 0.25
