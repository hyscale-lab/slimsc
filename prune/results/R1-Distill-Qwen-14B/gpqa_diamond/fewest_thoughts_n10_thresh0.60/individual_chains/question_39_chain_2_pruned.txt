Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a wave function. I remember that for wave functions, they need to be normalized, meaning the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1. 

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait a second, wave functions in quantum mechanics are usually complex, so that makes sense. But how do I find 'a'?

So, the setup is that each particle's wave function is described by this function, and when they measured the positions, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So that must mean the wave function is zero outside this region. Wait, but the given wave function isn't zero outside x=1 to x=3. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, the question says that none were found outside x=1 and x=3, which suggests the wave function doesn't exist (or is zero) outside that interval. So the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. 

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That doesn't look like it's zero outside 1 to 3. Maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function is defined as that expression only in the region between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the wave function is a piecewise function, perhaps. But the problem statement
