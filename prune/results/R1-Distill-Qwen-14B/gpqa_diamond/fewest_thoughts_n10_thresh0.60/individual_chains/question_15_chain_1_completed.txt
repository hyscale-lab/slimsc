Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since its orbital period is shorter. Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star.

The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.

Wait, the transit probability formula. If I recall correctly, the probability P is approximately (R_p / a) * (something), but wait, more accurately, the transit probability is given by the formula: P = (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_p/R_*)), but since the planet's radius R_p is much smaller than the star's radius R_*, the (1 + ...) term is approximately 1. So it's roughly (R_*/ a) * 1. Wait, no, wait. No, I think the formula is P = (R_*/ a) * ( something else). Wait, I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I think the correct formula is the probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (something else). Or is it the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis? No, wait: the transit probability is higher if the planet's orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight. So the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), because the star's size compared to the distance of the planet's orbit determines how likely it is that the orbit would intersect our line of sight. More precisely, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (some factor), but I think the main factor is (R_star / a).

Wait, perhaps I should look it up. Oh wait, I'm in a test situation, so I can't. I remember that the transit probability is given by (R_*/ a) * ( (R_p + R_*) ) / a ), but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, another way: the transit probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the sphere from which the transit could happen. Wait, that's the geometric probability. Let me think: the probability P is (R_*)/(a) multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, the geometric probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. So P ≈ (R_*/ a) * (something else), but perhaps the main factor is (R_* / a).

Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's roughly R_* / a.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because then if the star is larger, or the planet's orbit is smaller, the probability increases. So if R_* is larger, and a is smaller, the probability is higher. That makes sense because a larger star or a closer planet increases the chance of a transit.

But wait, in this problem, both stars have the same radius. So R_* is the same for both. So then, the probability will depend on a, the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, but wait, in the problem, the planet with a shorter period is Planet_1. Since Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(T^2) = (G(M_* + M_p))/ (4π²), and M_p is negligible compared to M_*, so a^3 ∝ T^2 * M_*, or a ∝ (T^2 * M_*)^(1/3).

In this case, Planet_1 has a period T1 = T2 / 3. The host star of Planet_1 has mass M1 = 2*M2. Because M1 is twice that of M2.

So let's compute the semi-major axis for each planet.

For Planet_1:
a1 = [ (G * (M1) * T1^2 ) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)
But since I'm looking for the ratio a1/a2, let's compute a1/a2.

a1 = [ (M1) * (T1)^2 ]^(1/3)
a2 = [ (M2) * (T2)^2 ]^(1/3)

But T1 = T2 /3. So T1^2 = T2^2 /9.

So,
a1/a2 = [ (M1 / M2) * (T1^2 / T2^2) ) ]^(1/3)
= [ (2) * (1/9) ) ]^(1/3)
= (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is smaller than a2. Because Planet_1 is closer to its star.

Now, the transit probability P is proportional to R_* / a. Since both stars have the same R_*, R_1 = R_2. So P1/P2 = (R_*/a1) / (R_*/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Because if P = R_*/a, then P1 = R_* /a1, P2 = R_* /a2.

So P1/P2 = (R_* / a1) / (R_* /a2) ) = a2 / a1.

We already found that a1/a2 ≈ 0.606, so a2/a1 ≈ 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait wait, no. Because if a is smaller, P is higher. So P1 = R_*/a1, and a1 is smaller than a2. So P1 is larger.

But wait, let me compute the exact a1/a2 ratio correctly.

So M1 is 2*M2.

T1 is (1/3) T2.

So the ratio a1/a2 is cube root( (M1 / M2) * (T1^2 / T2^2) )

Which is cube root( (2) * ( (1/3 T2 )^2 / T2^2 )) )

= cube root( 2 * (1/9) ) = cube root(2/9).

2/9 is approx 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So for the transit probability, P = R_*/a.

Since R_*/a is the same as (1/a) since R_* is same.

So P1 = 1/a1, P2 = 1/a2.

So P1/P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2 /a1 = 1.65.

Wait, that would mean that P1 is about 1.65 times P2, so higher.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability to transit, so researchers would prefer it.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred, with ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times, which is much higher.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me compute cube root(2/9). 2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

The cube root of 0.2222: since 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.2222. So cube root is approximately 0.606. So a1 = 0.606 a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So transit probability P is proportional to 1/a. So P1 = 1/a1, P2=1/a2.

So P1/P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has higher probability, so they should observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C is: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the answer should be option C.


The probability of detecting a transit of an exoplanet depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \). In this scenario, both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), so the transit probability depends only on the semi-major axis (\( a \)) of the planet's orbit. A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis is proportional to \( \left( \frac{T^2 M_*}{G} \right)^{1/3} \). For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( T_1 = \frac{T_2}{3} \) and a host star mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \).
- Planet_2 has an orbital period \( T_2 \) and a host star mass \( M_2 \).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \frac{T_1^2}{T_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{T_2}{3}\right)^2}{T_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( 2 \cdot \frac{1}{9} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbit is smaller than Planet_2's. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

This indicates that Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

Option C correctly states that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
