Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, okay, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is asking about the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. Oh right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed would just be based on the spring's potential energy converting into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, I guess I have to consider how relativity affects the equations.

So the setup: it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The maximum speed is v_max, and the speed of light is c. The options are A to D.

In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So PE = (1/2)kA², and KE = (1/2)m v_max². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)m v_max² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That would be option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so I can't use the classical formula directly.

Relativistically, energy is more complicated. The total energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; we have to consider the rest mass energy as well. So the total energy E would be the sum of the rest mass energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy, which in relativity isn't just ½mv². Oh wait, no, actually, in relativity, the kinetic energy is (γ -1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach it using energy conservation. At the maximum amplitude A, the mass comes to rest momentarily, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the speed is maximum, and all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy is conserved between these two points.

In the relativistic case, the potential energy in the spring is still (1/2)kx². Wait, but wait—relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, in special relativity, the concept of force is a bit tricky because F = dp/dt, where p is relativistic momentum, which is γmv. So perhaps the force isn't exactly -kx
