Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, and they have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, then Planet_1's is P/3. 

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, why would that be? Oh, right, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. So more evolved stars can be larger, but in this case, their radii are the same. Maybe because they're in a certain stage where they haven't expanded much yet?

So the researchers want to observe which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The probability is highest when the orbit is edge-on, which is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view.

The transit probability formula, as I remember, is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (1 + (R_planet / R_star))^(-2). Wait, wait, no, that's for the area or something. Wait, no, the probability of a transit is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to be aligned. The exact probability depends on the alignment, which is a factor, but for planets with similar sizes and stars, the probability depends on the relative size of the planet to the star and the orbital size.

Wait, another approach: the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet)/(a * (1 - eÂ²))^(1/2), but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The transit probability (for a circular orbit) is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (1 + (R_p / R_s) )^2 ) / ( (a_p / R_s )^2 + (R_p / R_s)^2 )^(1/2) ), but maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, no,
