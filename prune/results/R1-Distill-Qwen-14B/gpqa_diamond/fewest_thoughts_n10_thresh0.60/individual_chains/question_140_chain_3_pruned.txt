Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll take it slowly.

The problem starts by talking about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, I'm thinking that X is probably a compound where one of the elements has an isotope with a higher atomic mass. Since isotopes have the same number of protons but different neutrons, the heavier one would have more neutrons.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of neutrons and protons? So each molecule of W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let me think about common gases. Hydrogen has one proton, but no neutrons usually, unless it's deuterium. Helium maybe? No, helium is a noble gas. Oh wait, maybe something like H2O? No, that's a liquid. Or maybe CO2? No, that's also a gas but... Wait, W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about each atom's contribution.

Suppose W is H2O. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each H2O molecule has 2*(1+0) + 8+8 = wait, no, because the question says the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, total protons = total neutrons.

Let me calculate: If W is H2O, H has 1p each, O has 8p and 8n. So total protons: 2*1 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 2*(0) + 8 = 8. Doesn't match. So that's not it.

What about CH4? C has 6p, 6n. H has 1p, 0n. So molecule: 6p + 4*(1p) = 10p. Neutrons: 6n +4*0=6n. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the molecule is something like NH3? N has 7p, 7n (assuming it's the common isotope). H has 1p, 0n. So molecule: 7 + 3*1 =10p
