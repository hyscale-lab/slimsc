Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit involved, but I'll take it slowly.

First, let's read the problem carefully. It starts with Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Then, it reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is roughly 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0Â°C. So B is probably a solid at room temperature but melts just a bit above that.

Next, when a certain keto acid reacts with Substance X, the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Oh right, I remember that NaOH and KOH are common reagents, also like other hydroxides maybe. Wait, but let's think more.

So, let's break down each part. Let's start with the reaction between X and Y. 

The reaction is violent, so perhaps it's a strong acid reacting with something to produce a gas. When I think of violent reactions, maybe something like an acid reacting with a carbonate or sulfite, producing CO2 or SO2. But gas W has equal number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. Let's think about possible gases. H2O has 2 H and 1 O: protons are 2, neutrons would be (16 for O) 8? No, wait. Wait, the neutron count in the molecule is the sum of all the neutrons in each atom. Wait, no, the molecule as a whole. Wait, no, each atom contributes to the total. Wait, no, maybe the molecule's composition. For example, if W is H2O: each H has 0 neutrons (since they're protium, 1H). O has 8. So H2O has 2 H's (each 0 neutrons) and one O (8 neutrons). So total neutrons in the molecule: 8. Protons in H2O: 2*(1) + 8 = 10. So 8 vs 10, not equal. So that's not it.

What other gases are there? Maybe CO2? Let's see. CO2 has one C (6 protons, 6 neutrons in carbon-12, but could be another isotope). So C has 6 protons. O has 8 each. So CO2 has 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons: C-12 has 6, O has 8 each, so 6 + 8*2 = 22. So protons and neutrons in the molecule are each 22. Oh yeah, that fits because the problem says same number of neutrons and protons in the molecule. So W is CO2.

So gas W is CO2. That tells me that the reaction between X and Y is producing CO2. So what reactions produce CO2 gas? One possibility is when a carbonate reacts with an acid, like H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) reacting with Na2CO3 to produce Na2SO4, CO2, and H2O. Another possibility is when a metal reacts with acid, but that usually produces H2 gas. Hmm, but in this case, the gas is CO2, so perhaps Y is a carbonate. Alternatively, maybe Y is a bicarbonate, like NaHCO3.

Wait, but the reaction is violent. So perhaps Y is a carbonate and X is a strong acid. So X could be H2SO4, but let's think about that. Wait, but earlier it's said that X is known for incorporating a
