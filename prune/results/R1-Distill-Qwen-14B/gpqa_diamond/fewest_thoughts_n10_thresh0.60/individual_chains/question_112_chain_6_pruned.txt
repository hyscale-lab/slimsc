Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I know that for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates |up> and |down> correspond to the spin up and spin down states along the z-axis. The state |alpha> is expressed in terms of these, but it's only proportional—so I'll probably need to normalize it.

The first part of the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that matrix... Hmm. Let me think about the structure. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Wait, wait, no. Because for a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j run from 1 to 2. So A_12 and A_21 are ħ/2, and A_11 and A_22 are zero. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

Wait, but what operator has such a matrix? In quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices come to mind. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1], [1,0]], and the Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is diagonal. So the given matrix looks like (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, right? Because (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] would be the matrix here. So the operator is (ħ/2) sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Oh wait, but wait. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So the operator in question, let's call it A, has eigenvalues
