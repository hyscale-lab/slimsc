Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem involves several reactions and spectroscopic data. Let me break it down.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When heated with excess KOH at 240°C, it forms a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 has specific peaks: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone or an ester, but more likely a ketone since the reaction is with KOH, which is a strong base.

So, what's happening in the first reaction? 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene via an E2 mechanism. Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide; it's a diegeminal or maybe a geminal if the substituents were on the same carbon. Wait, no, the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four bridged cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Wait, no, the 1 and 3 positions on the adamantane might not be adjacent. Hmm, maybe the structure is such that when KOH is used, it's more likely a double elimination, possibly forming a ketone.

Wait, wait, but let me think again. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH. Wait, if KOH is in excess and the reaction is heating, perhaps it's an elimination reaction. Wait, but elimination usually requires adjacent halogens. Wait, maybe the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond. But wait, if it's a bridge structure, perhaps the elimination leads to a more stable structure. Alternatively
