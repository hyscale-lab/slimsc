Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So the problem is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It goes through a few steps, and I need to find the coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum.

Let me break it down.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240Â°C. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The NMR spectrum of product 1 has signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). There's also an IR peak at 1720 cm^-1. Hmm, IR absorption around 1720 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, let's think about what reaction occurs when dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons. When it's heated with KOH, that's probably an elimination reaction, E2 mechanism, since KOH is a strong base. But wait, elimination would form an alkene. But wait, the product after KOH is a solid, and IR shows a carbonyl. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but more likely, it's an elimination to form an epoxide? No, wait, no. Oh wait, KOH in such conditions can lead to elimination, but for vicinal dihalides, we often get elimination to form alkenes. But wait, the IR doesn't show a peak around 1600 cm^-1 which is typical for C=C. Instead, it's at 1720, which points more towards a carbonyl, like a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else.

Wait, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing an intramolecular attack. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a structure like four cyclo
