Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance. Hmm, let me think. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, that's kind of a steep variation. 

I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for distance in parsecs is 1 over parallax (plx), so plx = 1/d. Or wait, is it d = 1/plx? Yeah, right. So if the parallax increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa. 

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5), which I can write as N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) which is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, so it's the number of stars per unit distance. So I think I need to find the derivative of N with respect to r (distance), to find the rate of change. Because the question is about per unit range of distance.

So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. Taking the derivative dN/dr would be 5k d^4. But wait, the options don't have d^4. Oh wait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me read it
