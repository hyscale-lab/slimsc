Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like 1/(plx^5). And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. Wait, wait, parallax (plx) = 1 / distance (d) when d is in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. 

So if the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5, we can write that as N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. But since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So substituting, N = k * d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think this is asking for the rate of change, like dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r.

Because if N is proportional to d^5, then the derivative dN/dr would be 5 * k * d^4. But wait, wait. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the scaling with r, not the exact
