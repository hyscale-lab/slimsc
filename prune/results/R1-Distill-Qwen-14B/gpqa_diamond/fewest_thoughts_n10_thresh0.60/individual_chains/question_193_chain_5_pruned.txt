Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the number is proportional to 1/plx^5. I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Wait, parallax and distance... Right, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. The formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). Oh right, because parallax in arcseconds is 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if the distance r increases, the parallax decreases.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, I can substitute that in. Let me write that down.

So plx = 1/r, because parallax in arcseconds equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So substituting, N ‚àù 1/( (1/r) )^5.

Wait, 1/( (1/r)^5 ) would be the same as (r)^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, and taking the reciprocal makes it r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, per unit range of distance. So does that mean the derivative of N with respect to
