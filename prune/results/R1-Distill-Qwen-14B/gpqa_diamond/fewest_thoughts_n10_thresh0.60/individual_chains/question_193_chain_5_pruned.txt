Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about how the number of stars varies with distance. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Wait, but in the question, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So the number N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5.

Wait, let me write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So substituting, N ∝ (d)^5. Oh wait, no. Because 1/(plx)^5 would be (1/plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, 1/plx is d. So (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, so it's probably about the differential change in N with respect to d. Like, how much does N change when d increases by a little.

So I think I need to find dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to d. Because that would tell me the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance.

Wait, let's see. N is proportional to d^5, so N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. Then dN/dr would be 5k d^4. So as a function of d, the number of stars per unit distance increases with d^4.

So the rate of change (the number of stars per unit distance) is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars increases in that region with distance to the fourth power.

Looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question says the number varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, this becomes d^5. So N = C * d^5. The number of stars per unit distance would be the derivative, which is 5 C d^4. So the change is proportional to d^4.

So yeah, the correct option is C.


The number of stars in the region varies as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \), where plx is the parallax. Since parallax is invers
