Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking for the energy when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Oh, right, lithium has an atomic number of 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes the mass number 3 plus 3, which is 6. So X is Li-6, or ^6Li. So each nucleus is a lithium-6 ion, which is a charged particle. But since it's a nucleus, I think we're treating it as a heavy ion, so maybe it's a deuteron or something else? Wait, no, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so it's a nucleus with charge +3e, but perhaps in the collider it's a heavy ion, so the mass would be the mass of the entire nucleus.

Next, I need to find the energy of the collider. The speed is given as 0.96c. So I think this is a relativistic problem because 0.96c is pretty close to the speed of light. Relativistic effects are significant here. So I should use the relativistic energy equations.

Wait, what's the formula for the total energy of a particle? Oh right, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m0 cÂ².
