Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons, which I think makes it Lithium-6, right? Because Lithium usually has 3 protons, and adding 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6. So the formula would be Li-6.

Hmm, I remember that in physics, when dealing with particles moving at relativistic speeds, we use the theory of relativity. So I need to calculate the energy using the relativistic equations. 

Wait, the energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor. So the formula for gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Since v is 0.96c, I can plug that into the formula.

Let me write down the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.
2. Find the rest mass energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus.
3. Multiply gamma by the rest mass energy to get the total energy.

First, let's compute gamma. v is 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². So v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - (v²/c²) is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Take the square root of that: sqrt(0.0784) is about 0.28. So 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. But wait, maybe I should calculate this more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). So 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, but let me check: 0.
