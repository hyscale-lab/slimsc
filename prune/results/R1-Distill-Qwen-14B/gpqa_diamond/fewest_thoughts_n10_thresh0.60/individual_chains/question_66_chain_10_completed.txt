Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question is asking which symmetries must be preserved by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are combinations of these.

Wait, what's the deal with SMEFT? From what I remember, SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators that could modify the Standard Model, respecting certain symmetries. These operators are organized by their dimension, with higher dimensions being suppressed by some high energy scale, like the Planck scale or something.

So the key point here is: which symmetries must all these operators respect? I think SMEFT is built by including all possible operators that are consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. But wait, the Standard Model has certain gauge symmetries, like SU(2) and U(1), but the question is about other symmetries like Lorentz, Poincare, etc.

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincare adds translations, so it's a bigger symmetry group. But in the SMEFT, all operators must be Lorentz invariant, right? Because the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is an effective theory extending it. Oh wait, no, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's still Lorentz symmetric. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, which implies they must form a Lorentz-invariant set.

So option 1 is correct. What about Poincare symmetry (option 2)? Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. But I think in the SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that they're invariant under Poincare symmetry. Wait, but when you have operators of different dimensions, how does that affect it? Because for instance, a dimension 6 operator would have terms like (1/Lambda) * (field terms), so under spacetime translations, the action would change, but in SMEFT, the operators are built such that the theory is still Poincare invariant. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. In an effective field theory, the operators are constructed to be invariant under the same symmetries as the original theory. The Standard Model is Poincare invariant, so SMEFT should respect that too. So operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, which is option 2. Hmm, but wait, is that necessarily the case? Because operators are built from the SM fields, which are Poincare invariant, so the operators would naturally be Poincare invariant as well. So options 1 and 2 would both be correct.

Wait, the options include 1,2 as option A. But looking at the options, the choices are 1,2; 3,4; 1,2,4; and 1,3,4. So if 1 and 2 are both correct, then option A is a possibility. But let's think about the other options.

CP symmetry (option 3) – does SMEFT enforce that? I don't think so. Because SMEFT is meant to include all possible operators, including those that violate CP. For example, the Standard Model itself doesn't have a CP symmetry in its most general form (except when you impose it), so the effective theory should include terms that can break CP. Therefore, SMEFT doesn't require operators to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

CPT symmetry (option 4) – I'm a bit fuzzy on this. From what I remember, in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry, meaning that any Lorentz-invariant QFT must respect CPT symmetry. So if the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT automatically. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry because the theory is Lorentz symmetric. So option 4 is a must.

Putting this together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, wait, but does Poincare include Lorentz? Oh right, Poincare is the combination of Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, if an operator respects Poincare, it doesn't need to be separately checked for Lorentz symmetry.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is a must, then Lorentz is automatically included. But in the options, the available options are 1,2,3,4.

Wait, looking back at the question: which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So, the SMEFT operators must respect Poincare? Or only Lorentz?

I think in the SMEFT, all operators are Poincare invariant. Because the theory is an effective field theory, which is a Poincare-invariant theory. So operators must be Poincare-invariant. Therefore, both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are automatically respected, but since Poincare is a bigger symmetry, perhaps the question is whether each operator must individually respect both or just Poincare.

Wait, no, the question lists the options as 1,2,3,4, so each is a separate point.

So, if the operators must respect Poincare, then they must respect both Lorentz and translations. But does the question treat Lorentz and Poincare as separate options? Because option 1 is Lorentz, option 2 is Poincare.

But if Poincare is the larger symmetry, then all operators must respect Poincare, which automatically includes Lorentz. So, in that case, does the question consider both 1 and 2 as correct? Because each operator must respect Poincare, which implies they respect Lorentz.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT". So if an operator respects Poincare, it's already respecting Lorentz. So does the operator need to separately respect Lorentz? Or does the requirement that they respect Poincare imply that Lorentz is automatically respected?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think about what SMEFT requires. The SMEFT is built by including all possible operators that are consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model is Poincare-invariant, so the SMEFT must also be Poincare-invariant.

Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. So that would mean that both Lorentz and translation symmetries are part of what they're respecting.

But wait, the question is giving two separate options, 1 and 2: Lorentz and Poincare. If the operator respects Poincare, it's already respecting Lorentz. So, do both 1 and 2 have to be true?

Wait, but every operator that respects Poincare must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So, if the question is about which symmetries the operators must respect, and Poincare is one of them, then the operator must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So in that case, do the operators have to respect both? Or is Poincare a superset?

But the question gives each as a separate option. So perhaps the correct approach is that the operators must respect Poincare, which already includes Lorentz, so the correct answer would include both 1 and 2.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1, 2, 4. So if the operators must respect Poincare (so 2 is correct), then 1 is automatically correct. So both 1 and 2 would be correct.

Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are written down as Lorentz-invariant operators. Because the SMEFT is an effective theory, which is Lorentz-invariant. So operators must be Lorentz-invariant. But since they are also part of a Poincare-invariant theory, they must also be translation-invariant. But translation invariance is a part of Poincare. So perhaps the operators don't need to separately respect Poincare, but they must respect Lorentz.

Wait, I'm confused. Let me think again. In effective field theory, operators are constructed to be Lorentz invariant. They are local operators, so they automatically respect translation invariance because they're written in a way that's invariant under translations. So if an operator is written in terms of SM fields, which are Poincare-invariant, then any operator built from them would be Poincare-invariant? Or is that not necessarily the case?

Hmm, perhaps in the SMEFT, all operators are Poincare-invariant. Because the theory as a whole is Poincare-invariant. So each operator must be Poincare-invariant. Therefore, if an operator respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz, so both 1 and 2 would be correct. So the answer would include both 1 and 2.

But then, what about CPT symmetry (option 4). Since the theory is a Lorentz-invariant QFT, CPT must be respected. Because in any Lorentz-invariant QFT, CPT is a symmetry. So any operator must respect CPT, because the theory as a whole must be CPT-invariant.

Wait, so if the theory is built to be Lorentz-invariant, then it must be CPT-invariant. Therefore, any operator in the theory must also respect CPT, because otherwise the theory wouldn't be CPT symmetric. So option 4 must be correct.

So putting it together, the operators must respect Poincare (2), Lorentz (1), and CPT (4). But wait, if Poincare includes Lorentz, then if 2 is correct, 1 is automatically correct. So in that case, the correct choices are 1, 2, 4. So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but what about the statement that "all operators must respect Poincare"? So do the operators themselves have to respect Poincare, or is it the theory as a whole?

Hmm, in EFTs, the operators are written in such a way that the entire action is Poincare-invariant. So each individual operator doesn't need to be Poincare-invariant on its own; rather, the sum of all operators must be Poincare-invariant. Because each operator is multiplied by a coefficient, which is a Lorentz scalar, so the operator itself doesn't need to be Poincare-invariant; it's just part of the terms in the action that must be Poincare-invariant.

Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Because each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. So each operator must be Lorentz-invariant. So the operator itself is a Lorentz scalar. So each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry. But they don't have to individually respect Poincare, because the coefficients can take care of the translation part. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether the operators must be invariant under Lorentz, Poincare, etc. Or whether the entire theory must be invariant.

In the case of the SMEFT, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar because the theory is Lorentz-invariant. So the operator itself must be Lorentz-invariant, so option 1 is correct. For Poincare, since the theory is Poincare-invariant, each operator must be a Poincare scalar. But wait, each operator is part of the Lagrangian density, which is a scalar under Poincare (since the action is). So perhaps the operator itself (as part of the Lagrangian) is a Poincare scalar. Wait, but the operator is a term in the Lagrangian, which is a scalar. Therefore, each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So each operator must be Poincare-invariant. Therefore, both 1 and 2 would be correct.

But wait, in the SMEFT, the operators are written as part of the Lagrangian, which is a scalar. So each operator must be a scalar under Poincare. So yes, both 1 and 2 are correct.

But then, what about CPT? Since the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must be CPT-invariant, so each operator must transform correctly under CPT. So option 4 is correct. So the correct answer would be 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but the answer options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So if it's 1,2,4, that's option C.

But wait, earlier I thought that if operators are part of a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian, then the operator itself must be Poincare-invariant. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

So putting it all together, the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. So the correct answer is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective field theory constructed to include all possible operators that modify the Standard Model, while respecting certain symmetries. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry (Option 1):** SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it extends the Standard Model, which is Lorentz-invariant. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry (Option 2):** Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT is a Poincaré-invariant theory, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry. This implies that Lorentz symmetry (Option 1) is automatically included.

3. **CP Symmetry (Option 3):** CP symmetry is not a fundamental symmetry of the SMEFT framework. The SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP symmetry, as it is designed to encompass all possible modifications to the Standard Model. Therefore, CP symmetry does not need to be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry (Option 4):** CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must also respect CPT symmetry. Thus, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Poincaré symmetry (2) automatically includes Lorentz symmetry (1), but both are explicitly listed in the options. Therefore, the correct answer is **Option C: 1, 2, 4**.

Answer: C
