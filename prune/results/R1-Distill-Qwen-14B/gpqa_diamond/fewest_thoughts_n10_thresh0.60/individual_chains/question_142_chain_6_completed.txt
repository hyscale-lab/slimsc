Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, let's see. I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what exactly does the geometrical position refer to here?

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Oh right, I think this is a classical mixture of the |0> and |1> states. Because each term is a projector, and they are added together with equal coefficients, so each has a probability of 1/2.

Density matrices for qubits are 2x2 Hermitian matrices with trace 1 and positive semi-definite. The density matrix can also be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere, but wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? For mixed states, it's more like a point in the space, but maybe in the same 3D space as the Bloch sphere.

Wait, the Bloch vector representation. For a qubit, any state can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can express the given ρ in this form, I can find r.

Let me compute this. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write out |0><0|. That's the matrix [[1, 0],[0, 0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together, I get [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2.

Now, the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So comparing, I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. That implies r·σ must be zero. So r must be the zero vector.

Wait, what does that mean for the Bloch vector? The Bloch vector is (x, y, z), and in this case, all components are zero. So the point is at the origin.

Wait, but the options are given as r=(1,1,0) etc. Let me check the options:

Option C is (0,0,0). So that must be the answer. Because when r is zero, all the Pauli terms vanish, and ρ becomes identity/2, which matches the given matrix.

So the geometrical position is at the origin. So the correct answer is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with a probability of \(1/2\). For a single qubit, any density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector representation as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a 3D vector (the Bloch vector). Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be the zero vector, \(\mathbf{r} = (0,0,0)\).

This means the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the Bloch vector is zero for this density matrix.

Answer: C
