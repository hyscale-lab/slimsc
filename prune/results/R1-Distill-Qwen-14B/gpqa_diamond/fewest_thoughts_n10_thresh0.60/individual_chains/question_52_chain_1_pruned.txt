Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit nervous because stellar atmospheres can be tricky, but let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star with certain parameters. Let me jot down the given information first. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting, so spots are causing the temperature to decrease.

Now, the main part of the question involves the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. They're asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, in the photosphere, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy difference. So the ratio depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

Wait, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. So that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe the UV? Let me calculate the energy of that photon. The energy E is hc/λ. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. So λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

Calculating E: (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon. To get this in terms of eV (electron volts), since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E
