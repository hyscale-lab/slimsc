Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these spectrographs have different brightness limits. Let me think about what I know.

First, the question gives me some details. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Oh right, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." But wait, higher magnitudes mean dimmer stars, right? Because lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, that's like apparent magnitude less than 17. So ESPRESSO can see stars down to 17 mag, meaning it can detect stars that are brighter than thatâ€”so up to 17, but not beyond, I guess. Because higher than 17 is fainter, so they can't see those.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So same logic: apparent magnitude less than 16. So they can see stars up to 16 mag. So a star that's magnitude 15 is okay for both, but one that's 16 would be okay for HIRES but not ESPRESSO if ESPRESSO's limit is 17. Wait, no, wait. No, no. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17
