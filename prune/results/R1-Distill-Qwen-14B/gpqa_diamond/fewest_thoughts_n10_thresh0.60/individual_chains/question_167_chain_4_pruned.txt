Okay, I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. 

Hmm, wait, what's non-Gaussianity here? I remember that non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, like coherent states or squeezed states. The relative entropy measure compares the state's entropy to a reference Gaussian state's entropy. So, the formula given is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the Gaussian reference state's density matrix.

First, I think I need to compute the density matrix rho for the given state. The state is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, scaled by cos(phi) and sin(phi), respectively. 

Let me write down the state more clearly. |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. N is the normalization constant, given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2 alpha²)). Wait, let me compute N for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

First, compute sin(2*phi). 2*(-pi/4) is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2*phi) = -1.

Then, exp(-2 alpha²) with alpha=0.5 is exp(-2*(0.5)^2)=exp(-2*0.25)=exp(-0.5)= approximately 0.6065. So, the term inside N's square root is 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state becomes: [cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> = [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

To find rho, I need to compute |psi><psi|. But coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator a. The density matrix rho would be a mixed state that may not be Gaussian because it's a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian.

The reference state tau is a Gaussian state. Usually, the reference could be the closest Gaussian state to rho. Or perhaps, for the relative entropy, the reference could be a thermal state or a coherent state. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the reference is the Gaussian state obtained by taking the expectation values of the same state. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps, for the relative entropy, tau is the Gaussian state that is closest to rho in some sense, like the one with the same first and second moments. Alternatively, maybe it's the maximum likelihood Gaussian estimate.

Alternatively, for a cat state, the reference Gaussian state might be the fully mixed state, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the reference could be the state that has the same first moments as rho but is Gaussian. Alternatively, maybe the reference is the state which is a statistical mixture of the coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, each with some probability. But wait, rho is a pure state, so tau would have to be a mixed Gaussian state that best approximates rho.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference
