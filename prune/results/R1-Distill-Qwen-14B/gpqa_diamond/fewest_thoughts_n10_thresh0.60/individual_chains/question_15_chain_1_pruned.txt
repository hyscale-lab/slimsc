Okay, so I've got this problem here about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me try to think this through.

So the question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, since shorter period means closer orbit, right? Because Kepler's third law says the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So if P1 is P and P2 is 3P, then Planet_2 is three times farther out.

Wait, but the host stars have different masses. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So even though one star is more massive, they have the same size. That probably means Planet_1's star is more evolved or perhaps a subgiant or something, but the problem says Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Wait, the problem says Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so Planet_1's host is younger or less evolved because it's more massive?

Anyway, the main thing is the transit probability. Transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The probability that a planet transits its star from our perspective is roughly (R_planet + R_star) / a, but wait, actually, the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital plane's area that is aligned with our line of sight. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is R_star / a, but that's when considering the planet's orbital inclination. Oh wait, but in reality, the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is closer to edge-on. But for a random orientation, the probability is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (but not exactly, because it's more about the relative size of the star and the planet's orbital path projected in the sky).

Wait, no, the formula I remember for the transit probability is P â‰ˆ (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (m_planet/m_star)^(1/3)) ))
