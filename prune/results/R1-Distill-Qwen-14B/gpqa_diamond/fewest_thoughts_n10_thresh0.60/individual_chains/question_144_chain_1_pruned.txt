Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through. 

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and their decay distance has something to do with their lifetime and speed. Oh right, the mean decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. 

The production energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Wait, the width is the decay width, right? And that relates to the lifetime of the particle. 

I think the formula involves the mean lifetime, which comes from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy (which is the width Γ) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (the lifetime τ) is about ħ. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, τ is the mean lifetime, and the decay length is the product of the particle's velocity (v) and the lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ. Oh, but I need to calculate v, the velocity of the meson.

To find the velocity, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The energy E is given, which is the total energy of the meson. The mass is m, so I can find the momentum p from that. 

The formula for total energy is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So, p = sqrt( (E² - (mc²)²) ) / c. Wait, let me write that properly. 

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. Let me make sure the units are compatible. Since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c², I should convert everything to consistent units. But maybe I can keep using GeV for energy and mass since we're dealing with ratios that might cancel out units. 

So, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Let's compute p. 

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. So,

p² c² = E² - m² c^4. Wait, I'm a bit confused with the units here. Let me think. Let's consider c=1 in these units, which is
