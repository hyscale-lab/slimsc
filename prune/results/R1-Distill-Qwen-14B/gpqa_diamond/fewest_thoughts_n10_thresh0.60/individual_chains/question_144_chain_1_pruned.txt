Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about meson decay. Hmm, the question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with different values.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, the formula involves the particle's lifetime and the speed at which it travels. So the mean decay length L is given by L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime.

But how do I find τ? Oh, right, from the uncertainty principle, the lifetime is related to the width Γ. The formula is τ = ħ / Γ. Wait, but I need to make sure the units are correct. Let me think: Γ is given in MeV, but I need to convert it into energy units that match with ħ which is in J·s.

Wait, the natural units in particle physics often use ħc, but maybe I should convert everything into standard units. Alternatively, I think there's a formula that relates the decay width to the lifetime without having to convert units manually. Oh, right, the natural unit system uses ħ = c = 1, so I can use the relation τ = 1/(Γ) when Γ is in GeV, but I need to convert GeV into inverse seconds because ħ has units of J·s.

Alternatively, I think I can use the formula for the decay length which combines the factors
