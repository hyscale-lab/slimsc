Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about stars and their effective temperature. Oh right, when there are spots on the star, it affects the overall temperature, and that changes the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels. I remember something about this from my studies on stellar atmospheres and maybe the Boltzmann equation.

So the problem says the star normally has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses, but when it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that happen? Oh, because the spots are cooler, right? So they emit less flux, bringing the average temperature down.

But the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

I think the ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where E is the energy difference between the two levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Oh wait, no, actually, the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T)
