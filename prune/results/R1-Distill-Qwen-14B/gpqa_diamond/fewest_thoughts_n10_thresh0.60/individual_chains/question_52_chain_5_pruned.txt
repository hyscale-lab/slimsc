Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem is about a star with certain parameters. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They've observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when spots are present. Wait, let me think about what determines the ratio of populations in two energy levels for a star in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which is given here.

In LTE, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of the levels, E2 and E1 are their energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the ratio they're considering is n1/n2. So, that would be the reciprocal of the above, right? So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). 

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. So the energy difference between the levels can be found using the relation E = hc/λ. 

Let me compute the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3.0e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So, ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) )= approximately 1.37e-18 J per photon. 

But since we're dealing with energy levels per atom, maybe it's easier to express this in terms of eV. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So ΔE in eV would be (1.37e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.55 eV.

Wait, that seems a bit high for a transition in a typical stellar spectrum. Wait, maybe I made a mistake
