Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. There are four possible structures given, and I need to pick the correct one based on the spectral data.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. Broad peaks around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1700 is likely a carbonyl group, which is common in ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H peak, which aligns with the 3000 cm^-1 data. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so there are no double bonds or aromatic rings here. That rules out any structures with those features, but all the options given seem to be aliphatic.

In the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about how splitting works. Each split comes from neighboring protons. So if a proton is next to two sets of neighboring protons, the splitting gets more complex.

Let's try to analyze each option one by one.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the structure here is like a central CH attached to two C2H5 groups, then another CH attached to two C2H5, followed by a CH2 and then COOH. Wait, maybe I should draw it out. The molecule would be something like (CH(CH2CH3))2CH2COOH. So the CH2 group would be attached to the COOH. Let me think about the NMR signals here.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. This would be a central CH connected to a C2H5 group on each side, with the COOH at the end. So the structure is (CH2CH2CH3) attached to two C2H5 groups? Wait, not exactly. It's more like CH2CH2 is part of the chain. Maybe the central part is two CH groups each attached to ethyl groups. So, maybe (CH2CH2CH3) is not right. Wait, no. The structure is CH3CH2- connected to a CH
