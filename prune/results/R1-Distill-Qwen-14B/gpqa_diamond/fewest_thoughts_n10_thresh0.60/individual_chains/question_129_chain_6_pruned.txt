Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions, and there are some hints provided. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And then there are two hints:

Hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hint b: IR spectra of A and E. A has a peak around 1750 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1, which is a bit lower, maybe an ester or another carbonyl group but in a different environment.

Let me think about each step.

Starting with Compound A reacting with HCN to form B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups in a nucleophilic addition. So A is likely a ketone because HCN adding to a ketone would form a cyanohydrin. So A would have a carbonyl, and B would be the cyanohydrin.

Then, Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation. The cyanohydrin has a nitrile group. When you hydrogenate a nitrile, you typically get an amine, but wait, under what conditions? Wait, Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation of triple bonds or for some other groups. Wait, the cyanohydrin has a hydroxyl and a nitrile group.

Wait, maybe the structure of B is something like a secondary alcohol and a nitrile attached to the same carbon. Wait, no, HCN adds to the carbonyl, so the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent? Hmm.

Alternatively, when HCN adds to a ketone, you get a cyanohydrin. So the structure would have a CH(OH)CN group attached. When you reduce that, perhaps the nitrile would be hydrogenated. Nitriles upon hydrogenation typically become amines. Wait, no, hydrogenation of nitriles usually gives either primary amines (with H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni) or, with more vigorous conditions, perhaps more? Wait, but in the presence of Pd, perhaps the double bond is hydrogenated? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, Compound B is the product of A + HCN, which is a cyanohydrin. So B would have a structure like R-C(OH)-CN, where R is the rest of the molecule. Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, perhaps the nitrile group (CN) is reduced to an amine. So R-CH(OH)-CH2NH2? Or maybe R-CH(OH)CH2
