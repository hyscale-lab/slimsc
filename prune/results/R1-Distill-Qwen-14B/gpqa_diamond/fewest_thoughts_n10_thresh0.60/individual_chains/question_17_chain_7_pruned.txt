Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The pH is ideal, which I think probably means that the EDTA is in its correct deprotonated form to bind Ca²+ effectively. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, I guess. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10, which is a pretty large K, so the complex is very stable.

Wait, the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So, I'm thinking about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. Since the complex is formed, calcium and EDTA are bound together. But maybe some of them dissociate, releasing Ca²+ ions. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would depend on the stability of the complex.

I remember that the formation constant, Kf, is given by [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but wait, the K given here is K_Ca-EDTA. I think that's the same as Kf, the formation constant. So the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, and the formation constant Kf
