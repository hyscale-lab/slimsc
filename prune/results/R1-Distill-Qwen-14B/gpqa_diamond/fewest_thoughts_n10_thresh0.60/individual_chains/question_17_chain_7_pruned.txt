Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. Hmm, it's about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and they give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The question is asking for the concentration of Ca²+ ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions. So, the Ca-EDTA complex is a complex ion, right? The formula for the complex would be something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA part.

The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The problem is to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution. Because EDTA complexes are usually very stable, the concentration of free Ca²+ should be low, right?

I think I need to use the formation constant, K, for the complex. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA react to form the complex. The reaction would be something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So, the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 M. But what about the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4−?

I think that when the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, we can assume that the EDTA is mostly in the complex form, so the free EDTA is very low, and similarly, the free Ca²+ is very low. But wait, is there any way to simplify this?

Wait, because the formation constant is really large (5e10), that suggests that the complex is very stable. So, the majority of the EDTA and Ca²+ would be tied up in the complex. So, for the initial assumption, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M.

But, since the reaction is in equilibrium, some
