Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/distance, or distance = 1/plx. 

Wait, so if parallax is inversely proportional to distance, then higher parallax means closer stars. But the problem here says the number of stars varies as 1/(plx^5). So if I express this in terms of distance, it might make more sense.

Let me write down the relationship. The number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that: 1 divided by (1^5)/(d^5) ) equals d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but that's the number of stars as a function of distance. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, right, so probably we're looking for dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, no, maybe not exactly the derivative, but how N depends on r. Because the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, perhaps it's about the density of stars along the line of sight. Or maybe the number per unit volume.

Wait a second, I need to think about the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax plx is in arcseconds, and distance d is in parsecs. The formula is d = 1/plx. So plx = 1/d.

Given that the number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5. So substituting plx = 1/d, N is proportional to 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

But wait, the number of stars as a function of distance? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because stars aren't distributed in such a way. Oh wait, this is a specific region, so maybe it's the number of stars within a certain volume at a distance r. Or per unit distance.

Alternatively, maybe it's the number of stars per unit volume, which would depend on how many are in a given spherical shell or something.

Wait, the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So they're saying that within a certain region, for each star, the number you see depends on the parallax to the -5th power.

So if you have a thin shell at distance d, the number of stars in that shell would depend on how much volume there is, and how star density depends on distance.

Wait, let me think about the actual relation. Suppose that the number of stars in a small range of distance dr is N = (some density) * (volume element).

The volume element for a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4π d² dr. So if the number of stars in that shell is proportional to (d^5) * (4π d² dr), that would be 4π* d^7 dr. But that seems maybe not right.

Wait, no, maybe the density itself is varying with d. Let me think again.

The problem says N varies as 1/(plx^5) = d^5. So if you're considering the number of stars within a certain distance d, then N = d^5. But that can't be, because as d increases, more stars would be found, but that would suggest the number grows rapidly. But I think the correct approach is to consider how the number per unit distance changes.

Wait, wait, no. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's about the rate of change of N with r. So dN/dr.

So if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4. But then the options have a r^5 option, but I'm not sure. Let me see the options again.

Options are A) ~r^3, B) ~ r^5, C) ~r^4, D) ~r^2.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me go back.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And plx = 1/d. So N ∝ d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. But the question is about how N changes with d. So if N = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5 k d^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

But wait, the options don't have an r^4 as the change. Wait, looking at the options, option C is r^4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, so per unit range, meaning per dr, so the rate of change is dN/dr, which is 5 r^4. So yes, the change is proportional to r^4.

But maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think again. Maybe the initial assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars within a certain distance r is N = k r^5. Then the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr is dN = 5k r^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (dr) increases as r^4.

Therefore, the change in the number of stars with distance (per unit range) is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but the given options are A to D. Let me just make sure.

Alternatively, another approach: The number density of stars (stars per unit volume) is given. So if the number of stars in a volume element dV is proportional to (d^5) * dV. But that seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the initial statement is that for each star, the number observed is inversely proportional to plx^5. So the number of stars you can see depends on 1/(plx^5). Parallax is 1/d, so 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But how does N change as d changes? If N = k d^5, then the number per unit distance (dN/dr) is 5k d^4.

So the answer would be option C, ~ r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \), where parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \) into the given relationship, the number of stars becomes \( N \propto d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), i.e., \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), taking the derivative gives:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
