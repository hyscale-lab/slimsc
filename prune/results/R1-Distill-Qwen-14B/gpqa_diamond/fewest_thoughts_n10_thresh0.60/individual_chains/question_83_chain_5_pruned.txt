Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH at two different points during a titration. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the setup is that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D with two pH values each.

First, I'll recall what I know about titrations, especially for weak acids with strong bases. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction will form acetate ions and water.

Let me break this down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the initial concentration after dilution.

Original volume of acetic acid: 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) with 0.05 M concentration. So the moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are:

moles = Molarity × Volume (L)
moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

Then, we add 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). So the new concentration is:

M = moles / volume(L) = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Step 2: Determine the equivalence point.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH (a strong base) added equals the moles of acetic acid present.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.001 moles.

NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is:

volume = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So, equivalence occurs when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. That's 25% of the way? Wait, wait. Wait, the question says "at 25% titration" — does that mean 25% of the equivalence volume has been added? Or 25% of the original solution? Hmm, probably the former because usually, titration percentages refer to the fraction of the equivalence volume added. But let me think again.

Wait, no. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³. So 25% of that would be 2.5 cm³. Wait, but the question says "at 25% titration", which could mean that 25% of the acid has been neutralized. Alternatively, maybe it's 25% of the NaOH solution added relative to the equivalence point?

Hmm. Wait, more accurately, the question is about 25% titration, which I think refers to the point where 25% of the required NaOH to reach equivalence has been added. So for the equivalence volume (V_eq) of 10 cm³, 25% would be 2.5 cm³ added. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about the volume of titrant relative to the solution being titrated. Wait, that's another possibility. But no, typically, the percentage of titration refers to the amount of the analyte neutralized. So 25% titration would mean that 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

So, either way, perhaps I should calculate both points: one at 25% of the required NaOH (so 2.5 cm³) and another at equivalence (10 cm³). But wait, the question is asking for two specific points: 25% titration and equivalence point. So I need to find pH at both points.

But wait, perhaps the 25%
