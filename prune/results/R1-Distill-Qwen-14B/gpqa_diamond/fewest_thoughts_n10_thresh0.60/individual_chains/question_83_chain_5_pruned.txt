Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work it out.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. Since we're adding equal volumes of water and acetic acid solution, the concentration should be halved. Let me calculate the new concentration after dilution.

The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So, the new concentration (C) can be found using C1V1 = C2V2. Here, C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, and V2 is 40 cm³.

So, 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = C2 * 40 cm³ → C2 = (0.05 *20)/40 = 0.025 M. Okay, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, I need to find out how much NaOH is required to reach the equivalence point. Since it's a titration, I should calculate the moles of acetic acid and see how much NaOH is needed to neutralize it.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So, the moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in the diluted solution are:

Molarity = 0.025 M, Volume = 40 cm³ = 0.04 L.

Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Since NaOH reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O), the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence are also 0.001 moles.

Now, to find the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence, use Molarity = moles / volume. So, volume = moles / Molarity.

NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So, the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³. So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, let's tackle each part: the pH at 25% and at equivalence.

First, the 25% titration point.

At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The solution will be a buffer solution.

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles. Moles of NaOH added = 0.001 moles × 0.25 (since 25%) → 0.00025 moles.

So, moles of CH3COOH reacted = 0.00025, so remaining is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO-) formed = 0.00025 moles.

Since the total volume of the solution is the original 40 cm³ plus the NaOH added. Wait, wait, how much NaOH have we added? At 25%, we added 2.5 cm³. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

The pKa of acetic acid is given by Ka = 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.73 (since log(1.85e-5) is about 4.73 in negative, so pKa is 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Looking at the options, the first values are 4.26 (option A), 3.17 (B), 4.73 (C), 4.57 (D). So, approximately 4.25 is close to 4.26, which is option A's first value.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let me compute the exact concentrations.

Moles of acetic acid after reaction: 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Ratio [A-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) = 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) = log(1/3) ≈ -0.4771.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2529, which rounds to 4.25. The option A says 4.26, which is very close.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

But wait, sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, no, wait: Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.
