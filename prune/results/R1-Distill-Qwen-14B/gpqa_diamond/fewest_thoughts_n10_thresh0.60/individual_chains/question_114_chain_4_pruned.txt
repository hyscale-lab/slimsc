Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The problem has two reactions. The first one is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct pair of reagents from the options, which are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about each reaction.

First Reaction: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, methylacetone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. So, what kind of reaction would this be? Oh wait, when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably a nucleophilic addition. But in this case, maybe it's a substitution? Or perhaps it's an example of a cyanohydrin formation.

Wait, cyanohydrin formation is when a carbonyl compound reacts with cyanide to form a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin is a compound where the hydroxyl and cyanide groups add to the carbonyl carbon. So, for example, R2CO + CN- → R2C(OH)CN.

So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's exactly the product here.

So the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The conditions for this reaction: I think that generally, carbonyl compounds react with CN- in a solution. The solvent is often aqueous, maybe with some acid or base.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, and it's reacting with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions. The reaction is probably under acidic or basic conditions. Or wait, maybe it's in a protic solvent with some H+.

Wait, the cyanohydrin formation usually occurs in a basic medium, but sometimes with acid catalysis. Alternatively, sometimes it's done with aqueous Na
