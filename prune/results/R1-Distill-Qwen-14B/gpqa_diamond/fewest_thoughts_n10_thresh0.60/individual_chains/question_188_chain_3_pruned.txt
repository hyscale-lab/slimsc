Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal but the angles can be different, right? Or wait, no, wait, wait. No, rhombohedral typically has all edges equal and all angles equal, but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles are all 30 degrees each. Interesting.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I'm a bit rusty on my interplanar distance formulas. I think the formula involves the lattice constants and the Miller indices. Let me try to recall. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )

Wait, or is that correct? Another possibility is using the reciprocal relation. Alternatively, I remember that for cubic systems, the formula simplifies because all angles are 90 degrees, but here it's a rhombohedral system, so angles are involved.

Wait, another way to think is using the general formula for d-spacing in a crystal. The formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) + 2(hl cos β)/(a²) + 2(kl cos α)/(a²)

Wait, no, maybe
