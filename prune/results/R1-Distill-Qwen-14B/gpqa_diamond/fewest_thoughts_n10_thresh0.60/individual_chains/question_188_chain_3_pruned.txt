Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal but the angles between them are not necessarily 90 degrees. So it's a type of crystal system where the unit cell is a rhombohedron. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance is calculated using the formula from crystallography. I think the general formula for the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by 1/d squared equals (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) minus something involving the cosines of the angles... Oh right, because in a rhombohedral system, the lattice constants a, b, c are all the same, say 'a', but the angles are different.

Wait, actually, wait. In a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, right? And the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all the same. So in this case, all edges are equal to 10 Angstroms, and each angle is 30 degrees.

The formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is a bit different from the cubic case. Oh right, the formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2 hk (cos α_bar) )/(a²) - (2 hk (cos β_bar)) /a²) ... Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I remember that the general formula for any triclinic system is more complicated, but in the case of a rhombohedral system, it might simplify.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system can be written as:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) )

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h
