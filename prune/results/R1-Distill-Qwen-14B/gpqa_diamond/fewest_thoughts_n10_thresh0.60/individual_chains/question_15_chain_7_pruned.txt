Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of their transiting. Hmm, transiting method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, right? That's how we detect them, along with the radial velocity method.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But their masses are the same. Oh wait, RV gives the minimum mass because the inclination could vary, but maybe that's not super important here.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1 = P2/3. That probably means it's closer to its star because shorter period implies closer orbit, right? Because according to Kepler's third law, period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed over the star's mass. So for a given mass, shorter period means smaller a.

Now, the host stars: the star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So higher mass but same radius? Maybe the Planet_1's star is more massive (like a main sequence star) and Planet_2's star is slightly evolved but same size? Hmm, but same radius might mean their luminosity could differ because radius and mass are different for stars.

Wait, the key here is the probability of transit. The transit probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula I remember is that the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s), but wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits) is given by the formula P = (R_p / a) / (R_s / a) ) squared? No, wait. Wait, the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius (wait, no, that's not exactly right). Let me think. The transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a/(R_s * (1 + m_p / M_s))^{1/3} )) or something like that. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach:
