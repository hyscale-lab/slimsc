Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, but both have the same mass? Oh, right, same masses. So minimum mass is same for both. But their periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star, I guess.

Both have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit. The stars are different. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But wait, both stars have the same radii. Hmm, strange. Because more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so maybe it's a subgiant or something and hasn't expanded yet, so same radius as a less massive star.

So the question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula I think is something like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Or maybe it's the planet's orbital size relative to the star's size.

Wait
