Okay, so I've got this question here about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry types, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what is C3h symmetry? I remember that the 'h' in the notation refers to a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h would mean there's a three-fold rotational axis and also a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, or is it that the molecule has a three-fold rotation and a reflection that goes through it? Or maybe the horizontal mirror plane is involved in the symmetry operations. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the C3h point group consists of a three-fold rotation (360/3=120 degrees) and a horizontal mirror plane. So any molecule with this symmetry should be able to be rotated 120 degrees and look the same, and also have a mirror plane that cuts through it.

So looking at the options, the four molecules are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

I need to figure out each of their structures and their symmetries.

Starting with triisopropyl borate. Hmm
