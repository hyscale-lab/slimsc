Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two separate reactions, A and B. I need to determine the major products for each and then match them with the options given.

First, let's look at reaction A. The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol, and the reagents are THF, KH, and H+. THF is a solvent, commonly used in Grignard reactions, but here with KH (which is potassium hydride), and then an acid workup.

Wait, potassium hydride is a strong base. In the context of alcohols, maybe it's deprotonating something. But wait, the starting material is a spiro alcohol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom â€“ in this case, the alcohol is on a spiro structure with a vinyl group attached.

So, the structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol probably is a spiro ring system with one ring being a 3-membered and the other a 5-membered, connected at the 1st position. The 1st position has a vinyl group (CH2CH2) and an OH group.

Reaction conditions: THF is a good solvent for such reactions. KH is a strong base; perhaps it's used to deprotonate the alcohol. But wait, the alcohol is on a spiro system. Deprotonating an alcohol typically gives an alkoxide. But wait, maybe it's more about elimination? Or perhaps a ring-forming reaction.

Wait, but the reagents are THF, KH, and then H+. So the steps are: deprotonation with a base, followed by acid quench. Let me think about similar reactions. If you have a cyclic ether or a strained alcohol, deprotonating might lead to some kind of elimination or ring expansion.

Alternatively, the reaction could be an example of the Cope elimination or some kind of pinacol-like rearrangement. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition or an enol formation.

Wait a minute, wait. The starting material
