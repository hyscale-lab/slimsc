Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me three separate reactions labeled A, B, and C, and for each, I need to determine the major product. Then, I have to match the options provided (A to D) to see which set of products is correct.

Let me start by recalling what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile (enolate) attacking the β-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. This is a conjugate addition, adding across the conjugated double bond.

So, each of these reactions is a Michael addition. The first thing I need to do is identify the reactants and figure out what the products should look like.

Let's tackle each part one by one.

Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → A

Hmm. Dimethyl malonate is a good donor in the Michael reaction. It's a diethyl malonate derivative, but in this case, it's dimethyl. Wait, no—malonate ester is typically the donor. So, the enolate would form from dimethyl malonate, and the acceptor is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, what's the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate? The acrylate part is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but the substituent is at the 3 position. Wait, no—3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent on carbon 3. So, the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)COOCH3. Oh wait, wait no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon?

Wait, no—that's not possible. Wait, maybe it's
