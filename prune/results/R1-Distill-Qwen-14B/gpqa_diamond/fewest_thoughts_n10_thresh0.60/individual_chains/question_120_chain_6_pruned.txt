Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. The formula is distance (in parsecs) = 1 / parallax. So if a star has a parallax plx, its distance is 1/plx parsecs. 

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution probably means that the number of stars in a given volume of space is constant. So if I imagine a sphere with radius r, the number of stars inside would depend on the volume, which is proportional to r^3. But wait, that's for a uniform density distribution.

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So for a small change in parallax, what's the corresponding change in distance, and how does that affect the number of stars in that range?

Let me approach this step by step. Suppose I consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d from the Earth. The thickness of this shell would be a small change in d, say delta_d. The volume of this shell would be the surface area of the sphere times delta_d. The surface area is 4πd², so the volume is 4πd² delta_d.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this shell would be proportional to the volume. So N = n * 4πd² delta_d, where n is
