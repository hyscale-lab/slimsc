Okay, so I've got this physics question here about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the approximation assumes nucleons behave like free nucleons. So, the idea is that when you're dealing with interactions (like electroweak), you treat each nucleon as if it's not influenced by the others except for when the interaction occurs. I think this is similar to how in some approximations, particles are treated as non-interacting except at the collision point.

The question lists four assumptions, and we need to pick which three jointly imply the impulse approximation. The options are A to D, each being a combination of 1-4.

Let me go through each assumption one by one.

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
   So this means that when an interaction happens, like maybe a photon or a weak boson interacting with a nucleon, it's just one at a time. So each nucleon interacts independently. That makes sense for the impulse approximation because if the interaction is with individual nucleons, you can treat each as a free particle during the interaction.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
   Hmm, transparent here probably means that the interaction doesn't see other nucleons. So when a particle interacts with the nucleus, it only interacts with one nucleon and passes through the others as if they weren't there. So the nucleus as a whole is transparent, except for that one nucleon. This would mean that the other nucleons don't affect the interaction, which fits with treating the nucleon as free—since their binding isn't considered except at the point of interaction.

3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
   Wait, quarks are inside nucleons, right? If the quarks are non-relativistic, that might mean that their motion is not at speeds close to light speed. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? Well, I'm not entirely sure. The impulse approximation is more about the treatment of the nucleon as a whole rather than the internal structure. So maybe this assumption is about treating the nucleon as a point particle in the interaction, not worrying about the internal dynamics. But I'm not certain how this directly contributes. Alternatively, if the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe it's an approximation that allows us to treat the nucleon as a single entity without considering the complexities of internal interactions. So perhaps this is a condition for the impulse approximation.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.
   Oh right, because in the impulse approximation, the nucleons are treated as if they're free. So when the interaction occurs, the binding forces within the nucleus are ignored. So the selected nucleon is treated as if it's free—no residual strong force or nuclear binding is considered during the interaction. That definitely fits with the impulse approximation.

So now, the question is which three of these four assumptions imply the impulse approximation.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,4. So they include 1 (interacts with individual), 2 (nucleus transparent except for the selected), and 4 (no binding forces). That
