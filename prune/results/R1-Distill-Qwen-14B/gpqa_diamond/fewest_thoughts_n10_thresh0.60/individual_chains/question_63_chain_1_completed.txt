Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule transitioning states. Hmm, let me think. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon. 

Wait, the model here is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that in such models, the energy levels account for both rotational and vibrational states. Oh right, because in a diatomic molecule, the atoms can rotate and vibrate.

So the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. But wait, what's the fundamental state exactly? Oh, the fundamental state is the first excited state above the ground state for a given mode. Or is it the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state? Or perhaps I'm mixing up terms.

Wait, no. The fundamental vibrational state is the lowest energy vibrational state, n=0. But since this is a rotation-vibration model, the molecule has both vibrational and rotational energy. In the non-rigid rotor, the bond length isn't fixed, so the rotational energy isn't quantized in the same way as a rigid rotor.

Wait, no, the non-rigid rotor model relaxes the assumption of a fixed bond length. So the rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than in the rigid rotor. But the problem gives the molecular bond length as 2 angstroms, so maybe we can treat it as a rigid rotor for some aspects, but not sure. Hmm.

The question is about absorbing a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the molecule absorbs a photon, which provides the energy needed to transition. The next lowest state would be the next higher energy state, which could involve a change in either vibrational or rotational energy, or both.

Wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. So the energy levels are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

The fundamental vibrational state is n=0, and the rotational state is the lowest, which is J=0? Or is that for rigid rotor? Hmm.

Wait, maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0) and some rotational state J. To reach the next lowest energy state, perhaps it would transition to the next higher rotational state, J+1, while remaining in the ground vibrational state. Or maybe it would transition to the next vibrational state, n=1, while staying in the same rotational state.

But the question says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the least energy increase. So perhaps the transition is n=0, J=0 to n=0, J=1. Because adding a rotational quantum number usually requires less energy than adding a vibrational one, as vibrational energy levels are more spaced out.

Wait, but the vibrational energy spacing is larger than rotational. The energy between vibrational levels is (1/2) h w + h w for each increment, whereas rotational changes are on the order of h c / (I), but I'm not exactly sure about the exact expressions.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (n + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w. Rotational energy levels for a non-rigid rotor are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The spacing between J and J+1 is E(J+1) - E(J) = B (2J+1 + 2J + 2) ??? Wait, no, E_rot for J is B J (J+1). So the difference between J and J+1 is B [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ] = B (2J+2) = 2 B (J+1).

At the lowest J, J=0, the energy difference is 2 B (1) = 2B. So the energy difference for rotational transition (when J goes from 0 to 1) is 2B. 

But what's the value of B? B is h^2 / (8 π^2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ R^2, μ being the reduced mass.

Hmm, so let me compute B. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh, but I need to convert that into kilograms. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 is about 3.018. So μ ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So R = 2e-10 m.

So moment of inertia I = μ R^2 = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Then B is h²/(8 π² I). Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J s. So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J s)^2.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (8 * pi² * 1.2072e-46 )

Calculate denominator: 8 * pi² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568. Multiply by 1.2072e-46: 78.9568 * 1.2072e-46 ≈ 95.3e-46 ≈ 9.53e-45.

So B ≈ 4.39e-67 / 9.53e-45 ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

So the rotational energy difference for J=0 to J=1 is 2B ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is h w. w is 4e14 rad/s. So h w is 6.626e-34 J s * 4e14 s⁻¹ = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing the two, 9.2e-23 J (rotational) is much smaller than 2.65e-19 J (vibrational). So the energy required for a rotational transition is much less. Therefore, the molecule would prefer to absorb a photon that allows it to transition to a higher rotational state rather than a vibrational one, as that photon would have a lower energy and require less energy to absorb.

Wait, but the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next state in the overall energy order. So maybe it's the combination of both, but I'm not entirely sure. But the energy levels are such that the vibrational transitions require much higher energy, so perhaps the next possible state is a change in the rotational state.

Wait, but the molecule is in its fundamental state. Hmm, the term 'fundamental state'—I think it's the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be the next energy level, which could be either J=1 with n=0, or n=1 with J=0.

Which has lower energy? Let me compute.

The energy for n=0, J=0: E = (0 + 1/2) h w + B*(0)(1) = (1/2) h w.

n=0, J=1: E = (0 + 1/2) h w + B*(1)(2) = (1/2) h w + 2B.

n=1, J=0: E = (1 + 1/2) h w + B*(0)(1) = (3/2) h w.

So the next state with the lowest possible energy is n=0, J=1. Because 2B is much smaller than h w. Because in the earlier calculation, 2B was 9.2e-23 J, and h w was 2.65e-19 J. So 2B is about 0.0347% of h w. So adding 2B is a much smaller step than adding h w.

Therefore, the molecule would transition from (n=0, J=0) to (n=0, J=1), requiring an energy of 2B.

So the photon's energy must be equal to 2B.

But wait, in rotational transitions, for a diatomic molecule, the selection rules are ΔJ = ±1. So from J=0, you can go to J=1. So yes, that's allowed.

So the photon's energy must be 2B. 

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Remember that photons carry energy E = h f, and momentum p = E / c, since for photons, E = pc.

So first, compute the energy required: 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Then, the photon's momentum p = E / c. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.066666...e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options have that. Let me check my calculations again. Did I make a mistake in calculating B?

Wait, let me recompute B.

B = h²/(8 π² I).

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 (J s)^2.

I is μ R².

μ is (20 *2)/(22) amu = (40/22)=18.18... wait, 40/22 is 1.818 amu.

So 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

So denominator: 8 pi² I = 8 * (pi^2) * 1.2072e-46.

pi^2 is about 9.8696.

So 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.957.

Multiply by 1.2072e-46: 78.957 * 1.2072e-46 ≈ 95.3e-46 → 9.53e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.53e-45 = 4.39e-67 / 9.53e-45 = approximately 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

Then, photon energy E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

Momentum p = E / c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.066e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are much larger. The options are roughly 1e-27 to 2e-27 N s. Wait, 1 N s is equal to 1 kg m/s. So my calculation gives p ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N s. But the options are 1e-27 and higher. Hmm, that's way smaller than the options. So I'm probably making a mistake.

Wait, maybe the transition isn't rotational but vibrational. Because if the rotational transition requires 9.2e-23 J, but the vibrational transition requires 2.65e-19 J, which is much larger. So why would the photon have to supply 2B?

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So if the next state is the first possible higher energy state, which would be the next state in the energy ordering. But in the energy levels, the vibrational levels are much higher. So perhaps the next state is a combination of J and n.

Wait, maybe the next state is the first possible state in the energy level diagram. Let me think about the possible states.

The energy levels are E = E_vib + E_rot.

E_vib for n=0 is (1/2) h w.

E_rot for J=0 is 0 (if it's a rigid rotor, but wait, no, for non-rigid rotor, E_rot is proportional to J(J+1). For J=0, E_rot =0.

Wait, wait, no: for the rigid rotor, E_rot = B J (J+1). For the non-rigid rotor, it's similar. So for J=0, E_rot is 0.

So the ground state is n=0, J=0: E= (1/2) h w.

Then, the next possible states could be:

1. n=0, J=1: E = (1/2) h w + 2B.

2. n=1, J=0: E = (3/2) h w + 0.

3. n=1, J=1: E = (3/2) h w + 2B.

So comparing the energies:

E for option 1: (1/2) h w + 2B ≈ 1.327e-19 J (since (1/2) h w is 1.327e-19 J, and 2B is 9.2e-23 J. So about 1.327e-19 J.

Option 2: (3/2) h w = 3.98e-19 J.

Option 3: 3.98e-19 J + 9.2e-23 J ≈ 3.98e-19 J.

So the next state with the lowest possible energy after the ground state (n=0, J=0) is option 1: n=0, J=1. So the energy transition is 2B.

So the photon's energy is 2B =9.2e-23 J. So the photon's momentum is p = E / c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N s.

But none of the options are anywhere near this. The options are in the 1e-27 to 2e-27 range. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the model wrong. The question says 'non-rigid rotor model', which is another name for the rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy levels are different. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which for a diatomic is n=0 (vibrational ground state) and J=0 (rotational ground state). So the next state could be either a vibrational or rotational excitation. But the question is which transition gives the minimal photon momentum.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggests that the rotational transition requires less energy. So perhaps that's the approach.

But wait, the problem asks for the photon's momentum. So the photon's energy is 2B, which we have as 9.2e-23 J. So p = E / c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. But that's way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the transition is a vibrational one. Wait, because I thought the energy for a vibrational transition is h w, but perhaps the question is in the context of the quantum harmonic oscillator. But the question states it's the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the photon's energy as the energy difference between the two states. So if the system is in the fundamental state, which is n=0, J=0. The next state is either n=0, J=1 (rotational) or n=1, J=0 (vibrational). The energy required is the lower of these two.

So which requires less energy: 2B or h w.

From previous calculation, 2B is 9.2e-23 J, and h w is 2.65e-19 J. So 2B is less. So the photon's energy is 2B.

So p = E_photon / c = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = approx 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all around 1e-27 or higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the moment of inertia I.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, so 2e-10 meters. Correct.

Masses: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu. Correct.

Then, μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg. Correct.

I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m². Correct.

Then, B = h²/(8 pi² I).

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J s)^2.

Denominator: 8 pi² I = 8 * (pi^2) * 1.207e-46 ≈ 8 * 9.87 * 1.207e-46 ≈ 8*11.91e-46 ≈ 9.53e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.53e-45 ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

Hmm. So photon energy is 9.2e-23 J. So p=9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are in this range. The options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns

So 3e-31 is much smaller than 1e-28.

Wait, perhaps the problem is thinking about the photon's energy as h w. So E = h w. Then, momentum p = h w / c = (6.626e-34 J s)(4e14 s^-1) / (3e8 m/s) = (2.65e-19 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 8.83e-28 kg m/s, which is 8.83e-28 N s.

But the options don't have that. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is close but half. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the transition is a vibrational one, but the photon's energy is ½ h w. No, the fundamental vibrational state is n=0, and the first transition would be to n=1, which requires an energy of h w.

Wait, maybe the question is about the rotational transition, but using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps for the non-rigid rotor, the rotational energy is quantized differently. Or perhaps I should have used the rigid rotor formula, which is E_rot = B J (J+1) for J=0,1,2,...

Wait, but I think I did that. So perhaps another error is in the moment of inertia. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is 2 angstroms, but I used 2 angstroms as 2e-10 m, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the rotational transition but the vibrational. Because in that case, the energy would be h w.

So E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Then p = E / c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s, which is 8.83e-28 Ns.

But that's not an option either. The closest option is A) 1.9e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's compute E_photon and p again.

E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = (6.626 *4) * 1e-20 → 26.504e-20 J → 2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon = E / c = 2.6504e-19 / (3e8) = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s → 8.8347e-28 Ns.

Hmm, no option matches that. So perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the molecule's vibrational energy is quantized, and the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w. So the photon must have energy h w. So the momentum is p= h w /c.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps it's a rotational transition with J changing from 0 to 1, but using the rigid rotor model. Let me recompute B for the rigid rotor.

Wait, no, the problem states non-rigid rotor, which would have a different formula for rotational energy. Hmm, maybe the non-rigid rotor uses a different expression, like E_rot = B J, not J(J+1). But no, I think that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the (n=0, J=0) state to (n=1, J=0), which would require a vibrational transition. So the energy would be h w.

But again, that gives p=8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't an option.

Another idea: perhaps the problem is about the minimum energy photon needed to cause any transition, which would be the rotational one, but I'm getting a momentum that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Let me recompute B.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) * 1.6605e-27 kg = 40/22 *1.66e-27 ≈ 1.818 *1.66e-27 ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.018e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Denominator: 8 pi² I = 8 * (pi^2) * 1.207e-46 ≈ 8 * 9.87 *1.207e-46 → 8 * 11.908e-46 → 95.26e-46 → 9.526e-45 kg m².

So B = (4.39e-67) / (9.526e-45) ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

Hmm. So p_photon = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are anywhere near that. So perhaps the question is considering a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the photon's momentum being the change in the molecule's momentum. But that's not correct because photon's momentum is E/c, regardless of the molecule's momentum change.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the molecule's linear momentum, but that doesn't make sense because the molecule is in a quantum state with certain angular momentum, not linear.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the question is considering the energy required for the transition as being the vibrational energy plus the rotational energy. But that would be even higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, ignoring the rotational part. But that would still give p =8.8e-28 Ns, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the angular frequency given is in terms of the vibrational energy, but the problem is actually about the rotational energy. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the formula for the photon's momentum when the molecule is modeled as a harmonic oscillator, and the energy difference is h w. So p= h w /c.

But with w=4e14, that gives p= (6.626e-34 *4e14) /3e8 → (2.65e-19)/3e8= 8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 Ns. Closest option is A) 1.9e-28, which is about half of that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is the first rotational state, and the next is n=1. No, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So in that case, it's n=0, J=0.

Wait, perhaps the model is the rigid rotor, so the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1).

Then, the energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is 2B.

But if the problem uses the rigid rotor model, then B would be different.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, B = h²/(8 pi² I) as before. So same B.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in a rotational state J=0, and the next state is J=1, requiring energy 2B. Which brings back to the same result as before.

So if that's the case, the photon's momentum is 3e-31 Ns, which is not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond length is given as 2 angstroms, but I should have used 2 * 1e-10 meters correctly.

Wait, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters, correct.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass is calculated incorrectly.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu. Correct.

Hmm. So I'm stuck. The calculations don't match the options. Maybe the problem is based on a different model, like the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator with the energy levels treated as E = (n + J) h w. But that's not the usual model.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is actually about the photon's momentum when the molecule undergoes a transition involving both rotational and vibrational changes. But that's more complicated, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, regardless of rotational state. So the photon's energy is h w.

So p = h w /c.

h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = 2.65e-19 /3e8= 8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 Ns.

But looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is roughly a quarter of that. What's 8.83 / 4 ≈ 2.2. Hmm, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's energy being the vibrational energy plus the rotational energy. So E = h w + 2B.

But that would be 2.65e-19 +9.2e-23 = ~2.65e-19 J. So photon's momentum is same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me think: for a non-rigid rotor, does the rotational energy have a different form?

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model, also known as the rotational-vibrational coupling model, uses the effective bond stiffness. But in that case, the rotational energy isn't treated as a rigid rotor. Hmm, perhaps the rotational energy is treated with a different formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the bond length isn't fixed, so the moment of inertia I is a function of the vibrational state. But that complicates things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the selection rule ΔJ = ±1 but for a transition from J=0 to J=1, which requires a photon with energy 2B.

But I'm stuck. Let me think about the given options. The options are all around 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns. So perhaps I did a miscalculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute B again.

Compute μ again: (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m, so I=μ R^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Compute B: h²/(8 pi² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * pi^2 * 1.207e-46).

Calculate numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.389e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 * pi^2 is approx 78.9568. Multiply by I: 78.9568 * 1.207e-46 = 95.3e-46 = 9.53e-45.

So B = 4.389e-67 /9.53e-45 ≈ 4.599e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.198e-23 J.

p_photon = 9.198e-23 /3e8 = 3.066e-31 kg m/s → 3.066e-31 Ns.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units of bond length. Oh no! 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters, which is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum as hbar * omega / c. Let me compute that.

hbar is h/(2 pi) = 6.626e-34 /6.283 ≈ 1.055e-34 J s.

So E_photon = hbar * omega = 1.055e-34 *4e14 = 4.22e-20 J.

p = E /c =4.22e-20 /3e8 =1.407e-28 kg m/s →1.407e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28. So that's close.

Wait, so if the energy is hbar * w, that would be the case if the question is using the angular frequency in a different context. But why would that be? Because photon's energy is E = h f, where f is frequency. And angular frequency w =2 pi f. So, E = h f = h w/(2 pi) = ħ w.

So perhaps the question is expressing the energy as ħ w, which would be correct. So the energy is ħ w = (6.626e-34 / 2 pi) *4e14 = approx 4.22e-20 J.

Then, momentum p = E/c =4.22e-20 /3e8 =1.4e-28 kg m/s → 1.4e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D.

But why would the question use ħ w and not h w? Because the problem gives the angular frequency w, so perhaps the energy transition is related to w, and not the frequency f.

Wait, in the problem statement, the angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So, E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w.

So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w. So the photon's energy is h w.

But in terms of hbar, h w = 2 pi ħ w.

So, E_photon = h w =2 pi ħ w.

So, for n=0 to n=1, E_photon = h w.

Which would give p_photon = (h w)/(c) = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/(3e8) = (2.65e-19)/(3e8) =8.83e-28 Ns.

But there's no option for that.

Wait, but if the problem is considering a transition that also involves rotational energy, perhaps the energy is E = h w + 2B. But that would make the energy much higher, and the photon's momentum larger, which doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is the rotational energy, which is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J. So p=3.07e-31 Ns. Not matching options.

Wait, but earlier calculation using ħ w gave p=1.4e-28 Ns, which matches option D.

So perhaps the problem is considering the transition as a vibrational one, using E= ħ w, which is (hbar) * w.

But why would that be? Because for a photon, E = ħ w. So perhaps the transition is E_photon = ħ w.

So in that case, p = ħ w /c.

So let's compute that:

hbar = 1.055e-34 J s.

w =4e14 rad/s.

E_photon = 1.055e-34 *4e14 =4.22e-20 J.

p =4.22e-20 /3e8 =1.407e-28 kg m/s →1.407e-28 Ns.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

But why would the photon's energy be ħ w? Because for photons, energy is E= h f = ħ w. So yes. So the photon's energy is ħ w.

But in the molecule's transition, the energy required is h w. Oh, because the vibrational energy levels are E = (n + 1/2) h w.

So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w. So the photon's energy must be h w.

But wait, how does that relate to the photon's energy formula?

Ah, I see. The photon's energy is h f = ħ w.

But the transition energy is h w/(2 pi) = ħ w. So that would be the same as the photon's energy. Wait, no.

Wait, no. If the molecule requires energy h w, and the photon's energy is E_photon = ħ w, then:

h w = ħ w * (2 pi) → because ħ = h/(2 pi).

So h w = (h/(2 pi)) * w * 2 pi → h w. So yes, it's the same.

Wait, no, because if the transition requires energy h w, and the photon's energy is E_photon = ħ w, then:

h w = ħ w → h = ħ → which can't be correct because ħ = h/(2 pi).

So I'm getting confused.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are E = (n + 1/2) h w.

The energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w. So the photon must provide this energy. Photon's energy is E_photon = h f = ħ w.

So to achieve E_photon = h w, we have:

h w = ħ w → h= ħ → which is only possible if 2 pi =1, which is not the case.

So something's wrong with this approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use E_photon = h w, which is 6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

Then p =2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

But that's not an option.

Wait, but earlier when I did the calculation with ħ w, I got 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D. But why would that be the case?

Because the question gives w as the angular frequency, perhaps the energy is E = ħ w, which is the photon's energy. But the transition requires h w.

So h w = ħ w * 2 pi → E_photon = ħ w = h w/(2 pi).

So if the molecule requires h w, then the photon's energy should be h w, but the photon's energy is ħ w. So to have E_photon = h w, we need to have ħ w = h w → which isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition as a change in the vibrational state, and the photon's energy is ħ w. So E_photon = ħ w = 1.055e-34 *4e14=4.22e-20 J.

So p =4.22e-20 /3e8=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why would the transition require ħ w instead of h w?

Maybe I'm getting confused between the terms. Let me think: the energy of a photon is E = h f = ħ w. The energy required for the transition is the energy difference between two states.

If the transition is to the first vibrational level (n=1 from n=0), the energy difference is h w.

So the photon must have energy h w. But photon's energy is ħ w. So for the photon's energy to be h w, we have ħ w = h w → ħ = h, which is impossible. So there's a mistake in this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition as a change in the vibrational energy, which is (n=0 to n=1) requiring energy h w. So the photon's energy is h w, which is E_photon = h w. Then, the photon's momentum is E_photon / c = (h w)/c = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/(3e8) = (2.65e-19)/(3e8) =8.83e-28 Ns.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is not about the vibrational transition but the rotational.

Wait, let me think again about the rotational transition. Suppose the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest energy is (n=0, J=1), requiring a photon with energy 2B.

So E_photon =2B=9.2e-23 J. Then, p_photon=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns.

But no option matches. So perhaps the problem is using a different model where the energy required is hbar * w.

But I'm stuck. The only option close to my calculation when using ħ w is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1 in the rigid rotor model, but using the vibrational frequency as the rotational frequency. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the photon's momentum is given by the change in the angular momentum of the molecule. But that's not how photon momentum works. Photon's momentum is p = E/c, regardless of the direction.

I think I'm stuck, but the only option that comes close to any calculation I did is option D, which is 1.4e-28 Ns. So perhaps the correct answer is D.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, with the molecule initially in its fundamental state. The goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The key steps and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Understanding the Fundamental State**: The fundamental state corresponds to the lowest energy state, which is the vibrational ground state \( n = 0 \) and the rotational ground state \( J = 0 \).

2. **Energy Levels**: The total energy of the molecule is the sum of vibrational and rotational energies:
   \[
   E = E_{\text{vib}} + E_{\text{rot}}
   \]
   - Vibrational energy: \( E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega \)
   - Rotational energy: \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \) is the rotational constant, and \( I = \mu R^2 \) is the moment of inertia.

3. **Next State with the Lowest Energy**: The next state with the lowest energy could either involve a transition to \( n = 0, J = 1 \) (rotational excitation) or \( n = 1, J = 0 \) (vibrational excitation). The energy difference for rotational excitation is \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \), while for vibrational excitation, it is \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega \). Since \( B \ll h \omega \), the rotational transition requires less energy.

4. **Photon Momentum**: The photon's energy must match the energy difference of the transition. For the rotational transition:
   \[
   E_{\text{photon}} = 2B
   \]
   where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \). The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:
   \[
   p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c}
   \]

5. **Calculations**:
   - **Reduced Mass**: \( \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} \). Converting to kilograms: \( \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).
   - **Moment of Inertia**: \( I = \mu R^2 = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \).
   - **Rotational Constant**: \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).
   - **Energy Difference**: \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).
   - **Photon Momentum**: \( p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \).

6. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated momentum \( p \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \) is far smaller than the given options. Revisiting the problem, if the transition is interpreted as a vibrational excitation with \( E_{\text{photon}} = \hbar \omega \), where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2 \pi} \), then:
   \[
   E_{\text{photon}} = \hbar \omega = \frac{h}{2 \pi} \cdot \omega = 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}
   \]
   This matches option D.

7. **Conclusion**: The problem likely assumes the photon's energy corresponds to \( \hbar \omega \), leading to a momentum of \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \), which aligns with option D.
