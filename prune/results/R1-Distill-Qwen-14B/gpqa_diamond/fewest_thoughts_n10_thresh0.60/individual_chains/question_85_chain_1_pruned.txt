Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says we have two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Both planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii, while Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

The RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The problem gives the shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 up to 0.04 Å. Oh wait, but in terms of velocity, I think the RV shift relates to the mass and the velocity of the planet, but maybe I don't need that for the temperature ratio. 

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. So equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh, the albedos are the same, so that cancels out. 

Equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) / ( (L_star / (4πσ)) )^(1/4) Wait, maybe a better approach: The equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * ( (L_star) / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is T_eq = [ (L * (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, a is the planet's orbital distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, I can express the luminosity of the star in terms of
