Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to picture it. So, the setup is a spherical conductor, uncharged, with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is not at the same point as the conductor's center; they're separated by a distance s. Oh wait, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor, right?

Now, they put a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. Oh, and there's an angle theta between l and s. So I think s is the vector pointing from the conductor's center to the cavity's center, and l is the vector from the conductor's center to point P. The angle between them is theta.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges. Like, in electrostatics, the charges on a conductor reside on the surface. But wait, this conductor is initially uncharged. So when we put a charge inside the cavity, what happens?

I think the conductor will redistribute its charges. Since it's uncharged, but now there's a positive charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must develop an induced charge. Oh yeah,
