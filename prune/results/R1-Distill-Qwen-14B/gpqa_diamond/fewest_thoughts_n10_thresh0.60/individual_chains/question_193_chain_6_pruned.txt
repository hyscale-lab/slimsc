Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, right? So plx is 1 over distance, maybe in some units.

Wait, the formula given is number of stars N = 1/(plx)^5. Or is it proportional? Oh, the question says it varies as 1/plx^5, so N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So they want dN/dr, the change in number per unit distance.

Wait, but wait. Parallax is usually given in parsecs, and the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs), right? So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So d = 1/plx.

So substituting that into the equation, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Because plx is 1/d, so plx^5 is (1/d)^5. So 1/(plx^5) becomes d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars is proportional to the distance to the fifth power.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance in terms of per unit range. So d
