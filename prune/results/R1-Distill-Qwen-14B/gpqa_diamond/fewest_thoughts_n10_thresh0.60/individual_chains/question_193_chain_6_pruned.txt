Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the relationship is N = 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r, like r squared, r cubed, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star against the background as observed from Earth. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, plx = 1 / d, where d is distance in parsecs. Oh wait, actually it's d = 1/plx. Right, because as parallax increases, the distance decreases. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Now, the number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N = k / plx^5, where k is some constant. But since plx is related to distance, I need to express this in terms of distance.

Since d = 1/plx, that means plx = 1/d. So substituting that into N's equation: N = k / ( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 divided by that is d^5. So N = k * d^5.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So since plx = 1/d, 1/plx = d. So 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. Therefore, N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, per unit range of distance r. That probably refers to the number of stars per unit volume, or maybe the differential number of stars as a function of distance.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The question is about the number of stars in that region as a function of distance. So maybe it's about the number density as a function of distance. Or perhaps, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr.

Alternatively, maybe it's about how many stars
