Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's try to break it down. Okay, so both planets are orbiting a star, and we're using transit and radial velocity methods to detect them. The star's properties are given: mass 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, effective temperature 6300 K. 

The planets are Planet1 and Planet2. Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think affects how much light they reflect. The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. Oh right, the formula for that depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance, and albedo. The formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, A is the same for both, so the ratio will be based on the other factors.

But wait, the star's luminosity matters, right? The star's luminosity is given by L = 4πR²σT_eff^4. So for the star, L is proportional to R^2 T_eff^4. The star's R is 1.2 times Sun's radius, and T_eff is 6300 K. The Sun's T_eff is about 5778 K, I think. So the star is hotter than the Sun. 

But how does that tie into the planets' equilibrium temperatures? Each planet's equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Because equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). 

Wait, but in the question, I don't have the planets' orbital distances. Hmm, but maybe we can get that from the radial velocity method data? Because the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis, but I'm not sure. The question gives shift in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Wait, but how does that relate to the mass and the Doppler shift?

Oh
