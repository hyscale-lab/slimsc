Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's all about. I remember that these multi-step synthesis problems can be a bit tricky, but I'll try to break them down step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on my adamantane structures, but I recall that adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, like a cage-like structure. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the first and third positions of this adamantane structure.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. I'm thinking elimination reactions here. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's causing an E2 elimination. Since we have two bromine atoms, it's possible that they're undergoing dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but wait, in dibrominated compounds, using a strong base can lead to the formation of alkenes or maybe even dienes via double elimination.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid, and looking at the IR spectrum, there's an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That peak is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester. Also, the NMR spectrum shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That region is often where alcohols or ethers might show up, but more importantly, a carbonyl suggests maybe an epoxide? No, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, 4.79 ppm, that's around where an epoxide's protons might be. Because epoxide protons typically are around 3.5-4.5 ppm. Wait, but 4.79 is a bit upfield for that. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. Or perhaps something else.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is more likely a ketone. So perhaps the product is an diketone? Or maybe a cyclohexenone derivative? Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base, and heating would likely lead to elimination reactions. Since the bromines are on adjacent carbons (well, 1 and 3 on the adamantane, which I think are not adjacent but maybe in a way that allows elimination?), perhaps two E2 reactions happen, removing two Br atoms and forming a double bond. But wait, if two Br's are eliminated, perhaps it's forming an allene or a diene? Or maybe forming a bridge. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination leading to a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation, but if two Brs are present, maybe it's a double elimination. Alternatively, could it be a neighboring group elimination? Hmm. Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing an elimination to form a ketone via a double dehydrohalogenation. Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's a case where two bromides are on adjacent carbons, so removing both would form a double bond and maybe form a carbonyl group? Or maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, so elimination would form a ketone somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of two E2 elim
