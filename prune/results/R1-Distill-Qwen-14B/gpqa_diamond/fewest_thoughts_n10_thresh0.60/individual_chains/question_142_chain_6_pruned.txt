Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm still a bit fuzzy on some of these concepts, but let me try to work through it.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used in quantum mechanics to describe the state of a system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical ensemble. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), but mixed states are combinations of these.

Wait, so ρ here is (|0><0| + |1><1|) divided by 2. That seems like a diagonal matrix because the off-diagonal terms are zero. So in matrix form, each diagonal element would be 1/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ [1/2 0]
  [0 1/2] ]

Right, that's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal entries being 1/2. So each basis state (|0> and |1>) contributes an equal amount to the density matrix.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what this means. I think qubit space is often visualized using the Bloch sphere, which is a way to represent qubit states. But wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states. How does this apply to mixed states?

Oh right, for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The density matrix can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (like a radius vector in 3D space) and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So if I can express the given ρ in that form, the vector r would give me the geometrical position.

Let's compute. The given ρ is:

ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.

But |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ becomes (I)/2.

So ρ = I/2.

Now, using the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's set that equal to I/2.

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ.

Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ.

So that implies r·σ = 0. The Pauli matrices σ are the x, y, z matrices. So r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

If r·σ is zero, each component must be zero? Or maybe the sum equals zero. Wait, but each of these matrices is different.

Wait, let me think. The equation r·σ = 0 would mean that for each Pauli matrix, the coefficient is zero. Because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent.
