Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break down each step and see what's happening.

First, the compound is heated with KOH in excess at 240°C. The product, 1, is a light yellow solid. The NMR and IR data are given. So, what kind of reaction is this? Well, heating a dibrominated compound with KOH usually suggests an elimination reaction, likely dehydrohalogenation. But wait, since it's a dihalide, maybe it's a double elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility is that it's undergoing elimination to form an alkene because the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That peak is typically a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. Oh, but wait, elimination would form an alkene (which would show a peak around 1600-1650 cm⁻¹ for C=C), but 1720 is more like a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: when you have a dihalide and you treat it with a strong base like KOH, sometimes you can get a substitution, but more likely, especially with vicinal dihalides, elimination. Wait, but in the product, there's a carbonyl group. Oh, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to an alkene, but then maybe a further reaction? Or maybe it's a different process.

Wait, another thought: if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene via elimination. But wait, the product's IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So, maybe the product is a ketone. Hmm. How can that happen?

Wait, wait! Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of rearrangement. Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but that would produce an ether, which wouldn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the base is removing two protons, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, but that might be more of a pinacol-like elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a demetallation or something else, but I'm not certain. Let's think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings fused in a particular way. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3. When treated with KOH, perhaps each bromide leaves, but wait, in a double elimination, you would form a double bond. But if it's a vicinal dihalide (adjacent bromines) elimination, you would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but in adamantane, the positions are 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So that's a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Let me think: if you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, then eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond. But in this case, the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, which are not adjacent. So elimination might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe each bromide leaves, and the structure rearranges. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl, so maybe the product is a diketone? But that seems unlikely because the starting material is a dihalide. Alternatively, perhaps each bromide is replaced by something else. Wait, another possibility is that the base (KOH) acts as a nucleophile, but given the structure, substitution might not be feasible because adamantane is a rigid structure, and perhaps the leaving groups are not in positions that allow for easy substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fittig reaction, but that usually involves coupling of two aryl halides, which doesn't seem to fit here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone because each Br is replaced by an OH group, which then dehydrates to form a ketone. But that would require each Br to be replaced by OH, which would form a diol. Then, with heat, the diol could lose water to form a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure if that's feasible in this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane? But I don't see how that connects to the IR data.

Wait, what's the NMR data? Let's look at that.

The 1H NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

So, 4.79 ppm is a doublet of two protons. That might be an -OH group, but wait, the chemical shift is around 4.8, which is more like an -OCH2- group, or maybe an -OCH2CH2O- structure. Alternatively, it could be a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. For example, an ether or an ester group.

The 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 connected to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is a multiplet, possibly from CH2 groups in a cyclohexane-like structure, maybe. The 1.94 (2H) might be a CH2 group that's more deshielded, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen.

Wait, putting this together, maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide. No, the IR would then show the epoxide's C-O-C stretching, which is around 1200-1300 cm⁻¹. The IR here is 1720, which is a carbonyl.

So, let me think again. If the reaction is elimination of HBr twice and formation of a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone. But how? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a four-fused cyclohexane structure. When you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are on opposite ends perhaps. When you eliminate two HBr molecules, you could form a bridge, leading to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. Let me imagine: when two adjacent H's are abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. But since the starting material has bromines on positions 1 and 3, perhaps elimination leads to a bridge formation, creating a new ring with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Wait, no, the IR for epoxide is lower frequency.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reaction. KOH is a strong base. 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. Maybe it undergoes two dehydrohalogenation steps to form an cyclopropane ring? No, that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, leading to the formation of a gem-diol, which then loses water to form a carbonyl. So, each Br is replaced by OH, then the two OH groups lose water to form a ketone. But wait, that would require each Br to be replaced by OH, giving a diol, which then dehydrates. But would that happen under these conditions?

So, the product would be a ketone. Let's imagine that. Then, the NMR would have a CH2 group attached to O, perhaps as an ether or an ester. Wait, but the 4.79 ppm is 2H, maybe an OCH2O group, like in an epoxide, but earlier I thought that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alcohol, but the shift is more upfield than an alcohol typically is. Or maybe it's an ether.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a vicinal diol, but that doesn't explain the IR peak. Wait, but if it's a diol, the IR would have O-H stretches around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned, but the problem states that the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but I don't see how that leads to a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to a carbanion, which then eliminates Br⁻, but that's a single elimination. Hmm.

I think I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to look for another approach. Suppose that product 1 is an epoxide. Then, in the next step, when heated with aluminum isopropoxide, it would undergo ring-opening. But the IR of product 1 doesn't support that, as epoxide IR is different. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, which when treated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OR)3) would undergo some kind of enolate formation or alkylation. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone. Because when you eliminate two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, you could form a ketone. That would fit the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is typical for a ketone. So, the product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone.

Let me think about the NMR of 1,3-adamantanone. The structure would have a ketone group, and the adamantane skeleton. The protons near the carbonyl would be deshielded. But how does this fit the NMR data?

The NMR has a peak at 4.79 (2H), which is a singlet? Or a triplet? The integration is 2H. So, perhaps this is a methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl, but in adamantane, all the protons are typically in specific environments. Wait, but 1,3-adamantanone would have a ketone at position 1, and the rest of the structure would be similar to adamantane. So, the protons near the ketone would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is due to a hydroxyl group, but that would be a broad peak, not a sharp one. But the problem states "with a characteristic absorbance in the IR spectrum at 1720 cm-1", which is a strong peak for a carbonyl. So, product 1 is likely a ketone.

Now, looking at the NMR again: 4.79 (2H), which is a singlet perhaps? But wait, the integration is 2H, so maybe a CH2 group attached to something. The other signals are at 2.41-2.23 (10H) and 1.94 (2H). So, perhaps the 2H at 4.79 is a CH2 next to the carbonyl, and the other signals are from the adamantane structure.

Wait, but I might be getting ahead of myself. Let's proceed.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Hmm. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen rearrangement or some other pericyclic reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's undergoing a ring-opening or some kind of enolization.

Wait, another possibility: when a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, it can form an enol ether if there's an α-hydrogen. But if product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, which has α-hydrogens (since adamantane has CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl), then perhaps the ketone undergoes enolization, forming an enol or an enol ether.

Wait, the reaction is heating with Al(OiPr)3. So, perhaps the ketone is undergoing some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement. For example, the Claisen rearrangement involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds upon treatment with acid. But I'm not sure if 1,3-adamantanone would form such a structure upon treatment with a Lewis acid.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone is undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction, but I don't see a diene here. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's forming a cyclic ketone or undergoing some kind of aldol addition. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: let's think about product 3. Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 2 is a diene or an enone.

So, back to product 2: it's formed by heating product 1 (the ketone) with Al(OiPr)3. So, perhaps product 1 undergoes a dehydration reaction, forming a conjugated dienone or something with a double bond.

Wait, but how? If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing a conjugate addition or elimination to form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's forming an enol, which then dimerizes or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is not a ketone but something else. Let me think again. If the product 1 is an epoxide, then treating with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3 would protonate the epoxide, making it more electrophilic. Then, perhaps it would undergo ring-opening under those conditions. But product 1's IR doesn't indicate an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ether, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, stepping back, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Let me think: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's a double substitution, forming a diol (1,3-adamantanediol). Then, the diol would have two OH groups. But the IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which doesn't fit a diol. Unless the diol dehydrates to form a ketone. That would make sense.

So, if product 1 is a diol that dehydrates to form a ketone, perhaps it's 1,3-adamantanone. Then, the NMR would have a peak at around 4.79 ppm for the ketone's adjacent CH2 groups. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the NMR of 1,3-adamantanone. The structure would have the ketone at position 1, and the adjacent carbons would have CH2 groups. So, the protons adjacent to the ketone (positions 2 and 8, perhaps) would be deshielded and might appear around 2.4-2.23 ppm. The protons further away, like in the rings, would be around 1.94 ppm. But then, where does the 4.79 ppm come from?

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe product 1 is a diketone. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane seems unlikely to form a diketone upon elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mono-ketone and another group.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck on product 1. Let me try to proceed and maybe the later steps will help clarify.

Product 2 is then ozonolyzed to form product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond. So, when product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3, it forms product 2, which has a double bond.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enone (a conjugated enol). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, product 1 could be an epoxide, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 might rearrange to form a diene. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 forms a diene via elimination.

Wait, another angle: ozonolysis of product 2 yields product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. What's the NMR of product 3?

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

The most deshielded proton would be the one in the most electron-deficient environment, probably adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, maybe it's a CH2 group next to a ketone or another electron-withdrawing group.

In the NMR, this proton would couple with neighboring protons. Let's think about a possible structure. If product 3 is a diketone or has two carbonyl groups, the protons adjacent to them would be deshielded.

Wait, but let me think about what product 3 could be. Suppose product 2 is a diene, perhaps 1,3-butadiene or a more complex structure. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups, perhaps ketones or aldehydes, depending on the structure.

But the question says that after ozonolysis and workup with DMS (which is a reductive workup, I think), product 3 is formed. Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup typically yields aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substituents.

Wait, but wait, ozonolysis at -78°C is typically done under controlled conditions to prevent further reactions. So, in the presence of DMS, which is a mild reductant, the ozonides are cleaved to form carbonyl compounds.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. So, the structure of product 3 would depend on product 2's structure.

Let me try to outline:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (heated with KOH) → product 2 (heated with Al(OiPr)3) → product 3 (ozonolysis and DMS).

Assuming product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, then product 2 is formed by treating the ketone with Al(OiPr)3. Perhaps it's undergoing a conjugate addition or elimination. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is undergoing some kind of enolate formation, leading to a diene.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, heating with Al(OiPr)3 might cause it to undergo a dehydration, forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone). That would explain the formation of a double bond in product 2.

So, product 2 would be an enone, like 1,3-adamantano-alpha,beta-dienone or something similar. Then, ozonolysis of this enone would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But wait, enones have one double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave that into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have two ketone groups.

Now, looking at the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say each carbonyl is at the end of a chain. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be CH2 groups, perhaps.

Each of these CH2 groups would have protons that couple with neighboring groups. For instance, if each CH2 is next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets or something similar.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. Suppose product 3 is a diketone, like O=C-(CH2)n-C=O. The CH2 groups between the carbonyls would have their protons.

If n=2, for example, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. The protons on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So, each proton would couple with two neighboring protons on each adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but for each CH2 group, each H would have two neighboring Hs on each adjacent CH2. So, the central CH2 would have each H coupling with two on the left and two on the right. That would lead to a triplet of triplets, perhaps.

Alternatively, each H would couple with two on each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another approach: the coupling pattern is determined by the number of neighboring protons. For a CH2 group adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each H would have two neighboring Hs on each side. So, each H would be split by two neighboring Hs on each adjacent group.

Wait, but each H in the central CH2 would be next to two Hs on the left and two on the right. Wait, but each H is only coupling with adjacent Hs. So, in a structure like CH2-CH2-CH2, the middle CH2 would have each H adjacent to two Hs on each side. But that's not correct because each H is on the same CH2. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a four-membered ring where each CH2 is adjacent to two others. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diketone with two CH2 groups attached to each carbonyl. For example:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O.

In this case, each of the CH2 groups would have neighboring Hs. The end CH2 groups (adjacent to the carbonyl) would each have two Hs, and each would be next to another CH2 group.

So, for the end CH2 group, each proton would be adjacent to two protons on the adjacent CH2. That would cause a triplet coupling, as each H would have two neighboring Hs.

Wait, but wait: each H on the end CH2 is next to two Hs on the middle CH2. So, the splitting would be a triplet.

But what about the middle CH2 groups? Each H in the middle is flanked by two CH2 groups. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs on each side. So, each H would couple with two Hs on the left and two on the right. That would lead to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in a simple structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, the middle CH2 would have each H next to two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So, each H would be split into a triplet by the left Hs and a triplet by the right Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But what about the end CH2 groups? Each H is next to two Hs on the middle CH2, so each would be a triplet.

So, in product 3's NMR, the most deshielded protons would be the ones adjacent to the carbonyl groups, which would be the end CH2 groups. These would appear as triplets. But the question is about the most deshielded H. The end Hs are adjacent to the carbonyl, which is more deshielded than the middle Hs.

So, the end CH2 would have triplet coupling. But wait, looking at the options, option A is a triplet.

Wait, but let me think again. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the end CH2 groups would have protons that are next to a CH2 group. Each H on the end CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the middle CH2. So, each of these end Hs would split into a triplet.

The middle CH2 would have each H adjacent to two Hs on each side. So, each H would be split into a triplet from the left and a triplet from the right, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be the end CH2 groups. So their coupling would be triplet.

But then why is the question asking about the most deshielded H? Perhaps the end CH2 groups are the most deshielded, so their coupling would be triplet.

So, looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, another possibility is that the structure isn't a four-carbon chain but something else. Let me think again.

Alternatively, suppose product 3 is two ketone groups with a single CH2 group between them, like O=C-CH2-C=O. Then, the CH2 group would have each H adjacent to two protons on each side (from the two carbonyl groups). Wait, but each H would only have two neighboring Hs (from the same CH2 group), but wait, in a CH2 group, each H is next to one H on the same group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. In a CH2 group, each H is next to one other H on the same group. So, if a CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, each H would be a triplet because each is next to two Hs (from the same CH2 group and from adjacent groups? No, wait, each H in a CH2 is adjacent to one H in the same group. So, for a CH2 between two carbonyls, each H would be adjacent to one H in the same group and perhaps some others.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the splitting. For a CH2 group where each H is adjacent to two Hs on one side and two on the other, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as a conjugated diene becoming two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is a diene, say 1,3-pentadiene, then ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes: O=CH-CH2-CHO. But that's not possible because ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would give two carbonyls. Wait, for 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes: O=CH-CH2-CHO, but that's not correct. Actually, ozonolysis of 1,3-pentadiene would give two fragments, each with a carbonyl group.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me try to summarize:

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2, which has a double bond. The most deshielded H in product 3's NMR is adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring Hs.

If the H is in a CH2 group next to two other CH2 groups, then each H would have two neighboring Hs on each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets. But if the H is in a CH2 group with only one adjacent group, it would be a triplet.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the H is in a CH group, but that's less likely as CH groups are less common in such structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is in a CH2 group adjacent to two other CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, in the scenario where product 3 is a diketone with a central CH2 group between two carbonyls, the central CH2 would have each H adjacent to two Hs on each side. So, each H would have a triplet of triplets coupling pattern.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be the end CH2 groups. So, their coupling would be triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic diketone, where the Hs are in a ring. But that complicates things further.

Another approach: looking for the answer options. The options are: triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

If the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group that's adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each with two Hs, then each H would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the end Hs would be triplet, but perhaps the middle Hs would be triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the structure as:

O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O

Where R is some group. Then, the CH2 groups in the middle would each have two adjacent CH2 groups, leading to triplet of triplet coupling.

Alternatively, if the structure is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups opposite each other, the Hs adjacent to the ketones would be deshielded and have specific coupling.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the possible product structures.

If product 2 is an enone (conjugated dienone), then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have two ketone groups.

Assuming product 2 is an enone, the ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, product 3 might be a diketone.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Let's assume these are CH2 groups.

Each CH2 group next to a carbonyl would have neighboring Hs. If each CH2 is next to another CH2 group on the other side, the Hs would have coupling from both sides.

So, each H in the CH2 group would have two neighboring Hs on each adjacent group. So, each H would split into a triplet from the left and another triplet from the right, leading to a triplet of triplets.

That would make the coupling pattern a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled to two Hs on one side and two on the other. For example, each H has two adjacent Hs on the left and two on the right. Wait, but each H is only coupled to neighboring Hs. So, if a H is on a CH2 group and next to two CH2 groups (each with two Hs), then the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

So, the most deshielded H would be part of such a CH2 group, and its coupling would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to only one other CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the molecule. Suppose product 3 is a four-carbon diketone: O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O.

Each CH2 group would be adjacent to two others. For the end CH2 groups, each H is adjacent to two Hs on the middle CH2 group. So, each H would split into a triplet. For the middle CH2 group, each H is adjacent to two Hs on both sides, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the end Hs (most deshielded) would be triplet, and the middle Hs would be triplet of triplets.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be the end ones. So, their coupling would be triplet, which is option A.

But wait, earlier reasoning suggested that the middle Hs are more shielded than the end ones. No, the end Hs are closer to the carbonyl groups, so they are more deshielded.

So, the end Hs would be triplet, but the middle Hs would be triplet of triplets.

So, the correct answer would be triplet, which is option A.

But I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Another thought: if the structure is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups opposite each other, then the CH2 groups between them would each have two adjacent CH2 groups, leading to each H being coupled to two on each side, hence a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 group is between two carbonyls, leading to each H in the CH2 group being adjacent to two Hs on each side, hence a triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with two ketone groups across from each other, and each has a CH2 group in between. Then, each CH2 group would have two adjacent CH2 groups, leading to each H being a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is a triplet of triplets, option B. Because each H in the CH2 group is adjacent to two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet from each side, hence a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is a triplet because each H is only adjacent to two Hs on one side.

But I'm not entirely confident. Given the options, and considering that the H is in a CH2 group adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each with two Hs, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, no. Wait, each H is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 group (so that's a triplet), and if adjacent to another CH2 group, perhaps that adds another splitting. But wait, the splitting is only from neighboring Hs. So, if a H is on a CH2 group between two other CH2 groups, it would have two Hs on one side and two on the other. But each H is coupled with all neighboring Hs, regardless of their position.

Wait, for a structure like CH2-CH2-CH2, the middle CH2 would have each H adjacent to two Hs on the left and two on the right. So, each H would split into a triplet from the left and another triplet from the right, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

So, if the most deshielded H is in the middle CH2, then the coupling is triplet of triplets. But if it's on the end CH2, the coupling is a triplet.

But the most deshielded H would be on the end, adjacent to the carbonyl group. So their coupling would be a triplet.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is option A, triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to a final product (product 3) whose most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern is to be determined. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a double elimination of HBr, forming 1,3-adamantanone. This is supported by the IR spectrum showing a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a ketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) aligns with the structure of 1,3-adamantanone, where the 4.79 ppm peak corresponds to the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl group.

2. **Reaction 2: 1,3-adamantanone + Al(OiPr)₃**  
   Treatment of 1,3-adamantanone with aluminum isopropoxide likely leads to the formation of an enone (α,β-unsaturated ketone). This involves the removal of a proton α to the carbonyl group, forming a double bond between the carbonyl carbon and an adjacent carbon. The resulting product (product 2) is an enone.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   Ozonolysis of the enone cleaves the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups. The resulting product (product 3) is a diketone, likely with the structure O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. The most deshielded hydrogens in product 3 are the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

4. **Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Hydrogen**  
   The most deshielded hydrogens are in the CH₂ groups directly adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Each hydrogen in these CH₂ groups is coupled to two hydrogens on the same CH₂ group (resulting in a triplet) and two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group (also resulting in a triplet). The combination of these couplings leads to a **triplet of triplets** for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.
