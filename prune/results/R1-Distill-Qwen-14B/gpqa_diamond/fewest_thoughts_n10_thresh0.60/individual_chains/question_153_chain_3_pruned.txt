Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. It's a conjugate addition, right? So the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, which is conjugated to the carbonyl group.

The question has three separate reactions, and I need to figure out the major products for each. Let's take them one by one.

First, reaction (A): dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. What's the setup here? Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, I think. It's a dienolate, actually. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor here.

So, the Michael reaction typically involves a conjugate addition. The nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) would attack the beta position of the acrylate. The acrylate has a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. When the addition happens, the malonate part would add to the double bond.

Wait, but the structure of the acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, the (E) configuration means the substituents on either end are opposite. So the p-tolyl group is on the beta carbon, which is the CH2 group. Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is CH2-C(=O)-OCH3, but with a substituent on the double bond. Oh wait, the correct structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group being on the beta carbon. Wait, no. The actual structure is maybe more like CH2-CH-p-tolyl, but connected to the acrylate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw it out in my mind. The acrylate is E-configuration. So the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is CH2
