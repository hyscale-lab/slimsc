Okay, so I need to figure out the products of these Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think about each part step by step.

Starting with the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH. Sodium ethoxide is a base, so it probably deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. The enolate acts as a nucleophile.

Wait, dimethyl malonate has two ester groups. Its structure is like CH2(CO2Me)2. The enolate would form at the beta position, which is the central carbon. Then, the enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group attached. So, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the substituents are E configuration.

When the enolate attacks, it'll add to the beta carbon (the one further from the carbonyl). So the malonate's enolate (nucleophile) attacks the acrylate's beta position. Let me draw this out. The acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached. Wait, no, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with a substituent on the middle carbon. Wait, no, correct structure: methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Oh, wait, no, the IUPAC name for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with substituents on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH
