Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me read it again carefully. The question is asking about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just add them like in classical mechanics. Because of the speed limit, right? So, I think there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh yeah, the formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²). Let me write that down. So for the relative speed, I need to calculate the velocity of one astronaut from the other's frame.

So, astronaut 1 has velocity u = 0.6c, astronaut 2 has v = 0.5c. Which one is moving faster? Well, from the perspective of astronaut 2, astronaut 1 is moving at u' = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute the denominator first: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 -0.3=0.7. The numerator is 0.1c. So u' = (0.1c)/(0.7) = approx 0.1428c. So that's about 0.14c when rounded. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel of 0.14c.

Now, for the total energy of the system. I think each astronaut's total energy is their relativistic energy, so E = gamma * m c². So I'll calculate each and sum them.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, v=0.6c):
gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is gamma multiplied by the rest mass
