Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stereoisomers can get tricky. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The compound is 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol. Hmm, the name is a bit long, but let me break it down. Undeca means 11 carbons, so it's an 11-carbon chain. The substituents are on carbons 2, 6, 9, and the alcohol is on carbon 5. Also, there are double bonds at positions 3 and 7, so the structure should have two double bonds.

Wait, but where exactly are the double bonds? Let me think, undeca-3,7-dien means double bonds between 3-4 and 7-8. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2Cl-CH2OH? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me count.

Wait, the parent chain is undecane (11 carbons), and the double bonds are between 3-4 and 7-8. So, the structure would be:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11
CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CHOH-
