Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their masses are negligible. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places, and choose the right option from the given choices.

Hmm. Okay, so the setup is that 12 charges are each 2m away from point P, and the 13th is at P. All charges are 2e. Since the system is isolated, I think we're dealing with electrostatic potential energy because the charges are fixed in position.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So what's the formula for the electrostatic potential energy of a system of charges? Oh right, the potential energy U between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But since we have multiple charges, I think we have to calculate the potential energy for each pair and sum them all up.

Wait, but calculating each pair would be time-consuming, especially with 13 charges. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think. Since the charges are identical and we have symmetry, perhaps the potential energy can be broken down into contributions from the fixed charge at P and the others, plus the interactions between the moving charges.

Wait no, the twelve charges are at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is stationary and the others are 2m away from P. So the 13th is at P, and each of the 12 others is 2m away. But those 12 are identical and presumably placed symmetrically around P. But for potential energy, the interactions are between each pair.

So the total potential energy U of the system would be the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges. So for each pair of charges, I calculate U and sum all of them.

But wait, all the charges are identical, so each pair contributes the same amount? Let's see: the 1
