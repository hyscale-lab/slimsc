Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. So the question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D with different resolutions.

Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime affects how far they travel before decaying. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But when the particle is moving, we have to consider time dilation due to special relativity. So the moving particle's lifetime, τ, is longer than τ₀ by a factor of gamma (γ), the Lorentz factor.

The Lorentz factor γ is given by γ = E/mc². Wait, because E is the total energy of the particle. So since E is given as 27 GeV and the mass m is 3.41 GeV, I can compute γ as E/(m c²). But since E is already in units that probably include c², maybe I don't have to worry about the exact factors. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by about 3.4. 3.4 times 7 is 23.8, 3.4 times 7.9 is about 27. So approximately 7.935, maybe around 7.935 is gamma.

So the lifetime τ in the lab frame is γτ₀. So τ = γ * τ₀. Let me compute that: 7.935 * 8e-16 s. Let me do that multiplication. 8 * 8 is 64, but wait, 7.935 *8 is approximately 63.48. So 63.48e-16 s. So τ is about 6.348e-15 seconds.

Wait, wait, no, wait. 8e-16 times 7.935 is 63.48e-16, which is 6.348e-15 seconds. Right.

Now, the particle's speed is probably relativistic, so v is approximately c. So the distance it travels before decaying is L = v * τ. Since v ≈ c, L ≈ c * τ.

So c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.348e-15 s. Let me compute that: 3e8 * 6.348e-15 = (3 *6.348) * 1e8 *1e-15 = 19.044 * 1e-7 meters. That's 1.9044e-6 meters.

Wait, but that's the average distance the particle travels
