Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere, we often use the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Oh right, LTE means that the gas is in equilibrium, so the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So, I think the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me recall the Boltzmann equation. The population ratio N_upper/N_lower is equal to (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Since the question is about the ratio of excitation, I assume that the energy levels have the same degeneracy, so the ratio g_upper/g_lower is 1. So the ratio reduces to exp( - ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.

Wait, but wait. The excitation is twice as much in star_1. So if the ratio for star_1 is N1 and for star_2 is N2, then N1/N2 = 2. Because star_1's atoms are twice as excited, meaning more in the higher energy level. So, the ratio for star_1 is N1 = 2 * N2.

So the equation for star_1: N1/N2 = exp( - ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2: N2/N1' (wait, perhaps I should think differently. Wait, no. Let me clarify. Let me define N1 as the population in the higher level for star_1, and N2 as the same for star_2. The question says N1/N2 = 2, because star_1's are twice as excited.

Wait, no, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So N1 = 2 * N2. But the ratio of excited to lower is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star:

For star 1: (N_upper)/(N_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = (N1)/(N_lower1)
For star 2: (N_upper)/(N_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = (N2)/(N_lower2)

But wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the same energy levels in each star. So maybe the ratio of N_upper to N_lower is different for each star. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation potential is the same, and the ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, the problem says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So for both stars, ΔE is the same. Therefore, the ratio of N_upper to N_lower in each star is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where T is the star's temperature.

But the
