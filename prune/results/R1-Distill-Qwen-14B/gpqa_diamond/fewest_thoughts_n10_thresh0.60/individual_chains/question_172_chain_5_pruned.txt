Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember something about the Boltzmann equation and how it relates to the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere. Let's think this through step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can apply the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula I remember is something like n2/n1 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where n is the number of particles in each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the excited state is the higher energy level. Let me denote n1 as the number of atoms in the lower energy level, and n2 as the number in the higher (excited) level. The question says n2 for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, wait. The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So for star_1, the n2 is twice that of star_2's n2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms. Oh, maybe the ratio is between the two stars for the same energy levels.

Wait, let's clarify. The problem states that the excitation is twice as much for star_1 compared to star_2. So, for a specific energy level, the fraction of excited atoms is higher in star_1. So for each star, the ratio of n2 to n1 (excited to ground state) would be different.

So, for star_1, let's say n2_1 / n1_1 = twice that of star_2. Or wait, the question says it's twice as excited, so n2_1 = 2 * n2_2. No, wait, wait. Let me read again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2."

Ah, perhaps
