Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which compound it is based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question gives me the IR and 1H NMR data. I need to match these with one of the four options provided. Let's break down each part.

Starting with the IR spectrum. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches, but since the options all end with COOH, which is a carboxylic acid, the broad peak is likely from the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have strong, broad O-H absorption, so that makes sense.

The other strong peak is at 1700 cm^-1. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Since the compound is a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is part of the -COOH group. So that checks out.

Now, moving on to the NMR. The 1H NMR has several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule doesn't have any double bonds, or if it does, they're not vinylic (like in an alkene or aromatic ring). Looking at the options, all of them are carboxylic acids with branched structures, so no double bonds. So that's consistent.

One of the signals in the NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. I need to figure out what splitting patterns these correspond to.

Let me think about splitting in NMR. Splitting occurs due to neighboring protons. Each neighboring set of protons will split the signal into a number of peaks equal to the number of neighboring H's plus one. So, for example, a triplet comes from two neighboring protons (because n+1 where n=2 â†’ 3 peaks).

But when there are multiple neighboring groups, the splitting becomes more complex, leading to multiplets like doublets of doublets, triplets of triplets, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Structure: The main chain would be something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH. Wait, perhaps it's more like:

Wait, let's write out the structures for each:

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH

Wait, that might be:

- The central part is a C connected to another C, each of which has a CH group substituted with ethyl groups. Wait, perhaps it's more like a geminal diethyl group? Or maybe not. Let me try to draw each structure.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
So the structure is CH2CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. Wait, no, the formula is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So that's like:

CH2CH3 connected to a central carbon (C1), which is connected to another carbon (C2). C1 has a H and a C2H5 group. C2 has a H and a C2H5 group. Then C2 is connected to COOH.

So the structure would be CH2CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH? Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The main chain is longer. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH, which would make the two middle carbons each bearing an ethyl and a hydrogen. So each of those carbons (C1 and C2) are CH groups, each attached to an ethyl.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
So the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So each of the two middle carbons is a CH group attached to a methyl group.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
Structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the middle two carbons each have a CH group with a methyl substituent.

Now, looking for the NMR signals. The question says that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens, which we've already established isn't an issue here.

One peak is a doublet of triplet of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplet of triplets. Let's think about how these splitting patterns arise.

A quartet would suggest
