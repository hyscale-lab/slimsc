Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions in its core. The question is about what happens if the pp-III branch suddenly stops. Wait, I need to think about what the pp-III branch does.

I think the proton-proton chain is the main process in the Sun's core for producing energy. There are different branches. The pp-I branch is the simplest, involving two protons fusing into deuterium. The pp-II branch might involve more steps, maybe with boron or something. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is another part of the chain, perhaps involving higher energy reactions or specific particles.

Wait, in the pp-III branch, I believe it's where a helium-3 nucleus captures a proton to form helium-4, and that emits a positron and a neutrino. Oh right, because the helium-3 has two protons, so when it captures a proton, it becomes helium-4, which has only one neutron and three protons? Or wait, helium-4 is two protons and two neutrons, so maybe the process involves a proton being converted into a neutron, hence the positron and neutrino emission.

So the pp-III branch produces neutrinos. If that suddenly stops, the other reactions like pp-I and pp-II would still continue, right? So the neutrino flux from the Sun would change based on what reactions are contributing.

The question is about the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (
