Okay, so I have this question where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I'll consider the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. Let's compute that: (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3 dobs) plus a double bond and a ring, or a benzene and an amide group, perhaps. Or maybe a benzene, a carbonyl, and a ring? Hmm.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches, maybe from an amide or an amine. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably an ester or amide. Let's think about the options given.

The 1H NMR data: 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) must be a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests coupling with another CH2, so maybe an ethyl group attached to something. Then, at 4.0 ppm, a broad singlet (2H) could be an OCH2 group, maybe an ethoxy group. Wait, but ethoxy is usually around 4.0 as a quartet, but if it's a singlet, perhaps it's part of an amide or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen.

At 4.5 ppm, a quartet (2H) â€“ quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, maybe another CH2. So, perhaps this is an OCH2CH2O group or something else. Wait, no, in an ethyl ester, the CH2 next to O is usually around 4.1 as a quartet, but maybe in other
