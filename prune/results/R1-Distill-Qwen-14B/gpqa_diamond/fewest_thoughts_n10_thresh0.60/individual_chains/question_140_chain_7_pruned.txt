Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again carefully.

The problem says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Another clue: the product of a keto acid with Substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Also, Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reactions with liquids often involve things like metals reacting with acids. Maybe Y is water? Or perhaps another liquid like ammonia or something else. But wait, let me think about the gas W. It's a molecule with the same number of protons and neutrons. That's interesting.

So, same number of protons and neutrons—so the molecule is something like H2O? No, wait. H2O has 8 neutrons in oxygen (since O is 16, which is 8 protons and 8 neutrons). But wait, H2O's molecule is H2O, so each molecule has 2 H's and 1 O. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. The O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the total number of protons would be 2(1) + 8 =10. The total neutrons would be 0(2) +8=8. Wait, that's not same. So that doesn't fit.

Another thought—could the gas be CO2? Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons in its most common isotope (C-12). CO2 has one C and two O atoms. So protons: 6 + 2*8=6+16=22. Neutrons: 6 (for C) + 2*(8 each, since O is 16, so 8 neutrons each) = 6+16=22. Oh! So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons.
