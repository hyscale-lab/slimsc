Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. They react violently and release a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, which is interesting. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 

Another part says that when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Additionally, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So, I'm thinking X is probably a strong base or something reactive.

I remember that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Hmm, maybe it's something with isotopes like chlorine or something else. Wait, sodium hydroxide uses sodium, which doesn't have heavy isotopes commonly. Maybe it's something else.

Let me think about the reaction details. When X reacts with liquid Y (maybe an acid?), it releases a gas W. If W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons, that makes me think of something like NH3 or H2O, but wait, H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Wait, no, another possibility: CO2? No, that's 1 C and 2 O. Wait, another idea: the molecule must have the same number of protons and neutrons. So,
