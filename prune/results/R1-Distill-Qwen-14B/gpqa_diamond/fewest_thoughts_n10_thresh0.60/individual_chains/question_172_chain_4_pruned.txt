Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the photosphere's behavior relates to something called Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Oh right, LTE means that the gas in the photosphere is emitting light based on its temperature, and the atoms' energy levels are determined by that temperature.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the population of that energy level is higher in star_1. I think the population of energy levels in atoms is described by the Boltzmann distribution. Yeah, the Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels.

The formula I'm trying to remember is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since both stars are talking about the same energy levels, I guess the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) are the same for both stars. Or maybe they're comparing the same transition, so the ratio of their excitation would be based on temperature differences.

Wait, but the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, the number of atoms in that higher energy level (let's say level E_i) compared to the lower level (E_j) is higher. If star_1 has twice as many, then the ratio n_i/n_j for star_1 is 2. For star_2, it's 1, I guess. Or wait, maybe star_2 is lower? The way the question is phrased: "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited when compared to star_2." So, n1/n2 = 2. Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Oh, no, the problem says in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So, for star_1, the number in the excited state is higher.

Wait, let me clarify. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So, the energy difference ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Let me call E_i the higher energy level and E_j the lower. So E_i - E_j = ΔE.

In star_1, n_i1 / n_j1 = 2. In star_2, n_i2 / n_j2 is
