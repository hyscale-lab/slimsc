Okay, so I've got this physics problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the two stars based on the given information.

Let me read the problem again. So, star_1 has iron atoms that are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is 1.38e-23 J. And the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the population of states i and j, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. For star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in the higher energy level compared to star_2. Wait, wait. Which level are they in? So, the excitation level refers to the population of a specific energy level. So, let's say the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is given.

Let me denote the two energy levels as E1 and E2, where E2 is higher than E1. So, the excitation energy is ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J.

In star_1, the excited state population is twice that of star_2. Wait, no—the problem says that the excited atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, no, the exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the population of the specific energy level is twice as high in star_1.

So for star_1, let's say n1 is the population of the excited level, and for star_2, n2 is the same level's population. Given that n1 = 2 n2.

But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is n_i/n_j, and the exponent depends on the energy difference and temperature. Let me set E_i as the higher energy level and E_j as the lower. So, for each star, the ratio of n_i to n_j would be exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), but wait, no, because n_j is the lower level. So, the ratio is like n_i/n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But wait, wait, no—actually, the Boltzmann factor is for the probability of a system being in a higher energy state. So, the probability decreases with higher energy. So, for each temperature, the ratio of the population in the higher energy level to the lower is given by exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1, ratio is (n1_j)/(n1_i) = exp( -
