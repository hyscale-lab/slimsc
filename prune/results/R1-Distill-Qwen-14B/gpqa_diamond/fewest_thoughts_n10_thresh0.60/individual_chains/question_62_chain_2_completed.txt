Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane, and I need to choose the correct sequence of reagents from the options given.

Let me start by understanding the target molecule: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Breaking it down, I imagine it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, and then a carbonyl aldehyde group somewhere. Wait, maybe it's more like the cyclohexane has a side chain that includes another cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl, and an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a branch where the main ring has a substituent that is -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, and an aldehyde group attached.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: the main cyclohexane ring has a CH2 group attached, which is connected to both a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. Additionally, that same carbon (the CH2) is also attached to a carbonyl group (the aldehyde). So the structure would be something like cyclohexane with a substituent that is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and that same carbon also has a CHO group. Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2 group that's attached to both a cyclohexyl and an OH group, and that same CH2 is also attached to a carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps the main chain is a cyclohexane with a side chain that has a cyclohexyl, a hydroxymethyl, and an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule is cyclohexane with a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, and that same CH2 group is also attached to an aldehyde. So, the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-OH and cyclohexyl-CH2-CHO. Wait, maybe it's (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl connected to a cyclohexane ring, and also with a formyl (CHO) group attached.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw a rough structure. Let me think: Ethynylcyclohexane is the starting material. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond attached, like CH2-C≡CH). So the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH substituent.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane. There's a substituent at position 1 (assuming the numbering starts where the substituent is). The substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group, which would be CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexyl attached to a central carbon, which is also attached to the main ring. Additionally, that same substituent might have an aldehyde group (CHO). Wait, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2 group that has both a cyclohexyl (as in, connected via a ring) and a hydroxyl group, and the same carbon has an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the synthesis steps. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane with a triple bond attached. Let's think about possible reactions.

One common reaction with terminal alkynes is hydroamination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, adding groups via alkyne reactions. Another approach is to consider that ethynylcyclohexane can undergo various additions, like hydrohalogenation, but more likely, perhaps oxidation or reduction.

Wait, the target molecule has a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group. So perhaps the alkyne is used to form a diketone or something similar, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think about the options. The options are sequences of reagents used in each step. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) might be an alkylating agent. So step 1 could be an alkylation. Then H2/Pd is hydrogenation, perhaps reducing a triple bond to a single bond. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxide opening? H2SO4, HgSO4, and H2O sounds like acid-catalyzed hydration or something else.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/H2O; 4. NH4OH.

NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: maybe alkylation again. Then Li in liq NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or deprotonation. O3 is ozone, used in ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. NH4OH is ammonium hydroxide, maybe for workup.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

So step 1 is alkylation. Step 2 uses H2 with Pd over CaCO3, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Ozone and (CH3)2S sounds like a reductive workup in ozonolysis. Ba(OH)2 again, perhaps elimination.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol — maybe a different kind of alkylation, perhaps forming an ether? Then Li in liquid NH3 is a typical condition for elimination reactions, like the formation of alkenes from alcohols (E2). Ozone again, and then workup.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible steps needed to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target.

Ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. Let's think about possible transformations.

First, perhaps we need to add a methyl group via alkylation. Using NaNH2 (a strong base) with methyl chloride would deprotonate the alkyne (since terminal alkynes are acidic, pKa ~25) and the chloride would act as an electrophile. So the alkyne would get alkylated. So ethynylcyclohexane + CH3Cl in presence of NaNH2 would give (ethyl)methylcyclohexane? Wait, perhaps the alkyne becomes CH2CH2-Cl? Wait, no, I think the alkylation would add a methyl group to the triple bond. Let me think: the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. Treating with a base like NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide (but wait, NaNH2 is a strong base and would deprotonate the alkyne, generating an acetylide). Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react as an alkylating agent, so the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, adding a methyl group. So after step 1, the structure would be CH2-C≡C-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane? Wait, no, wait. Original structure is cyclohexane with CH2-C≡CH. After deprotonation, the acetylide would be CH-CH- (but with negative charge on the terminal carbon). Then methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the acetylide, giving CH2-C≡C-CH3? Wait, but that would make the alkyne longer. So the product after step 1 would be 1-methylpropynylcyclohexane? Or maybe the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, no. Let me correct: starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH). Deprotonation by NaNH2 gives cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- + NH3. Then adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would give cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? Wait, no, because the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, so the alkyne would become CH2-C≡C-CH3, but that's an internal alkyne. So after step 1, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3? Wait, that doesn't seem right because that would make a four-carbon chain. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group to the acetylide, so the ethynyl group becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3, but that's not correct since the starting material is CH2-C≡CH. Adding a methyl via alkylation would make CH2-C≡C-CH2- something? Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is extended by one carbon. Let's think: the starting material is -CH2-C≡CH. After alkylation, it becomes -CH2-C≡C-CH2-Cl? No, because methyl chloride would add a methyl group. So, the alkyne becomes -CH2-C≡C-CH3. So after step 1, the structure would be cyclohexane with a prop-1-ynyl group? Or maybe that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is cyclohexane with a prop-1-ynyl group attached. No, wait, the starting material is ethynyl, which is CH2C≡CH, and adding a methyl would make CH2C≡C-CH2Cl? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should move on and see how the other steps might fit.

After step 1 in option C, the next step is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is hydrogenation. So perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane. So if after step 1, the alkyne is longer, then hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, making a single bond. So if after step 1 we have CH2-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would convert into CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, so a four-carbon chain. But wait, ethynyl is two carbons (CH2-C≡CH), adding a methyl via alkylation would make three carbons, CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then hydrogenation would add H2: the triple bond becomes a single bond, so CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, making a butyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

But wait, that would give a cyclohexane with a butyl group. But the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 which is also attached to an OH and a CHO. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is adding a methyl group to the cyclohexane via alkylation, but I'm not so sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a Grignard-like alkylation. Using NaNH2 as a base, methyl chloride as an alkylating agent. The acetylide would form, then react with methyl chloride to add a methyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane with a propyl group attached via a triple bond? Not sure.

Maybe I should consider that the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and that same carbon is connected to a carbonyl. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol from the alkyne, then oxidizing to a carbonyl?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an epoxide, but I don't think that's likely. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, which is then epoxidised, and then opened to form a diol, which can be oxidized.

Wait, but looking at the target, I think it's more about adding substituents via alkyne chemistry, then oxidizing. Let's think about the overall steps needed.

Let me think about the target molecule again. It's a cyclohexane with a substituent. The substituent is a methyl group that's connected to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group, and also has an aldehyde group. Wait, that's not possible because a carbon can't have more than four bonds. Oh, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl ring and a hydroxyl group, and that same CH2 is also attached to a CHO group. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH2 group, which is connected to a cyclohexyl ring (so it's a bridge?), a hydroxyl group, and a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a quaternary carbon connected to the main ring, a hydroxyl, a cyclohexyl, and a carbonyl group. That seems unlikely because that would require a carbon with four bonds: the main ring, OH, cyclohexyl, and CHO. But carbonyl is a double bond, so that's three bonds. Wait, no, the substituent would be a CH group with three substituents: the main ring (so one bond), the OH group (another bond), the cyclohexyl (third), and a carbonyl (fourth). That's not possible because a carbon can't have four bonds if one is a double bond. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and that same carbon is connected to a formyl (CHO) group, making it a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO, which would require that carbon to have four bonds: the cyclohexane ring (one), OH (two), cyclohexyl (three), and CHO (four). But that's impossible because that would be five bonds total (each bond is between two atoms). Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group, which has a hydroxyl group, a cyclohexyl group, and an aldehyde group. But that would require the CH2 to have four substituents: the main ring (cyclohexane), the OH, the cyclohexyl, and the CHO. But that's four substituents on a CH2, which is impossible. So maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH group attached to the main ring, and that CH has a hydroxyl, a cyclohexyl, and a formyl group. That would make the structure a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO attached to the main cyclohexane. But that would require the central carbon to have four bonds: the main ring (one), OH (two), cyclohexyl (three), and CHO (four). But that's four bonds, which is possible if it's a CH group (with a double bond to O in the aldehyde). Wait, no, the aldehyde is a CHO group, which is a carbonyl, so the carbon has a double bond to O. So the structure would be:

Main cyclohexane ring → C(H)(OH)(cyclohexyl)(CHO)

Wait, but that central carbon would have four bonds: the cyclohexane ring (so one bond), OH (another), cyclohexyl (third), and CHO (fourth). But that's four bonds—so it's possible if the structure is a CH group with those substituents. So, the substituent is a CH group attached to the main ring, with OH, cyclohexyl, and CHO groups. So that's possible.

So how to get there from ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about the steps.

Ethynylcyclohexane → step 1: something → step 2: something → etc.

Option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → likely alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation, probably of a triple bond.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds.

4. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination or epoxidation.

Wait, after step 1, if we have a longer alkyne, then step 2 hydrogenates it to a single bond. Then, perhaps ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds, but how does that fit?

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to convert the alkyne into an alkane.

But then, how do we introduce the hydroxyl group and the aldehyde?

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene (but that would require a different catalyst, like Lindlar's). Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone. Wait, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a diol via hydration. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me try to think about the steps needed for the target. The substituent has a hydroxyl group and a formyl group. So perhaps oxidation is involved. So, if we have a secondary alcohol, it can be oxidized to a ketone, but in the target, there's an aldehyde group, which is a primary carbonyl. So perhaps an oxidation of a primary alcohol would give the aldehyde.

Wait, but the target structure also has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl and the aldehyde. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexyl group via ring-opening or some kind of coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the process involves adding a methyl group, then functionalizing it with hydroxyl and aldehyde groups.

Wait, maybe the sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, perhaps forming a bridge.

3. Ozonolysis would then break a double bond, but wait that requires a double bond. Hmm, maybe after hydrogenation, there's a double bond formed elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that after alkylation and hydrogenation, we have a diol, which can then be oxidized.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option C: Steps 1-4:

1. Alkylation adds a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

Wait, but hydrogenation of an alkyne (with H2 and a catalyst) would typically stop at the cis-alkene if using a poisoned catalyst, but with excess H2 and a different catalyst, perhaps it goes all the way to an alkane. So, if the alkyne becomes an alkane, perhaps we can form a cyclohexane ring with a longer substituent.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds, but if after step 2, the compound is a single bond, perhaps ozonolysis isn't applicable. Wait, that doesn't make sense. So maybe the alkyne isn't hydrogenated all the way to an alkane. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans-alkene (but I'm not sure about the conditions). Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but in option C, step 2 is H2 with Pd over CaCO3, which is a common catalyst for hydrogenation of alkynes to alkanes. So after step 2, the alkyne becomes a single bond, making a four-carbon chain attached to the cyclohexane.

Then, step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S as a workup. Ozone cleaves double bonds, but if there's no double bond, what happens? Unless, perhaps, the hydrogenation didn't go all the way and left a double bond. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, the substituent becomes a double bond somewhere else, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the target's structure again. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH group attached to OH, cyclohexyl, and CHO. So perhaps the substituent is formed by adding groups via alkyne chemistry.

Another approach: perhaps the alkyne is functionalized to form a propargyl alcohol, which can then be oxidized. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the substituent. So perhaps a cyclohexyl group is introduced via some kind of ring-opening or alkylation.

Wait, step 4 in option C is Ba(OH)2, which is used in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but more commonly, Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination reactions, like in the formation of epoxides or for creating carbonyl groups via oxidation of alcohols.

Wait, let's think about the possible steps in option C:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, perhaps adding H2 to make a single bond. So the substituent becomes a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis would require a double bond, so perhaps after step 2, the substituent is a single bond, but that might not have a double bond. So maybe I'm wrong about that.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, a double bond is formed elsewhere, but I'm not seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the target again.

Wait, perhaps the target is a tricyclic compound, but that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide or some kind of diol formation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a ketone, which is then functionalized.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to alkylate the alkyne, hydrogenate to a single bond, then perform ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and then perform some kind of elimination or oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step adds a methyl group to the alkyne, making it longer, then hydrogenation makes a single bond, then ozonolysis breaks the molecule into two parts, and then Ba(OH)2 is used to form a carbonyl.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider each option's steps and see which makes the most sense.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps a different kind of alkylation, maybe adding an OMe group? Or perhaps forming some kind of ether.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → a strong base, perhaps for elimination, forming a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup, maybe to form aldehydes or ketones.

Alternatively, maybe this sequence forms a double bond, which is then cleaved by ozone to form carbonyl groups.

So, starting with ethynylcyclohexane, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation with methanol. Wait, but methanol is a poor electrophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's for aromatic rings, which we don't have here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to generate an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol is a nucleophile, so perhaps it would attack the acetylide, giving a new alkyne with an OMe group. But that's a possibility.

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, often used for eliminations, like forming alkenes from alcohols (E2 mechanism). So maybe if we have an alcohol here, it could eliminate to form a double bond.

Then ozone would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. Finally, NH4OH would work up the ozonides, perhaps yielding aldehydes or ketones.

Hmm, that might fit. Let me think about each step.

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and methanol.

NaNH2 deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide. Then, methanol (CH3OH) would react as an electrophile, but wait, the acetylide is a strong base. Maybe it would deprotonate methanol, but that's less likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, maybe the acetylide attacks the methyl group of methanol. So, the OMe would attach to the acetylide, giving a new alkyne with an OMe group. So ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡C-OCH3 group.

Then, step 2: Li in liq NH3. That's a strong base. If the compound now has an OMe group, perhaps it undergoes elimination. For instance, if there's a neighboring hydrogen, it could eliminate to form a double bond. But wait, the structure would be CH2-C≡C-OCH3 attached to the cyclohexane. Hydrogen adjacent to the OMe group? Maybe the OMe group is at the end, so elimination would form a triple bond again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe this step is for something else, like deprotonation to form an alkyne again.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a different kind of alkylation. Maybe it's adding a methoxy group via some other mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylation of the alkyne to add an ethyl group.

2. Li/liq NH3 → elimination, perhaps forming a double bond.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup, maybe to form aldehydes.

So, starting with ethynylcyclohexane, step 1 adds an ethyl group via alkylation, making the substituent longer. Step 2 uses Li in liq NH3, which could eliminate to form a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls, and the workup would form aldehydes or ketones.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how that would form the target molecule.

Option A's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation to add a methyl.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe oxidation or elimination.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → acid-catalyzed reaction, perhaps hydration or oxidation.

Wait, step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. HgSO4 in acidic conditions is Jones' reagent, which is a strong oxidizing agent. It oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but maybe in this case, it would oxidize a secondary alcohol to a ketone or something else.

So, let's think: step 1 adds a methyl group to the alkyne, step 2 hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, making a longer chain. Then, Ba(OH)2 could induce elimination, perhaps forming an epoxide or a carbonyl group. Then step 4 is Jones' reagent, which oxidizes something.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target molecule.

Option C's steps 1-4:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation, adds methyl to alkyne.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenates alkyne to single bond.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but if the molecule has no double bonds after step 2, perhaps this is a problem.

Wait, maybe after step 2, there's a double bond. Wait, when you hydrogenate an alkyne, you can get a cis-alkene if using Lindlar's catalyst, or a trans-alkene with other conditions. But the catalyst here is H2 with Pd over CaCO3, which is typically used for full hydrogenation of alkynes to alkanes. So after step 2, the substituent would be a single bond, without a double bond. So step 3's ozonolysis wouldn't have anything to react with. That makes me think that option C might not be correct.

So perhaps the correct sequence is in option D.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms an acetylide, then reacts with methanol. Methanol is a poor alkylating agent, but maybe it's used to form an ether. Alternatively, perhaps this step is for forming a Grignard-like reagent.

2. Li in liq NH3 → strong base, perhaps for elimination, forming a double bond.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the double bond to form carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup to form aldehydes or ketones.

So, let's imagine the steps:

Ethynylcyclohexane → step 1: treated with NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile, so perhaps the acetylide attacks the methyl group, leading to a new alkyne with an OMe group. So the structure becomes cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡C-OCH3 group.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3. This is a strong base, perhaps leading to elimination. If the structure is CH2-C≡C-OCH3, elimination could occur, but where's the H for elimination? Maybe the Li abstracts a proton adjacent to the OCH3 group, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the triple bond might become a double bond, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the OMe group leaves as a good leaving group, leading to elimination.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Another approach: perhaps after step 1, we have a propargyl ether (CH2-C≡C-OCH3). Then, step 2 uses a strong base to eliminate, perhaps forming a double bond.

Elimination would require adjacent H and leaving group. The structure is CH2-C≡C-OCH3. If the Li abstracts a beta hydrogen (from the CH2 group), perhaps leading to an elimination of OCH3 and forming a triple bond again. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Another possibility: after step 1, the structure is CH2-C≡C-OCH3. Then, step 2's base could deprotonate the OCH3 group, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the OCH3 group is a good leaving group under certain conditions, leading to elimination and the formation of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the Li in liquid NH3 induces elimination of the OCH3 group, forming a double bond. So the triple bond would become a double bond, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is used for deprotonation to form a stronger base, which could then eliminate. For example, if the molecule has an alcohol group, the base could deprotonate and eliminate. But in this case, after step 1, the molecule has an OMe group, not an OH.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Maybe I should consider that the correct option is option C.

Wait, another approach: The target has an aldehyde group, which suggests oxidation of a primary alcohol. So perhaps in the steps, a primary alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, which ones include an oxidation step that would produce an aldehyde?

Option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is Jones' reagent. That would oxidize a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid, not an aldehyde. So that's probably not the correct path.

Option B's step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent in some contexts, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, in ozonolysis workup with NH4OH, it would form carbonyl groups, perhaps aldehydes if the original double bond was between two CH2 groups.

Option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination or for creating a carbonyl group via oxidation of an alcohol.

But in the target molecule, we have a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group on the same carbon. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol, then oxidizing one of the OH groups to a carbonyl.

Wait, if after some steps, we have a diol (vicinal diol from ozonolysis), perhaps Ba(OH)2 could eliminate to form a carbonyl.

Wait, ozonolysis of a diene typically forms two carbonyl groups. So if we have a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But the target only has one carbonyl group, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group, hydrogenating, then ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group, and then some elimination to form the aldehyde.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look for another way to approach this.

Another angle: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to the substituent. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a ring-opening reaction or via some kind of coupling that adds a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which already has a cyclohexane ring. So the substituent is on that ring. The target's substituent includes another cyclohexyl group, so perhaps the synthesis involves adding a cyclohexyl group via a new ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C.

Let me try to imagine the steps in option C:

1. Alkylation adds a methyl group → the alkyne becomes longer.

2. Hydrogenation converts the alkyne into a single bond (but that would require a four-carbon substituent).

3. Ozonolysis would require a double bond, but after step 2, the substituent is a single bond. So perhaps this is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, the substituent has a double bond somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't complete. For example, if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, which then undergoes ozonolysis. But I thought the catalyst in step 2 is for full hydrogenation to an alkane.

Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about that. If step 2 uses H2 and Pd, perhaps it hydrogenates the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

Wait, no, typically, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds all the way to single bonds. But if the catalyst is Lindlar's, it would stop at the cis-alkene. So perhaps the catalyst in step 2 isn't Lindlar's, so it goes all the way to the single bond. So ozonolysis wouldn't have a double bond to work with, making option C steps 3 and 4 a bit puzzling.

So perhaps option D is correct.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms an acetylide and then reacts with methanol to form an ether.

2. Li in liq NH3 → elimination to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup to form aldehydes.

So, after step 1, we have a propargyl ether (CH2-C≡C-OCH3). Step 2 uses Li in liq NH3, which is a strong base. Perhaps it abstracts a proton adjacent to the OCH3 group, leading to elimination of OCH3 and forming a triple bond. Wait, but that would just give back the original alkyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is for deprotonation to form a stronger base, which could then eliminate. If the structure after step 1 is CH2-C≡C-OCH3, perhaps the Li abstracts a proton from the CH2 group, leading to elimination of OCH3 and forming a double bond between the two carbons. So the alkyne becomes CH2-CH2 after elimination, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a triple bond, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 forms a double bond via elimination, making the structure CH2=CH-C≡C-OCH3. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should think about the correct answer based on the reagents.

The target requires introducing a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group. So the reagents should include steps to introduce these groups.

Option D's step 4 is NH4OH, which in the context of ozonolysis would lead to the formation of aldehydes or ketones. So if after ozonolysis, you have carbonyl groups, perhaps one of them is an aldehyde.

Putting it all together, perhaps option D's steps would involve:

1. Alkylation to add a methoxy group.

2. Elimination to form a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into carbonyls.

4. Workup to form aldehydes.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group to the main ring, along with a hydroxyl and an aldehyde. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a bridge between rings, introducing the substituents via alkyne chemistry.

If I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for the correct answer by process of elimination.

The correct sequence likely involves adding a substituent, hydrogenating the alkyne, then introducing a carbonyl group via ozonolysis, and then forming the aldehyde.

Looking at the options, option C's step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes and ketones. Then step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which could be for elimination or oxidation.

Wait, if after step 3, we have a diol, then Ba(OH)2 might cause elimination to form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation adds a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation makes the alkyne into a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis isn't applicable because no double bond, so perhaps step 3 is something else.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and an aldehyde group attached to the same carbon. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Likely alkylates the alkyne, adding a methyl group.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer alkyl chain.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones' reagent, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. This does not align with the target molecule, as it would not produce an aldehyde.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, adding an ethyl group.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, forming a double bond.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup for ozonolysis, forming aldehydes or ketones.

This sequence could potentially form carbonyl groups, but it does not clearly explain how the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups are introduced onto the same carbon in the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, adding a methyl group.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer alkyl chain.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. However, after step 2, the alkyne is fully hydrogenated to a single bond, leaving no double bond for ozonolysis. This makes this step questionable.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation. This step does not clearly align with forming the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Likely forms an acetylide, which reacts with methanol to form a propargyl ether (CH₂-C≡C-OCH₃).
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, forming a double bond.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup for ozonolysis, forming aldehydes or ketones.

This sequence provides a plausible pathway for introducing the aldehyde group. However, the role of methanol in step 1 and the formation of the hydroxyl group remain unclear.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, **Option C** appears to be the most likely sequence. It involves alkylation, hydrogenation, and ozonolysis, which could potentially lead to the formation of the target molecule. However, the exact role of Ba(OH)₂ in step 4 is unclear. Despite some uncertainties, Option C aligns most closely with the required transformations.
