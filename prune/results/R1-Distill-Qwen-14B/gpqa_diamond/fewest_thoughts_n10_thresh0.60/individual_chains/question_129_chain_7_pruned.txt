Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, I'm a bit new to organic chemistry, but I'll do my best. The question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

And there are hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with ylides, but I remember that ylides are usually involved in alkyne synthesis, like in the Wittig reaction. The product here is a cyclopentane with some substituents. So maybe A is an alkyne or an aldehyde or ketone?

b) The IR of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O). So A likely has a ketone or aldehyde group. E's IR is around 1715, which is also a carbonyl, maybe a ketone but perhaps a different environment? Maybe less substituted or more electron-withdrawing groups?

Looking at the options, all are cyclic ketones. So E is a cyclo ketone.

Let's think about each step.

Step 1: A reacts with HCN to form B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation is when a carbonyl reacts with HCN to form a compound with an adjacent CN group and OH.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that A is an aldehyde, but the IR at 1750 is more ketone-like. So A is probably a ketone. So when A (a ketone) reacts with HCN, it would form a cyanohydrin, which has an OH and CN group adjacent to each other.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation. So if B is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and nitrile group, what would happen upon hydrogenation? The nitrile would reduce to an amine? Wait, no. Wait, H2 and Pd usually reduces nitriles to amines, but maybe under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe the cyanide group is in a position that allows for hydrogenation. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, if B is an alkyne, but no, A is a ketone, so B would be a cyanohydrin.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. HCN adds to a ketone to form a cyanohydrin, which has an -OH and -CN group adjacent to each other. So when you reduce that, maybe the nitrile group is converted into an amine, but that doesn't seem right because Pd and H2 is usually
