Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to understand what it's asking. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first things first, I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on the state being a unit vector. 

Wait, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, in the standard basis, these are just the basis vectors. Let me write the state as |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2-i). But wait, the problem says it's proportional, so I have to find the normalization factor.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. Let's calculate |a|^2: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1=2. And |b|^2: (2-i)(2+i)=4 +1=5. So sum is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Okay, moving on to the next part. The operator's matrix representation has elements Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So it's a 2x2 matrix. Let me visualize it. For a spin-1/2 system, the basis is |up> and |down>, so the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, because for i≠j, Aij is hbar/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and off-diagonal are hbar/2. So this is the matrix for the Pauli X operator multiplied by hbar/2. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) X. So any operator proportional to X would have eigenstates along the x-axis.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are equal superpositions of |up>
