Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance is formed from its elements in their standard states. Oh wait, but wait, the question gives me some bond energies instead. Oh right, bond energies can be used to calculate the enthalpy change for reactions, but I need to figure out how to apply that here.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complex. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, it's a molecule with two double bonds, I think. Each double bond is probably between carbons. Let me count the double bonds. The formula I see has two double bonds: the first part is (CH3)2C=CH, and the end part is CH=C(CH3)2. So that's two double bonds right there.

The question gives me bond energies for C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H. Also, the enthalpy of atomization for carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. I'm a bit confused because I thought atomization was about breaking bonds in an element. Oh wait, enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break bonds in one mole of an element to produce separated atoms. For carbon, which is a solid, it would involve breaking C-C bonds. But how does that tie into the enthalpy of formation?

Wait, I think I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The general approach is to calculate the total bond energies of the reactants and products. For the formation reaction, the reactants are the elements in their standard states, and the product is the compound.

But wait, in this case, the compound is a hydrocarbon, so the elements are carbon and hydrogen. So the standard states are graphite for carbon (since it's the most stable form) and H2 gas for hydrogen.

The reaction for formation would be something like:
24 C(graphite) + 30 H2(g) â†’ (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 + ... ?

Wait, let me count the number of carbons and hydrogens
