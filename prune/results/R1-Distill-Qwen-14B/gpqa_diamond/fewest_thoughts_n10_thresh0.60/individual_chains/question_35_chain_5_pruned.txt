Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The operator AY is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of AY. Then, among the options A to D, I have to pick the correct statement.

First, I remember that the eigenvalues of a matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(Ay - λI) = 0.

Wait, what's the matrix Ay? Let me write it down. Since Ay = c * S, and S is given, let's substitute c = h/(4π). So,

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So the matrix is:

[ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

But maybe it's easier to first compute the eigenvalues of S and then scale them by c, since c is a scalar multiple. Because if S has eigenvalues s, then Ay would have eigenvalues c*s.

So let me find the eigenvalues of S first. The matrix S is:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

The trace of S is 0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = (i^2) * (-1). Wait, wait, let's compute that.

Wait, (-i) * i = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is (0)(0) - ( (-i)(i) ) = 1. Because (0 - (-i)(i)) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - ( -(-1) ) = 0 - (1) = -1? Wait, wait, no. Let me compute determinant correctly.

S is a 2x2 matrix with elements (row 1: 0, -i) and (row 2: i, 0). The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - ( -i*i ). i* i is i² = -1, so -i * i = -(i²) = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is 0 - (1) = -1? No, wait. The calculation is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - [ (-i)(i) ].

Compute (-i)(i) = (-i²) = - (i²) = -( -1 ) = 1. So determinant is 0 - 1 = -1? Wait, no, wait. The formula for determinant is (a*d - b*c) for a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d].

So in this case, a
