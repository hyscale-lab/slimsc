Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as a 2x2 matrix. 

First, let me read the problem again. The muon's intrinsic angular momentum operator's Y-component is Ay, which is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The equation given is Ay(φ) = a(φ), where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. 

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix whose first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). Wait, so matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]?

I remember that angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices. Oh wait, right! The Pauli matrices are often used in spin-1/2 systems. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall their forms. 

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh wait, that's exactly the structure of matrix S here. So S is the Pauli y matrix, σy. So, S = σy.

So operator Ay is c * σy. And c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

But wait, what's the operator for the angular momentum in terms of Pauli matrices? Oh right, for spin systems, the angular momentum operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Because ħ is h/(2π), so (ħ/2) = h/(4π). Oh wait, so that would mean that Ay, which is (h/(4π)) * σy, is equal to (ħ/2) σy, which is exactly the component of the spin operator S^y. Because spin angular momentum S is given by S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices.

So the operator Ay should have eigenvalues corresponding to the possible values of S^y. For spin-1/2 particles, the eigenvalues of S^y are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues a of Ay should be (h/(4π)) multiplied by the eigenvalues of σy. Let me compute that. 

Wait, the eigenvalues of σy are ±i, but that's not right because σy is Hermitian? Wait no, σy is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues should be real. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check: the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues must be real. So σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but wait, that can't be right because the trace is zero. Let me think again. The trace of σy is 0. So eigenvalues should be λ and -λ, summing to zero. The determinant is (0)(0) − (−i)(i) = (i^2) = -1. So determinant is -1. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues satisfy λ^2 - trace λ + determinant = 0. So λ^2 + (-0)*λ + (-1) = 0 → λ^2 = 1 → λ = ±1. So yes, σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So, operator Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy. So the eigenvalues a are (h/(4π)) * (±1). So a = ± h/(4π). 

Wait, but what about the options? Let me look at the options again.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but the eigenvalues of Ay are real, right? Because real matrices can have real eigenvalues, but actually σy is Hermitian, so Ay is also Hermitian because it's a scalar multiple of a Hermitian matrix. So eigenvalues should be real. So option A is talking about an imaginary part, which can't be right. So A is incorrect.

Option B: The imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Well, the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary part is zero. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Well, A^2 would be (Ay)^2. Since Ay is a spin operator, for any eigenstate of Ay, it should also be an eigenstate of A² because A² is just the square of the component, which for spin 1/2 is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) multiplied by the identity matrix. So eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az, the z-component? The eigenfunctions of Ay are not the same as those of Az, since they don't share the same eigenbasis. So the statement in option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That seems correct. But I'll have to check the other options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Wait, the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay? I'm not sure what that means. I think it's perhaps referring to the eigenvectors forming a basis. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, yes, the eigenvectors would form a basis if they are not degenerate. But the question is whether the eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe that's a trick option.

Wait, let's go back to the question. The problem is to calculate
