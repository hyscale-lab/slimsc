Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let's try to think it through.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], right? So I remember that the gamma matrices are dimensionless, and F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. So F^{μν} is like the field tensor, which has dimensions based on the electromagnetic field.

Wait, the overall question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. I remember that in QFT, the renormalizability depends on the dimensions of the coupling constants. If the coupling has positive mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable because you can't absorb the divergences into a finite number of counterterms. Or wait, is it the other way around? Let me think: the superficial degree of divergence depends on the dimensions. For a theory to be renormalizable, all couplings must have positive or zero mass dimension. Wait, no, I think the opposite: if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory might be non-renormalizable because higher-order terms are more relevant.

Wait, maybe I should start by figuring out the mass dimensions of each field and term in the Lagrangian. Because the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in four spacetime dimensions (since the action is dimensionless). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So let's break down each part of L_int. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}.

First, ψ is a spinor field. The Dirac spinor has mass dimension 3/2 because in four dimensions, to make the Dirac equation work, ψ must have dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ (the adjoint spinor) also has dimension 3/2.

σ_{μν} is made from the commutator of gamma matrices. Since gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices), the commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] is also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless (times i/2, which is also dimensionless). So σ_{μν} has mass dimension 0.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for gauge fields. For electromagnetism, the field tensor F is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A. So F has dimensions of mass squared, because A has dimension 1 (since the covariant derivative is ∂ - i e A, and ∂ has dimension mass). So derivatives give mass dimension 1, so F, which is ∂A - ∂A, has dimension (mass)^1 * (mass)^1 = (mass)^2? Wait, no. Wait, the field strength tensor F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so each A has dimension 1, so each derivative gives one mass dimension. So F has dimension (mass)^2.

Wait, let me think again. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1 because the term in the covariant derivative is ∂_μ which is mass dimension 1, and the term i e A_μ is added, which must match the dimension, so A has dimension 1.

So F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each term in F has dimension (mass)^1 * (mass)^1 = (mass)^2, because ∂ is mass dimension 1, and A is mass dimension 1. So F has dimension 2.

Putting it all together: the terms in L_int are κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

Let me compute the
