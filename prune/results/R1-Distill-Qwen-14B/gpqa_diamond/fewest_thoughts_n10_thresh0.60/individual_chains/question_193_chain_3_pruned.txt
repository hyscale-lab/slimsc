Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are related. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh wait, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if the distance is larger, the parallax is smaller.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let's substitute plx with 1/d. So N ‚àù 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question isn't just about N as a function of d, it's about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, right, that means the change in N with respect to r, which I think is the derivative dN/dr. Or wait, per unit range, so maybe it's the density of stars as a function of distance.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N
