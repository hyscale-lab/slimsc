Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy terms, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. 

Wait, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (d) is approximately 1 over plx (d ≈ 1/plx), but that's in parsecs, right? So when plx increases, the star is closer because the parallax is larger, and vice versa.

The problem states that the number of stars (let's call it N) varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So mathematically, that would be N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, I need to express N in terms of distance (r) rather than parallax.

Hmm, I should relate parallax to distance. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, plx ∝ 1/r. So plx = k/r, where k is some constant. Let me plug that into the equation for N.

N ∝ 1/( (k/r) )^5. Let's compute that. (k/r)^5 is k^5 / r^5. So 1 over that is r^5 / k^5. So N ∝ r^5 / k^5. Since k is a constant, the proportionality becomes N ∝ r^5. Wait, but wait a second. Am I sure about the substitution?

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of substitution. Let me express plx in terms of r. If plx is 1/r (ignoring the constant for proportionality), then plx = 1/(r). So when I substitute, 1/plx^5 becomes 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in terms of per unit range of distance. Oh, wait, the question is asking about the change in the number of stars per unit distance. So perhaps I'm looking
