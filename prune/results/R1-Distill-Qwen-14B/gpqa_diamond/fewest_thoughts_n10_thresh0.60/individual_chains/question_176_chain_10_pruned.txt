Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in a system. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that doesn't look normalized. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors need to be normalized, meaning their squared length should be 1. So I'll need to normalize it first.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let's compute its norm. The norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of each component. So that's sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. That makes sense.

Next, the operators for P and Q are given. Let's look at operator P's matrix. The first row is [0, 1/√2, 0], second row [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], third row [0, 1/√2, 0]. Wait, what's the structure of this matrix? It seems like a symmetric matrix because the elements are symmetric across the diagonal. Symmetric matrices are diagonalizable, so P is an observable with real eigenvalues.

Operator Q's matrix is diagonal: [1, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, -1]. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, I think. Because for Q, when it's diagonal, each basis vector is an eigenvector. So |q=1> is [1, 0, 0]^T, |q=0> is [0, 1, 0]^T, and |q=-1> is [0, 0, 1]^T. Wait, no. Wait, the diagonal elements are 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvectors are standard basis vectors, right. So measuring Q will collapse the state into one of these.

The question is: what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1
