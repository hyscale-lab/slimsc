Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options for the chemical formula are all C6H something O or O2. The options are A to D.

First, I'll break down the given data step by step.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak. The other peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm. The 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like conjugated double bonds, as in an aromatic ring). Alternatively, 1650 could be an amide, but I don't see any N in the possible formulas, so maybe not.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond somewhere. Also, since the molecular formula options include O, maybe there's an ester group or something with a carbonyl.

The Mass Spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. I remember that m/z 45 is indicative of a fragment that's (CH3)2CO, which is an acetone fragment. Or wait, another possibility: maybe a propionyl group or a ketone. Let's think, 45 could also correspond to (CH3)CO, like a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment where a methyl group is removed.

Now, let's think about the molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10
