Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's see, the options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Hmm, starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm-1 suggests the presence of either an alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe an amide N-H, but I don't think that's the case here because the options don't have nitrogen. So probably an alcohol group. Wait, or could it be something else, like an aromatic C-H stretch? No, aromatic C-H is usually around 3000 but less broad. Oh, right, a broad peak around 3000 is more likely an O-H group, like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm.

1700 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1650 might be another carbonyl, but that's lower. Maybe an conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, which would lower the carbonyl stretch frequency. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or one and another functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond, perhaps conjugated with a carbonyl group. So maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl system. That would explain the 1650 cm-1 peak, as conjugated double bonds have lower wavenumbers.

Now, the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. What could that correspond to? Common fragments at m/z 45... Let me think. 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O, which is like a propoxide ion, but more likely, maybe something like a (CH3)2CO+ fragment. Wait, no, (CH3)2CO is 58. Hmm. Or maybe it's the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Wait, no, 45 is smaller. Oh, wait, 45 could be the fragment of a ketone. For example, acetone (propan-2-one) has a molecular weight of 58, but if there's a cleavage, maybe a fragment of 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2CH2O or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3CO+ group, but CH3CO+ is 43, I think
