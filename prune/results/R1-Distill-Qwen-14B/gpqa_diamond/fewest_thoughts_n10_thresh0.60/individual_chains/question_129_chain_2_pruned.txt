Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack it all.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are some hints and an IR spectrum data to help me. Let's break it down.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, which are various cyclic ketones.

So, let's start by thinking about each step.

Step 1: A → B with HCN. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So A must be a ketone or aldehyde. The product B would be a cyanohydrin. Wait, but HCN adds to ketones in a way that forms a secondary alcohol and a cyanide group. So if A is a ketone, B would have an -OH and a -CN group adjacent.

Step 2: B → C with H2 and Pd. That's a hydrogenation reaction. So if B has a triple bond, hydrogenation would make a single bond. Alternatively, if B has a nitrile group (from HCN addition), hydrogenation might reduce the nitrile to an amine. But wait, H2 with Pd usually is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So nitriles (R-CN) on hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would become amines (R-CH2-NH2?), but wait, I think hydrogenation of nitriles typically yields amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrogenation of a carbonyl group? But in step 1, B is formed from A (a ketone) and HCN, so B would have a structure like R-C(OH)-CN. No, wait, maybe A is a cyclic ketone. For example, cyclopentanone or something similar.

Wait, considering hint a): A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So if the product is a cyclopentane with substituents, A must be a ketone in a cyclic structure. Let's think: the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 2, and position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group (which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group? Wait, no: propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=. Wait, maybe it's (propan-2-ylidene) group is a substituent on the cyclopentane at position 4. So the structure would have a double bond from the Wittig reaction.

So A is a cyclic ketone (like cyclopentanone), and when it reacts with a Wittig reagent, it forms an alkene. So the product would have a double bond where the carbonyl was before.

Wait, cyclopentanone reacting with a Wittig reagent would form cyclopentene, but in this case, there are substituents. Let me look at the product structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has two methyl groups at positions 1 and 2
