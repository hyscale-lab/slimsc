Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think it through.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, hold on, those numbers... but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors with complex numbers, right? Oh wait, maybe the state is normalized here. Let me check. The vector is (-1, 2, 1). To see if it's normalized, I'll compute the sum of the squares of the elements. So, (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. 1+4+1=6. Oh, so the vector isn't normalized. So maybe I need to normalize it first before proceeding.

Wait, but the problem is about measurements of P and Q. Oh right, when measuring an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probabilities depend on the state being projected onto the corresponding eigenspaces.

So the process would be: first measure P, then measure Q after that. We need the probability that P is 0 and Q is -1.

Let me look at the operators P and Q. The operator P's matrix is given. Let me write that down:

P matrix:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And Q's matrix is:
Row 1: 1, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -1

So, Q is a diagonal matrix. The eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1. So, the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, I think. Because Q when applied to |e1> gives 1|e1>, same for |e3> gives -1|e3>, and any vector in the second component (e2) would be 0.

Now, for operator P. Hmm, let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because the eigenvalues will tell me the possible outcomes when measuring P.

Wait, but how do I find the eigenvalues of P? Let's compute the characteristic equation. The matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. The trace is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is 0.

Let me compute the determinant of (P - λI). The matrix P minus λ times identity:

Row 1: -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ

So the determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/s
