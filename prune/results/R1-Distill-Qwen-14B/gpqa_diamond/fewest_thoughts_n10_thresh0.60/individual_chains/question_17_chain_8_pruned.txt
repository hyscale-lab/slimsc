Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, so maybe I don't have to worry about other reactions there. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard for these kinds of problems. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is 5x10^10. The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution.

Wait, right, EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So the Ca-EDTA complex is [CaEDTA]^2-, I think. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- (or some form, depending on pH). The K value given is the formation constant, which for a complex like CaEDTA would be K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Oh wait, but wait. The solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, without any dissociation, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But because it can dissociate, the actual concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will be less than that.

Hmm, so let me think about the dissociation. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- according to the equation:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2- 

The formation constant K is 5e10, which is a very large number. That suggests that the complex is very stable, so the dissociation won't be much. So the concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will be very low.

Let me denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Then the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, assuming that each mole of complex dissolves into one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So the expression for K is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

Wait, no. Wait, I think the formation constant
