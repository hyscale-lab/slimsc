Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin in the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation is a two-component spinor. So the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T. Right, because electron spin-1/2 states are usually represented as two-component vectors.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket product, right? So S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices come into play here. I remember that S_x, S_y, and S_z are proportional to the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Specifically, S = (ħ/2) * σ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

So the S_y operator must be (ħ/2) times the σ_y matrix. The σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

To find the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I need to compute χ† S_y χ. Let me write this out step by step.

First, the state vector χ is [3i, 4]^T. The adjoint χ† is the row vector [3i*, 4*], which since 3i is a complex number, its conjugate is -3i. So χ† = [-3i, 4].

Wait, wait. Wait, the components of χ are 3i (top) and 4 (bottom). So χ† should be [3i*, 4*], which is [ -3i, 4 ] because 4 is real, its conjugate is itself.

So now, the matrix S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix. Let me compute S_y χ first.

Let me compute S_y multiplied by χ. Let's break it down:

S_y χ = (ħ/2) * σ_y * χ.

So σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Multiplying this by χ, which is [3i, 4].

Wait, matrix multiplication: the first row is 0*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = -4i. The second row is i*(3i) + 0*(4) = i*3i = 3i^2. Since i^2 is -1, that's -3.

So σ_y χ is [ -4i , -3 ]^T. Then, multiplying by (ħ/2), S_y χ is (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ].

So now, the expectation value is χ† multiplied by S_y χ.

Wait, no, wait. The expectation value is χ† (S_y) χ. So another way is to compute χ† multiplied by S_y, and then multiplied by χ. But perhaps it's easier to compute as χ† times (S_y times χ).

Alternatively, since χ is a column vector, χ†
