Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. The idea is to make the theory finite and then take a limit where the regularization parameter goes away.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think superstring theory is a type of string theory, which is a theory of quantum gravity. String theories are supposed to be finite because strings have a minimum size, which might prevent the kinds of divergences that occur in point particle theories. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same divergences as other quantum field theories.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD requires regularization when dealing with things like renormalization because of the non-Abelian nature of the gauge group. It has issues like confinement and asymptotic freedom, but that doesn't directly answer if regularization is needed. Wait, regularization is usually a part of the process in QFT regardless of the theory. So QCD would need it.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. QED definitely has divergences, like in calculating the electron self-energy, so it requires regularization. Techniques like cutoff regularization, Pauli-Villars, or dimensional regularization are used. So yes, QED needs it.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Classical ED is a non-quantum theory. Since it's classical, there are no divergent loop integrals or renormalization issues. So regularization isn't needed here because regularization is a quantum field theory concept.

The question is which theory never requires regularization. So looking again, the options are about which theory doesn't need it.

Superstring Theory (A) might not need it because it's a theory that doesn't have the same divergences as QED or QCD. But wait, I'm not sure. Some might think that string theories require regularization because loop divergences could still come up, but I think in string theory, the higher-order terms are handled differently. Strings have a sort of "built-in" cutoff because they have a minimum length, so maybe they don't have the same issues, meaning they don't need regularization.

Classical ED (D) doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory and doesn't have the divergences that come from quantum effects.

So the question is asking which theory never requires regularization. So looking at the options, both A and D might not require regularization. But wait, the options are:

A) Superstring Theory — quantum theory, but perhaps no divergences needing regularization.

D) Classical Electrodynamics — no regularization because it's classical.

But the question is about which of the following theories never requires regularization at high energies. So high energies would be where quantum effects are important. So if a theory is classical, it doesn't use regularization. But if a quantum theory doesn't need regularization, that's another option.

Wait, the question is about which theory "never" requires regularization. So perhaps the correct answer
