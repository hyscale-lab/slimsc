Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives me some information. The operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So the matrix S looks like this:

S = [ 0   -i ]
      [ i    0 ]

And Ay is c times S, so substituting c, Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are A to D, and I need to determine which statement is correct.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors... Right, for a 2x2 matrix, I can find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So let's write down Ay. Since c = h/(4π), then:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ 0   -i ]
                [ i    0 ]

So the matrix Ay is:

[ 0        -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  0       ]

Let me represent this as:

Ay = [ 0      -i c ]
      [ i c     0 ]

where c is h/(4π).

To find the eigenvalues, I set up the equation Ay * φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. Alternatively, the characteristic equation is det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ -a      -i c ]
[ i c     -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i)(i) c² )

Wait, let's compute each part. The determinant is ( (-a)*(-a) ) - ( ( -i c ) * (i c ) )

So, (a²) - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

What's (-i)(i)? That's -i² which is -(-1) = 1. So:

(-i c)(i c) = ( (-i)(i) ) * c^2 = (1) * c².

So the determinant becomes a² - c² = 0.

So the characteristic equation is a² = c², which implies a = ±c.

Wait, but wait. Wait, c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π). So that's the eigenvalues.

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and the real parts are ±h/(4π). Wait, that doesn't make sense because eigenvalues are real or complex? Wait, wait. Wait, angular momentum operators usually have real eigenvalues in
