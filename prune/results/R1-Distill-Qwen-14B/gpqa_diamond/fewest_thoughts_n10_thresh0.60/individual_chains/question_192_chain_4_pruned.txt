Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

So, there's this uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the conductor's center, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Hmm, point P is outside, so its distance from the conductor's center is L. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both larger than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s. 

I remember that conductors behave in certain ways when charges are placed inside or outside. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, I think the inner surfaces of the conductor will have induced charges.

Wait, right. For a conductor, when you place a charge inside a cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to that. So the inner surface would have -q. But since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q because the total charge is zero. Or wait, no, because the conductor was uncharged initially. So the net charge on the conductor is zero. So if the cavity has +q, the inner surface must have -q, leaving the outer surface to have +q to balance. But wait, maybe I'm mixing things up here.

Wait, the conductor is neutral. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of -q to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner is -q, the total conductor's charge is zero, so the outer must be +q.

But wait, the conductor as a whole is neutral. So the outer surface's charge is +q. Because the inner surface is -q, so the conductor's own charge is zero. Correct.

So the field outside the conductor would be as if the charge +q was concentrated at the center of the conductor? Or does the position of the cavity affect it? Because in this
