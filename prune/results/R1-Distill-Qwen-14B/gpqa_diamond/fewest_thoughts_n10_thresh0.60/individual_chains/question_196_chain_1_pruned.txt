Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so I have to think about how relativity affects things.

The problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force law is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. So it's like a spring. The question is about the maximum speed v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed can be found by equating the potential energy at maximum displacement to the kinetic energy. So the potential energy U is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy K is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That would be option C, but wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so option C might not be correct.

In relativity, energy considerations change. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is quantized, but here I think we're considering a classical approach because it's talking about maximum amplitude, not quantum states.

Wait, but how does the relativistic approach affect the maximum speed? In relativity, as an object's speed approaches c, the relativistic effects become significant. So the energy can't be treated class
