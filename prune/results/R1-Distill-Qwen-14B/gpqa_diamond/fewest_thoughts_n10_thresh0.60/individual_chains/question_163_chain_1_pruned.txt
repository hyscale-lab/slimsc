Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions, but let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. The goal is to find out the minimum volume of 0.1 M HCl needed to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution, and then determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given, so maybe I can work through it.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and can react with a strong acid. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O. Wait, is that right? Yeah, because each OH- from Fe(OH)3 would react with an H+ from HCl, so three H+ for each Fe(OH)3.

So the first thing I need to do is find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3... Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1.008. So Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1.008) ?

Let me calculate that: 55.85 + 3*(17.008) = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 / 106.874 ≈ 0.0009357 moles. Wait, let me double-check that calculation: 0.1 divided by 106.874. Let me compute that. 106.874 is approximately 107, so 0.1 / 107 is about 0.0009346. So approximately 9.356e-4 moles.

Next, the reaction is 1 mole Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 moles HCl. So for 9.356e-4 moles Fe(OH)3, we need 3 * 9.356e-4 = 0.0028068 moles of HCl.

Wait, but wait, what's the concentration of HCl? The HCl is 0.1 M, and we're adding it to a total volume of 100 cm³ (which is 0.1 liters). So the volume (in liters) needed can be found by moles = Molarity * Volume. So volume = moles / Molarity.

So volume = 0.0028068 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028068 L, which is 28.068 cm³. So around 28.07 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that might be the volume needed. But wait, the question says "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid." Oh, right, because HCl is a monobasic strong acid, so that's correct.

But wait, are we done? Because when Fe(OH)3 dissolves, it forms Fe^3+ and OH- reacts with H+ from HCl. But I think once the stoichiometric amount is added, maybe the solution will have excess H+ because the reaction produces water and the solution will contain FeCl3, which is a strong acid (since Fe^3+ is a weak acid, but in solution, it can hydrolyze). Hmm, wait, maybe I should consider the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ ions.

Wait, the problem is asking for the pH of the resulting solution. So after dissolving all the Fe(OH)3, the solution will have Fe^3+ ions. FeCl3 is a strong electrolyte, so it will dissociate completely into Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions. The Fe^3+ ions can hydrolyze in water to form H+ ions, making the solution acidic. So we need to calculate the pH based on the concentration of Fe^3+.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3 → done: ~9.356e-4 mol.
2. Moles of HCl needed: 3 * 9.356
