Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, no, wait—the correct expression should probably be something like L = -λ f ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y) plus the mass term. Oh, maybe I should parse the given Lagrangian correctly. The user wrote it as -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that might be a typo or unclear. Oh, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the interaction between the boson X and the fermions. From the way it's written, it looks like X is a scalar boson field because it's written as X(y), which is a scalar. So the interaction term is something like Yukawa coupling, where the boson X couples to fermions with a coupling λ.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to find all possible fermion-antifermion pairs that X can decay into.

In particle physics, a boson like this can decay into fermion pairs if their combined mass is less than the mass of the boson. Because, for a decay X → f f̄, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than or equal to the boson's mass. Also, the fermions must be such that they are allowed by the interaction terms in the Lagrangian.

Wait, but what fermions are involved? The Lagrangian term here is for a Yukawa interaction, right? So the term is something like λ ψ_f X ψ_f, which means that the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So the fermions that X can decay into are those that are present in the Lagrangian.

So, in the given Lagrangian, the fermion is ψ_f, but the problem statement says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions"—so perhaps X can couple to multiple fermions. But wait the problem statement doesn't specify which fermions are present in the interaction. Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that X couples to all possible fermions, and then the possible decays are determined by the mass limits.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about knowing the masses of the quarks and leptons, and seeing which pairs sum up to less than 6 GeV.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV can be produced.

Let's list the masses of the known fermions:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV (so negligible compared to 6 GeV)
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): around 1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV, so can't decay into t t̄.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

So for each fermion, 2m_f:

u: ~4.4 MeV → way less than 6 GeV. So uū is allowed.

d: ~9.4 MeV → allowed.

s: ~190 MeV → allowed.

c: ~2.6 GeV → 2.6 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so c c̄ allowed.

b: 9 GeV → 9 GeV is way bigger than 6 GeV. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the mass of the b quark is about 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b̄.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake. The mass of the X is 6 GeV. So for a decay into a pair of fermions f and fbar, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, I think that's not exactly correct. The condition for a particle to decay into two particles is that the sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So for X → f f̄, 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So let's compute for each fermion:

u: m_u ~2.2 MeV → 2m_u ~4.4 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.

d: m_d ~4.7 MeV → 2m_d ~9.4 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.

s: m_s ~95 MeV → 2m_s ~190 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.

c: m_c ~1.3 GeV → 2m_c ~2.6 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.

b: m_b ~4.5 GeV → 2m_b ~9 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.

t: m_t ~173 GeV → way above, so no.

Leptons:

e: m_e ~0.5 MeV → 2m_e ~1 MeV → allowed.

μ: m_μ ~105.7 MeV → 2m_μ ~211.4 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.

τ: m_τ ~1.78 GeV → 2m_τ ~3.56 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.

So which fermions can X decay into as f f̄ pairs?

u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

But wait, the problem is about the interaction. Does the interaction Lagrangian include all these fermions? Because if the Lagrangian only includes certain fermions, then X can't decay into others.

Looking back at the problem statement, the interaction is given by L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation. Oh, maybe the interaction is -λ f X ψ_f ψ_f, which would imply that X couples to fermion ψ_f. So the fermion type depends on ψ_f. But the problem states that the interaction is between X and "fermions", plural, so perhaps X couples to multiple fermions. Or perhaps the problem assumes that X can couple to any fermion, so all possible decays are possible as long as the mass condition holds.

Wait, but the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by...", so the Lagrangian must include all possible terms for the fermions that X can couple to. But the Lagrangian as written is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and the actual Lagrangian is L = -λ X ψ_f^† ψ_f, meaning X couples to ψ_f. So ψ_f would be specific fermions. But the problem doesn't specify which fermions. Hmm, but the problem is about which decays are allowed, so perhaps the interaction includes all possible fermions, and the allowed decays are determined by the mass.

So, considering that, any fermion that meets 2m_f ≤6 GeV can be produced as a decay.

So, the possible fermions are:

u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ. Because their 2m_f is less than 6 GeV.

So possible decay channels are:

X → uū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e ē, μ+μ-, τ+τ-.

Wait, but let's look at the options. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ+τ-, e+e−.

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, b's mass is too high (2m_b =9 GeV >6 GeV), so X can't decay into b b̄. So option A includes b b̄, which would be incorrect. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ+τ-, μ+μ-, e+e−.

Wait, but earlier I thought c is allowed (2m_c=2.6 GeV <6 GeV). So option B includes c c̄, which is allowed. It also includes μ and e, which are allowed. So yes, option B includes all the allowed decays except for b and t.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the fermion masses. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, so 2m_b is 9 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄.

So option B includes c, which is allowed. So option B would have:

c c̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ+τ-, μ+μ-, e+e−.

That's all the allowed decays except for b and t.

Looking at the options:

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ+τ-, μ+μ−, e+e−.

Yes. So is that one of the options?

Looking at the options:

Option B is exactly that. So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but what about the tau? 2m_τ is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so allowed. So option B includes tau, which is correct.

Wait, but looking at option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

But wait, option D includes b b̄, which isn't allowed because 2m_b is 9 GeV >6 GeV. So option D is incorrect.

So among the options, the correct allowed decays are option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The top quark is way too heavy, so it's not an option. So option C includes t, which isn't possible. So option C is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decays are determined by the condition that the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \) (i.e., \( 2m_f \leq m_X \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fermion Masses and Decay Conditions**:
   - The masses of the known fermions are:
     - \( m_u \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_d \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_s \sim 95 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_c \sim 1.3 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_b \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (quarks),
     - \( m_e \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_\mu \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_\tau \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (leptons).
   - For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \), the condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) must be satisfied.

2. **Allowed Fermion Pairs**:
   - \( u \bar{u}: 2m_u \sim 4.4 \, \text{MeV} \, (\ll 6 \, \text{GeV}) \),
   - \( d \bar{d}: 2m_d \sim 9.4 \, \text{MeV} \, (\ll 6 \, \text{GeV}) \),
   - \( s \bar{s}: 2m_s \sim 190 \, \text{MeV} \, (\ll 6 \, \text{GeV}) \),
   - \( c \bar{c}: 2m_c \sim 2.6 \, \text{GeV} \, (\leq 6 \, \text{GeV}) \),
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^-: 2m_\tau \sim 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \, (\leq 6 \, \text{GeV}) \),
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^-: 2m_\mu \sim 211.4 \, \text{MeV} \, (\ll 6 \, \text{GeV}) \),
   - \( e^+ e^-: 2m_e \sim 1 \, \text{MeV} \, (\ll 6 \, \text{GeV}) \).
   - \( b \bar{b}: 2m_b \sim 9 \, \text{GeV} \, (> 6 \, \text{GeV}) \), so this decay is not allowed.
   - \( t \bar{t}: 2m_t \sim 346 \, \text{GeV} \, (> 6 \, \text{GeV}) \), so this decay is not allowed.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
