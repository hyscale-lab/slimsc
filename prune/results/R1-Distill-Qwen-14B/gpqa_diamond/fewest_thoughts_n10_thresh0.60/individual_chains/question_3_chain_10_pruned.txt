Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z matrix. They're asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Oh right, expectation values are like the average outcome if you measured this operator many times on the same state.

Wait, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket of the state with the operator acting on the state. So, ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩. Alternatively, it's the sum of the expectation values of each term. So I can split it into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a superposition of σz eigenstates, maybe it's easier. I think for σz, the expectation value is just the probability of each state times their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, the state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a is 0.5 and b is sqrt(3)/2. The eigenvalues for σz for |↑⟩ is +1 and for |↓⟩ is -1, right? So ⟨σz⟩ = |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1).

Let me calculate |a|^2
