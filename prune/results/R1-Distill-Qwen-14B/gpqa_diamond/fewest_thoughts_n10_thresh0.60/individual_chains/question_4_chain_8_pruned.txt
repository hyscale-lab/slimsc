Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, right, in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. I remember that's called the principle of magnetic duality or something like that.

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me think about each one. The first one is Gauss's Law for electricity, which deals with electric flux and charge. That's ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. Then there's Gauss's Law for magnetism, which says the divergence of B is zero, ∇·B = 0. Oh wait, that's because in our universe, there are no isolated magnetic charges, so the magnetic field lines are always continuous, no starts or ends.

The third equation is Faraday's Law of Induction, which is about the curl of E being equal to the negative rate of change of B. So ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. The fourth is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, which includes the curl of H being the sum of the current density and the displacement current, ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t.

So the question is, in this alternate universe where you can have isolated North or South poles, which of Maxwell's equations change? Because in that case, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. In our world, ∇·B = 0 because there are no magnetic monopoles,
