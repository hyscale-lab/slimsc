Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized, right? So the state vector's components should have a magnitude squared that sums to 1. Let me check that real quick.

So, the state vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The sum of the squares would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, that's 6. So the state isn't normalized. Hmm, I think I need to normalize it first. Because without normalization, the probabilities won't add up to 1. So, maybe I should divide each component by sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector (let's call it |Ïˆ>) would be [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Alright, moving on. The operators for observables P and Q are given. Let me look at each operator.

First, operator P's matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, that looks familiar. It seems symmetric, but I'm not sure. Let me write it out:

P =
[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

And operator Q is a diagonal matrix. Its first row is [1,0,0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-1]. So Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is, when we measure P first, then Q, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, wait. No, the measurements are in the order: first P, then Q. So the process is: measure P, get outcome 0, then measure Q on the resulting state, and get -1. Or is it the other way around? No, the question says measuring Q after P, so after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then on this new state, we measure Q and want the probability of getting -1.

Alternatively, maybe it's the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q, in sequence.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So, that would be the joint probability: first P measured to be 0, then Q measured to be -1.

So, perhaps I should calculate the probability of measuring P=0 first, and then, given that, the probability of measuring Q=-1.

But wait, the way measurement works is
