Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis, which probably means the radiation pattern has some angular dependence based on that symmetry.

It oscillates, so it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ. I remember that in electromagnetism, especially with dipole radiation, the power radiated depends on the angle. For a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum perpendicular to the dipole axis, which is along the z here. So the intensity would be maximum when θ is 90 degrees, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

The question is about the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and what form f takes in terms of λ.

Wait, the maximum power is A. So the function f(λ, θ) must be such that when you integrate it over all solid angles, you get the total power. But the question is about the fraction at θ=30°, so f evaluated at that angle, multiplied by the differential solid angle, compared to the maximum A.

Let me think about the radiation from a dipole. I recall that the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to (d²p/dt²)², where p is the dipole moment. But for the angular part, the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the intensity formula: I is proportional to (sinθ)^2, but wait, that's for the far field, right? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, the intensity pattern for a dipole radiator is maximum at θ=90 degrees, and falls off as cosθ for θ near 0 and 180. Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The electric field for a dipole in the far field is proportional to (1/r) * sinθ * exp(i(kr - ωt)), something like that. The intensity is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the electric field, so something like sin²θ. Wait, but wait, that's for the E-field. The Poynting
