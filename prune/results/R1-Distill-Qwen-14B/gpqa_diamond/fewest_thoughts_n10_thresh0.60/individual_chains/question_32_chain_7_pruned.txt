Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking what energy the RHIC should have so that the nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, Li is lithium, right? So lithium-6, I think, because Li usually has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the atomic number is 3 and mass number is 6.

Wait, but waitâ€”nucleus X has 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) = 6. So it's a lithium-6 nucleus.

Now, the goal is to find the energy of the RHIC. I remember that in particle accelerators, the energy given to the particles is their kinetic energy. Oh wait, but sometimes it's the total energy. Wait, what's the context here. The problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So I think RHIC accelerates the nucleus to a certain kinetic energy, but I need to clarify whether the problem is asking for total energy or kinetic energy.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The question says "the energy of the RHIC", which usually refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the particles. But sometimes accelerators are described by their maximum kinetic energy. Hmm. Well, I'll proceed, but I'll have to make sure which one it is.

So, the nucleus is moving at v
