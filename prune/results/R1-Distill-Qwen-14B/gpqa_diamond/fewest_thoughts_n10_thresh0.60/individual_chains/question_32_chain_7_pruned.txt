Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so the nucleus in question here is likely a heavy one. Wait, the nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, Li is lithium. So Li-6 maybe, because lithium typically has 3 neutrons when it's Li-6 (since Li has atomic number 3, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6).

Wait, but let me think. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons, so X would be Li-6. So the nucleus is Li-6. Okay, so I need to find the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light.

I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times mc squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I'll need to calculate gamma first.

Let me jot down the formula. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in.

Calculating v squared over c squared: (0.96c)^2 / c^2 is (0.96)^2, which is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, what's sqrt(0.0784)? Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let's calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Because 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, and 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.9
