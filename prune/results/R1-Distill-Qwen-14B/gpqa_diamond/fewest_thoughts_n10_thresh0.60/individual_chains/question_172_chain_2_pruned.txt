Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, the problem also states that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which probably means I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula I remember is something like the ratio of populations (n_upper and n_lower) is equal to the Boltzmann factor multiplied by some constants. The exact formula is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is ΔE = E_i - E_j. Let's say star_1 has more excited atoms, so n_1 is higher than n_2 for the same energy level. Wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So for a specific energy level, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is double that in star_2.

Wait, but the energy difference is the same for both stars because it's between the same two levels. So the ratio of populations would depend on the temperatures of the stars. Let me think: for each star, the population ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation.

So for star_1, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE / (k T1) ). Similarly, for star_2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE / (k T2) ).

But wait, the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So I think that means n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower ). Because the excitation is twice as much in star_1. Or maybe n1_upper is twice n2_upper? Or maybe it's the ratio of the populations. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level". So I think it's the number of atoms in that higher energy level. So n1_upper = 2 * n2_upper.

But wait, considering that in each star, the ratio of n_upper to n_lower is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, n1_upper/n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly, n2_upper/n2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But if n1_upper = 2 * n2_upper, then:

n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the probabilities or the excitation is given. Let me think again. The question states that the excitation is twice as much
