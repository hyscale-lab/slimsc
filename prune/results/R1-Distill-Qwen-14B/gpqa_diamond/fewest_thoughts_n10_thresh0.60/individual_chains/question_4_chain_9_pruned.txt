Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles, so you can't get a single isolated North or South. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields behave. The four equations are pretty fundamental. Let me think about each one. 

The first equation is Gauss's Law for electric fields: it says that the divergence of E is proportional to the charge density. That's about electric fields and charges, right? So if the problem is about magnetic poles, maybe this equation doesn't change because it's about electric fields and charges only. So probably not related to this scenario.

The second equation is Gauss's Law for magnetism. Oh wait, that's the one that says the divergence of B is zero. Because in our universe, there are no isolated magnetic monopoles—so the magnetic field lines are always continuous, forming closed loops. The equation is ∇·B = 0. If in this parallel universe, there are isolated North and South poles, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Because each monopole would act like a source or sink for the magnetic field. So Gauss's Law for magnetism would change. So the second equation would be different.

The third equation is Faraday's Law of Induction. It deals with the curl of E being equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic field. So it's about how changing magnetic fields create circulating electric fields. I don't think the existence of magnetic monopoles would change this, because this equation is more about the interaction between changing B fields and E fields. Unless... wait, if there are magnetic charges, maybe Faraday's Law gets modified. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think that if magnetic monopoles exist, then there would be a similar term for the time derivative of E, but wait, no. Wait, in standard Maxwell's equations, the divergence of B is zero, but if B can have sources and sinks (monopoles), then another equation would come into play. Oh, right, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, there's an additional term in the equation for the divergence of B and perhaps another equation for the curl of E. Or wait, maybe the curl of B would change?

Wait, the four equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (Gauss's Law for E)
2. ∇·B = 0 (Gauss's Law for B)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's Law)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t (Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition)

So in our universe, equation 2 is ∇·B = 0. In a universe with monopoles, equation 2 would become ∇·B = μ_m ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So equation 2 changes.

What about Ampère's Law, equation 4? That equation deals with the curl of B.
