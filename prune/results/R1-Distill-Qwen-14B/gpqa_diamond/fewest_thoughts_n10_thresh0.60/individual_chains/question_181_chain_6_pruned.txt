Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, especially in different parts of the core. The pp chain is a major one, and I think it has different branches.

Wait, the question says the pp-III branch stops. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I remember that the pp chain is the proton-proton chain, which converts hydrogen into helium. There are different branches, like the main one (pp-I), and some others. Oh right, the pp-III branch is one of the side reactions, maybe involving higher energy states or something.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino production? Neutrinos are produced in the Sun primarily through the decay of beryllium-7, which comes from the pp chain. Oh wait, no, I think neutrinos are mainly from the decay of beryllium-7 in the CNO cycle or... Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The dominant solar neutrinos come from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I branch, producing positrons and neutrinos. Or wait, the pp-I branch produces two protons into a helium-4, right? And in the process, a positron and a neutrino are emitted.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. So the pp chain steps: two protons fuse with each other, but they can't directly form helium-4 because of Coulomb repulsion. So they form deuterium, then another proton adds, making tritium, which then decays into helium-3 plus a positron and a neutrino. Oh wait, that's the main pp-I branch.

Then there are other branches. Like, sometimes the deuterium might capture another proton to form helium-3 (pp-II?), and the pp-III branch may involve higher energy reactions or maybe something else. Oh, right, the pp-III branch might involve the formation of boron or something. But I'm not 100% sure.

But the question is about the neutrino flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So when the pp-III branch stops, how does that affect these fluxes?

I think that different branches of the pp chain emit neutrinos with
