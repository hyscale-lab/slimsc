Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if the pp-III reactions stopped, that means the neutrinos produced by those reactions wouldn't reach us yet. So for those 8.5 minutes, the neutrinos from the pp-III process wouldn't be here, but the other processes would continue as usual.

I remember that the Sun's energy production has several branches in the proton-proton chain. The main branches are the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing a significant number of high-energy neutrinos, especially the 7 Be neutrinos and maybe others. Oh wait, actually, the pp-III branch produces the 7 Be neutrinos, which are a big part of the solar neutrino flux. 

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those neutrinos would suddenly halt. But what about the other branches? The question says all other reactions remain as they were, so pp-I and pp-II would continue. Now, I need to figure out the neutrino flux from these different bands.

The bands in question are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band
