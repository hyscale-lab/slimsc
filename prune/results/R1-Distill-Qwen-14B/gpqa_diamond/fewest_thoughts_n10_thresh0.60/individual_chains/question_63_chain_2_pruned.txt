Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Hmm, wait, what's the fundamental state in this context? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state for a given rotational and vibrational level. But I think the problem is considering the transition where both rotation and vibration change. Or maybe it's just about the vibrational transition because the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model. Oh wait, the non-rigid rotor model is an extension of the rigid rotor, considering bond length changes due to vibration.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. So the fundamental state would be the state with the lowest possible energy, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. But I'm a bit confused about whether the question is about a transition in rotation or vibration or both.

The question says the molecule absorbs a photon and switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think this is about the first excited state. But in quantum mechanics, transitions can involve changes in both rotational and vibrational energy levels. But the photon's energy must match the difference between these states.

Wait, photons have energy E = hf, and their momentum p is related to energy as p = E/c, since E = pc for light. So if I
