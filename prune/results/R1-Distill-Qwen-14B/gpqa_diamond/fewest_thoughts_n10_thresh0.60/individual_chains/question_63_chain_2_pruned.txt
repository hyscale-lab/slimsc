Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the momentum of a photon that causes a transition to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is in its fundamental state, meaning the lowest energy state. I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, transitions can involve either rotational, vibrational, or both changes. But wait, the problem specifies the quantum rotation-vibration model, so maybe it's considering both.

Wait, the model is the non-rigid rotor model, which implies that the bond isn't perfectly rigid. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy transitions. Oh right, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and the vibrational energy levels are quantized as well. But for a non-rigid rotor, the bond length can change, so the moment of inertia isn't constant. But for the purposes of this problem, maybe I can treat it as a rigid rotor first since the bond length is given.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the initial state is v=0, J=0.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, what's the next state? Let me think: in vibrational transitions, the fundamental transition is from v=0 to v=1. But in rotational transitions, the change in J is ±1, so from J=0 to J=1. But since it's a diatomic, there's also the consideration of whether both can change at the same time.

Wait, but the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So I think that's the next higher energy state, which would be the next available state after the fundamental. So, what's the order of energies? Vibrational energy levels are much higher than rotational. So the first transition would be a vibrational one, or a rotational one?

Wait, no. The rotational energy levels are lower than the vibrational. Oh, no, wait: the vibrational energy levels have a spacing of h ν, and the rotational are ΔE = B (h c) (J(J+1)), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational spacing is much larger. So the lowest energy state is v=0
