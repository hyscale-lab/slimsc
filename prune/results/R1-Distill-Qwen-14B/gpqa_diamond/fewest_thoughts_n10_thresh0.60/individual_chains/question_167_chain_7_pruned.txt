Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. And N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, the first thing I need to figure out is what a Gaussian state is. Oh right, Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions, like coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. Non-Gaussian states are those that don't have Gaussian Wigner functions, which is the case here because the Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, which makes it non-Gaussian.

The non-Gaussianity is being measured using the relative entropy between the state's density matrix and a reference Gaussian state. The formula given is delta_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho - rho ln tau). But here, the formula is given as the difference of the von Neumann entropies of rho and tau. So it's like delta_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy.

So the question is to compute this delta_b for the given state. But how?

I remember that for pure states, the von Neumann entropy S is zero because rho is a pure state, so trace(rho ln rho) is zero. But wait, the given state |psi> is a pure state, right? Because it's a normalized superposition. So rho would be |psi><psi|, which is pure, so S(rho) is zero.

Wait, but what's the reference state? It's a Gaussian state. So tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps the closest Gaussian to rho? Or is it some specific Gaussian state, like a coherent state?

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but maybe for this problem, the
