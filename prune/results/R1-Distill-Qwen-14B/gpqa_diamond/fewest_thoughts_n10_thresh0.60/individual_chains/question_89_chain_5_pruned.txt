Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, first, it's heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'll probably need to figure out what each product is.

First, the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, I think. 1,3-Dibromo would have Br atoms on two of the positions. Heating with KOH as a base—probably an elimination reaction. Since KOH is a strong base, it's likely a dehydrohalogenation, leading to an elimination product, which would be an alkene.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, would lose two HBr molecules and form an alkene. So it would form 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe 1,3-diene? So product 1 is probably an adamantane derivative with a double bond.

The 1H NMR of product 1 is given: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, IR at 1720 is usually a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. Wait, but product 1 is formed from elimination of HBr, which would make a diene. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe product 1 isn't from elimination. Maybe it's a substitution? But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, so with KOH, perhaps it's undergoing a substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, more
