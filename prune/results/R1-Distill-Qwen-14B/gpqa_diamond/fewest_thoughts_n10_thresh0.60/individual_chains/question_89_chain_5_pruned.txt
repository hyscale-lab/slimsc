Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The first part is about the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene. Since KOH is in excess and heat is applied, it's probably an E2 mechanism. So the product here would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, no, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine on adjacent carbons? Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1 and 3 positions... Hmm, actually, I think 1 and 3 positions aren't adjacent. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Adamantane is a cage structure. Each bridgehead is connected to two others. So 1 and 3 would be on adjacent bridgeheads. So when two bromines are on adjacent bridgeheads, and KOH is used, elimination would form a double bond between those bridgeheads. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, wait, elimination of HBr would produce a double bond. So the initial product is probably the diene, product 1.

Looking at the NMR spectrum of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let me think about this. The 4.79 ppm is a doublet, maybe from an -OH group, but wait, KOH is a strong base. Wait, in the reaction, we have elimination, so maybe it's forming a diene. But wait, the 1H NMR shows a triplet or something else. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol. No, wait, if KOH is used, it's more likely elimination to form a diene, but in this case, wait, no. Wait, the IR spectrum has an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak. So the product must have a carbonyl group. Hmm, so maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. If it's a substitution, but that's less likely unless it's a SN2 mechanism, but with two bromines adjacent, maybe it's an example of a dieckmann-type elimination? Wait, no, that's for esters. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that would form a double bond. But if KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a more involved mechanism. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is around where esters, ketones, or maybe aldehydes appear. So maybe product
