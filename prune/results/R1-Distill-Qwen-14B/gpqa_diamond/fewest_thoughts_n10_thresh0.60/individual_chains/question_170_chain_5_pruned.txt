Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, Sy. Hmm, I remember that the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured Sy many times on identically prepared systems.

Wait, what's the spin state again? Oh right, the state is given as a vector with components (3i, 4). So that's like a two-component vector. I think in quantum mechanics, spin states are often represented as two-component spinors.

The operator for Sy is given as sigma_y, which is the Pauli matrix. The sigma_y matrix is:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

But wait, spin operators in quantum mechanics are usually (hbar/2) times the Pauli matrices. Oh right, because the eigenvalues for spin-1/2 systems are ±hbar/2. So the actual spin operator S_y should be (ħ/2) * sigma_y. So the operator is (ħ/2) times the matrix I was given.

So the expectation value of S_y is the expectation value of this operator. The formula for the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, then multiplied by the state vector. Or wait, no, actually, it's ψ† S ψ, where ψ is the state vector.

Wait, no, I think I got that right. Let me make sure. The state vector
