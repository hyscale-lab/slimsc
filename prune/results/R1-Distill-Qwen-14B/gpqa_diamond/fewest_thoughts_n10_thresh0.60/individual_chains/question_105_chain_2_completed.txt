Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots will cause brightness variations that look like those from an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same light curve variation amplitude as these spots?

Wait, the key point is to find R_planet / R_star such that the planet's transit would cause the same change in brightness as the spotted star's modulation.

I remember that the brightness variation from a planet transit is when the planet blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness (delta F) is given by the area of the planet's disk over the area of the star's disk. Because flux is proportional to area.

But wait, the star's brightness variation here isn't just due to the blocked light, right? Because the spots are cooler. So when the spots rotate into and out of view, the total brightness of the star changes because the spots are darker.

Wait, no. Wait a second. The problem says that the star's brightness variations are due to rotational modulation of the spots. So when the spot side is facing us, more of the star's surface is cooler, so the total flux is less. The maximum brightness is when the spot hemisphere is away, so we see the hotter (unspotted) side.

Wait, no, wait. The star is a normal star with some spots. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the total flux is lower. The variation in brightness would come from how much of the star's surface is covered by spots. But the problem says that the spots have a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. So maybe the spots cover 20% of the visible hemisphere when they're facing us.

So the star's brightness variation would be due to the spots rotating in and out of view. So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted side (with no spots) is facing us, and the minimum is when the spotted side is facing us.

Wait, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into view and then go out of view, causing a dip in brightness each time a spot comes into view.

But the problem states that the situation resembles an exoplanet's transit. So the dip in brightness should be similar to that caused by a planet transiting the star.

So the question is, what would be the planetary radius that would cause the same dip in brightness as the spotted star's modulation.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed brightness variation is periodic due to rotation. So the star's brightness would dip when the spotted side is facing us, but the dip's amplitude would depend on how much of the star's surface is covered by cooler spots.

But wait, I'm a little confused. Let's think again.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun, Rstar = R_sun.

The spots cover one hemisphere, 20% filling factor. So for the hemisphere facing us when the spot is on that side, 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. Let me think about the area of the star's surface.

So the area of the entire star is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So one hemisphere is 2πR², and the spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So the area of the spots is 0.4πR².

Wait, but when the star rotates, we see different parts of the surface. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 0.4πR² of the star's surface that's visible. But wait, the star's total visible area is 2πR² (the hemisphere facing us). So the fraction of the star's visible surface that is spots depends on whether the spots are on the visible hemisphere.

Wait, maybe the spots are 20% of the entire star's surface? No, the problem says 20% of one hemisphere. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says: "the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Wait, I think the filling factor is the fraction of the area covered by spots on the hemisphere. So on the hemisphere that's facing us, 20% is spots.

So when the star rotates and the other hemisphere comes into view, that hemisphere (which is spot-free) would not have spots. So the spots are only on one side.

Wait, no, perhaps the star's entire surface is covered with spots, but only in one hemisphere? No, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the spots are only on one hemisphere, and they cover 20% of that hemisphere.

So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So the area of the spots visible is 0.2 * (area of one hemisphere) = 0.2 * 2πR²/2 = 0.2 * π R². Wait, no. Wait, the area of one hemisphere is 2πR² (because the surface area of a sphere is 4πR²; a hemisphere is half, so 2πR²). So the area of spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the problem says the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K.

So the flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is facing us would be less than when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us.

But in reality, the star is rotating, so the spots on the surface will come into and out of view. But the problem says that the situation can "closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet" in terms of the photometric time series. So the observed brightness variation is similar to that of a planet causing a dip when it transits.

Wait, but how does that work? Because when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip. The dip's depth is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is area of planet over area of star.

But in the case of the star with spots, the dip in brightness would be due to the spots being in view. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is lower.

Wait, but the star isn't just a uniform blackbody. The spots are cooler. So the total flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is visible is the flux from the unspotted parts plus the flux from the spots.

But how does that compare to when the unspotted hemisphere is visible?

So when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotted = F_total = F_sun, which is the flux from a star with Teff 6000 K.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux F_spotted = F_total * (1 - 0.2) + F_spots.

Wait, no. Let's model it properly.

The total flux from the star is the sum of flux from the unspotted regions and the spots.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area of the spots is 0.4 π R², as calculated before. Each spot has a temperature of 5000 K.

The flux from the spots is the area of the spots multiplied by the flux per unit area at 5000 K.

The flux from the rest of the hemisphere (the unspotted part) is (2π R² - 0.4 π R²) * flux per unit area at 6000 K.

Wait, but wait. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. So the flux from the entire star, without spots, would be F_total = 4π R² * sigma * T_eff^4.

Wait, but when a part of the star has a different temperature, the flux changes. So when the star's surface has spots, the total flux would be less.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_spotted = (Area_unspotted * sigma T_unspotted^4) + (Area_spotted * sigma T_spotted^4).

Similarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotted = (2π R²) * sigma T_unspotted^4.

Wait, but isn't the star's overall flux when both hemispheres are considered? No, because the star is a sphere, and we're looking at one hemisphere at a time. So the other hemisphere is not visible, so the flux depends on which hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the star's total flux without spots would be 4π R² * sigma Teff^4. When there are spots, the flux from the spots is less.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as follows:

The star's flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is F1. The flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us is F2.

The difference between F2 and F1 would be the amplitude of the brightness variation.

Because when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the total flux is less, leading to a dip.

So the variation in flux would be F2 - F1.

Wait, but when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F1 = (Area_unspotted * sigma T_eff^4) + (Area_spotted * sigma T_spot^4).

The area_unspotted is the area of the hemisphere not covered by spots, so 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

The area_spotted is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So F1 = (1.6 π R²) * sigma (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * sigma (5000)^4.

F2 is when the other hemisphere is visible, which is completely unspotted. So F2 = 2π R² * sigma (6000)^4.

Wait, that's not correct. Because the other hemisphere may not have any spots. So when the star's unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere contributes normally, so F2 = 2π R² * sigma (6000)^4.

But the star's other hemisphere (the one with spots) is not visible, so when that's the case, F1 is when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So the brightness variation is between F2 and F1. The amplitude is (F2 - F1)/F2.

Wait, but let me compute F1 and F2.

Compute F1 = (1.6 π R²) * sigma (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * sigma (5000)^4.

Factor out sigma π R²:

F1 = sigma π R² [1.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4 ].

F2 = sigma π R² [ 2*(6000)^4 ].

So the relative change is (F2 - F1)/F2.

Compute (F2 - F1) = sigma π R² [2*(6000^4) - 1.6*(6000^4) - 0.4*(5000^4) ]

= sigma π R² [0.4*(6000^4) - 0.4*(5000^4) ]

= 0.4 sigma π R² [ (6000^4 - 5000^4) ]

So (F2 - F1)/F2 = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [2*(6000^4)].

Simplify:

= [0.4 (6^4 -5^4) ] / (2 *6^4 )

Let me compute 6^4 and 5^4.

6^4 = 1296.

5^4 = 625.

So 6^4 -5^4 = 1296 -625 = 671.

So putting numbers in:

0.4 * 671 / (2 * 1296) )

Compute numerator: 0.4 *671 = 268.4.

Denominator: 2 * 1296 = 2592.

So 268.4 / 2592 ≈ 0.1035.

So about 10.35% dip.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the observed variations can resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as if a planet were transiting.

So the dip from the planet is when the planet blocks part of the star's light. The dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So the dip amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035, approximately.

Wait, but wait! The problem says "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". Wait, wait, what? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that the star is covered by spots, but we need to find the planet's radius that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots. So if the star had no spots, what planet radius would cause the same dip as the spots do.

Wait, no. Let me re-read the question.

Question: To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e., Rpl/Rstar)?

So, the star's light curve's amplitude variation due to spots is A. So the planet's transit would cause a variation of A. So we need to find Rpl where (Rpl/Rstar)^2 equals the amplitude A.

Wait, in the problem, the star with spots has a certain amplitude. We're to find the planet radius that would produce the same amplitude if the star were not spotted. So the star's light curve amplitude due to the spots is the same as what a planet would cause.

Wait, but the way I computed earlier, the dip from the spots was about 10.35%, so about 0.1035. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So approximately 0.32, which is option D, ~0.32.

Wait, but let me check my calculation again.

Wait, in the calculation, I found the dip as (F2 - F1)/F2 ≈ 0.1035, so about 10.35% dip.

So the dip is 10% of the star's flux.

So the planet must cause the same dip when it transits.

The dip caused by a planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So setting (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035).

Let me compute sqrt(0.1035):

0.3^2 = 0.09.

0.32^2 = 0.1024.

0.321^2 = about 0.1030 (since 0.32^2=0.1024, 0.321^2= (0.32 +0.001)^2 = 0.32^2 + 2*0.32*0.001 + 0.001^2 = 0.1024 + 0.00064 + 0.000001= 0.103041.

So 0.321^2 = ~0.103.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.321, so about 0.32.

So the answer would be option D: ~0.32.

Wait, but wait: no, that can't be right. Because a planet with 32% the radius of the star would be a very large planet, larger than Jupiter. Jupiter's radius is about 0.1 R_sun, I think. Wait, no, Jupiter's radius is about 1/10th of the Sun's radius. So a planet of 0.32 R_sun would be way bigger than any known planet. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I got the dip the wrong way around. Let me think again.

Wait, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F1. When the unspotted is visible, it's F2.

Wait, but the flux should be higher when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, because more of the hotter parts are visible. So F2 > F1. So the dip is F2 - F1.

Wait, but the dip in brightness is (F2 - F1)/F2, which is the change relative to F2.

But wait, when the planet transits, the dip is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2). Because the planet blocks part of the star's light.

So that dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But in the case of the spots, the dip is (F2 - F1)/F2 ≈ 10.35%.

So the planet's dip would have to be 0.1035.

Thus Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.321.

So that's option D.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So option D is ~0.32.

Hmm, but let me think again about the calculation.

Wait, the problem says that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So the area of the spots on that hemisphere is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Each hemisphere has area 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F1 = (unspotted area) * sigma T_eff^4 + (spotted area) * sigma T_spot^4.

Unspotted area is 2π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

So F1 = 1.6 π R² sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma (5000)^4.

F2 is when the other hemisphere is visible, which is unspotted, so F2 = 2 π R² sigma (6000)^4.

So the difference is F2 - F1 = [2 π R² sigma (6000)^4] - [1.6 π R² sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma (5000)^4 ]

= [0.4 π R² sigma (6000^4) - 0.4 π R² sigma (5000^4) ]

= 0.4 π R² sigma [6000^4 -5000^4 ]

So the relative change is (F2 - F1)/F2 = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [2 (6000^4) ]

Compute 6000^4 = 6^4 *10^12 = 1296 *1e12.

5000^4 = 5^4 *1e12 = 625 *1e12.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 671e12.

So the numerator becomes 0.4 * 671e12.

Denominator is 2 * 1296e12.

So (0.4 *671) / (2 * 1296) = (268.4) / (2592) ≈ 0.1035, which is 10.35%.

So the dip is 10.35% of the star's flux.

A planet would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F_total.

Wait, but wait, the planet's dip is when it blocks part of the star, so the dip is the area blocked (planet area) over the star's area.

So dip = (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.321.

So that's option D.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I should have considered the flux from the spots as a percentage of the total. Because the star's flux without spots is F_total =4 π R² sigma T_eff^4.

Wait, no, because the star's flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F1, and when the other (unspotted) is visible, it's F2.

The dip is F2 - F1.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the dip as (F2 - F1)/F_total, not relative to F2.

Wait, because F_total is the star's flux without any spots. So when the star has no spots, F is F_total. But when it has spots, F varies between F1 and F2.

Wait, but in this problem, the star has spots, and we're comparing the brightness variation to a planet. So perhaps we should compute the dip relative to F_total.

Wait, let me think. The actual dip when the star is spotted is (F2 - F1), but the planet's dip would be (F_planet) = F_total * (Rp^2/Rstar^2).

Wait, but the star's brightness variation due to spots is (F2 - F1) compared to F1. Or compared to F2?

Wait, the star's brightness when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is F2, which is higher than F1 (spotted hemisphere). So the maximum brightness is F2, the minimum is F1.

The amplitude of the variation is F2 - F1, and the relative variation is (F2 - F1)/F2.

But a planet's transit causes a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F_total.

Wait, but wait, the star's brightness without spots is F_total = 4 π R² sigma Teff^4.

When the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's surface, so the observed flux is F_total - (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) F_total.

So the dip is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) F_total.

The amplitude (relative to F_total) is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but in the star with spots, the variation is from F1 to F2. So the amplitude is (F2 - F1)/F2.

But since the star's F_total without spots is (4 π R² sigma (6000)^4 ), but when the star has spots, F1 and F2 are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem states that the observed variation is due to spots, and we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same observed dip.

So the amplitude of the dip caused by the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

The amplitude of the dip caused by the spots is (F2 - F1)/F2, which we calculated as approximately 0.1035.

So setting (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.321.

So the answer would be D, ~0.32.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, the star's flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is F2 = 2 π R² sigma (6000)^4.

The star's flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F1 = (1.6 π R²) sigma (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) sigma (5000)^4.

So the dip is F2 - F1 = [2 π R² sigma (6000)^4 ] - [1.6 π R² sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma (5000)^4 ]

= 0.4 π R² sigma (6000^4) - 0.4 π R² sigma (5000^4 )

= 0.4 π R² sigma [6000^4 -5000^4 ]

The relative dip is (F2 - F1)/F2 = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / (2 (6000^4 )) )

Which, as before, is 0.1035.

So yes, the planet's dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

So Rp/Rstar is sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.321.

So the answer is D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the total flux is reduced due to the cooler spots.
   - The flux from the star depends on the visible hemisphere:
     - **Unspotted hemisphere**: \( F_2 = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
     - **Spotted hemisphere**: \( F_1 = (1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4) + (0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4) \), where the unspotted area is \( 80\% \) of the hemisphere and the spotted area is \( 20\% \).

3. **Amplitude of Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness variation amplitude is the relative change in flux:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{F_2 - F_1}{F_2}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \):
     \[
     F_2 - F_1 = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 - \left[(1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4) + (0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4)\right].
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     F_2 - F_1 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 - 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4.
     \]
     Factoring out \( 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \):
     \[
     F_2 - F_1 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spots}}^4).
     \]
   - The relative amplitude becomes:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{F_2 - F_1}{F_2} = \frac{0.4 (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spots}}^4)}{2 T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
     \]

4. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}, \, T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Compute \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 = 6000^4 = 1296 \times 10^{12} \, \text{K}^4 \), \( T_{\text{spots}}^4 = 5000^4 = 625 \times 10^{12} \, \text{K}^4 \).
   - \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spots}}^4 = 1296 \times 10^{12} - 625 \times 10^{12} = 671 \times 10^{12} \, \text{K}^4 \).
   - Substituting:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \times 671 \times 10^{12}}{2 \times 1296 \times 10^{12}} = \frac{268.4}{2592} \approx 0.1035.
     \]
   - The amplitude is approximately \( 10.35\% \).

5. **Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2.
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of \( 10.35\% \), set:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1035.
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.321.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
