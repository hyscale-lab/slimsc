Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, classical mechanics doesn't apply anymore, so I definitely need to use special relativity here.

Wait, the question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Right, so the relative speed calculation is probably based on relativistic velocity addition because they're moving at significant fractions of c. And the total energy would involve their relativistic masses, right?

Starting with the relative speed. Let me recall the formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Oh yeah, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/cÂ²). Wait, wait, no, wait. Because both are moving in the same direction, so v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.5c, what's the speed of the other one?

Wait, no. Wait, the relative speed depends on the frame. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B's speed is v_rel =
