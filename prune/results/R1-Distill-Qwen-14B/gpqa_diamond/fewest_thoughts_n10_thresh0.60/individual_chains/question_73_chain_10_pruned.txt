Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. Let me recall the formula. I think it's v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(cÂ²)). Wait, but wait, that's when both are moving in the same direction, right? So since both are in the positive x, their velocities are in the same direction.

So astronaut A is 2m moving at 0.6c, astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, no, no, the masses might not matter for the relative speed calculation. Because the relative speed formula depends only on their velocities, not their masses. Oh wait, no, mass might be involved elsewhere, but for the relative speed calculation between them, it's just about their velocities.

So let's compute the relative speed. Let
