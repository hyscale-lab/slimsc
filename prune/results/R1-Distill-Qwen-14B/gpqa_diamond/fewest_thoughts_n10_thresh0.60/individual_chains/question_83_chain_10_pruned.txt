Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so their reaction should form acetate ions and water.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, okay, let's break it down. First, what happens when we dilute the acetic acid? Diluting it will decrease the concentration, which should affect how much we need to titrate and the pH at various points.

So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. The initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M. When diluted by half (since 20 + 20 = 40), the new concentration should be 0.025 M. Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when the amount of solute is constant. So, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating, each mole of NaOH will
