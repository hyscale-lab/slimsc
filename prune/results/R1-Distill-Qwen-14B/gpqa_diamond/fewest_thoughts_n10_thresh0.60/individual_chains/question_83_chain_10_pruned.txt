Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should form acetate ions and water. But wait, let me make sure.

The question gives me some specific volumes and concentrations. So initially, there's 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. I think I need to find the new concentration after dilution.

Oh right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The formula is M1V1 = M2V2. Wait, no, M1 is initial molarity, V1 is initial volume, then M2 is new molarity, V2 is new volume. So here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. V2 is 0.04 L. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04. Let me calculate that: 0.001 divided by 0.04 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, okay.

First, what's the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have reacted with the NaOH. So I need to find out how much NaOH is needed to reach that point.

But wait, let's think about the moles. Moles of acetic acid initially is Molarity × Volume. The original volume before dilution was 20 cm³, but after dilution, the volume is 40 cm³. Wait no, wait. Wait, no. Let me clarify. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³, so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M, but the total moles are still 0.001 moles.

When titrated with NaOH, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So at equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH3COOH. So moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But wait, the problem is asking about two points: 25% titration and equivalence point. So for 25% titration, that's 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Let me tackle each part separately.

First, pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted. So the initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. Moles of
