Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react in a neutralization reaction. The general formula is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. Acetic acid donates a proton, and NaOH accepts it.

The problem starts with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. I need to calculate the concentration after dilution.

Wait, the dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (M1 * V1) / V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40. So M2 is 0.05 * 20 /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Let me calculate the moles initially. Acetic acid initial moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 mol. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001 mol. Oh wait, but then we add 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M as I had before, but the moles are still 0.001 mol. Because dilution doesn't change the number of moles, just the concentration.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal 0.001 mol.
