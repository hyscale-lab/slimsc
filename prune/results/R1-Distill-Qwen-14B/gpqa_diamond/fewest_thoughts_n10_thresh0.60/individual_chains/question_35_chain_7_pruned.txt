Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let's see what information I've been given.

First, the operator Ay is defined as c multiplied by the matrix S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right. And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So let me write down what S looks like.

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And Ay = c * S, so substituting c:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Hmm. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Eigenvalues are scalars a such that Ay φ = a φ. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me compute det(Ay - a I) = 0.

First, compute Ay - a I:

Ay - a I = [ [ (h/(4π)) * 0 - a, (h/(4π))*(-i) ],
             [ (h/(4π))*i, (h/(4π)) * 0 - a ] ]
Which simplifies to:

[ [-a, -i h/(4π) ],
  [i h/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [ [a, b], [c, d] ] is ad - bc.

So, determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ]

Wait, let me compute the product (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)).

First, (-i) * (i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i squared is -1. So (-i)(i) is 1. Then (h/(4π))^2 multiplied by that.

So the determinant becomes a² - [ (h/(4π))^2 * 1 ] = 0.

So, a² - (h^2)/(16 π²) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. Because when I multiplied (-i)*(i), I have (-i)(i) = (-1)(i^2) = (-1)(-1) = 1. Right, so I think that's correct. So, a squared is h squared over (4 π)^2, so a is plus or minus h/(4 π).

Wait, but h/(4 π) is the value of c. Oh wait, but the options mention different values. Let me look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary parts are +2πh or -2πh, and real parts +h/(4π) or -
