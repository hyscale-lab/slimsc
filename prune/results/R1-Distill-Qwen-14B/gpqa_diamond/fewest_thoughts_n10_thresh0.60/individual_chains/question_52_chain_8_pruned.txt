Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about how the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. Interesting.

So the setup is that there's a star with certain parameters. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. But wait, I think when spots are present, the unspotted areas are probably hotter, right? Because starspots are cooler regions, so they absorb less light and the surrounding areas might be brighter. But I'm not sure how that affects the overall photospheric temperature. Oh, wait, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So maybe the spots are making the star appear cooler overall because they're part of the surface we're measuring.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, and the transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…. Important because that's in the ultraviolet, I think. Oh wait, the Balmer series is in visible, but this is about Ti lines maybe. But for this problem, maybe the exact wavelength isn't as crucial as the fact that it's a specific transition, so the energy difference between the levels is determined by the wavelength.

Since the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I can use the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio DECREASES when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K). So the ratio n2/n1 is lower when T is lower. So when the star has spots, n2/n1 decreases, implying that the ratio without spots is higher.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So without spots, ratio R1 = n1/n2? Or R = n2/n1? Wait, no, the problem says the RATIO of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in level 1 and level 2. Oh, wait, when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So normally, without spots, it's higher. So the ratio without spots is higher, and with spots, it's lower.

Wait, the ratio is n_level1 / n_level2. So if the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that means with spots, n1/n2 is lower. So without spots, n
