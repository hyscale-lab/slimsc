Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. It has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, and LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) is assumed.

Hmm. So, the key points here are about the Saha equation and the Boltzmann equation, I think. Because the ratio of populations in energy levels depends on temperature. Oh right, the Saha equation deals with ionization and the Boltzmann equation with excitation.

Wait, but wait. The ratio of neutral atoms in two energy levels—so this is about the Boltzmann factor. The ratio would be (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So the ratio depends on the temperature.

But wait, in the star's photosphere, when there are spots, the effective temperature changes. But wait, how exactly? The star's overall Teff is lower when spots are present. But the spots themselves are cooler regions, right? So when 40% of the surface is spots, the overall observed Teff is 5500 K. But what about the temperature structure of the photosphere without and with spots?

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So, in the photosphere, the effective temperature is now lower. But how does this affect the ionization/excitation of atoms?

Wait, the Saha equation tells us about ionization states. But here, the question is about two energy levels of neutral Ti. So, it's about excitation rather than ionization. So the Boltzmann equation applies.

So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels (n1 and n2) for neutral Ti is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). 

But the question is about the ratio decreasing when there are spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So, the ratio in the spot case is lower than the no-spot case. So, the factor is (no spots ratio) / (spot ratio) = ?

But wait, why does the ratio change? Because the temperature T is different. When the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower. So T decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K.

Wait, but wait. Are we talking about the same region of the photosphere
