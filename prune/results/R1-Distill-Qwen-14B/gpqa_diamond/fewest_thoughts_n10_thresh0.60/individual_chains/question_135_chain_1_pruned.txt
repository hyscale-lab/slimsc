Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

The question is about a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure if I need to focus on that right now. The main thing is probably the mass of X and what particles it can decay into.

Wait, the Lagrangian's term is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, so this looks like a Yukawa interaction term. In Yukawa theory, the coupling is between a scalar (boson) and fermions. The term implies that the boson X can interact with fermions ψ_f. The possible decay products of X would be fermion-antifermion pairs.

So, the question is about kinematically allowed decays. That means the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. Because, in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent must be >= 2*m_child to allow the decay.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to list all possible fermion pairs that X can decay into, considering their masses.

First, what are the possible fermions? The options given include various quarks and leptons.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions (approximate):

- Up quark (u): ~1.5 MeV (so 0.0015 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~3 MeV (0.003 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.25 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy, since X is 6 GeV)
- Tau lepton (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.000511 GeV

So the pairs X can decay into are those where 2*m_fermion <= 6 GeV. Let's see which fermions satisfy m_fermion <= 3 GeV.

Looking at each:

- u: 0.0015 GeV → 2m=0.003 GeV → allowed
- d: 0.003 GeV → allowed
- s: 0.095 GeV → allowed
- c: 1.25 GeV → allowed
- b: 4.5 GeV → 2m=9 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed
- t: way too big
- τ: 1.78 GeV → 2m=3.56 GeV >6 GeV? Wait, wait. Wait, 1.78 GeV is the mass of the tau. So 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Oh wait, no—wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So 2*m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6. So X can decay into tau pairs.

Wait, but wait: 1.78 GeV * 2 is 3.56 GeV, which is below 6 GeV. So yes, X can decay into tau pairs. So tau is allowed.

What about the muon? Muon is about 0.1 GeV, so 2*0.1=0.2 GeV, allowed.

Electron is even lighter, 0.0005 GeV, so 2m is negligible.

But wait, in the options, I see e+ e- and mu+ mu- etc
