Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, and beta4=16. 

Wait, wait, stability constantsâ€”so these are the formation constants for the complexes, right? Each beta represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of the nth complex. So, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, the second is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, and so on up to the fourth complex with four thiocyanate ions.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be the di-substituted complex, so that's the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, right? So I need to find the fraction of Co that is in this form.

But wait, I'm not sure. The blue color, I think, is associated with the [Co(SCN)_6]^3- complex. Oh wait, no, wait! Wait, I remember that the hexa-aqua ion is pink, and when thiocyanate replaces the water ligands, the color changes. The [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, but wait, no, maybe it's the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} that's blue? Or perhaps the [Co(SCN)_6]^3- is blue? Hmm, I might be mixing this up. But the question says 'dithiocyanato' which is two SCN, so that's [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.

So, the problem is to find the fraction of Co that's in this dithiocyanato form.

The approach I think is to use the stability constants to find the distribution of each complex species. Since the solution has a certain concentration of Co^2+ and SCN^- ions, the distribution among the complexes depends on the stability constants and the concentrations.

But how to model that? I
