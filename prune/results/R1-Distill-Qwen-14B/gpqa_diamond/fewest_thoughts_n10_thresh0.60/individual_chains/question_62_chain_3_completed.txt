Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me parse that structure.

First, I'll draw the structure in my mind. The main chain is cyclohexane. At position 1, there's a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So, the substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(OH)CH2- attached to the cyclohexane ring. Additionally, there's a carbonyl group (aldehyde) at position 1 as well. Wait, no, actually, the aldehyde is part of the substituent as cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1: this substituent is a methyl group where the methyl is connected to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. And the entire substituent is also connected to an aldehyde group. Hmm, maybe I should look for the substituent structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the main ring is cyclohexane with a substituent that's a CH2 group, which is connected to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. And the same carbon (the CH2) is also connected to an aldehyde group. Wait, that can't be right because the aldehyde is a carbonyl group, so maybe the structure is something like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent on the same carbon as the aldehyde. Wait, maybe the structure is such that the aldehyde is at C1, and the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-O-cyclohexyl, but that doesn't fit. Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane ring (the main ring) is at position 1 attached to a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is -(CH2OH)cyclohexyl? Or is it -(CH2-cyclohexyl-OH)? Wait, no, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So methyl group (CH2-) where the substituent is attached, which is connected to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is CH2— where the CH2 is attached to cyclohexyl and OH groups. But since it's a methyl group, that's possible.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2-cyclohexyl-OH), but that would be a secondary alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's -(CH2OH) attached to cyclohexyl. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the synthesis steps.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond) attached. Structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a triple bond directly attached? Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached, i.e., cyclohexane attached to a propargyl group. So structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH.

Now, the target molecule has an aldehyde group. So perhaps we need to oxidize a certain position to an aldehyde. Let's think about the possible steps.

Looking at the options, the reagents in the options include things like NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, O3, etc. So these are typical reaction conditions for elimination, substitution, hydrogenation, oxidation, ozonolysis, etc.

Let me think about the possible steps to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target.

First, perhaps we need to add some substituents. Maybe introduce a hydroxyl group and a methyl or other group.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane can undergo some reactions. For example, in presence of NaNH2 and methyl chloride, that's a typical condition for deprotonation and alkylation. But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So perhaps this is an alkylation via a deprotonation. Where would the proton be abstracted?

In ethynylcyclohexane, the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. So the ethynyl group is a propargyl group attached to the cyclohexane. The protons on the triple bond are acidic because of the sp hybridization. So NaNH2 would deprotonate the triple bond, perhaps at the terminal position. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the resulting anion. So adding a methyl group to the triple bond.

Wait, but if we deprotonate the ethynyl group and then add methyl chloride, that would lead to CH2-C≡C-CH3. So the triple bond would become a propyl group. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. After deprotonation and alkylation with CH3Cl, the triple bond would become CH2-C≡C-CH3, so the substituent would become a propargyl methyl group? Wait, maybe not. Let me think: The starting material is CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives a CH2-C≡C-⁻. Alkylation with CH3Cl would add a methyl to the triple bond, making CH2-C≡C-CH3, which is a 1-propenyl group (but perhaps more accurately, it's a propyl group with triple bond). Wait, that might not be correct because when you add a methyl to a deprotonated triple bond, you could form a longer alkyne. But wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the alkylation is at the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, another possibility: the cyclohexane ring has a CH2 group attached to the triple bond. Deprotonating the CH2 group, which is less acidic than the triple bond, but perhaps in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, it could deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the triple bond. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane is deprotonated, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the propargyl group is more acidic, so the base deprotonates the triple bond's hydrogen, making a propargyl anion, which then reacts with methyl chloride to add a methyl group, making CH2-C≡C-CH3, so the substituent becomes a prop-1-ynyl group with a methyl. Wait, but that would make the substituent a longer chain, which might not directly lead to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a substitution reaction. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base but also a good nucleophile in some contexts. However, methyl chloride is a primary alkylating agent. So perhaps the base deprotonates the triple bond, which then attacks the methyl chloride in an alkylation. So the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3, but that's a propargyl methyl group. So the substituent is now a propargyl group with a methyl on the triple bond.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how that helps. Maybe the next step is hydrogenation. Option A has step 2 as H2/Pd. So hydrogenation of the triple bond would convert it into a single bond. If the substituent was CH2-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would give CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would give a butyl group, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is at the end. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. After alkylation with CH3Cl, perhaps the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then hydrogenation would convert the triple bond to a single bond, so CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent becomes a four-membered chain. But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached, so perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation is elsewhere. Maybe the base abstracts a proton from the cyclohexane ring, leading to a cyclohexyl anion, which then reacts with methyl chloride to alkylate the ring. But wait, methyl chloride in presence of a strong base like NaNH2 would likely lead to an alkylation at the ring. But cyclohexane is a saturated ring; deprotonating it would give a cyclohexyl anion, which can react with methyl chloride to form cyclohexane with a methyl substituent. So perhaps the first step is adding a methyl group to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the steps.

Option C's steps: 

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Hmm. Let's think about each step.

Initial compound: ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH).

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. As discussed, perhaps this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. If the triple bond's hydrogen is deprotonated, then methyl chloride would alkylate to form CH2-C≡C-CH3. So the substituent becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2 is H2 with Pd/CaCO3. That would hydrogenate the triple bond. So CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond usually gives a single bond, so the substituent becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a four-carbon substituent. But that doesn't seem to help with adding a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is different. Another possibility is that after alk. with methyl chloride, the triple bond is now part of a longer chain, perhaps allowing for some kind of ring-forming reaction.

Wait, maybe another approach. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which is in turn attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So perhaps we need to introduce a substituent that will later form a cyclohexyl group. Alternatively, maybe we need to perform an alkyne metathesis or some other reaction to form rings.

Another thought: perhaps the target molecule has an aldol-like structure. The aldehyde is at a certain position and the substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the starting material undergoes a series of reactions that add substituents and then oxidize certain positions.

Another approach: Let's think about the possible reactions each option's steps would perform.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liquid NH3; then O3/H2O; NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would probably add an ethyl group to the triple bond, making a longer alkyne. Then, Li in ammonia is a typical condition for elimination (like forming alkenes via dehydrohalogenation), but I'm not sure. Ozonolysis would break double bonds into carbonyl groups. Then NH4OH could work in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are about forming rings through elimination. Maybe the first step adds a substituent, the second step forms a ring via elimination, ozonolysis cleaves a double bond, and then something else happens.

Alternatively, maybe the first step adds a substituent, the second forms a ring, and then ozonolysis adds the hydroxyl groups.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the substituent on the cyclohexane ring is a CH2 group, which is connected to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(OH)CH2- attached to the ring, and the ring also has a carbonyl group (aldehyde) at that position.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the substituent is a CH2OH group attached to a cyclohexane ring that's also attached to the main ring. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal diol after some oxidation, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, and all of that is attached to the main cyclohexane ring, which also has an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis requires adding a methyl group to the ethynyl substituent, then hydrogenating it, and then performing some kind of oxidation or ring-forming reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the target is formed via a Grignard reaction or some kind of nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about possible functional group transformations.

Another idea: The triple bond (alkyne) can be converted into a ketone via ozonolysis, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group to the ethynyl substituent, then hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, leading to a longer chain. Then, perhaps an epoxidation or another reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to add a hydroxyl group. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, let's consider each option's steps.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Hmm, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base used in elimination reactions. H2SO4 and HgSO4 with H2O are conditions for oxidation, perhaps the Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones to carboxylic acids. Wait, but first, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which would cause elimination if possible. So, step 1 would alkylate the triple bond. Then, step 2 hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond. Then step 3, Ba(OH)2, which might cause elimination, but from where? If the substituent is now a longer alkyl chain, perhaps an E2 elimination would form a double bond. Then, step 4 is Jones oxidation, which would oxidize a secondary alcohol to ketone or primary to carboxylic acid.

But I'm not sure how this sequence would lead to the target.

Option B: Steps 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liquid NH3; 3. O3/H2O; 4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: alkylating the triple bond with ethyl chloride, making CH2-C≡C-Et. Then step 2: Li in NH3 is a strong base, which could cause elimination. Maybe dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. But wait, after alkylation, perhaps we have CH2-C≡C-Et, but wait that's a longer alkyne. Then, Li in NH3 (which is a condition for elimination) might convert the alkyne to an alkene via dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation leading to elimination.

Then step 3: ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. Then step 4: NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reductive workup after ozonolysis.

Hmm, perhaps after alkylation and elimination, we get a diene, which ozonolysis would break into two carbonyls. But I'm not sure how that leads to the aldehyde and the substituent with cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

So step 1: alkylate the triple bond with methyl chloride, making CH2-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: hydrogenate with H2 and Pd/CaCO3, which reduces the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3: ozonolysis with (CH3)2S as a workup. Wait, ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds. But if after hydrogenation, there's no double bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is under different conditions.

Wait, maybe after step 1, the substituent is CH2-C≡C-CH3. Step 2, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a four-carbon chain, which doesn't seem to help. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which wouldn't react. Step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base causing elimination, but without a suitable leaving group, perhaps not useful.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, methanol is a good methylating agent, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation with methanol, but methanol is a poor electrophile. Alternatively, perhaps this is a Birch reduction condition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation and then quench with methanol to add a methyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to form a Grignard-like reagent.

Wait, maybe the first step in option D is a deprotonation of the ethynyl group, then quench with methanol to add a methyl group, making the substituent CH2-C≡C-OCH3. But that's an ether, which I don't see in the target.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a sequence that introduces a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group in the correct positions.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which is in turn attached to the main cyclohexane. So perhaps during the synthesis, the ethynyl group is converted into a substituent that can form a ring.

Another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone via oxidation. Then, a Grignard reaction could add a cyclohexyl group. But how?

Wait, in the target, the substituent on the main cyclohexane ring is CH2 connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(OH)CH2- attached to the main ring. So maybe we need to introduce that group.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible reagents and what they do.

The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring, which is also attached to another cyclohexane. So perhaps we need to introduce a diol or a vicinal diol.

Wait, the steps in option C: after step 1 (alkylation), step 2 (hydrogenation), then ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if after step 2, there's a double bond introduced, then ozonolysis would break it.

Wait, perhaps in option C, step 2 is hydrogenation which reduces the triple bond to a single bond. Then, perhaps in a subsequent step, a double bond is formed elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I'm missing the right sequence. Let's try to think about the possible reactions.

Ethynylcyclohexane → Step 1: NaNH2 and CH3Cl → alkylates the triple bond to CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2: H2/Pd → reduces triple bond to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Now, the substituent is a four-carbon chain. Then, step 3: Ozonolysis would require a double bond, but hydrogenation would have removed it. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the triple bond is converted into a double bond. Wait, how? Maybe via elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group via alkylation, then step 2 is hydrogenation (maybe partial hydrogenation to a double bond), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach involves forming a ketone from the alkyne, then a Grignard reaction to add the cyclohexyl group, followed by oxidation to form the aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: the target has an aldehyde group. So perhaps, after some steps, we oxidize a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. But how?

Wait, another possibility is that the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via ozonolysis, but that would require introducing a double bond first.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylate the triple bond to get a longer chain.
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.
3. Introduce a double bond via elimination.
4. Ozonolysis to create carbonyl groups.
5. Further reactions to form the substituent.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let's think:

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylate to CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → reduce triple bond to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → Ozonolysis, but where's the double bond? Unless step 2 didn't completely hydrogenate, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation to a double bond. Wait, H2 with Pd could be hydrogenation, but perhaps under specific conditions it can hydrogenate only part of the triple bond, but that's unusual. Alternatively, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation to a trans double bond. Wait, hydrogenating an alkyne to an alkene would require specific conditions, like using a poisoned catalyst or Lindlar catalyst. But the option says H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is more for hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds.

Wait, maybe I'm not considering that the substituent after step 1 is CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2 hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, giving CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Now, the substituent is a four-carbon chain. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, but without a double bond, that won't do anything. So step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe Ba(OH)2 would cause elimination, but without a leaving group, that's hard.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Let me think about other possibilities.

Wait, the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring. So perhaps during the synthesis, we introduce an alcohol group and a cyclohexyl group.

Another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, then subjected to some kind of addition reaction.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane can be oxidized to a diketone. But how? Ozonolysis would break the triple bond into carbonyl groups. So perhaps step 3 in some options is ozonolysis. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the target's structure and work backwards.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, there's a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at C1. Attached to C1 is a CH2 group, which is connected to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is -(CH2-OH)(cyclohexyl)CH2- attached to the main ring, which also has the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which is in turn attached to the main cyclohexane ring. The main ring also has an aldehyde group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a secondary alcohol attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(OH)CH2- attached to the main ring.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves introducing a geminal diol, which can then undergo a reaction to form the cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a diol, which then undergoes some kind of cyclization to form the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, another thought: ethynylcyclohexane can undergo hydroboration-oxidation to form a ketone. Then, perhaps a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group, followed by oxidation to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then ozonolysis is done to form two carbonyl groups, which can then undergo further reactions.

Wait, another possibility: the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, which would form a ketone. Then, a nucleophilic addition could attach a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about each option's steps again.

Option D: NaNH2, methanol → maybe this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation with methanol, but that would add an OMe group, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me think about each step:

Step 1: Alkylation adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Hydrogenation reduces the triple bond to a single bond, giving CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ozonolysis, but with (CH3)2S as a reductive workup. Wait, ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but without a double bond, it won't work. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond elsewhere. How?

Wait, maybe after step 1, the substituent is CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then step 2: H2 with Pd could hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond. Wait, that's possible if the hydrogenation is partial, but Pd usually fully hydrogenates alkyne to alkane. Unless it's Lindlar's catalyst for hydrogenating to cis double bonds.

Wait, option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd on CaCO3 is typically used for hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds, not to alkenes. So probably, step 2 fully hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, making -CH2CH2CH2CH3.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which wouldn't do anything. So perhaps that's not the right path.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the target's synthesis path.

We need to get from ethynylcyclohexane to a molecule with a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde.

Perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group (via oxidation), then a Grignard reaction adds a cyclohexyl group, followed by some oxidation to form the aldehyde.

Wait, let's outline possible steps:

1. Oxidize ethynylcyclohexane to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. But how? Oxidizing an alkyne to a ketone usually requires specific conditions, like O3 followed by Zn. Alternatively, using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic conditions could oxidize the alkyne to a diketone, but perhaps that's not applicable here.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane → oxidation → forms cyclohexanecarboxylic acid? Or maybe a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkyne typically gives a diketone, but that would require cleavage. But our target doesn't have two carbonyl groups, so maybe that's not the path.

Another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a vinyl group, which can then undergo a ring-forming reaction.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then a dihydroxylation occurs, forming a diol, which can then undergo cyclization to form a ring.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group, then hydrogenating, then oxidizing to introduce an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the correct option is option C. Let me think again about the steps.

Option C:

Step 1: alkylate with methyl chloride to get CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: hydrogenate triple bond to single bond (CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3).

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. But without a double bond, ozonolysis won't do anything.

So, this doesn't make sense. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Looking at option B:

Step 1: alkylate with ethyl chloride → CH2-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond, making CH2-C=C-Et.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → cleavage into two carbonyl groups. So, if the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-Et, no. Wait, no, after elimination, the substituent would have a double bond.

Wait, if the substituent is CH2-C≡C-Et, then Li in NH3 (strong base) could cause elimination of the ethyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but there's no halogen here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent after step 1 is CH2-C≡C-Et. Then, step 2's Li in NH3 could deprotonate and cause elimination, forming a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Hmm, but I'm not seeing how that leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, the substituent becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-Et, which then undergoes ozonolysis. But again, without a double bond, that's not possible.

Another possibility: Perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, which then undergoes a Grignard addition.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane → oxidize triple bond to ketone → Grignard reaction to add cyclohexyl group → then oxidize to aldehyde.

But how to oxidize the triple bond to a ketone? Ozonolysis would cleave the triple bond into two carbonyls. But the target has only one aldehyde group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a propargyl alcohol via some reaction, then undergoes a Grignard reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C, but I'm not fully understanding the steps.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is option D. Let's think:

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is deprotonating the ethynyl group and then quenching with methanol to get CH2-C≡C-OCH3. Then, step 2: Li in NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps inducing elimination to form a double bond. So, CH2-C≡C-OCH3 → CH2-C=CH-OCH3. Then, step 3: Ozonolysis → cleavage of double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the substituent would split into two parts, each with a carbonyl group. Then, step 4: NH4OH (which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reductive amination, but not sure).

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the target and which reagents would lead to the necessary functional groups.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is in turn attached to the main ring. Also, there's an aldehyde group.

So perhaps a possible pathway is:

1. Add a methyl group to the triple bond via alkylation.
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain.
3. Introduce an oxygen-containing group, like a hydroxyl, via some reaction.
4. Perform an oxidation to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The target's substituent is (cyclohexyl)(OH)CH2- attached to the main ring, which also has an aldehyde. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone.

Ethynylcyclohexane → oxidize to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? No, because oxidation of an alkyne usually goes to a diketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via ozonolysis, which would give a ketone. Then, a Grignard reaction adds a cyclohexyl group, forming a tertiary alcohol. Then, oxidation of the secondary alcohol to a ketone, but that doesn't fit the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct path is to form a diol, then eliminate to form a double bond, then perform ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and so on.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, let me think again about option C's steps:

1. Alkylate the triple bond with methyl chloride → CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Without a double bond, ozonolysis does nothing. So, this step might not make sense.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Option B steps:

1. Alkylate with ethyl chloride → CH2-C≡C-Et.

2. Li in NH3 → eliminate to form a double bond → CH2-C=CH-Et.

3. Ozonolysis → cleave the double bond into two carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → perhaps workup.

But I'm not sure how that gives the substituent with cyclohexyl and OH groups.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, each carbonyl group is further modified. But I'm not seeing it.

Another angle: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group, which suggests that a cyclohexane ring is formed during the synthesis. So perhaps one of the steps is a ring-forming reaction, like a cyclization.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane → after some steps → forms a larger ring.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a diol, which can undergo cyclization to form a six-membered ring.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane can be hydroboration-oxidized to form a ketone. Then, a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, oxidation would form a ketone, but that's not the aldehyde in the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, then a Grignard adds to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone, but again, not aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, if after some steps, we have a primary alcohol, oxidation would give an aldehyde.

Hmm.

Another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a benzyl-type group, then undergoes some kind of coupling to form the cyclohexyl substituent.

But I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should think about each option's outcome.

Option D: steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

After step 1, perhaps the substituent becomes CH2-C≡C-OCH3. Then, step 2, Li/NH3 could eliminate to form a double bond. So, CH2-C=CH-OCH3. Then, step 3: ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls. So, the substituent would break into two parts. But how does that form the desired substituent?

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the correct answer based on the options and the required steps.

The target requires an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves introducing an aldehyde via oxidation and adding a hydroxymethyl group via some addition.

Looking at the options, option C includes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyls. So maybe after forming a diene, ozonolysis would create the necessary carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think:

Start with ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane).

Step 1: alkylate with methyl chloride → CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But then, no double bond for ozonolysis. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is not full hydrogenation but partial, forming a cis double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it.

Wait, if step 2 is hydrogenation using a poisoned catalyst (like Lindlar's), it would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond.

But option C's step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is a standard catalyst for full hydrogenation. So, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

Wait, another thought: The target has a cyclohexane ring. So perhaps during the synthesis, a ring is formed via an elimination reaction, which would require a suitable leaving group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C, as it includes ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, preventing the formation of peroxides and forming aldehydes instead of carboxylic acids.

After ozonolysis, the aldehydes can then undergo further reactions, like forming the cyclohexyl group via a Grignard addition.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Another approach: Let's think about the reagents in each option and what they do.

Option C: Step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. This would break a double bond into two aldehydes (if the double bond is between two CH2 groups), or a ketone and an aldehyde, depending on substitution.

If after step 2, there's a double bond, then ozonolysis would generate the necessary carbonyl groups.

But in option C, step 2 is hydrogenation, which would remove any double bonds. So I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps option D is the correct one.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, deprotonate the ethynyl group and then quench with methanol, leading to CH2-C≡C-OCH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → elimination to form a double bond, CH2-C=CH-OCH3.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → cleave into two carbonyls. The substituent would become two carbonyl groups, perhaps forming a diketone.

Step 4: NH4OH → could be a reducing agent, but not sure.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me try to think again.

Option C steps:

1. Alkylate to CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis → no reaction, since no double bond.

4. Ba(OH)2 → strong base, perhaps causing elimination if there's a suitable leaving group.

But without a leaving group, Ba(OH)2 wouldn't do much. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Wait, another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached as a substituent. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a cyclohexyl group via a Grignard reaction.

But Grignard reagents are typically strong bases and nucleophiles, requiring a carbonyl group for addition.

So, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, then a Grignard adds a cyclohexyl group.

How?

Ethynylcyclohexane → oxidize to form a ketone → Grignard addition → form secondary alcohol → oxidize to aldehyde.

But how to oxidize the triple bond to a ketone.

Ozonolysis of an alkyne typically gives a diketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH) → ozonolysis → cleaves into two carbonyl groups. But that would give two carbonyls, which doesn't match the target.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

Wait, if after step 1, the substituent is CH2-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, step 3: Ozonolysis doesn't do anything. So step 4: Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, perhaps causing some elimination, but without a leaving group, it's unclear.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the options and the target molecule, which requires introducing a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, perhaps the correct steps involve adding a methyl group, hydrogenating the triple bond, then forming a double bond via elimination, followed by ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Looking at the options, option C's steps include ozonolysis after hydrogenation, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, option B includes Li/NH3, which could induce elimination to form a double bond before ozonolysis.

Wait, option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → CH2-C≡C-Et.

2. Li/NH3 → elimination to form CH2-C=CH-Et.

3. Ozonolysis → cleave into two carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → perhaps to form amine or something else.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target.

Another thought: if step 3 in option B produces two carbonyl groups, perhaps one is a ketone and the other an aldehyde. Then, step 4: NH4OH (which is a mild reducing agent) could reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at position 1 and a substituent at the same position: a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Likely alkylates the triple bond, forming CH2-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly causing elimination, but without a suitable leaving group, this step is unclear.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or secondary alcohols to ketones. However, the sequence does not clearly lead to the desired product.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the triple bond, forming CH2-C≡C-Et.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base, possibly inducing elimination to form a double bond, resulting in CH2-C=CH-Et.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: A mild reducing agent, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the triple bond, forming CH2-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the hydrogenation step produces a single bond, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, but without a leaving group, it is unclear how this step contributes to the synthesis.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Likely forms CH2-C≡C-OCH3 by deprotonating the triple bond and quenching with methanol.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base, possibly inducing elimination to form a double bond, resulting in CH2-C=CH-OCH3.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: A mild reducing agent, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the introduction of a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde. None of the options clearly and directly lead to the desired product. However, based on the analysis, **Option C** is the most plausible, as it includes steps that could potentially form the necessary intermediates, even though the reasoning is not fully consistent with the target structure.
