Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a bit because of the planet's orbit, and that movement shifts the spectral lines we observe.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So, both planets are about the same size. The planets are in circular orbits, which probably means their velocities are uniform, making the calculations a bit simpler.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relation here. I think the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is the maximum speed the star moves towards or away from us. The formula for that semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) )^(1/1) )) * something. Oh wait, maybe I should think about Kepler's third law here, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the star's properties, as well as the orbital period. The formula is K = (v) = (2Ï€ G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. Both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses. The RV shift depends on the velocity of the star. So if the star is moving more, the spectral shift is larger. But how does the velocity relate to the orbital period?

Wait, the Doppler shift is directly related to the velocity. So a larger shift (7 vs 5) means the star is moving faster. Because if the planet is more massive, the star's velocity would be higher. But wait, the planets have similar masses, so that shouldn
