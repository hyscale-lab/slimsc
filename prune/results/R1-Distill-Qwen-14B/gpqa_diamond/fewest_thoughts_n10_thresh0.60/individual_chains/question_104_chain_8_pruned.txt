Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare based on the given data. Let me start by recalling what I know.

The radial velocity method detects planets by measuring shifts in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. The star moves in response to the planet's gravity, causing the spectral lines to shift as the star moves toward or away from us. The size of this shift relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, but in this question, both stars have the same mass as our Sun, and the planets are similar to Neptune in mass. So the planet masses are the same. The difference must be in the observed Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star.

The shift given is in milliangstroms. I think the formula for the Doppler shift relates the velocity of the star (v) to the wavelength shift (Δλ). The formula is something like v = (Δλ / λ) * c, where c is the speed of light. But wait, in practice, people often use the approximation v in m/s when Δλ is in miliangstroms and λ is in the optical range, say around 500 nm (which is 5000 angstroms, but wait, 500 nm is 5000 angstroms? No, wait: 1 nm is 10 angstroms. So 500 nm is 5000 angstroms. So each wavelength shift in miliangstrom is 0.001 angstroms. Because 1 milli = 1e-3.

Wait, but in the formula, the Doppler shift is (Δλ / λ) = v/c. So rearranged, v = c * (Δλ / λ). But when Δλ is much smaller than λ, you can approximate v as proportional to Δλ. Because c and λ are constants for a given spectral line, the velocity of the star is proportional to Δλ.

So in this problem, the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstrom and for planet #2 it's 7 milliangstrom. Since the stars are the same and the planets have the same mass, the velocity of the star (v) will be higher for planet #2, because a larger shift implies a larger velocity.

Wait, but wait. The velocity of the star (v) is related to the mass of the planet and the star's mass and the orbital period. Oh, right, the formula for the velocity amplitude (K) in the radial velocity method is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (P (M_star + M_planet)) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) ) / (M_star^(2/3) c )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that relates the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) to the orbital period (P), the mass of the planet (M_p), and the mass of the star (M_*). The formula is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ] * (1 / (P * (2
