Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a reaction scheme where a compound A goes through several reactions to form compound E. Each step involves different reagents, and there are some hints provided. My goal is to figure out what compound E is from the given options.

First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it correctly.

Compound A reacts with HCN to give compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Next, C reacts with HNO2 to give D, and finally, D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Additionally, there are two hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Looking at the options, they're all cyclic ketones. So E is a ketone. Let me map out each reaction step to see what's happening.

Starting with the first reaction: A + HCN → B.

HCN is a nucleophile. When a carbonyl compound reacts with HCN, it typically adds the cyanide across the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin. So compound A is likely a ketone or aldehyde, but since after some steps we get a ketone again, maybe A is a ketone.

Wait, but the first step is A to B via HCN. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. Then, the second step is B being reduced with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation with Pd usually reduces triple bonds, maybe double bonds or ketones. Wait, but B is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol group and a nitrile. But wait, I'm not sure.

Hold on, let me think about each step.

Step 1: A → B with HCN. A is a carbonyl (since IR of A is 1750, which is a strong carbonyl peak, probably a ketone, maybe ester or aldehyde. Let's think ketone first).

So A is a ketone. Reaction with HCN gives a cyanohydrin. So B would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. So the structure would be something like R2C(OH)CN.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. What does that do? H2 and Pd is hydrogenation. So if B is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile, maybe the nitrile is reduced. Wait, nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but more commonly, they're reduced to amines with H2 and catalysts like Raney Ni or Pt. But Pd might be for hydrogenation of triple bonds, but in any case, perhaps the nitrile is reduced.

Wait, nitrile (CN) upon hydrogenation (H2 and Pd) would
