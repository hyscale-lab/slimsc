Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. The NMR data is provided, which should help me figure out the structure. The reagents used are NaNO2 + HCl, followed by H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat. I need to find the final product from the options given.

Wait, the reagents sequence looks familiar. NaNO2 and HCl are usually involved in diazotization. Oh right, that's the first step in making a diazonium salt. Then, when treated with water, especially under certain conditions, it might undergo hydrolysis. The third step with aqueous KOH and heat sounds like a possible elimination or maybe some kind of elimination reaction, maybe the formation of a carbonyl group.

So, the starting compound must have an aromatic amine or something that can form a diazonium salt. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. Molecular formula: C8H9NO. 

The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, X=0 (assuming no halogens), N=1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring and some double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one double bond, or maybe a ring plus a double bond plus another ring or something.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet around 9.7. That's a strong indicator of an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. But wait, the triplet? Aldehyde protons are usually singlet, but maybe coupling with another proton. Like, perhaps it's a conjugated system. Or maybe it's a formyl group adjacent to something else.
