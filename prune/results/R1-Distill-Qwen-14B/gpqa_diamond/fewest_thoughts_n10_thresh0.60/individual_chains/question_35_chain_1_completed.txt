Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y. Hmm, let's start breaking this down.

The problem says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix and is given by c multiplied by S. Wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). Oh wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices used for spin-1/2 particles. So S probably is one of them. Let me think: Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The given S looks like σ_y because σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So S is σ_y.

So A_y = c * S = (h/(4π)) * σ_y. But wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±ℏ/2 when multiplied by appropriate constants. Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by something like ħ/2, their eigenvalues become ±ħ/2. Because if S is σ_y, then S has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So A_y would be c times those eigenvalues.

So c is h/(4π). Wait, but Planck's constant is usually written as ħ = h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2. So c = ħ/2. So A_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y. So the eigenvalues of A_y would be (ħ/2) * (eigenvalues of σ_y), which are ±(ħ/2) * 1 = ±ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. But wait, the options don't mention ħ, so maybe they're using h instead. Let me compute in terms of h.

Since ħ = h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues would be ± h/(4π) * (1) * something? Wait, wait, no. Wait, S is σ_y, which has eigenvalues ±1. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. So the eigenvalues of A_y are (h/(4π)) * ±1. So they're ± h/(4π). So that's the eigenvalue a in the question.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real, right? Because A_y is a Hermitian operator, so its eigenvalues must be real. Wait, is A_y Hermitian? Because for angular momentum operators, they are Hermitian because they correspond to observables. So the eigenvalues must be real. So options that talk about imaginary parts are probably wrong.

Option B: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That can't be, because our eigenvalues are real. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az. Hmm. Well, the square of the angular momentum operator A^2 commutes with all the components, so if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, it should also be an eigenfunction of A^2. Because A^2 is a Casimir operator, which commutes with all components. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A^2 as well. But what about Az? If φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, does it have to be an eigenfunction of Az? No, because the components don't commute. So φ can be a combination of eigenfunctions of Az. So C says that the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², which is correct, and not of Az, which is also correct. So C could be a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Wait, I'm not exactly sure what that means. The basis functions are the eigenvectors, so the eigenfunctions are the basis. So D is saying that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which I think is correct because any operator can be diagonal in its eigenbasis. So D seems correct, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let's look back.

We have eigenvalues a = ± h/(4π). So for an option to be correct, it should state that the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which is real. Looking at the options, option A has eigenvalues with imaginary parts. So A's eigenvalues are complex, which can't be right because the operator is Hermitian.

Option B's eigenvalues are ±1/2 (imaginary parts) and ±1 (real parts). Again, complex, so wrong.

So which options are left? C and D.

So option C: the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. As I thought earlier, that makes sense. Because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so the eigenstates of Ay are superpositions of eigenstates of Az. So C is a correct statement.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That's also true because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are true. But looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm. So both statements seem correct. But I have to choose the correct answer from the options.

Wait, let's think again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me think about each option.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² commutes with Ay, this is correct. As for Az, since [Ay, Az] = iħ A_x (or something), so they don't commute, so the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Well, any operator's eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so D is correct. That is, the matrix can be diagonalized in its eigenbasis. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the options are four, and I have to choose one. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option C: ... Az. So the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's correct because, as I thought, A² commutes, so same eigenstates, but Az doesn't, so the eigenstates are not shared.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which form a basis. So yes, D is correct.

So both C and D are correct? But the options can't have two correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

What's the operator A_y?

A_y is a 2x2 matrix, so its eigenvectors form a basis for the two-dimensional space. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So D is correct.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². But since [Ay, Az] isn't zero, they don't share eigenfunctions.

So both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is an option.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Looking at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum. Since A² is a Casimir operator, it commutes with all components, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So if both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow that, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let me think about the matrix S. S is given, and it's 2x2. So S is a 2x2 matrix, so the eigenvectors are 2-dimensional vectors. So the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the 2x2 space. So D's statement is correct.

So now, looking back at the options, the correct statements are C and D. But perhaps only one of them is correct. Let me see the options again.

Wait, option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, perhaps the way the question is phrased, the matrix operator is 2x2, so the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors. So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, only one is presented as correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check each option again.

Option A: Im parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That's wrong because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Im parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's wrong because eigenvalues are real.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis of Ay. Correct.

Hmm, but the question may not have both C and D as options. So perhaps the correct answer is C or D.

Wait, the square of the angular momentum operator A² is given by A_x² + A_y² + A_z², right? So for a spin-1/2 particle, A = ħ/2 * σ, so A² = (ħ/2)^2 (σ_x² + σ_y² + σ_z²). But σ_x², σ_y², σ_z² each equal the identity matrix for Pauli matrices. So σ_x² = I, same for σ_y and σ_z. So A² = (ħ²/4) * (I + I + I) = (3ħ²/4) I. So A² has eigenvalues 3ħ²/4. But since our A_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, when squared, (± ħ/2)^2 = ħ²/4. But wait, A² is (3ħ²/4) I, which is the same for all eigenstates. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue 3ħ²/4. So C is correct.

As for D, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator, which is a 2x2 matrix. So that's correct as well.

But the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answers are C and D. But the options only have one correct.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between eigenvectors and basis functions. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay form a basis for the two-dimensional space. So D is correct.

But the question says, which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, but the options are labeled A to D. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the eigenvalues again. Let me recalculate.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay are (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So a = ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B, which talk about imaginary parts, are incorrect.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the matrix.

So which of the options is correct? The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

Hmm, perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct, so I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. The basis functions are the eigenvectors, so yes, they form a basis. So D is correct.

So which of the options is correct?

If all four options are to be evaluated, then perhaps both C and D are correct. But that can't be because it's a multiple-choice question with four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, looking back, perhaps D is incorrect. Because the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the Hilbert space, not necessarily the basis functions of the matrix operator. The matrix operator is represented in a particular basis, but the eigenfunctions are in another basis. So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, but not necessarily the standard basis of the matrix representation.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think: The operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvectors can be used as a basis for the matrix, yes. So D is correct.

But perhaps the other option, C, is also correct.

Hmm, since both C and D seem correct, but the options don't allow for that, perhaps one of them is incorrect.

Wait, the statement in D says 'the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.' So the matrix operator is represented in a certain basis. If the eigenfunctions are not orthonormal, maybe they don't form a basis? No, any set of eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues can form a basis. Since Ay is 2x2, and we have two distinct eigenvalues, the eigenvectors are orthogonal, so they form an orthonormal basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again about each option.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

We know that A² commutes with Ay, so yes, eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². And since [Ay, Az] = iħ A_x (from angular momentum commutation relations), the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions form the basis of the matrix operator Ay. So the matrix is represented in the original basis, but its eigenfunctions are in a different basis. So perhaps D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, so when you diagonalize Ay, you express it in terms of its eigenbasis. So the matrix in that basis would be diagonal. So D is correct.

But considering all that, perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options don't allow that, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

C) The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Hmm. So perhaps D is correct regardless of the basis. The matrix operator is represented in a certain basis (like computational basis), but the eigenvectors are in a different basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator in its eigenbasis.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix operator is already given in a certain basis, and its eigenfunctions are the basis functions for that operator. Hmm, I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So, to find the eigenvalues, solve det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a, (h/(4π))(-i) ]

[ (h/(4π))i, -a ]

The determinant is (a)^2 - [ (h/(4π)) * (-i)(h/(4π)) i ].

Compute the off-diagonal term: (h/(4π))^2 * (-i)(i) = (h^2/(16 π²)) * (-i²) = (h²/(16 π²)) * (1) because i² is -1.

So the determinant equation becomes a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π).

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π), which are real numbers, as expected.

Now, to find the eigenvectors.

For a = h/(4 π):

The matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -h/(4 π), (-i h)/(4 π) ]

[ (i h)/(4 π), -h/(4 π) ]

The equations are:

- (h/(4 π)) φ1 - (i h/(4 π)) φ2 = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ -i φ2, φ2 ]^T. Let φ2 = 1, then the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ]^T. To make it a unit vector, multiply by 1/√2. So the eigenvector is (1/√2) [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly for a = -h/(4 π), the eigenvector would be (1/√2)[i, 1]^T.

So the eigenvectors are these two vectors.

So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the 2D space. So D is correct.

But what about option C? The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is (3 ħ²/4) I, which is the same for all states, any state is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue 3ħ²/4. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². And they are not eigenfunctions of Az because, as I thought earlier, [Ay, Az] is non-zero. So C is correct.

So both C and D are correct. But the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps D is incorrect. Because the operator Ay is represented in a particular basis, not necessarily the eigenbasis. The eigenfunctions are in a different basis. So the statement in D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, perhaps the matrix operator is given in the computational basis, so its eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the matrix. Alternatively, the matrix can be diagonalized, so in the eigenbasis, it is represented as a diagonal matrix. So in that sense, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator when it's diagonal. So D is correct.

But perhaps the confusion is that the matrix operator is given in a particular basis (not necessarily the eigenbasis), so the statement D is correct because the eigenfunctions can form a basis for the operator.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider another approach. Let's see what the options say.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Yes, correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Since both are correct, but the options have only one correct answer, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing knowledge that the eigenfunctions of Ay are the same as those of A², which is correct, making C correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, another thought: The square of the operator A^2 is (h^2/(4π)^2)(S_x^2 + S_y^2 + S_z^2). Since S is σ_y, which is one of the Pauli matrices, S_x, S_y, S_z would be the other Pauli matrices? No, wait, S is given as the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σ_y. So the operator A would have components A_x, A_y, A_z, each being c times their respective Pauli matrices.

Wait, but the square of the total angular momentum is A^2 = A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2.

But for a spin-1/2 particle, the total angular momentum squared is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) (σ_x^2 + σ_y^2 + σ_z^2 ) = (ħ^2/4)( 3 I ), since each Pauli matrix squared is I.

So A^2 has eigenvalue 3 (ħ/2)^2 = 3 ħ^2 /4.

So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A^2 with eigenvalue 3 ħ^2/4. So C is correct.

So I think the correct answer is C.


The problem involves analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix given by:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - Since \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, it has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are therefore \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), as \( A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} S \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, indicating that \( A_y \) is a Hermitian operator.

2. **Option A:**
   - This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

3. **Option B:**
   - This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

4. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), as \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \) (being a Casimir operator). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \), as \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This statement is correct.

5. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional vector space. Since \( A_y \) is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) span the space and can serve as a basis. This statement is also correct.

6. **Final Decision:**
   - Both options C and D are correct. However, since the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation, the focus is on the relationship between \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \). Option C highlights the fact that \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \) share eigenfunctions, which is a key insight during the calculation. Therefore, **C is the best answer**.

### Conclusion:
The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This statement is correct and aligns with the properties of angular momentum operators.

**Answer: C**
