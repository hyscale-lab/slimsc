Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. They've given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/parallax^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, actually, the formula I remember is that distance d is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in parsecs), right? So d = 1/plx.

The question asks how the number of stars N changes with distance r, per unit range. So I think we need to express N in terms of r and then see how N changes as r increases.

Let me think: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we have N proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Which simplifies as N proportional to d^5. Oh wait, but d is the distance. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how N changes with distance per unit range. So maybe we're looking at the differential, like dN/dr.

Wait, let me clarify. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which we can write as N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N = k * (d)^5.

Wait, so N = k * d^5. If I want to find how N changes with distance, that's the derivative of N with respect to d. So dN/dd = 5k d^4. That would mean that the number of stars increases by 5k d^4 per unit distance. So the change in N per unit distance (r) is proportional to r^4, since d is the same as r in this context.

Wait, but the options given are about the change with distance, so the rate at which N increases as r increases. So the rate (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4. Looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the answer should be C.
