Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I recall is plx = 1/distance, but wait, I think the actual formula is plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So distance d is inversely proportional to plx. Or d = 1/plx.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, I can rewrite this in terms of d. Let's see, substituting d for 1/plx. So 1/plx is d, so 1/plx^5 would be (1/plx)^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. So I think I need to find how N changes as a function of distance, considering a range dr. Maybe it's about the density of stars in space.

Wait, the number of stars in a region is often given in terms of density. So if N is proportional to d^5, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at distance d with thickness dr. Because when you observe stars, you're seeing them from all directions, so perhaps it's about the number per unit volume or per unit area.

Wait, let me think again. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And plx is 1/d, so substituting, N ∝ (d)^5.

But wait, the problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So when you're looking at a region at a particular distance, how does N change as you move away by a unit distance.

Wait, another approach: the question is about the number of stars per unit range
