Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of sigma_z. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are given as A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state vector. So I'll need to compute this for the given operator.

Let me break it down. The operator is a combination of σz and σx. Since expectation values are linear, I can compute each part separately and then add them together. So, the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make things easier.

First, I'll compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, I think σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. So if the state is a linear combination, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, let me check the coefficients. The square of 0.5 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. Adding them together gives 1, so that's correct. So the probabilities are 0.25 for |↑⟩ and 0.75 for |↓⟩.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1) = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The coefficients are 0.5 (which is 1/2) and sqrt(3)/2. Squaring them gives 1/4 and 3/4. So yeah, 0.25 and 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ is 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. That's negative half.

Next, I need to compute ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which, if I remember correctly, has eigenvalues +1 and -1 but for the states |+x⟩ and |-x⟩. But the given state is expressed in the σz basis. I think I can compute ⟨σx⟩ by expanding the state in the σx eigenbasis, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the expectation value formula directly.

Alternatively, I can write the state as a vector and compute the expectation value using matrix multiplication. Since σx is a matrix, perhaps that's the way to go.

Wait, let's think about this. The state is a column vector. For a spin-½ particle, the basis |↑⟩ is usually represented as [1; 0], and |↓⟩ as [0; 1].

So our state |ψ⟩ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩, which would be the vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The Pauli matrices are:

σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

So, the expectation value of σx is ψ† σx ψ, where ψ is the column vector.

So, let's compute that. ψ† is [0.5, sqrt
