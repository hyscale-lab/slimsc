Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given state. The state is an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and we're supposed to find the uncertainty in P_z.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the standard deviation. The formula for the uncertainty ΔA is sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for the given state.

Wait, but wait. The state isn't given as an eigenstate of P_z, it's an eigenstate of P_x. So P_z might not have a definite value here. So the expectation values are what I need.

The state vector is given as a column vector: [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]^T. Let's call this vector |ψ⟩.

The matrix for P_z is given. Let me write it down. P_z has rows as [ [ħ, 0, 0], [0,0,0], [0,0,-ħ] ].

So, first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ. Then compute ⟨P_z^2⟩, which is ψ† P_z^2 ψ. Then the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2).

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure about the matrices. So P_z is a diagonal matrix, right? Because the given matrix has non-zero elements only on the diagonal. So P_z squared is just each element squared. So the matrix for P_z squared would be [ [ħ², 0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0, ħ²] ].

So, let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute ⟨P_z⟩: ψ† P_z ψ.

The vector ψ is a column vector with components [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]. So ψ† is the row vector [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2].

Multiplying ψ† with P_z: Let's see. The first element would be (-1/2)*ħ + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*0 = (-ħ/2). The second element is ( -1/2 * 0 ) + (1/sqrt(2)*0 ) + (-1/2 * 0 )=0. The third element is (-1/2)*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ) = (ħ/2). Wait, no, because when you multiply ψ† with P_z, each element is the product of ψ† with each column of P_z.

Wait no, perhaps I should think of it as a matrix multiplication. Because P_z is diagonal, the calculation is straightforward.

⟨P_z⟩ = [ψ† P_z] ψ.

Wait, ψ† P_z is a row vector. Wait, maybe I should compute each component.

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute ψ† P_z ψ as the sum over the diagonal elements multiplied by the square of the components. Because P_z is diagonal.

Wait, no, because ψ is a vector. The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum over i of ψ_i^* (P_z)_ii ψ_i.

Because P_z is diagonal, so only the diagonal elements contribute.

So, the diagonal elements of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ.

So, let's compute each term:

First term (i=1): ψ_1^* * (P_z)_11 *
