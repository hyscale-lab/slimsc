Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, and I need to figure out the products for each reaction. The options are given as A, B, C, etc., and I need to match each product to the correct option.

Let's start with the first reaction:

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A

Hmm, so the reactants are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol with acid and heat. Wait, I think this might involve some kind of rearrangement. Sigmatropic rearrangements usually involve the shifting of a sigma bond with a pi bond moving in the same direction. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples, but this looks a bit different.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is (CH3O)2CHNH2, right? And but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2C(OH)CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2OHCH2? Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have a double bond between carbons 3 and 2? Or is it between 2 and 3? Wait, but the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, butenol. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So structure is CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C2 and C3? Or wait, but-3-en-2-ol
