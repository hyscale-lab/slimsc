Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, so the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. Both have circular orbits. The method used is the radial velocity (RV) method, which detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P))^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the velocity and the orbital period. Oh, right, the RV method relates the star's velocity to the planet's mass and the orbital period.

But wait, I think there's a simpler relation. The Doppler shift (wavelength shift) relates to the velocity of the star. The velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift (since the shift is wavelength change over the original wavelength, which is small, so K is approximately proportional to the shift in wavelength).

So, K is the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/(M_star)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the simplified version for when M_p is much less than M_star, which is the case here since the planet is Neptune-sized and the star is solar mass. So M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p â‰ˆ M_star.

So the
