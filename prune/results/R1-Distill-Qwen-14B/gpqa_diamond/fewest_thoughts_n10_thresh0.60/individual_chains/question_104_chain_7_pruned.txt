Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's presence.

The question says that two stars have the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the key here is probably Kepler's laws, but I need to think about how the RV method relates to the orbital period.

The RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us, which is related to the planet's orbit. The shift in spectral lines gives us the velocity. So, the star's velocity (v) is related to the planet's orbital parameters.

The formula I remember is from the RV method: the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K) is given by K = ( (G * (M_p)^3 sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ something) ) ? Wait, maybe I should think of the relation between the star's velocity and the planet's orbital period.

Wait, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, but that's in the form (P^2) = (4π²/G(M+m)) ) * a^3. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M + m ≈ M. So, P² ∝ a³/(M), assuming M is the star's mass.

But how does this tie into the RV method? The RV method measures the star's velocity, which relates to the planet's orbital speed. The star and planet orbit their mutual center of mass. The star's velocity (v) is related to the planet's orbital speed. Since M_p << M_star, the star's orbit is small, so the semi-major axis of the star's orbit (a_star) is much smaller than the planet's (a_planet). But the period is the same for both.

The velocity semi-amplitude K (the maximum velocity of the star) is given by the formula:

K = ( (2π G) / (P (1 - e²)^½)
