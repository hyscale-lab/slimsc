Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Alright, so let's break this down. I'll tackle each reaction separately.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. It's reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what's that product look like? Let's draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is sodium cyanide, I think it's a nucleophilic substitution or addition. Wait, in ketones, the alpha carbons are where substitution can happen. Or wait, NaCN is a nucleophile. Oh, right, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition, like in the case of the formation of cyanohydrins. A cyanohydrin is when a hydroxyl group and a cyanide add across the carbonyl group.

So butan-2-one has the structure (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN in the presence of an acid catalyst would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. The CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, pushing the double bond to form a new bond. Then water would leave, but wait, that's not exactly right. Let me think again.

Wait, in the formation of a cyanohydrin, the mechanism involves the attack of the nucleophile (CN-) on the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, when the CN- attacks, it forms a new bond. The oxygen then picks up a proton, and eventually, the leaving group (water) departs, giving the cyanohydrin.

So the product would have a hydroxyl group and a cyano group added to the same carbon that
