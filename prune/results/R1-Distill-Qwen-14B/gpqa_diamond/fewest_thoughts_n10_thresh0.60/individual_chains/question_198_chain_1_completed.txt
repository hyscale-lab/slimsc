Okay, so I have this problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my coordination chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN- ions, and the stability constants for four different complexes.

Wait, stability constants, right. Those are the formation constants, which tell us how stable a complex is. Higher β means a more stable complex. The complexes here are Co(SCN)_n^2+ where n is 0,1,2,3,4.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So I think each β corresponds to a different complex. Oh wait, no, wait. Typically, the stability constant (β) for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex. So, for Co(SCN)^(2+), the first step would be Co²+ + SCN⁻ → CoSCN²+ with β1=9. The second step would be CoSCN²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₂²+ with β2=40. And so on up to the fourth complex, which is Co(SCN)4²+ with β4=16.

Wait a second, but β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63). That's interesting because usually higher n complexes are more stable, but that's not always the case. So β3 is the highest here, which would mean Co(SCN)3²+ is the most stable. But the question is about dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complexes. So n=2, so that's the β2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Cobalt complexes can have different colors based on their structure. For example, [Co(SCN)₄]²− is usually blue. Wait, but is it dithiocyanato (n=2) or something else? Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN groups, right? So if the complex is [Co(SCN)₂]²+, then that's the dithiocyanato complex. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I think the common blue complex is the tetrathiocyanate, [Co(SCN)4]^2−. So maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, the problem refers to the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So perhaps in this context, the blue color comes from the dithiocyanato form, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+? Or maybe I'm mixing up the nomenclature. Alternatively, maybe it's the tetra that's blue, but the question specifically says dithiocyanato, so maybe n=2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. I recall that the color of the complex depends on the crystal field splitting, which in turn depends on the number of ligands and the metal's oxidation state. But maybe that's beyond the point here. The question is about the percentage of the blue complexes, which are the dithiocyanate, i.e., n=2.

But wait, the options given are in the 10-40% range. So, perhaps the calculation involves determining the fraction of Co in each possible complex and then summing the ones that are blue.

So, the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex in the solution, then find the sum for the desired complexes, and then compute the percentage.

The key is to find the fraction of each species: Co²+, [CoSCN]²+, [Co(SCN)₂]²+, [Co(SCN)3]²+, [Co(SCN)4]²−.

Wait, but I think the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So how do these relate to each complex?

Wait, the stability constants for each successive addition of SCN- are given. So β1 is for the first ligand, β2 is for the second, etc. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]²+ would be the product of the β1 through βn. Or wait, no. Wait, each β is the step-wise constant. So the overall formation constant K for [Co(SCN)_n]²+ would be β1 * β2 * ... * βn. So for example:

- [CoSCN]^2+ has K1 = β1 = 9
- [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ has K2 = β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360
- [Co(SCN)3]^2+ has K3 = β1 * β2 * β3 = 9 *40 *63 = let's see, 9*40 is 360, 360 *63 = 22680
- [Co(SCN)4]^2- has K4 = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 = 22680 *16 = 362880.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, sometimes the overall stability constant for a complex with n ligands is given as βn, which is the product of the step-wise β's. So for example, βn = β1 * β2 * ... * βn. So I think that's the case here. So the problem gives β1, β2, β3, β4 as the step-wise constants. So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n]²+ is the product up to βn.

So, for each complex, the formation constant is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So, now, the concentrations of each species can be determined using the formation constants and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN⁻.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex, then sum the fractions for the desired complexes.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the stability constants and the concentrations. The fraction f_n of [Co(SCN)_n]²+ is given by:

f_n = (K_n * [Co²+] [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=0}^4 K_i [SCN]^i [Co²+] )

Wait, but wait, [Co²+] is the concentration of the free ion, and the total concentration of Co is the sum of all species. Let me think again.

Wait, the total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. That includes all species: free Co²+ and all the complexes.

But, in the solution, the concentration of SCN⁻ is 0.1 M.

The formation of each complex is as follows:

Co²+ + n SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)_n]²+.

The fraction f_n of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, no. Wait, [Co²+] is the free ion, and the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n]²+ is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n]²+ = K_n [Co²+] [SCN]^n

So the sum of all species is:

[Co²+] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] = c_total = 1e-2 M.

But [Co²+] is equal to c_total multiplied by the fraction not in any complex. Alternatively, [Co²+] = c_total * (1 - sum_{n=1}^4 f_n )

Hmm, but perhaps a better approach is to use the formation constants to find the distribution of each species.

In terms of the free ion [Co²+], the concentration of each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n]²+ = K_n [Co²+] [SCN]^n

So the total concentration of cobalt is:

[Co²+] + sum_{n=1}^4 [Co(SCN)_n]²+ = c_total.

So this gives:

[Co²+] + sum_{n=1}^4 K_n [SCN]^n [Co²+] = c_total.

Factoring out [Co²+]:

[Co²+] (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 K_n [SCN]^n ) ) = c_total.

So,

[Co²+] = c_total / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 K_n [SCN]^n )

Once [Co²+] is known, each [Co(SCN)_n]²+ can be calculated as K_n [Co²+] [SCN]^n.

Then the fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n]²+ / c_total.

So, the steps are:

1. Calculate each K_n for n=1,2,3,4.

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So,

K1 = β1 =9

K2 = β1 * β2 =9 *40=360

K3= β1 * β2 * β3=9*40*63=22680

K4=β1*β2*β3*β4=22680 *16=362880

2. Compute [SCN] for each term: [SCN] is 0.1 M.

Compute each term in the denominator of [Co²+]: sum_{n=1}^4 K_n [SCN]^n.

So sum = K1 * (0.1)^1 + K2*(0.1)^2 + K3*(0.1)^3 + K4*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

K1*(0.1) =9 *0.1=0.9

K2*(0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6

K3*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

K4*(0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288

Adding these up: 0.9 +3.6=4.5; +22.68=27.18; +36.288=63.468.

So denominator sum is 63.468.

Plus 1 (from [Co²+] (1 + sum ... )).

Wait, no. Wait, [Co²+] = c_total / ( 1 + sum )

So sum is 63.468, so 1 + sum is 64.468.

So [Co²+] = 1e-2 M / 64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

Now, compute each [Co(SCN)_n]²+:

For n=1:

[CoSCN] = K1 [Co²+] [SCN] =9 * 1.55e-4 * 0.1 = 9 * 1.55e-5 = 1.395e-4 M.

n=2:

[Co(SCN)₂] = K2 [Co²+] (0.1)^2 =360 * 1.55e-4 *0.01 =360 * 1.55e-6 =5.58e-4 M.

n=3:

[Co(SCN)3] = K3 [Co²+] (0.1)^3 =22680 * 1.55e-4 * 0.001 =22680 * 1.55e-7 =approximately 3.5142e-3 M.

n=4:

[Co(SCN)4] = K4 [Co²+] (0.1)^4 =362880 *1.55e-4 * 0.0001=362880 * 1.55e-8 ≈ 5.62e-3 M.

Wait, let me compute each more accurately.

Compute each:

n=1: 9 *1.55e-4 *0.1 =9 * 1.55e-5 =1.395e-4≈0.0001395 M.

n=2:360 *1.55e-4 *0.01=360 *1.55e-6=5.58e-4≈0.000558 M.

n=3:22680 * 1.55e-4 *0.001=22680 *1.55e-7.

22680 *1.55e-7 = let me compute 22680 * 1.55 = 22680 * 1.55. 22680*1=22680, 22680 *0.55=12474. So total 35154. So 35154e-7 = 3.5154e-3 ≈0.003515 M.

n=4:362880 *1.55e-4 *0.0001.

First, 1.55e-4 *0.0001 =1.55e-8.

362880 *1.55e-8 = (362880 *1.55) * 1e-8.

362880 *1.55: Let's compute 362880 *1=362880, 362880 *0.55=199,584. So total 562,464.

So 562464 *1e-8 =5.62464e-3 ≈0.005625 M.

Now, sum all the [Co(SCN)_n]²+ plus [Co²+] to check if it equals c_total.

[Co²+] =1.55e-4 ≈0.000155 M.

n=1:0.0001395

n=2:0.000558

n=3:0.003515

n=4:0.005625

Sum of all species:

[Co²+] + others = 0.000155 + 0.0001395 + 0.000558 + 0.003515 +0.005625.

Let's add them step by step.

0.000155 +0.0001395=0.0002945

+0.000558=0.0008525

+0.003515=0.0043675

+0.005625=0.0099925.

Wait, but the total c_total is 1e-2 M =0.01 M. So our sum is approximately 0.0099925, which is about 1e-2. So that's correct, considering possible rounding.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, which are [Co(SCN)₂]²+ (n=2) and any other complexes that are dithiocyanato. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." So perhaps only n=2 and n=3 and n=4? Or maybe they mean a specific structure, like [Co(SCN)₂]²+ being blue. Or perhaps [Co(SCN)₂]²+ is not blue, but I'm not certain. Wait, the question says "dithiocyanato", which would imply two SCN groups. So for n=2, it's dithiocyanato. So the percentage is the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]²+.

Wait, but wait. The question says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". So perhaps only the n=2 is blue, or maybe another complex like n=4 is blue. Wait, earlier I thought n=4, [Co(SCN)4]^2− is the blue one, but the question says dithiocyanato, which would be n=2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me double-check. I think I've heard that [Co(SCN)4]^2− is the one that's blue. But the question refers to dithiocyanato, which would be two SCN ligands, so n=2. So perhaps the correct complexes are the ones with n=2. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So perhaps the blue color is due to [Co(SCN)₂]²+? Or perhaps I'm mistaken. Alternatively, maybe the dithiocyanato refers to two SCN groups but in a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers all complexes with two SCN groups as dithiocyanato, regardless of the state. But I'm not sure, perhaps the problem assumes that the blue color is for the [Co(SCN)₂]²+ complex.

Wait, the options are given for the percentage. Let's proceed with the calculation.

So, the fraction f_n for each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]²+ / c_total.

c_total is 0.01 M.

So,

f_1 = 0.0001395 / 0.01 = 0.01395 (1.395%)

f_2 =0.000558 / 0.01=0.0558 (5.58%)

f_3=0.003515 /0.01=0.03515 (35.15%)

f_4=0.005625 /0.01=0.05625 (56.25%)

[Co²+] fraction:0.000155 / 0.01=0.0155 (1.55%)

Wait, wait, adding all fractions: 1.55% +1.395% +5.58% +35.15% +56.25% = approx 104.925%. Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Because the sum of fractions should be 100% (since all are part of the total Co concentration).

Ah, I see where I went wrong. I took each [Co(SCN)_n]²+ as computed (like 0.0001395 M for n=1) and divided by 0.01 M to get the fraction. But wait, the sum of all these fractions should equal 100%, but according to the sum, it's over 100%. That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the computation of [Co(SCN)_n]²+.

Wait, let me recalculate each [Co(SCN)_n]²+.

[Co²+] = 1e-2 / (1 + sum) =1e-2 / (64.468) ≈1.55e-4 M.

n=1: K1=9. So [CoSCN] =9 * [Co²+] * [SCN] =9 *1.55e-4 *0.1.

So 9 *1.55e-5 =1.395e-4 M.

n=2: K2=360. [Co(SCN)₂]=360 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^2 =360 *1.55e-4 *0.01=360 *1.55e-6=5.58e-4 M.

n=3: K3=22680. [Co(SCN)3]=22680 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^3.

0.1^3=1e-3. So 22680 *1.55e-4 *1e-3=22680 *1.55e-7.

22680 *1.55=35154. So 35154e-7=3.5154e-3 M.

n=4: K4=362880. [Co(SCN)4]=362880 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^4 =362880 *1.55e-4 *1e-4.

So 362880 *1.55e-8. 362880 *1.55=562,464. So 562464e-8=5.62464e-3 M.

Now, [Co²+] is 1.55e-4 M.

So the sum of all these concentrations should be 0.01 M.

Sum all:

[Co²+]=0.000155 M.

n=1:0.0001395 →0.0001395

n=2:0.000558 →0.000558

n=3:0.003515 →0.003515

n=4:0.005625 →0.005625

Adding them:

0.000155 +0.0001395=0.0002945

+0.000558=0.0008525

+0.003515=0.0043675

+0.005625=0.0099925.

So the total is 0.0099925 M, which is approximately 0.01 M, so that's correct.

Now, the fractions of each species relative to the total Co concentration (0.01 M) are:

f0 = [Co²+] / 0.01 = (1.55e-4)/1e-2 =0.0155 →1.55%

f1 = (1.395e-4)/1e-2 =0.01395 →1.395%

f2 =(5.58e-4)/1e-2 =0.0558 →5.58%

f3= (3.515e-3)/1e-2=0.3515 →35.15%

f4=5.625e-3 /1e-2=0.5625 →56.25%

Wait, but 1.55% +1.395% +5.58% +35.15% +56.25% = 100.925%, which is over 100%. That's impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, I see my mistake. Oh, no! Wait, I think I messed up the calculation of the sum. Let me recompute [Co²+] and the sum.

Wait, the denominator when calculating [Co²+] is (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 K_n [SCN]^n).

Earlier, I computed sum as 63.468. So 1 + sum is 64.468. So [Co²+] = 1e-2 /64.468 ≈1.55e-4 M, which is correct.

Now, the sum of [Co²+] plus all complexes should be 1e-2 M.

Wait, but when I added all the concentrations, I got 0.0099925, which is very close to 0.01, so that's correct.

But when I compute the fractions, I get f0=1.55%, f1=1.395%, f2=5.58%, f3=35.15%, f4=56.25%.

Adding those: 1.55 +1.395=2.945; +5.58=8.525; +35.15=43.675; +56.25=99.925%. So actually, the sum is 99.925%, which is about 100% when considering rounding errors. So that's correct.

Wait, but the problem says the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So which of these is blue?

If the blue is [Co(SCN)4]^2−, which is n=4, then the fraction is 56.25% (option D is 16.9%, which is nowhere near that). But the options given don't include 56.25%, but option C is 38.1%, which isn't matching either.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the complexes. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the [Co(SCN)3]^2+ is the blue one. No, I thought [Co(SCN)4]^2- is blue.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato complexes as the ones with two SCN ligands, which is n=2. So the fraction is 5.58% (option B is 25.6%, not matching. Option D is 16.9%, also not matching.

Wait, that can't be right because 5.58% isn't one of the options. So I must have made a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers all the possible dithiocyanato complexes, including those with more ligands, but with exactly two SCN groups. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, the problem says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". So maybe it's a specific complex, perhaps [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is blue. So the fraction is f2=5.58%, which is about 5.58%, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato complexes as those with two SCN groups, and the blue color comes from another complex, like [Co(SCN)4]^2−, but that's a tetra, not dithiocyanato. So I'm confused.

Wait, maybe the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes that are blue. So perhaps, the [Co(SCN)₂]²+ is blue. But according to our calculation, it's about 5.58%, which isn't any of the options.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractions. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the fractions are [Co(SCN)_n]²+ divided by the total Co concentration (0.01 M).

So for n=2, [Co(SCN)₂]²+ is 5.58e-4 M.

So 5.58e-4 / 0.01 =0.0558, which is 5.58%. So that's correct.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the blue complex refers to [Co(SCN)3]^2+, which has a fraction of 35.15%. The options don't have that either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to all dithiocyanato complexes, which include n=2 and n=3 and n=4? No, that doesn't make sense because dithiocyanato implies two SCN groups.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is about the dithiocyanate (SCN-₂) ion, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the logarithmic form of the stability constants, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the overall K but the step-wise β.

Wait, let me think. The stability constant β for a complex is the equilibrium constant for adding one ligand. So the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]²+ can be considered step-wise:

Co²+ + SCN⁻ ↔ [CoSCN]^2+ ; β1=9

[CoSCN]^2+ + SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ ; β2=40

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ + SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)3]^2+ ; β3=63

[Co(SCN)3]^2+ + SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)4]^2− ; β4=16.

So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n]²+ is the product of β1 to βn.

So the previous approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato complexes as the ones where two SCN groups are bound, but the overall structure is different. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to [Co(SCN)₂]^− which is a different charge, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the blue color comes from [Co(SCN)₂]²+ and [Co(SCN)3]^2+ together. But that would make the fraction 5.58% +35.15% =40.73%, which is closest to option A (42.3%). But that's not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers all complexes with more than two SCN groups as dithiocyanato? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of [Co(SCN)_n]²+ concentrations. Let me recompute each term.

[Co²+] =1e-2 / (1 + sum) =1e-2/(64.468)=approx 1.55e-4 M.

n=1: K1=9. [CoSCN]=9 *1.55e-4 *0.1=9 *1.55e-5=1.395e-4 M.

n=2: K2=360. [Co(SCN)₂] =360 *1.55e-4 *0.1^2=360 *1.55e-4 *0.01=360 *1.55e-6=5.58e-4 M.

n=3: K3=22680. [Co(SCN)3] =22680 *1.55e-4 *0.1^3=22680 *1.55e-4 *0.001=22680 *1.55e-7=35154e-7=3.5154e-3 M.

n=4: K4=362880. [Co(SCN)4]=362880 *1.55e-4 *0.1^4=362880 *1.55e-4 *0.0001=362880 *1.55e-8=5.62464e-3 M.

These calculations seem correct.

So, the problem is that the fraction for n=2 is 5.58%, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes, which are the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ and [Co(SCN)₂]^− or another form. But given the charge, I think it's [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato as [Co(SCN)₂]²+ and [Co(SCN)₂]Cl₂, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the sum of the first two complexes, [CoSCN]^2+ and [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, which are the dithiocyanato complexes. But then the fraction would be 1.395% +5.58% =6.975%, still not matching any options.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the stability constants. Wait, perhaps the stability constants are for the overall complexes, not step-wise. That is, β1 is for [CoSCN]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)2]^2+, etc. So K1=β1=9, K2=β2=40, K3=β3=63, K4=β4=16.

In that case, the overall K for each complex is:

[CoSCN]^2+ : K1=9

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ : K2=40

[Co(SCN)3]^2+ : K3=63

[Co(SCN)4]^2− : K4=16.

Wait, but this would change the approach because the K for each complex is given directly, not as the product of step-wise β's.

In that case, the formation of each complex is:

Co²+ + n SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ with K_n = βn.

In this case, the formula for the fraction of each complex would be:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=0}^4 K_i [SCN]^i )

Wait, but [Co²+] would be:

[Co²+] = [Co_total] / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

So, let's try this approach.

Given:

K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

[SCN]=0.1 M.

Compute denominator terms:

1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

Compute each term:

K1 [SCN]=9 *0.1=0.9

K2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

K3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

K4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Sum these:

0.9 +0.4=1.3; +0.063=1.363; +0.0016=1.3646.

Denominator is 1 + 1.3646=2.3646.

So [Co²+] = 1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈4.226e-3 M.

Wait, that's a different [Co²+] than before. Hmm, but earlier approach considered the K's as products of β's, but this approach considers K's as given for each complex. So which is correct?

This depends on how the β's are given. If the problem states that β1=9 is the stability constant for the first complex, [CoSCN]^2+, β2=40 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, etc., then this approach would be correct.

In this case, let's proceed.

Now, compute the [Co(SCN)_n]²+ for each n:

n=1: K1 [Co²+] [SCN] =9 *4.226e-3 *0.1=9*4.226e-4=3.8034e-3 M.

n=2: K2 [Co²+] [SCN]^2=40 *4.226e-3 *0.01=40 *4.226e-5=1.6904e-3 M.

n=3: K3 [Co²+] [SCN]^3=63 *4.226e-3 *0.001=63 *4.226e-6=2.663e-4 M.

n=4: K4 [Co²+] [SCN]^4=16 *4.226e-3 *0.0001=16 *4.226e-7=6.7616e-6 M.

Check the sum:

[Co²+]=4.226e-3

n=1:3.8034e-3

n=2:1.6904e-3

n=3:2.663e-4

n=4:6.7616e-6

Sum:4.226e-3 +3.8034e-3=8.0294e-3; +1.6904e-3=9.7198e-3; +0.0002663=9.9464e-3; +0.0000067616=9.946e-3+0.00000676=9.9467e-3.

But the total cobalt is 0.01 M, so this approach gives a sum of ~9.9467e-3, which is less than 0.01. So something's wrong here.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the approach because the sum of all species should equal c_total=0.01 M, but in this approach, it's only about 9.946e-3, which is off. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the K's are the products of β's, not the individual β's.

Wait, perhaps the problem defines βn as the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So βn = K_n.

In that case, the denominator would be 1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, but the sum in the denominator would be 1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

In our earlier case, with K's as products of β's, the denominator was 64.468. But in this case, with K's as given β's, the denominator is 2.3646, leading to a different [Co²+].

But the sum of the concentrations in this case is less than c_total, which is not possible. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, treating β's as step-wise.

But then, why is the fraction for n=2 only 5.58%, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me reread it.

The problem states: "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

In the step-wise approach, the K for [Co(SCN)_n]²+ is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So, the initial approach was correct, and the K's are the product of the β's.

So, the fractions are as I calculated earlier.

So, with that, the fraction for [Co(SCN)₂]²+ is 5.58%, which isn't among the options.

But the options given are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato complex as the one with two SCN groups, but perhaps the calculation should include all species with at least two SCN groups. But that doesn't make sense because the question specifically refers to dithiocyanato.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering both [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ and [Co(SCN)₂Cl₂], but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the [Co(SCN)₂]^− complex, but I don't think it's relevant.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato as the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ and [Co(SCN)₂Cl₂], but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractions. Let me recheck.

Wait, the fraction for [Co(SCN)₂]²+ is 5.58%, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato complexes as those with two SCN groups, but the complexes can have different charges, like [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ and [Co(SCN)₂]^−. But without more information, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanate ion itself, but that's SCN-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the distribution of the ligands, not the complexes. Hmm, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the dithiocyanato complexes as [Co(SCN)₂]Cl₂, which would dissociate into [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ and Cl^- ions. But that's probably not relevant here.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options given. The options are all much higher than my calculated 5.58% for n=2. So perhaps I'm missing something in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all complexes with two or more SCN groups as dithiocyanato. But that would include n=2,3,4. The fraction for n=2 is 5.58%, n=3 is 35.15%, n=4 is56.25%. So sum is 97%, which is close to 97%.

But the option closest is C)38.1%, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the dithiocyanato complexes in a different way. Let me think about the stability constants again.

Wait, the stability constants are given, but perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the first two complexes, [CoSCN]^2+ and [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. Their fractions are 1.395% +5.58% =6.975%, which is still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the stability constants are given as K's, not β's. Let me try that approach.

If K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Then, the denominator is 1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

Compute each term:

K1 [SCN] =9*(0.1)=0.9

K2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.01)=0.4

K3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063

K4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016

Sum: 0.9+0.4=1.3; +0.063=1.363; +0.0016=1.3646.

Denominator=1+1.3646=2.3646.

[Co²+] = 1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.226e-3 M.

Now, compute each [Co(SCN)_n]²+.

n=1: K1 * [Co²+] * [SCN] =9 *4.226e-3 *0.1=3.8034e-3 M.

n=2: K2 * [Co²+] * [SCN]^2=40 *4.226e-3 *0.01=1.6904e-3 M.

n=3: K3 * [Co²+] * [SCN]^3=63 *4.226e-3 *0.001=2.663e-4 M.

n=4: K4 * [Co²+] * [SCN]^4=16 *4.226e-3 *0.0001=6.7616e-6 M.

Now, the fractions are:

f1=3.8034e-3 /0.01 =0.38034 →38.034%

f2=1.6904e-3 /0.01=0.16904 →16.904%

f3=2.663e-4 /0.01=0.02663 →2.663%

f4=6.7616e-6 /0.01=0.00067616 →0.0676%.

So, the fractions are:

f0: [Co²+] =4.226e-3 /0.01=42.26% (no, wait, [Co²+] is 4.226e-3, so f0=4.226e-3 /0.01=42.26%.)

f1=38.034%, f2=16.904%, f3=2.663%, f4=0.0676%.

Wait, adding these up: 42.26 +38.034=80.294; +16.904=97.198; +2.663=99.861; +0.0676≈99.928%. Close enough.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes.

If in this approach, the blue is [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ (n=2), then the fraction is 16.904%, which matches option D (16.9%). So the answer would be D.

But earlier, when treating β's as step-wise, the fraction was only 5.58% for n=2. So which approach is correct?

It depends on how the stability constants are given. If β's are step-wise, then the K's are products. If K's are given as the overall constants for each complex, then the approach is correct as done here.

The problem statement says β1=9, β2=40, etc., which are the step-wise stability constants.

Wait, but in this approach, when treating the K's as the overall constants, the fraction for n=2 is 16.9%, which matches option D.

But earlier, the approach treating K's as products of β's gave n=2 fraction as 5.58%, which doesn't match any options.

So perhaps the correct approach is to treat each β as the overall K for that complex. But in that case, the sum of the fractions would be 42.26% (for [Co²+]) +38.03% (n=1) +16.90% (n=2) +2.66% (n=3) +0.067% (n=4)= about 99.92%, which is correct.

So in that case, the fraction for [Co(SCN)₂]²+ is 16.90%, which is option D:16.9%.

But earlier, when treating β's as step-wise, the fraction was only 5.58%, which isn't an option.

So perhaps the correct approach is to treat each β as the overall K for the complex.

But why would the problem give β's as step-wise constants, then?

Ah, perhaps the problem is using the β's as the overall constants, not step-wise. Because in that case, the fractions would give a matching option.

But in the problem statement, β's are typically step-wise constants. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the logarithmic form, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the dithiocyanato complexes as both n=2 and n=3, which would sum to 38.03% +16.90% =54.93%, which is close to option A (42.3%) but not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the blue complexes are [Co(SCN)₂]²+ and [Co(SCN)₂]Cl₂, but that's outside the scope.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the dithiocyanato complexes as those with exactly two SCN groups, which would be n=2, giving 16.90% as in option D.

Hmm. In this case, the correct answer would be D)16.9%.

But wait, the problem says "the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt containing species."

So if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)₂]²+, then the fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.

But I'm not entirely confident because the initial approach gave a different result. But given the options, this seems to be the only matching one.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- **Total cobalt concentration**: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- **Thiocyanate concentration**: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- **Stability constants**: \( \beta_1 = 9, \beta_2 = 40, \beta_3 = 63, \beta_4 = 16 \)

### Approach:
1. **Interpretation of Stability Constants**:
   - The stability constants \( \beta_n \) are step-wise constants, meaning:
     \[
     \beta_1 = K_1, \quad \beta_2 = K_2 / K_1, \quad \beta_3 = K_3 / K_2, \quad \beta_4 = K_4 / K_3
     \]
   - The overall stability constant for a complex with \( n \) ligands is:
     \[
     K_n = \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2 \cdot \beta_3 \cdot \beta_4 \quad \text{(for \( n = 4 \))}.
     \]

2. **Fraction of Each Complex**:
   - The fraction of each cobalt species is determined using:
     \[
     f_n = \frac{K_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{1 + \sum_{i=1}^4 K_i [\text{SCN}]^i}
     \]
   - Here, \( K_1 = \beta_1 = 9 \), \( K_2 = \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2 = 9 \cdot 40 = 360 \), \( K_3 = \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2 \cdot \beta_3 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 = 22680 \), and \( K_4 = \beta_1 \cdot \beta_2 \cdot \beta_3 \cdot \beta_4 = 22680 \cdot 16 = 362880 \).

3. **Denominator Calculation**:
   - Compute the denominator:
     \[
     1 + K_1 [\text{SCN}] + K_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + K_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + K_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     K_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \quad K_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 360 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 3.6, \quad K_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 22680 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 22.68, \quad K_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 362880 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 36.288
     \]
   - Sum:
     \[
     0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 63.468
     \]
   - Total denominator:
     \[
     1 + 63.468 = 64.468
     \]

4. **Free Co\(^{2+}\) Concentration**:
   - Using the total cobalt concentration:
     \[
     [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{c(\text{Co})}{\text{denominator}} = \frac{10^{-2}}{64.468} \approx 1.55 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}.
     \]

5. **Concentrations of Complexes**:
   - Compute the concentration of each complex:
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_n]^{2+} = K_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}]^n
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     - \( n = 1 \): \( [\text{CoSCN}]^{2+} = 9 \cdot 1.55 \times 10^{-4} \cdot 0.1 = 1.395 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M} \)
     - \( n = 2 \): \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2+} = 360 \cdot 1.55 \times 10^{-4} \cdot (0.1)^2 = 5.58 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M} \)
     - \( n = 3 \): \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_3]^{2+} = 22680 \cdot 1.55 \times 10^{-4} \cdot (0.1)^3 = 3.515 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \)
     - \( n = 4 \): \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^{2-} = 362880 \cdot 1.55 \times 10^{-4} \cdot (0.1)^4 = 5.625 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \)

6. **Fractions of Each Complex**:
   - Normalize each concentration to the total cobalt concentration (\( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)):
     - \( f_1 = \frac{1.395 \times 10^{-4}}{10^{-2}} = 0.01395 \, (1.395\%) \)
     - \( f_2 = \frac{5.58 \times 10^{-4}}{10^{-2}} = 0.0558 \, (5.58\%) \)
     - \( f_3 = \frac{3.515 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} = 0.3515 \, (35.15\%) \)
     - \( f_4 = \frac{5.625 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} = 0.5625 \, (56.25\%) \)

7. **Blue Dithiocyanato Complexes**:
   - The blue dithiocyanato complex is assumed to be \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2+} \), corresponding to \( n = 2 \).
   - Its fraction is \( f_2 = 5.58\% \).

### Conclusion:
The calculated fraction of the blue dithiocyanato complex (\( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2+} \)) is \( 5.58\% \), but this value does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem interprets the stability constants differently (e.g., as overall constants for each complex), the fraction of \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^{2+} \) could align with **Option D (16.9%)**. Given the options, the most reasonable answer is:

ANSWER: D
