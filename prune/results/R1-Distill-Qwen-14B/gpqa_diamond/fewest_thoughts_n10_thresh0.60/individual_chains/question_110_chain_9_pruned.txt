Alright, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are visible to both instruments based on their apparent magnitudes. Let's start by understanding the problem.

First, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, noâ€”wait, the question says brighter than 17 mag, meaning stars with V mag less than 17 (because lower magnitude numbers are brighter). Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag less than 16. Oh wait, wait: no, wait. If a star is brighter than a certain magnitude, that means its apparent magnitude is lower. Because the magnitude scale is inverted, with lower numbers meaning brighter objects.

Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So, for ESPRESSO, the apparent V magnitude should be less than 17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star's V mag is, say, 16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, so V mag less than 16.

So, both spectrographs can only detect stars that are brighter than their respective thresholds. So
