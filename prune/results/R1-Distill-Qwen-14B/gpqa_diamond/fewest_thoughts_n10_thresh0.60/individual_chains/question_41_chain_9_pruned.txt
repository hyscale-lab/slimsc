Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Hmm, let's see what it says. Alright, the question is about the speed of light in a moving medium. Let me try to break it down.

So, the setup is a light beam propagating through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v, same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is, relative to the observer.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. When the glass is moving, does that affect the speed of light inside it? I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, like the index of refraction. Oh right, the formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, c is given as 1 here, so the speed in the glass is 1/n.

But wait, the glass is moving. How does that play into it? I'm trying to think about relativity here. Oh, right, because the glass is moving relative to the lab frame, we might need to consider how velocities transform between frames. But wait, the speed of light is supposed to be constant in all inertial frames according to Einstein's postulate. So maybe the speed of light as observed in the lab is still c, but wait, the problem says the speed of light in the glass, not the speed of the light beam in the lab frame.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the question again. It asks for
