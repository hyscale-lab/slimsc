Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember that when objects move, it affects how light behaves, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

So the setup: a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. And they give four options.

Wait, I think this involves special relativity here. Because when the medium itself is moving, the speed of light in that medium as observed in another frame (like the lab frame) might not just be c/n, right? Because from the lab frame, the glass is moving, so we have to consider how velocities transform between frames.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium at rest is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But when the medium is moving, does that affect it? Or is it that the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, according to special relativity?

Hold on, I'm confused. Because in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. So if the glass is moving, but the light is inside the glass, then the speed of the light relative to the lab frame would be... wait, but the glass is a medium, not a vacuum. So maybe the usual scenario would be that the light's speed in the glass is c/n, but then the glass is moving, so we have to add the velocities or something?

Wait, no, velocity addition in relativity isn't that straightforward. Let me think. In special relativity, velocities don't simply add up with a simple vector sum. Instead, you use the velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, that's when you have a frame S moving at velocity v relative to frame S', and you want to find the velocity u' of an object in S'.

Wait, no, maybe I have it backwards. Let me recall: If frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to frame S, then the velocity u of an object in S is related to the velocity u' in S' by u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u'
