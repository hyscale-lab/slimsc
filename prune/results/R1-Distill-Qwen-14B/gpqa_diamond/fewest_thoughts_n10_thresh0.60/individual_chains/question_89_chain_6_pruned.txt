Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about some reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and going through several steps to produce a product 3, whose NMR spectrum we're supposed to analyze. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's like a really rigid molecule with four cyclohexane rings fused together. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons, probably opposite each other.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's dehydrohalogenation or some kind of elimination reaction. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. Oh wait, when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they typically undergo elimination to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide. The bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure, which are not adjacent. So maybe it's a different kind of elimination.

Wait, perhaps it's a neighboring group elimination. Alternatively, could it be a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene via an E2 mechanism? But for E2, the leaving groups have to be anti-periplanar. Let me think about the structure. In adamantane, the bridgehead carbons are each attached to two other bridgeheads. So if the bromines are on 1 and 3, maybe they're on adjacent bridgeheads? No, wait, in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to two adjacent bridgeheads. So 1 and 3 might be separated by a couple of carbons, but not adjacent.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination. Since KOH is in excess, perhaps two E2 reactions happen. So each Br leaves, and two Hs are abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, in adamantane, each bridgehead is a CH2 group? No, wait, adamantane has each bridgehead as a CH group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on CH2 groups? Or are the bridgeheads CH2
