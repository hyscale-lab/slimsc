Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out which compound it is based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the question mentions that the compound was analyzed using FTIR and 1H NMR. So I'll need to look at both sets of data.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The broad absorption at around 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of an -OH group. Broad peaks in that region are typically from O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). Now, in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1, and the O-H is very broad, which fits with the data given. So the compound probably has both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and some substituents.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. It says that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens, which means there are no double bonds or adjacent hydrogens in the molecule. So the structure doesn't have any vinyl groups, which rules out any possibility of conjugated double bonds or something that would have protons on adjacent carbons.

The NMR also shows some complex splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplet of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. I think these splitting patterns come from the coupling of protons on adjacent carbons, maybe in a di-substituted or more complex environment.

Looking at the options given:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

I need to figure out which of these structures matches the spectroscopic data.

Let me try to draw each structure mentally.

Option A: The structure would be something like a central C with two C2H5 groups, another CH2 group attached to a COOH. Wait, no. Wait, the formula for A is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So that's a five-carbon chain, with two substituents on the second and third carbons. The substituents are ethyl groups on each of those.

Option B: The formula is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So here, the COOH is at the end, and the substituents are ethyl groups on the second and third carbons. So the structure is like CH2CH2... Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The main chain is: CH3CH2 is the first two carbons. Then the third carbon (C) is connected to a H and a C2H5 group, and the fourth carbon is also connected to H and C2H5. So it's a four-carbon chain with substituents on carbons 3 and 4, leading to the COOH on carbon 4.

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the structure would have two CH3 groups on each of the second and third carbons, connected to a CH2COOH group. So each of those middle carbons (C2 and C3) have two methyl groups attached. So the structure
