Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So, the question is about the wave function of a particle in a tube, and we're supposed to find the value of 'a'. 

Alright, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wave functions usually need to satisfy certain conditions, right? Like, they must be normalized. Oh right! The total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should be 1.

But wait, in this case, the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this region. Oh, but wait, the given wave function isn't exactly zero outside. Oh, wait, the question says when measuring, none were found at x <1 and x>3. So I think that means the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3. Because if a particle is in a bound state, its wave function would be zero beyond certain points.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) -0.5i. Hmm, that seems to be a complex function. So when taking the absolute square, the probability density would be the square of the modulus of the wave function. So |ψ(x)|² = [ (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about complex numbers. The wave
