Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm-1. The NMR data includes several signals, but none are vinyl hydrogens. There are specific splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. The options are four different structures, and I need to choose the correct one.

Let me start by breaking down the IR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm-1 usually indicates O-H stretching. That's a strong peak for hydroxyl groups, like in carboxylic acids. The peak at 1700 cm-1 is a strong absorption, which is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O). So, the compound likely has both a carboxylic acid group and a carbonyl group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, carboxylic acid has both O-H and C=O. Oh, wait, the 1700 peak in a carboxylic acid is actually around 1700, right? So the compound is probably a carboxylic acid. The broad peak at 3000 is the O-H stretch, which is common for carboxylic acids because their O-H is acidic and they tend to form hydrogen bonds, leading to a broad peak.

Now, looking at the NMR. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so we can eliminate any structures with double bonds? Wait, actually, looking at the options, I don't see any with double bonds. All the options are carboxylic acids with various substituents. So no need to worry about vinyl protons in the NMR.

The NMR has two specific splitting patterns. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm. Splitting patterns in NMR are determined by the number of
