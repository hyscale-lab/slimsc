Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. So, Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is about 277 K, which is pretty close to 0 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0, so 277 is around 4°C. Hmm, but wait, 277 K is about 4°C, right.

The product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog. So I'm trying to think, what reagents are used in organic chemistry that fit this scenario.

Also, X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe it's something like hydrogen with a deuterium isotope? Or maybe something like oxygen with a heavier isotope? Not sure yet.

Let me break down the reactions. The first part: X reacts with Y (liquid) violently. What liquids react violently? Maybe water? Or perhaps another liquid like something else. Wait, the reaction produces a gas W where the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think about what gas that could be.

If the gas's molecule has equal protons and neutrons, that suggests maybe something like NH3 (but that's a liquid at room temp), or perhaps CO2? Wait, CO2 has 1 carbon (6 protons, 6 neutrons if it's the most common isotope), and two oxygens. Wait, but the molecule would have a total of 6 protons and 6*2=12 neutrons? Wait, no, each CO2 molecule is C (protons=6, neutrons=6 for C-12) and two O (each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons if it's O-16). So each CO2 molecule would have 6+ (8*2) =
