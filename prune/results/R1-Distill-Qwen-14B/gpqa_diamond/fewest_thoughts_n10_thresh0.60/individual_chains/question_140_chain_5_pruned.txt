Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is a bit complex, but I'll take it piece by piece.

First, let's read the problem again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The problem says: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. So, I think about what substance has a melting point around that. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, water freezes at 273 K, which is 0Â°C, so 277 K is slightly above that. Maybe B is something like ice, but that's not right because ice melts at 273 K. Wait, maybe B is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's another compound. I'm a bit stuck here.

Next, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. So, the product has two oxygens. Keto acid... oh wait, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like something like acetoacetic acid? Or maybe it's something else.

Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So, what reagents are commonly used? Maybe something like Grignard reagents? Because Grignard reagents are used in various organic reactions. Oh, wait, Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds, like RMgX. So maybe X is a magnesium-containing compound.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction. If X reacts with liquid Y, which could be a halogen, like maybe Y is a dihalide? Or perhaps an acid. Wait, Grignard reagents react with acids to produce alkanes, but maybe in this case, the reaction is different.

Wait, the reaction of X with Y produces gas W. Let me think: If X is a Grignard reagent, RMgX, and Y is something like water or an acid, it would react violently. For example, Grignard reagents react with water to produce alkane gas (like methane, ethane, etc.), magnesium hydroxide, and heat. So, gas W would be an alkane. 

But wait, the molecule of gas W has the same number of neut
