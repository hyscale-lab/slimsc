Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what reagent A and catalyst B are from the given options.

Hmm. So, the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me draw that out in my mind. The cyclohexylidenemethyl group is a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene bridge, right? So, like, a cyclohexene (which is a six-membered ring with a double bond) connected to the pyrrolidine ring via a CH2 group. Wait, no, cyclohexylidene is CH2 connected to the cyclohexene. So, the structure would be where the 1-position of pyrrolidine has a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexene ring.

So, the reaction is starting with 3-methylpyrrolidine. The product is a ring-expanded or perhaps a fused ring? Or maybe adding a substituent. Wait, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? Or perhaps an alkylation.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the cyclohexylidene part is a cyclohexene ring. So, that suggests the formation of a ring through some kind of cyclization or addition.

Wait, the starting material is pyrrolidine. The product has a new substituent at the 1-position, which is a cyclohexylidene methyl group. So, maybe it's an alkylation or some kind of ring-forming reaction.

The reaction is acid-catalyzed. So, the catalyst is an acid, either TsOH or acetic acid, as the options suggest.

What kind of reactions involve acid catalysis with amines and carbonyl compounds? Maybe an imine formation? Or perhaps a substitution.

Wait, in the product, the
