Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergent integrals or infinities that come up when calculating things like loop diagrams. It's a way to make the calculations finite so we can handle the infinities more systematically, maybe with renormalization.

Wait, so the question is asking which theory never needs regularization. That means I'm looking for a theory that doesn't have these kinds of divergences, or perhaps doesn't require this technique because it's already finite.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. Since it's a theory that incorporates both quantum mechanics and general relativity, maybe it doesn't have the same kinds of divergences as other quantum field theories. Or wait, string theory does use perturbation theory with Feynman diagrams, so maybe it still has divergences. But I've heard that string theories can sometimes have problems with certain infinities, but perhaps they are tamed in a different way, like through the use of the string tension or other mechanisms. Or maybe because it's a theory that works at high energies, it doesn't require the same kind of regularization as other QFTs. Not sure yet.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. I remember that QCD does have issues with things like Landau poles and maybe confinement, but when it comes to regularization, I think it requires it because of loop divergences. For example, when you calculate things like beta functions or running coupling constants, you have to regularize the theory, maybe using methods like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization. So QCD would require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, and it's a well-understood QFT. I know that QED has issues with divergences, especially in higher-order loop diagrams like the electron self-energy and the photon vacuum polarization. Because of that, QED definitely requires regularization, like using cutoff regularization or other methods before renormalization. So QED is out.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, wait, this is the classical version, not the quantum one. Classical theories don't involve the same kind of infinities because they don't have the same mathematical framework. In classical electrodynamics, you don't have renormalization because you don't quantize the fields. So there's no need for regularization in the quantum sense. But wait, does classical theory have any issues with infinities? Like, for example, the self-energy of a charge moving in its own field might lead to some infinities, but I think in classical physics, these are handled differently or perhaps ignored. Or maybe the question is more about whether regularization is a part of the theory's standard approach.

Wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if a theory is free from divergences, it won't
