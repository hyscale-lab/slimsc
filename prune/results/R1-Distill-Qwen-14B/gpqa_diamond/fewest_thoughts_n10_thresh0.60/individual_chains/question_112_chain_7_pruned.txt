Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem involves an electron state |alpha> which is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. The task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation is given by Aij. Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step. I'll probably need to use some quantum mechanics concepts, like eigenvalues, orthonormality, and expectation values.

First, let's write down what the operator A looks like. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down states), and Aij is hbar/2 when i ≠ j, and zero otherwise. So, the matrix should look like:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, that's the matrix for the spin-x operator, maybe? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so perhaps A is proportional to that. But I'm not sure if that's important right now. Let me focus on the problem.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So, the state can be written as |alpha> = a (1+i)|up> + a (2 - i)|down>, where a is the normalization constant. Wait, but the question says it's proportional to that, so first I need to normalize the state.

So step one: normalize |alpha>. The state must satisfy <alpha|alpha> = 1.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 -i). Let's compute the norm.

The norm squared is |1+i|² + |2-i|².

Calculating each term:

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1=2.

|2 -i|² = (2)^
