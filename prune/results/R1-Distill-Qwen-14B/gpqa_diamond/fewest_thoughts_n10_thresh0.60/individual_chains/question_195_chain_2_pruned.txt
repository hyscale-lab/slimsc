Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about planets transiting and occulting around a star. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

So the setup is that there are two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has Earth's radius, and it's transiting with an impact parameter of 0.2. The star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of the first planet is 3 days. Now, the question is about the maximum orbital period of a second planet (with 2.5 Earth radii) that will also show both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Wait, transit and occultation events. Oh right, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked, causing a dip too, but this is harder to detect because the planet's light is so much dimmer than the star's.

But for both events to happen, the planet's orbital period must be such that both events are observable. Oh wait, but waitâ€”transit and occultation require that the planet's orbit is aligned with our line of sight. But more importantly, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that they can both transit and occult. But I think the main point here is about the timing of when the planet goes in front and behind the star relative to the observer.

Wait, no. For a planet to have both transit and occultation events, it must pass in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star as seen from Earth. But to have both, the orbital period must be such that it can do both. Wait, but the planet's orbital period is the time it takes to go around the star. So, for a transit and occultation to occur, the planet must be in a position where, during its orbit, it can cross in front and then behind the star.

Wait, but all transiting planets will also have an occultation, but it's the other way around. Wait, no, because the planet's orbital period is the time it takes to orbit the star. So, if it transits, then after half an orbital period, it would be on the opposite side of the star. So from our perspective, if we can
