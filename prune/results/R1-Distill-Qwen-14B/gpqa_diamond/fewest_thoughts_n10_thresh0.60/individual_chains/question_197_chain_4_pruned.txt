Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of elimination or substitution reaction, maybe a phosphorylation or something else. Wait, no, waitâ€”I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroxy-mercuration or maybe in the formation of ylides? Or wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, when you have an alkyl halide and red phosphorus, it might be part of the preparation of a ylide, like in the Wittig reaction. Oh right! Because the Wittig reagent is typically made from an alkyl halide and triphenylphosphine, but wait, red phosphorus doesn't have the same structure as triphenylphosphine. Wait, maybe I'm confusing different reactions.

Wait, the reaction in question is between compound X and red phosphorus and HI. Oh, wait, I think when an alkyl halide reacts with red phosphorus and iodide, it forms a phosphorus ylide. Or wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI to form an acyl phosphorane, which is a ylide. No, wait, wait.
