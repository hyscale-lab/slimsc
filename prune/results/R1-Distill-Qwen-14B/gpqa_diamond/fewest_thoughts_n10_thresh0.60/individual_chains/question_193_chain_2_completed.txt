Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm. So the number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/plx^5. Wait, parallax is inversely related to distance, right? Yeah, I remember that parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance.

Got it. So if plx is 1/r, then 1/plx would be r. But in the question, it's 1/(plx^5), so that would be r^5. Because (1/plx)^5 is (r)^5. So the number of stars N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait. How does the number of stars change with distance per unit range? Oh, right, because the problem is asking about how the number of stars changes as you move a unit distance away. So maybe I need to think about the differential change. Like, how many stars are there per unit distance.

Wait, let's think this through. The formula given is N ~ 1/plx^5. So substituting plx = 1/r, gives N ~ r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But wait, does that make sense? Because I think in reality, the number of stars you can see should increase with distance, but not exponentially. Oh, but maybe this is a made-up scenario.

So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then for each increase in r, the number of stars increases by r^5. But wait, the options are given in terms of how N changes with r, like the relationship between N and r. So if N ~ r^5, then that would be option B. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait, the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, plx = 1/r. Substitute that in: N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5 = r^5. So yes, N is proportional to r^5. So when r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So the correct option is B, which is ~r^5.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because another way to think about it is that maybe the number of stars in a spherical shell (like a thin shell at distance r) would depend on the surface area, which is 4πr², and perhaps some density factor. But in this case, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which leads to N ∝ r^5 regardless of other factors. So unless there's a misunderstanding in the question, the answer should be B.

Wait, another thought: the number of stars you observe depends on both the volume (so r^3) and perhaps the surface area (r^2), depending on how you're observing. But in this case, the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which is r^5. So the answer is B.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the given relationship gives:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

Thus, the number of stars is proportional to \( r^5 \). This means that as the distance \( r \) increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of \( r \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
