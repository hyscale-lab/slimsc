Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra.

Hmm, okay, so first, I should probably analyze the IR and NMR data to determine what Compound X is. Once I know what X is, I can figure out what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI to find the product.

Let me look at the IR data first. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. There's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Another peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. So the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group. But wait, when a carboxylic acid is present, the IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1, which matches the first IR region given.

So, putting it together, the IR suggests a carboxylic acid (1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, but wait, wait. Wait, carboxylic acids actually have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. So that fits. The IR has a peak at 1720, which might be a bit higher, but maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or something else. Alternatively, could it be an ester? No, because the 10.5 ppm in NMR is more like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the IR would have a very broad O-H stretch, but the given IR shows 3400–2500 as a broad region. So that makes sense. So, the compound is a benzoic acid derivative, perhaps.

Looking at the NMR again. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest an aromatic ring with two substituents because of the doublets. The two doublets probably indicate a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like, for example, in para-substituted benzene, the protons would split into two doublets. So, this suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, maybe with two substituents.

Wait, the integration is 2H for each. So the substituents are probably in the para positions.
