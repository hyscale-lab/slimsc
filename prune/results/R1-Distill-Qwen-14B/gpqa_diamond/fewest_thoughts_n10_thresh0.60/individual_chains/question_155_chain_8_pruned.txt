Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty of the operator P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The uncertainty is ΔP_z, and I need to compute it using the provided matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z.

Hmm, right. The uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for P_z, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, but wait. The state is given as a column vector, so I can use that to compute the expectation values. The state is |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that down as a vector:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; sqrt(1/2); -1/2 ]

Wait, no, the vector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Oh, right, 1/sqrt(2) is the second component.

So the first thing is to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ, and ⟨P_z²⟩, which is ψ† P_z² ψ. Then ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, but wait a second. P_z is given as a matrix. Let me write down P_z:

P_z matrix is:
[ [ħ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So, it's a diagonal matrix. That might make calculations easier because diagonal matrices are straightforward to apply.

Since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, in this basis, the vector |ψ⟩ is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of P_z. Let me confirm that: the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z
