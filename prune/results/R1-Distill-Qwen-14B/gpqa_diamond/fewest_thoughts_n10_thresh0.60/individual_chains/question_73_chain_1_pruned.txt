Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my studies.

Alright, so the problem states that astronaut A has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? Because at high speeds, you can't just do v_rel = v_A - v_B. I remember something about using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Oh wait, but wait, since both are moving in the same direction, v1 would be the velocity of A, and v2 would be the velocity of B. So the relative speed of A as seen from B would be (vA - vB)/(1 - (vA vB)/(c²)).

So substituting the values: vA is 0.6c, vB is 0.5c. Plugging these into the formula gives (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's calculate the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's a start.

Now for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy isn't just kinetic; it's their relativistic energy. So the total energy would be the sum of their rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies, but wait, no, the total energy in relativity is given by gamma times m c squared for each, then sum them.

Wait, each astronaut's energy is gamma * m_i * c², where m_i is their rest mass. So for
