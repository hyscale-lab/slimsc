Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The problem is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, I remember from my physics class that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities like you would in classical mechanics. So, for relative speed, I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1*v2)/(cÂ²)). 

Wait, but wait, the velocities are both in the same direction. So one is moving at 0.6c, the other at 0.5c, both positive x. So, from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.5c, what would be the speed of the other astronaut? Or wait, maybe vice versa. Oh right, the relative speed is how much faster one is moving compared to the other. So if astronaut A is at 0.6c, and astronaut B is at 0.5c, then A is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c in the same direction as B's frame. But wait, that's the classical approach, but relativity doesn't work that way. So I have to use the relativistic formula.

So applying the formula
