Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what it's asking.

Alright, the question is about comparing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and also a mass 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. There's this formula called the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says that Luminosity (L) is proportional to radius squared (R²) multiplied by temperature to the fourth power (T⁴). So the formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since we're dealing with ratios, the constants might cancel out.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength for a blackbody is given by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is the same, T would be the same. So both stars have the same temperature? That's an important point.

Wait, but wait. The radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, which I think means it's not moving towards or away from us—maybe it's at rest relative to us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Do I need to consider Doppler shift here? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength would shift.

Ah, right! The wavelength we observe (λ_observed) is affected by the star's velocity. The formula for Doppler shift is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, in this case, Star_1 has v_r=0,
