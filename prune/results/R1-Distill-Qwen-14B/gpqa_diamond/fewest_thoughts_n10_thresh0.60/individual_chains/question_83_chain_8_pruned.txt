Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So, the acid will neutralize with the base until it's all converted, which is the equivalence point.

First, I think I need to figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. So, the initial acetic acid solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So, the concentration after dilution would be half, right? Because volume is doubled, concentration is halved. So 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. So, the diluted acetic acid has a concentration of 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait a second. When you have a solution and you dilute it, the number of moles stays the same. So, initial moles of acetic acid: M = mol/volume(L). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L, so the new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So, moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

But the question is about 25% titration. Since the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, 25% would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait, the 25% is probably of the total needed to reach equivalence. So, the equivalence is 10 cm³. So 25% titration is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. That makes sense.

So, first, let's handle the 25% titration point. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion.

The reaction is:
CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the moles of NaOH added at 25% titration are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Because 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 mol. So, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is original solution (40
