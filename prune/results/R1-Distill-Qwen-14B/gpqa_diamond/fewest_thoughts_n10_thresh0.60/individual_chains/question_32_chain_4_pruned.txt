Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The options are A, B, C, D with various GeV values.

Hmm, first, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Lithium usually has an atomic number of 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, that would mean the mass number is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So it's Li-6. Is that right? Yeah, because Li typically has isotopes; Li-6 is a common isotope.

Next, the problem involves relativistic speeds because 0.96c is pretty close to the speed of light. So I'll probably need to use the relativistic energy equations.

I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can compute gamma.

Let me compute that. Let's see, v = 0.96c so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.0784). Let me think. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? 0.28 *0.28 = 0.0784. Yes. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/(0.28) which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me do the calculation step by step.

v = 0.96c, so beta = v/c = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )

Compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 *0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, as I thought. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Now, I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. But wait, the question is about the energy of the RHIC. So the collider imparts kinetic energy, right? Or is it the total energy?

Wait, the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" so I think that refers to the total energy of each ion. Because in colliders, the particles are accelerated to a certain energy, which is usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes expressed as the total energy. I might have to be careful here.

Wait, no. In particle physics, when we talk about
