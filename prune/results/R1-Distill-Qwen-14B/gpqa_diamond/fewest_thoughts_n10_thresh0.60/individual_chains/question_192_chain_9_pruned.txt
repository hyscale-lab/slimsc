Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll do my best.

The problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity with radius r, and the center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So imagine a big sphere, and inside it, a smaller sphere (the cavity) not exactly at the center. The distance between their centers is s, and r is less than R, so the cavity is entirely within the conductor.

Then, there's a small positive charge +q placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside the conductor. Also, the angle between l (from the cavity's center to P) and s (the distance between the conductor's and cavity's centers) is theta.

The options are formulas for E. I think I need to figure out which one correctly describes the electric field at point P.

Hmm. I remember that conductors have some properties regarding electric fields and charges. When a conductor is neutral, any enclosed charge doesn't affect the exterior field because the charges redistribute on the surface. But wait, here the conductor is uncharged. So initially, it's neutral. But then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity.

Wait, when a conductor is neutral and you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's charges respond. Since the conductor is neutral, the net charge on it is zero. So, the presence of +q inside the cavity must induce a charge on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Induced charges: The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) would have a charge of -q. Because the +q charge attracts opposite charges. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to keep the conductor's net charge zero (since it was initially neutral). Wait, is that right? Let me think: The conductor is neutral, so it can't have any net charge. The charge inside the cavity is +q, which induces -q on the inner surface. Therefore, the outer surface must
