Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Let me read the question carefully.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity of radius r, and the cavity's center is offset by a distance s from the conductor's center. So, s is the separation between the two centers, right? And r is less than R. 

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. Both l and L are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. I remember from my studies that when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So let me think about the induced charges.

Inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field is zero. So any charges in the conductor will rearrange themselves. But since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it must be zero. So when we place +q inside the cavity, the conductor will have induced charges. 

Wait, right. The inner cavity has a charge +q, so the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor's material is a conductor, the charges move to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. So the cavity's charge induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface.

But since the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the total induced charge must balance the inner charge. So inner surface is -q, outer surface is +q, and conductor has a net zero charge.

Now, point P is outside the conductor, so it's beyond radius R. The question is about the electric field at P. Since P is outside the conductor, the field there should be due to all the charges enclosed within the Gaussian surface that encloses P. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, so the field at P would be as if all that charge is concentrated at the center. Because for a spherical charge distribution, the field outside is
