Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and the reaction involves three steps: first with NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aq. KOH and heat. I need to figure out the final product from the options provided.

Hmm. Let's start by interpreting the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. 

The NMR peaks are:
- 9.72 ppm: a triplet (t), 1H. That's a pretty high shift, maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but wait—if it's an aldehyde, the proton is usually a singlet because there's no neighboring protons. Wait, maybe it's something else. Maybe an acidic proton, like an aromatic OH? But wait, those are usually broad or under other conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol proton or something else.

Wait, but let's think about the shifts. 9.72 t (1H). Maybe it's an aldehyde, but why a triplet? That's confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinylic proton next to an electronegative group. Or perhaps an alpha proton to a carbonyl group. Or maybe it's an aromatic proton in a very deshielded environment, but that's less likely.

Another peak is 6.98 ppm, a doublet (d) of 2H. That's in the aromatic region, maybe para-substituted. For example, two protons as a doublet—could be a pair of aromatic protons next to substituents. Let's say, maybe a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents. Or perhaps adjacent protons in a di-substituted ring.

Then 6.51 ppm, another doublet (d), 2H. Also aromatic. If the first peak is at 6.98, maybe that's a pair of protons on one substituent, and 6.51 on another. So perhaps a di-substituted benzene ring, maybe with two substituents in para positions, each causing the neighboring protons to
