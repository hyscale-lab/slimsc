Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me think about the possible structures. The formula has 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Wait, so the degree of unsaturation might give me some clues. The formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation.

Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. Wait, wait, wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2? Or wait, I think the correct formula is (2 + 2C - H - X + N)/2. So plugging in C=8, H=9, X=0, N=1: (2 + 16 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring and some double bonds or rings. Like maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and a double bond (1 more) and a carbonyl group (another double bond), but wait, that would be more than five. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me recount: benzene is 3 double bonds (so 4 degrees?), wait no. Each ring or double bond is a degree. So benzene has three double bonds, which is three degrees, but wait, wait, the degree of unsaturation counts each ring and each double bond as one. So a benzene ring has three double bonds, which is three degrees, plus maybe a ring (like a cyclohexane would be one degree for the ring). Wait, no, cyclohexane is a ring, which is one degree. So benzene is a ring plus three double bonds? No, no, wait. Benzene has three double bonds, but since it's a ring, each double bond is part of the ring structure. So benzene contributes 4 degrees: one for the ring and three for the double bonds. Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again.

Wait, the degree of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO:

2*8 +2 =18, 18 -9=9, 9 +1 (from N)=10. 10/2=5. So five degrees. Each benzene ring accounts for (3 double bonds +1 ring) but wait, no, a benzene ring has one ring and three double bonds, which is four degrees. So if we have a benzene ring, that's four degrees, leaving one more. So another double bond or another ring or a carbonyl group.

But the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde or something with a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, plus
