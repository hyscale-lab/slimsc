Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two specific spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Oh, right, it's brighter than 17. So, stars with V mag less than or equal to 17 can be observed because lower magnitude means brighter. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star's V mag is 17 or less, ESPRESSO can see it.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16. Because again, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star is 16 or brighter (like, magnitude 16 is dimmer than 15, so I'm a bit confused here. Wait, no, wait. The question says "brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." So, that means apparent magnitude less than 16. Because higher magnitude means dimmer. So, if a star has an apparent V magnitude of 15, it's brighter than 16, so HIRES can see it. If it's 16, it's exactly at the limit, so maybe it can be observed, but I'm not sure. But for simplicity, I'll assume that 16 and below are within the detection range.

Wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag. So, apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. For HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag <=16.

Wait, no, wait. The way it's phrased is a bit tricky. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, brighter than 17. So, since lower magnitudes are brighter, the apparent V mag should be less than 17. Because if a star's V mag is 16, it's brighter than 17, so it's observable. Similarly, for HIRES, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 16 (so less than 16) can be observed.

So, for a star to be detected by both spectrographs, it must have an apparent V magnitude <=17 (for ESPRESSO) and <=16 (for HIRES). Wait, no. Wait, because to be detected by both, the star's apparent V mag must be within both telescopes' capabilities. So, the star's apparent V mag must be <=17 for ESPRESSO, and <=16 for HIRES. So, the star's V mag must be <=16 to be detected by both. Because if it's 17, it's detectable by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, their apparent V mag is less than 16.0. Because if a star has V=16, it's exactly at the limit. But since it's "brighter than 16", that would be V <16.

Wait, but this is a bit confusing. The way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, the maximum V mag that ESPRESSO can observe is 17. So any star with V <17 is acceptable.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V <16.

So, for a star to be observed by both, it's V mag must be <16. Because if V is between 16 and 17, it's only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

So, the stars that have apparent V mag <=16 can be detected by both. But let's look at each star and compute their apparent V magnitudes.

Wait, so each star's absolute magnitude is given, or in some cases, their apparent magnitude is given. Let me check each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag of 15.5, located at 10 pc. So, the apparent V mag can be calculated using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 log10 (d /10), where d is distance in pc.

So for Star1: m =15.5 +5*(log10(10/10))=15.5 +5*(0)=15.5. So, m=15.5. Which is less than 16, so it's observable by both. Because 15.5 <16.

Star2: Apparent V mag of 16.5, which is above 16. So
