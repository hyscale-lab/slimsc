Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

So the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, when we talk about excitation, that usually relates to the Boltzmann distribution. I remember that the distribution tells us about how particles are distributed in different energy states at thermal equilibrium.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, that's right! So the energy difference ΔE is k_B * something. Let me write that down: ΔE = k_B * T * something else? Wait, no. The Boltzmann factor is the probability of a particle being in a higher energy state compared to a lower one. The ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann equation: n_upper / n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)).

Wait, in this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the ratio n1/n2 is 2. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. Star_1 has twice the excitation in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the population of the excited state (let's say level 2) is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. So n2_1 / n2_2 = 2. Or perhaps, the ratio of the excited state to the lower state in each star. Hmm.

Wait, no, maybe the setup is that for each star, the excitation level is measured relative to a common lower state. So each star has its own ratio of n_upper to n_lower, which depends on their temperatures.

Wait, let's think again. Let's denote the two energy levels as E2 and E1, where E2 > E1. The excitation is the population in E2 relative to E1. So for each star, the excitation ratio is n2/n1. From the Boltzmann distribution, n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k_B T) ). 

In star_1, the ratio is 2, and in star_2, it's 1. Because the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, no, the problem says that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, perhaps that means that the ratio n2_1/n1_1 is twice the ratio n2_2/n1_2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is comparing the excitation relative to the same lower level, but in their respective stars.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each star's situation. Let me denote:

For star_1: n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 (since it's twice as excited as star_2's ratio). No, wait, no. The question says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So perhaps the ratio (n2/n1) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So if for star_2, (n2_2/n1_2) = x, then for star_1, it's 2x.

But wait, the problem says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So maybe it's the same energy level in each case. Wait, no, the same specific energy level. Oh wait, wait, perhaps each star has the same transition, say from E1 to E2. So E2 - E1 is the same for both stars. That makes sense because it's the same iron atoms.

So for each star, the ratio of the upper level (E2) to lower level (E1) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1: (n2_1)/(n1_1) = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T_1) ), and for star_2: (n2_2)/(n1_2) = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T_2) ). 

But the question states that star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. So, n2_1/n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2). So:

exp( -ΔE/(k_B T_1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T_2) )

Taking natural log on both sides:

-ΔE/(k_B T_1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k_B T_2) ]

Let me rearrange this equation. 

Move the terms involving T:

-ΔE/(k_B T_1) + ΔE/(k_B T_2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k_B):

ΔE/(k_B) [ 1/(T_2) - 1/(T_1) ] = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by k_B/ΔE:

1/(T_2) - 1/(T_1) = (k_B ln(2) ) / ΔE

Wait, but ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. And k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K. So let's compute (k_B ln(2)) / ΔE.

k_B = 1.38e-23 J/K.

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So (k_B * ln2 ) / ΔE = (1.38e-23 * ln2 ) / (1.38e-23 ) ) 

The 1.38e-23 terms cancel out, so it's ln(2).

So the equation becomes:

1/(T_2) - 1/(T_1) = ln(2)

Alternatively, 1/(T_2) = 1/(T_1) + ln(2)

Wait, but that can't be correct, because I think I made a mistake in the sign. Let me go back.

In the earlier step:

We had:

-ΔE/(k_B T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k_B T_2)

Bring all terms to one side:

-ΔE/(k_B T_1) + ΔE/(k_B T_2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k_B):

ΔE/(k_B) [ 1/(T_2) - 1/(T_1) ] = ln(2)

So,

[1/(T2) - 1/T1] = ln(2) * (k_B / ΔE )

But [k_B / ΔE ] = [1.38e-23 J/K ] / [1.38e-23 J] = 1/K * (J cancels with denominator J), wait wait, no.

Wait, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k_B * 1 K. Because ΔE = k_B * T * something? Wait, no, no. Let me compute k_B / ΔE.

k_B = 1.38e-23 J/K.

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So k_B / ΔE = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = (1 J/(K)) ) / (1 J) ) * (1/(K)) )? Wait, no, units: J/(K) divided by J is 1/K. So 1.38e-23 J/K / 1.38e-23 J = (1 J/K) / (1 J) ) = 1/K.

So k_B / ΔE = 1 K^-1.

So [1/(T2) - 1/T1] = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1}) ) → [1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Hmm, but wait, how does this relate to the options given?

Looking at the options:

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2)

Wait, let's see.

We have 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2). Let's rewrite the left side:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is option D. Because option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ).

Yes, that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. Our equation after rearrangement is 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2). Let me write that as:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

So, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ). So that's option D.

So the correct equation is D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the populations of energy levels to temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio of iron atoms in a specific energy level is given as twice as high for star_1 compared to star_2. Using the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), the excitation ratios for the two stars can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{1,1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,2}}{n_{1,2}}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and substituting the Boltzmann factor, the equation becomes:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k_B \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting this in terms of \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
