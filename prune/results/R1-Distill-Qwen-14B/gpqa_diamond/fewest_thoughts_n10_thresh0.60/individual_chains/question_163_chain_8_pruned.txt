Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide in a strong acid. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, and we need to dissolve it in 100 cm³ of solution using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. We're asked to find the minimum volume of the acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I should probably figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. Molar mass time. Iron's molar mass is about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, so three oxygens would be 48. And each OH has 17 (O=16, H=1). Wait, no, Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3, so each OH is 17, and there are three. So wait, Fe is 55.85, each OH is 17, so 3*17 is 51. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is Fe^3+ and 3 OH^- ions. So the formula is correct. So the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is Fe (55.85) + 3*(O (16) + H (1)) = 55.85 +3*(17) = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 is how many moles? Moles = mass/molar mass. So 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles.

So, Fe(OH)3 has the formula Fe(OH)3, which can be written as Fe(OH)3 → Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- when it dissolves. But when a strong acid is added, the OH^- will react with H+ ions.

Wait, the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid (like HCl, for example) would be Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ ions.

So, from the moles of Fe(OH)3, which is approximately 0.000936 moles, the moles of H+ required would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

Now, the acid is 0.1 M HCl (since it's monobasic and strong, let's assume it's HCl). So the volume needed (in liters) would be moles of H+ divided by concentration. So 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but wait, the options don't have exactly that. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. Option B is 30.09 cm³ and pH 2.69. Hmm, but wait, is there any other consideration? Like the volume change upon dissolving?

Wait, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. So the acid volume plus the solution volume after diss
