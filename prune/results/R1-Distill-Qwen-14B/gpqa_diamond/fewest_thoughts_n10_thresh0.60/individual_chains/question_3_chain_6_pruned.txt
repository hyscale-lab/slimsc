Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. I remember that expectation values are important in quantum mechanics. They basically tell us the average value we'd expect to measure for an observable in a given state.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition, specifically 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, the Pauli z-matrix. So the state is a combination of spin-up and spin-down in the z-direction.

The operator we're looking at is 10σ_z +5σ_x. I need to find the expectation value of this operator for the given state.

Hmm, I think the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate of the state multiplied by the operator acting on the state. So for an operator A, ⟨A⟩ is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩.

Since the state is already given, let me write it out. The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let's denote |↑⟩ as the first basis vector and |↓⟩ as the second. I think it's easier to represent them as a column vector. So |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So ψ can be written as a vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] transpose, because the coefficients are 0.5 for |↑⟩ and (sqrt(3)/2) for |↓⟩.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Oh, yeah, the state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. So as a column vector, it's [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. I should remember that when I compute the expectation value.

Now, the operator is 10σ_z +5σ_x. I can compute the expectation of each term separately and then add them together. Because expectation is linear.

First, let me find the expectation of σ_z. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, this should be straightforward.

The Pauli z-matrix, σ_z, is [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So when σ_z acts on |↑⟩, it gives +1 times |↑⟩, and on |↓⟩, it gives -1 times |↓⟩.

The expectation value of σ_z for a state ψ is ⟨ψ|σ_z |ψ⟩. Let me compute that.

ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ† (the conjugate transpose) is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] as well, since the coefficients are real.

So ψ† σ_z ψ is:

[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[1, 0],[0, -1]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ]

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute σ_z ψ:

σ_z * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [ (1)(0.5) + (0)(sqrt(3)/2), (0)(
