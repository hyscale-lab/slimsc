Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an effective theory that modifies the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options given are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare Symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these. I think I should break down each symmetry to understand which are required.

First, Lorentz Symmetry. I know that SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. All the operators should transform appropriately under the Lorentz group because they are part of a relativistic quantum field theory. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected. So options with 1 must include 1, which is option A, C, or D.

Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations, right? So Poincare symmetry implies the theory is invariant under Lorentz transformations and translations. But in SMEFT, when we consider effective theories, we often work in a certain frame, perhaps the center-of-momentum frame. But I think the effective theory is still supposed to be Poincare invariant because it's a low-energy effective theory of the Standard Model. Or wait, maybe not? Because SMEFT is a low-energy theory, sometimes you fix the frame, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, effective theories should still respect the same symmetries as the original theory at high energies
