Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully. The question involves two reactions, each producing a product A and B, and I need to choose the correct options from the given choices.

The first reaction is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, and H+ to give product A. The second reaction is (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol reacting with acetyl bromide in the presence of a base, LDA, to give product B.

Hmm, let me break this down. Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the spiro center. The structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro rings are nonane (nine carbons) with the substituents: a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂) and an alcohol (-OH) group on the same carbon.

The reagents are THF (a solvent, tetrahydrofuran), KH (which is potassium hydride, a strong base), and then H+ as a workup. Wait, but wait, I think I might be mixing up the conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is in THF with K-H, which is often used as a strong base in deprotonation. But then H+ is added afterward. I'm a bit confused about the exact steps here.

Wait, another thought: sometimes when a strong base like KH is used in THF, it's for deprotonating something, like an alcohol. But 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol has an -OH group. Deprotonating an alcohol would give an alkoxide. But what happens next?

Alternatively, maybe this is a vinylogous base situation. Vinylogous bases are those where a proton alpha to a carbonyl is abstracted, leading to a conjugate base. But wait, I don't see a carbonyl here. Hmm.

Wait, wait, another possibility: The starting material is an enol. Maybe it's undergoing some kind of elimination or cyclization. Since it's a spiro alcohol with a vinyl group, perhaps a Claisen or Aldol-like reaction? Or maybe it's forming a cyclic ether or something else.

Alternatively, another thought: the reaction conditions with a strong base like KH might abstract a proton adjacent to the alcohol. Wait, but the structure has an -OH on the spiro carbon. So, the adjacent carbons are connected to the rings. Let me visualize the structure.

The spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol: the spiro carbon is connected to a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring. The three-membered ring would be a cyclopropane, I think, but wait, no, the numbers in the spiro notation are the number of carbons in each ring. So [3.5] means one ring has 3 carbons (including the spiro atom) and the other has 5 (including the spiro). So the spiro is
