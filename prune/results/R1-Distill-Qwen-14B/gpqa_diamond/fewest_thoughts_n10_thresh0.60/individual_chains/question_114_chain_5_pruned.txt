Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. There are two reactions given, and four options to choose from. The options are combinations of reagents A and B, which correspond to the first and second reactions respectively.

First reaction:
Butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO, I think) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. So NaCN has CN- as the nucleophile. Wait, but what's the exact reaction here?

Wait, but when a ketone reacts with a nitrile group, maybe it's a substitution or addition. Alternatively, butan-2-one is a ketone, so adding CN- would typically proceed via a nucleophilic addition. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me try to draw that structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product would be a nitrile group added where?

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think: butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substitutions. Wait, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the n
