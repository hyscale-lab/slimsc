Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how the flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, and I need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, with various ratios.

Wait, first, I remember that the pp chain is the primary source of energy in the Sun. The pp-III branch is one part of that chain, right? Oh right, the proton-proton chain has several branches. The pp-I and pp-II branches produce lower energy neutrinos, while pp-III produces higher energy ones, I think. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, actually, the pp chain has different branches. The main branches are pp-I and pp-II, but the pp-III branch involves higher mass states, I think. Oh wait, I think pp-III is where a boron-8 nucleus is formed. Boron-8 decays into beryllium-8, which then emits a positron and a neutrino. Those are the high-energy neutrinos, like around 15-20 MeV, right? Hmm, but the question is about lower energy bands, around hundreds of keV.

Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, the
