Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, that's the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to the Earth. So if the pp-III branch stopped, the changes in neutrino flux would take about that time to be observed here. But the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands, so maybe the time delay isn't directly relevant except to set the context that the effect has reached us.

So, what's the pp-III branch? As I remember, the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, and then there are other branches like pp-II and pp-III. I think the pp-III branch is one of the less dominant branches. When it stops, the production of certain neutrinos would be affected.

Solar neutrinos are mainly produced in two main processes: the proton-proton (pp) chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. The pp chain contributes about 90% of the Sun's energy, and the CNO cycle the remaining 10%. But wait, the pp chain has different branches. The pp-I branch leads to deuterium, and the pp-II and pp-III are side reactions. Oh right, the pp-III branch is when a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus (alpha particle?), but wait no, wait. Let me get this straight.

The pp chain starts with two protons (H-1) fusing to deuterium via the pp-I branch. Then, another proton can fuse with deuterium (making tritium, then He-3), which is the pp-II branch. Or, alternatively, deuterium can capture another proton to make He-3 via the pp-III branch. Oh, so the pp-III branch is part of the main pp chain but a different path. So if the pp-III branch stops, does that affect the overall production of He-3 or other products?

Wait, solar neutrinos are produced via the beta decay steps. For example, in the pp chain, during the fusion steps, there are beta decays where a proton converts into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. So the main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos (Î½_e) emitted in these decays.

In the pp chain, one of the key steps is the fusion of He-3 into He-4, which releases two protons (H-1). But that might involve a beta decay step. Wait, perhaps I should think about where neutrinos are produced in the pp chain.

In the pp chain, the main neutrinos come from the decay of boron-8, which is a product of the CNO cycle. Wait no, wait. The main pp chain doesn't produce neutrinos directly in the same way as the CNO cycle. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the primary neutrinos come from two processes: the CNO cycle and the proton-proton chain. The CNO cycle produces more high-energy neutrinos, I think. The
