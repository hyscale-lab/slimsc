Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the answers for the three reactions given. The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which are pericyclic reactions where the terminal pi bond moves into a sigma bond. I remember that Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples of this, and these reactions are usually thermodynamically controlled.

Let's start by looking at each reaction one by one.

**First Reaction:**
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A

Hmm. The starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. The conditions are H+ and heat. I'm thinking this is a type of acid-catalyzed reaction. Maybe an example of a Claisen or Cope rearrangement? Wait, another possibility is a pinacol rearrangement, but that involves vicinal diols. Alternatively, considering the presence of amines and alcohols, perhaps the reaction is a Cope rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is H2N-C(OCH3)2. So that's a dimethoxyamine. When heated under acidic conditions, maybe it undergoes some kind of rearrangement. But I'm not recalling exactly.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol. Maybe the presence of H+ leads to some kind of hemiacetal or acetal formation? Alternatively, perhaps it's a Michael addition or some conjugate addition. Or maybe it's a Claisen-type condensation.

Wait, another possibility: Could this be a case of the Stork enamine reaction? Enamines are typically made from amines and ketones, but here we have an alcohol. Maybe not. Alternatively, considering the presence of H+ and heat, could it be a case of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement? Or maybe some kind of sigmatropic shift.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, like the Claisen or Cope. Let's see. For a Claisen rearrangement, you need an allyl vinyl ether. Do I have that? 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine... Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the amine is acting as a base or something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the two reactants are undergoing some kind of conjugate addition or a reaction where the amine attacks an allylic position. But I'm not quite getting it. Maybe I should think about the possible product.

Looking at the options for A:

Option A: 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine. That's an aminopyran, which suggests a ring formation.

Option B: (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine. That's an enamine, perhaps?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a Robinson annulation? But Robinson typically
