Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this matrix must be representing a mixed state, since it's a convex combination of pure states.

Wait, what do I know about the structure of qubit density matrices? A qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix should be a 2x2 matrix. The general form for a qubit density matrix is something like [[a, b], [c, d]], and for it to be a valid density matrix, it must be Hermitian (so a and d are real, and b is the complex conjugate of c), positive semi-definite, and have a trace of 1.

Let me compute ρ. Expanding the given expression:

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding these gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiply by 1/2, so ρ is (1/2) * I, which is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

So ρ has diagonal entries 1/2 and 1/2, and zeros off-diagonal. That makes sense because it's a completely mixed state, as both diagonal terms are equal.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The Bloch vector for a density matrix is found using the formula: r = [x, y, z], where x = (ρ_{01} + ρ_{10}) / 2, y is something else... Wait, let me get this right. The general formula for the Bloch vector components is:

x = (ρ_{01} + ρ_{10}) / 2
y = (ρ_{02} + ρ_{20}) / 2 (but wait, for a qubit, maybe it's a different index)
Wait, no. For a qubit, the density matrix can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ) / 2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector. So expanding this:

ρ = (I + σ_x r_x + σ_y r_y + σ_z r_z) / 2

So each component of r is related to the coefficients of the Pauli matrices in the expansion.

Let me compute that using our ρ matrix. Our ρ is (I)/2, because ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|) = (I)/2.

So, substituting into the expansion:

(I/2) = (I + σ_x r_x + σ_y r_y + σ_z r_z) / 2

Multiply both sides by 2:

I = I + σ_x r_x + σ_y r_y + σ_z r_z

Subtract I from both sides:

0 = σ_x r_x + σ_y r_y + σ_z r_z

Which implies that each coefficient must be zero. So r_x = r_y = r_z = 0.

Thus, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which means the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. But wait, the origin is the completely mixed state, which matches our ρ because it's a maximally mixed state.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the state |0><0|, but our ρ isn't that. It's a mixed state, so the origin makes sense.

So the correct answer should be option
