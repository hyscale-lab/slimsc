Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I need to find the energy, and the options are given as A to D.

Wait, first, I should figure out what the nucleus X is. Li is lithium. The regular lithium nucleus has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, right? Because the atomic number for Li is 3. But wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So that would mean it's a lithium-6 nucleus? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons, so Li-6.

So the mass number A is 6. So the mass of the nucleus is important because relativistic energy depends on it. I think I can use the relativistic energy equation for this.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to calculate gamma when v is 0.96c.

But wait, I also need the rest mass (m) of the nucleus. The nucleus is a collection of protons and neutrons. Maybe I can approximate the mass using the sum of the individual masses. But wait, considering binding energy would complicate things, but perhaps for this problem, we can ignore it and just use the sum of the masses of the nucleons.

Wait, but the problem might actually just want the energy in terms of the rest mass energy. Let me think. Because the mass of the nucleus is m = (number of protons * mass of proton + number of neutrons * mass of neutron). So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

I remember that the mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939 MeV/c². But wait, wait. Let me get their masses right. Proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutron about 939.565 MeV/c². Or maybe I should just use m_p and m_n with their exact values. But perhaps for this problem, using m_p ≈ 938 MeV/c² and m_n ≈ 939 MeV/c² is sufficient.

So for the nucleus X (Li-6), the rest mass m would be 3*(m_p) + 3*(m_n). Let me compute that.

3*(938 + 939) = 3*(1877) = 5631 MeV/c². Wait, but wait, 938 +939 is 1877? Let me check: 938 +939 is 1877? Wait yes, 900+900 is 1800, 38+39 is 77, so 1877. So 3*1877 is 5631 MeV/c². So m = 5631 MeV/c².

But wait, that's the sum. However, in reality, the mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum because of binding energy. But I think for this problem, we can ignore the binding energy, as it's probably beyond the intended scope. So we'll proceed with m = 5631 MeV/c².

But wait, another approach: sometimes, in problems like this, the mass is taken as the mass number times the mass of a nucleon. Since each nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1 atomic mass unit (u). But 1u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So for a nucleus with mass number A=6, m ≈ 6 * 931.5 MeV/c² = 5589 MeV/c². Hmm, but wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.014 u, right? Wait, no, let me think. The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 6.014 atomic mass units. So m = 6.014 u.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Because if I use the exact atomic mass of Li-6, which is 6.014 u, that's more precise. But I'm not sure if I remember the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass number A and the corresponding approximate mass.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since the exact mass of the nucleus is needed, maybe I can look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps it's given as part of the problem, but the problem statement doesn't give it. So maybe I need to proceed with the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that I can take the mass as A times the mass of a nucleon. So for Li-6, A=6. So m=6 * m_nucleon. And m_nucleon is about 931.5 MeV/c².

Wait, but actually, the mass of the proton is 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is 939.565 MeV/c². So maybe the average is around 938.9 MeV/c². But perhaps for simplicity, the problem uses the mass of a nucleon as 938 MeV/c².

Wait, but perhaps another approach. The mass of a nucleus is approximately A * m_nucleon minus the binding energy. But if we don't have the binding energy, maybe the problem expects me to use m = A * m_nucleon. So for Li-6, m = 6 * m_nucleon.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the concept that the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass energy, but in this case, since gamma is when v is 0.96c, gamma would be significant. Let me compute gamma.

v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 0.0784 is the number under the square root. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784): 0.28 is correct because 0.28 *0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So then, the total energy E is gamma * m c².

But what is m? Let's think again. The mass of the nucleus is needed. So perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.014 atomic mass units (u). So m = 6.014 u.

1 atomic mass unit is 931.5 MeV/c², approximately.

So m = 6.014 * 931.5 MeV/c².

Let me compute that: 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.014 * 931.5 = 13.041 MeV. So total m c² is 5589 +13.041 = 5602.041 MeV, which is approximately 5.602 GeV.

Wait, because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 5602 MeV is 5.602 GeV.

So m c² is approximately 5.602 GeV.

Then, E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.602 GeV.

Let me compute that:

3.5714 *5.602.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.602: 0.602 *3.5714 is approximately 2.145.

So total is 17.857 + 2.145 = 20.002 GeV. Hmm, that's close to 20 GeV.

But wait, let's compute it more accurately.

3.5714 *5.602.

Let me do it as 3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 * 0.6 is 2.14284.

3.5714 * 0.002 is 0.0071428.

So sum is 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20.0, then plus 0.0071428 gives 20.0071428 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.007 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option D is 21.419. Hmm, perhaps my approximation for m is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for m.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.014101727 u. Wait, I think I can look this up, but as I don't have access right now, I'll proceed with the value I have.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use m = 6 * m_p, but that can't be right because the number of neutrons is 3 and protons 3, so m = 3 m_p +3 m_n.

Wait, the mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So m =3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = let's compute that.

3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Sum: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV.

So m c² is 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.6335 GeV.

Then, E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 *5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.6335 = let's compute 0.6 *3.5714=2.14284, 0.0335 *3.5714=0.11933. So total 2.14284 +0.11933 =2.26217.

So sum is 17.857 +2.26217 =20.119 GeV.

Hmm, around 20.119 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132, which is close.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me recompute gamma.

v=0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, because 0.28²=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So gamma is 3.57142857.

Then, E = 3.57142857 * (5633.511 MeV) / 1000 (convert to GeV) → 5.633511 GeV.

So 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute this accurately.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Break it down:

3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

Wait, 0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511= approximately 0.07142857 *5.633511.

Wait, 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14.

5.633511 *1/14 = approx 5.633511 /14 ≈0.4023936.

So 0.57142857 *5.633511 ≈2.8167555 +0.4023936=3.219149.

So sum: 16.900533 +3.219149 =20.119682 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Close to my result. But why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate the mass.

Li-6: 3 protons (each 938.272 MeV/c²) and 3 neutrons (each 939.565 MeV/c²).

3*(938.272) = 2814.816 MeV.

3*(939.565)= 2818.695 MeV.

Total m = 2814.816 +2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV.

So m c² is 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute this with more precision.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Well, 3.57142857 is exactly 25/7, because 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 25/7 *5.633511.

25 *5.633511 = 140.837775.

140.837775 /7 = approximately 20.119682 GeV.

So the precise calculation gives us 20.119682 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close, but perhaps the problem expects using a more precise value for the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact atomic mass of Li-6. Let me try that.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.014101727 u.

So m =6.014101727 u *931.5 MeV/c² per u.

Wait, 1 u = 931.494064 MeV/c².

So m c² =6.014101727 *931.494064 MeV.

Compute that:

6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.014101727 *931.494064 = let's compute that.

0.01 *931.494064 =9.31494064.

0.004101727 *931.494064 ≈ approximately 3.816 MeV.

So total m c² =5588.964384 +9.31494064 +3.816 ≈5588.964384 +13.13094064=5602.09532 MeV.

Which is 5.602095 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.602095 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *5.602095=16.806285 GeV.

0.57142857 *5.602095.

Compute 0.5 *5.602095=2.8010475.

0.07142857 *5.602095 ≈0.07142857 *5.602095 ≈0.40177.

So 2.8010475 + 0.40177 =3.2028175.

Sum total:16.806285 +3.2028175=20.0091025 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.0091 GeV, which is approximately 20.009 GeV.

But that's conflicting with the earlier calculation where using the sum of protons and neutrons gave about 20.119 GeV.

Hmm, so why the discrepancy? Because when I used the exact mass of Li-6 in atomic mass units, I got a lower energy, but when I used the sum of protons and neutrons, I got a higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as A * nucleon mass (assuming a nucleon mass of 938 MeV/c²), but that would lead to a different result.

Wait, another approach. Let's compute the mass of the nucleus more accurately, considering the exact mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has a mass of 6.014101727 u. So m c² is 6.014101727 u *931.494064 MeV/u.

So 6.014101727 *931.494064 = ?

Let me compute that:

First, 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.014101727 *931.494064:

Compute 0.01 *931.494064 =9.31494064.

0.004101727 *931.494064 ≈ let's compute 0.004 *931.494064=3.725976256.

0.000101727 *931.494064 ≈0.09498.

So 3.725976256 +0.09498 ≈3.820956.

So the 0.014101727 *931.494064 ≈9.31494064 +3.820956=13.13589664.

So total m c² =5588.964384 +13.13589664 =5602.10028 MeV, which is 5.60210028 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.60210028 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.60210028.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60210028 = let's compute this.

0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714.

0.00210028 *3.57142857 ≈0.007494.

So 2.14285714 +0.007494 ≈2.150351.

So sum: 17.85714285 +2.150351 =20.00749385 GeV.

So approximately 20.0075 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option D is 21.419 GeV.

Hmm, but according to this, the correct energy is approximately 20.0075 GeV. None of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic energy in terms of kinetic energy, but the question asks for the total energy, not just kinetic. So E = gamma m c², which includes the rest mass energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6 again.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.014101727 u, which is 6 u plus 0.014101727 u.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the mass of Li-6 as 3*(proton mass) +3*(neutron mass) - binding energy.

Wait, but that's more complicated because binding energy varies with the nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as A * m_nucleon (where m_nucleon is approximately 938 MeV/c²), but let me try that.

If I take m =6 *938 MeV/c² =5628 MeV.

Then, E =3.5714 *5.628 GeV.

3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.628 = let's compute:

0.6 *3.5714=2.14284.

0.028 *3.5714=0.0999992.

Total 2.14284 +0.0999992=2.24284.

So total E=17.857 +2.24284=20.0998 GeV.

Hmm, about 20.1 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). So why is there a discrepancy between the two methods?

Ah, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the rest mass of the nucleus as (mass number) * (mass of a proton). Because the neutron is slightly heavier, but perhaps the problem assumes m_n =m_p. That would change the calculation.

If m_n = m_p ≈938 MeV/c².

Then, m = 3*938 +3*938 =6*938=5628 MeV =5.628 GeV.

E =3.5714 *5.628 GeV.

Compute 3.5714 *5.628.

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.5714 *5.628:

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.0714 *5.628≈0.403.

So total 2.814 +0.403=3.217.

So E=16.884 +3.217=20.101 GeV.

Which is about 20.101 GeV, very close to option C's 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a more precise value for gamma.

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma more precisely.

v =0.96c.

beta =0.96.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Which is exact.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it precisely using a calculator method.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise calculations.

Wait, another way: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1 / sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's exact.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the mass of the nucleus is being taken as 6 *938.272 MeV/c² (the proton mass) but that would be incorrect, because Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, but if the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as A * m_p, where m_p is 938.272 MeV/c², then m=6 *938.272=5629.632 MeV =5.629632 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.629632.

Compute that:

3 *5.629632=16.888896.

0.57142857 *5.629632.

0.5 *5.629632=2.814816.

0.07142857 *5.629632≈ approx 0.403.

So sum:2.814816 +0.403=3.217816.

Total E=16.888896 +3.217816=20.106712 GeV.

That's closer to 20.1067 GeV.

Option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps the discrepancy comes from using more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation with more precise m.

Let me compute m as 6 *938.272 MeV.

6 *938.272 =5629.632 MeV =5.629632 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

E =3.57142857 *5.629632.

Compute this accurately:

3.57142857 *5.629632 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.629632.

Let me compute 0.629632 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.02 *3.57142857=0.0714285714.

0.009632 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.009 *3.57142857=0.0321428571.

0.000632 *3.57142857≈0.002253.

So 0.0321428571 +0.002253≈0.034395857.

So sum for 0.629632 *3.57142857: 2.142857142 +0.0714285714 +0.034395857 ≈2.24868156.

So E =17.85714285 +2.24868156 =20.10582441 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1058 GeV. Still, the option is C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the use of m =6 *938.272 MeV, which gives E≈20.1058 GeV, but the option is C)20.132 GeV. There's a small difference, perhaps due to more precise gamma calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for v and gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using a calculator method.

But another thought: maybe the problem uses the relativistic energy formula where the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². No, the question asks for the energy, which is the total energy, so it's gamma m c².

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass energy of the entire nucleus, which includes the exact atomic mass. Let's compute that.

Exact mass of Li-6: 6.014101727 u.

m =6.014101727 u *931.494064 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.014101727 *931.494064 ≈ let's compute 0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064.

0.004101727 *931.494064= approx 3.820956.

So sum is 9.31494064 +3.820956=13.13589664.

Total m c²=5588.964384 +13.13589664 =5602.10028 MeV=5.60210028 GeV.

E =3.57142857 *5.60210028 = ?

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60210028= let's compute this accurately.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.00210028 *3.57142857=0.007494.

So sum is 2.14285714 +0.007494=2.15035114.

So E=17.85714285 +2.15035114=20.00749399 GeV.

So about 20.0075 GeV.

But none of the options match this exactly. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.1245 GeV higher than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the sum of the rest masses of protons and neutrons without considering any binding energy. So m =3*(m_p) +3*(m_n).

So m_p=938.272 MeV, m_n=939.565 MeV.

m =3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.633511 = ?

3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511=0.4023936.

So sum 2.8167555 +0.4023936=3.2191491.

So total E=16.900533 +3.2191491=20.1196821 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So the calculated value is 20.1197, which is about 20.12 GeV.

The options have option C as 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps due to rounding in the problem statement, the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate using beta=0.96, which gives gamma=3.57142857, and m as 5.6335 GeV, leading to E=20.1197 GeV, which rounds to 20.12 GeV. But none of the options exactly match.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic energy formula where the total energy is calculated as:

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

But wait, since the particles are moving at speed v, their momentum p is gamma m v.

So p = gamma m v.

Then, E = sqrt( (gamma m v c)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

= m c² sqrt( gamma^2 (v²) +1 )

But since v = beta c, and gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²).

So v² = beta² c².

Then, E = m c² sqrt( gamma^2 beta² +1 )

But wait, gamma^2 beta² = (1/(1-beta²)) ) * beta².

Which is beta²/(1-beta²) = beta^2 (gamma^2).

Wait, perhaps this approach complicates it, but let me try.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the earlier approach.

Given the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to the 20.1197 GeV when m is calculated as the sum of protons and neutrons.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass \( m \)
The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using approximate proton and neutron masses (\( m_p \approx 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), \( m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)):

\[
m = 3m_p + 3m_n = 3(938.272) + 3(939.565) = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2
\]

Convert to GeV:

\[
m c^2 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Break the calculation:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.633511 \approx 2.262 \, \text{GeV}
\]

\[
E \approx 17.857 + 2.262 = 20.119 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.119 \, \text{GeV} \), which is very close to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
