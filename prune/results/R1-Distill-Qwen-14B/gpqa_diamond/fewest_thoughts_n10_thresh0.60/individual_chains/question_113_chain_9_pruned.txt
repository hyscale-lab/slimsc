Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through the question again and break it down step by step.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to determine the chemical formula from the given data among the four options.

First, let's look at each piece of information provided and see what they can tell us about the compound.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate either O-H (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or N-H stretches, but since the options don't include nitrogen, I'll focus on O-H. The broad peak is probably an alcohol, but wait, another possibility is a carbonyl group, but the carbonyl absorption is usually around 1700 cm^-1, which is mentioned here as a strong peak. So the 3000 cm^-1 is likely an O-H stretch, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's an O-H from an alcohol since carboxylic acids have very strong absorption, but sometimes they can be broad too. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether? No, ethers don't have O-H. So probably an alcohol or a carboxylic acid or maybe a phenol, but phenols have stronger absorption.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring (like C=C in conjugation). But wait, 1650 is a bit lower than typical C=O, which is usually around 1700-1750. Alternatively, 1650 might be a conjugated double bond, like in an enone system or perhaps an aromatic ring. Or maybe an amide, but again, options don't include nitrogen. Hmm.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including those corresponding
