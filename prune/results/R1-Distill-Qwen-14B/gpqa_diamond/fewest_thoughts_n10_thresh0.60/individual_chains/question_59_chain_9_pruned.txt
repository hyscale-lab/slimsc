Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider the neutralization reactions. So, I think I'll need to figure out how much acid and base I have and see if they neutralize each other or if there's an excess.

First, let's calculate the moles of each component in each solution. I remember that moles = concentration (M) Ã— volume (L). But wait, the volumes are given in mL, so I need to convert them to liters by dividing by 1000.

Starting with the acetic acid: 500 mL is 0.5 L. The concentration is 0.1 M, so moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Next, the HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L. Concentration is 0.2 M, so moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, providing 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

Then, the Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Concentration is 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each mole gives two OH-, the total moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but mixing acid and base, right? So the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid. Does that affect the neutralization? Hmm, I think when you mix a weak acid and a strong base, the base will first neutralize the strong acid (if any), but in this case, the other acid is HCl, which is strong. So the OH- will react with both HCl and CH3COOH. But HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate all its H+ ions. So the OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl first, and then any remaining OH- will neutralize the acetic acid.

Wait, let me think. The total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl gives 0.08 moles H+. CH3COOH is a weak acid, but in solution, it does contribute some H+ (but since we're mixing with a strong base, perhaps the reaction will consider all the H+ from CH3COOH as available? Or wait, no, because when you mix a weak acid with a strong base, the base will deprotonate the weak acid as well. But in this scenario, maybe it's better to calculate the total H+ and OH- and see what's left.

Wait, another approach: the total H+ from HCl and the H+ from CH3COOH, and then subtract the OH- from Ba(OH)2. But I'm not sure if that's correct because HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, while CH3COOH doesn't. So maybe I should handle them separately.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

The H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH
