Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI elimination reaction, which is a type of dehydrohalogenation. So the starting compound is probably an alkyl halide, and the reaction would lead to the formation of an alkene.

First, I need to figure out what compound X is. Let's look at the spectroscopic data.

The IR data shows peaks around 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates the presence of O–H (like a carboxylic acid) or N–H (maybe an amine), or possibly alkenes (C=C) stretching, but the 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 might be C=C. Wait, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl group (C=O), so that's probably a carboxylic acid or an ester or ketone. But the broad peak around 3400 could also be an O–H stretch from a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 for a carbonyl could also be from an ester or ketone, but the 1720 is a bit high for some of these. Let me think. A carboxylic acid would have a broad O–H around 2500-3000, but the peak here is 3400-2500, which is a big range. Maybe it's a broad O–H, like from an acid.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong deshielded proton, probably an -OH group. So, this suggests a carboxylic acid, because the OH protons are usually around 10-12 ppm, and broad. Wait, but wait, in some cases like phenol OH, it can be around 5 ppm, but more for alcohols. Wait, 10.5 is more like a carboxylic acid. So that would support the IR data.

Other NMR signals:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a substituted benzene ring. The doublets with 2H each suggest a para-substituted ring. Like p-xylene or similar. So, if the ring has substituents at the para positions, each set of Hs would be a doublet.

Then, looking at the other signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This could be a methylene or a methyl adjacent to a carbonyl, but not sure yet.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe a methylene group attached to something, perhaps a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

Wait, or maybe a chain attached to the ring. Let's consider the possibility that the molecule has a benzene ring with substit
