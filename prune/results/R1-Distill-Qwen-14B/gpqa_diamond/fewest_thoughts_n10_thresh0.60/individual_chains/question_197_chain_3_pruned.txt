Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I think red phosphorus and HI are used for some kind of elimination reaction, maybe a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, I'm not too sure. Let me go through it slowly.

First, let's look at the data. The IR shows strong absorption around 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which probably indicates either O-H or N-H stretching. But then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group? Or maybe an ester, ketone, or aldehyde? Well, a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000, which fits with the first IR region. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions could be aromatic C=C stretching, which suggests there's a benzene ring involved.

Looking at the NMR data, the 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H). That's a very deshielded proton, which usually corresponds to an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be around 10-12 ppm, but the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's a phenol O-H? But phenol O-H is usually broader and maybe a bit lower, around 5 ppm, but that's not always the case. Or maybe it's a ketone or something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the other NMR signals. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in a para-disubstituted benzene, the two protons ortho to substit
