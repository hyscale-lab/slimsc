Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about determining the starting materials A and B for two different reactions that produce the same product but with different configurations. The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one in the first reaction and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one in the second. 

Wait, both products are the same molecule but with opposite configurations at the chiral center. So reaction A gives R, reaction B gives S. The reducing agents used are LiBH4 and BH3, which I think are different in their reactivity or maybe in their ability to induce certain stereochemistry.

I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used with ketones to form secondary alcohols. But wait, in this case, the product is a ketone... Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ketone, right? So maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester or something else.

Wait, maybe the reactions involve the reduction of a ketone. Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 usually reduce carbonyl groups. Oh wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and can even reduce esters sometimes, but BH3 is more selective. Or wait, perhaps the starting materials are some sort of carbonyl compounds, like ketals or acetals, and the reducing agents are
