Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like infinite quantities that pop up when you calculate things. So, the idea is that you make a temporary modification to the theory to make calculations finite, and then you remove the modification in the end.

Wait, but not all theories might require this. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, right? Since it's a theory that unifies quantum mechanics with general relativity, maybe it doesn't have the same kinds of divergences that other quantum field theories do. Or wait, do string theories still have issues with infinities? I'm not too sure. I remember that in string theory, particles are replaced by strings, and the theory might have a better behaved perturbation expansion, but I'm not certain if it requires regularization. Maybe it's supposed to be finite? Or perhaps it's the opposite, like it does require some form of regularization because even though it's a string theory, high energies can still lead to issues.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies, QCD behaves in a way that's asymptotically free, meaning the coupling constant decreases, so perturbative methods work. But when you go to low energies, it becomes non-perturbative. Do QCD calculations require regularization? I think yes, because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergences, so you need to regularize them. Regularization methods like lattice QCD or Pauli-Villars are used, right? So QCD does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory. But wait, doesn't renormalization involve dealing with divergences, like in loop integrals? So yes, QED calculations can lead to infinities, which require regularization (and then renormalization). So QED does require regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. This is the Maxwell's equations, right? It's a classical field theory without quantum mechanics. Since it's classical, there's no issue with quantum divergences. In classical theories, you don't have the same kind of infinities because you're not quantizing the fields. Wait, but even in classical E&M, when you have point charges, you get issues like the self-energy of a charge, leading to infinities in the field. But in classical theory, I think these are handled differently—maybe through redefinitions or other classical techniques. Or perhaps in the classical case, you don't require regularization in the same sense as quantum field theories because the infinities aren't as problematic in the same way. Because regularization is a quantum field theory concept; it's about handling divergences that arise in perturbative expansions. So classical
