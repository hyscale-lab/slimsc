Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up. It's a way to make the calculations finite and manageable.

Let me think about each option. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Starting with option D: Classical Electrodynamics. That's the theory of electromagnetism as described by Maxwell's equations, right? It's a classical theory, so it doesn't involve quantum mechanics. But wait, in classical theories, do we have issues with divergences at high energies? I'm not so sure. Because in classical E&M, the fields are smooth and don't have the same kind of infinities that quantum theories do. So maybe regularization isn't needed here because there's no quantum loop divergences or anything like that. So D might be the answer, but I need to check the others.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory. I know that in QED, when you calculate loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy, you get divergent integrals. These are handled using techniques like regularization. So QED definitely requires regularization. So option C isn't the answer.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's also a quantum field theory, and I remember that it deals with things like asymptotic freedom. But since it's a non-abelian gauge theory, it probably has its own set of divergences. So regularization is used here as well. So option B is out.

Option A: Superstring Theory. String theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. I think string theories, including superstring theory, aim to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kinds of divergences as in QFT. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Do they still require regularization? I remember that in string theory, it's supposed to be a background-independent theory, and perhaps it doesn't have the same loop divergences because the strings have a different structure. Or maybe they handle divergences in a different way, not needing the same kind of regularization. But wait, I've also heard that even string theories can have divergences, especially in certain limits or when considering different backgrounds. But compared to QFTs like QED and QCD, do they require regularization?

Wait, but the question is about which theory "never" requires regularization. So if any of these don't need it, that's the answer.

Classical theories, like option D, don't have quantum effects, so they don't have the divergences that come from quantum loops. Therefore, regularization isn't needed because the theory itself doesn't produce those kinds of infinities. So D) Classical Electrodynamics would be the theory that doesn't require regularization.

So putting it all together: among the options, only the classical theory doesn't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory and doesn't have the same divergent
