Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Alright, the state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, which are Gaussian states. So this state is a superposition of two coherent states, which makes it non-Gaussian. Non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they can't be described by Gaussian operations alone.

The problem gives me phi as -pi/4 and alpha as 0.5. I need to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula for del_b is given as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau. So del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

Wait, wait. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is calculated with respect to a reference Gaussian state. So tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian state. Since rho is non-Gaussian, we're comparing it to the closest Gaussian state, I think. But I'm not exactly sure how that works.

First, I should compute the density matrix rho of the given state. The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). 

Let me plug in the values. phi is -pi/4, so sin(2 phi) is sin(-pi/2) which is -1. And alpha is 0.5, so exp(-2*(0.5)^2) is exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1)*0.6065) = sqrt(1 -0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So N is approximately 0.6275. Now, the state |psi> is normalized, since it's divided by N.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. So rho is (1/N^2) [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>][ <alpha| cos(phi) + < -alpha| sin(phi) ].

Wait, that expands to (1/N^2) [ cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) (|alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha|) ].

Because when I multiply out the terms, the cross terms will involve |alpha><-alpha| and vice versa.

Now, the reference Gaussian state tau—I think it's the closest Gaussian state to rho. But in this case, what is the reference Gaussian state? I'm a bit confused. Since rho is a superposition of two coherent states, it's a non-Gaussian state, so the reference Gaussian state could be the mixture of the two coherent states weighted by probabilities.

Wait, another thought:
