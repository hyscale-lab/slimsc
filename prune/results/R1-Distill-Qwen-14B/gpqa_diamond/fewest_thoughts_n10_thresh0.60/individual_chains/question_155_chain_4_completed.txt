Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in Pz, given that the system is in an eigenstate of Px with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared. But wait, the state is given as an eigenstate of Px, not Pz. So I can't directly use that state with Pz's matrix unless I express the state in the basis of Pz's eigenstates.

Wait, the problem says that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. Oh right, so the given state is already expressed in the Pz basis. That makes things a bit easier. Because if the basis is the eigenvectors of Pz, then the state vector given is in that basis. So I can directly apply Pz to the state without needing to change the basis.

Wait, no, not exactly. Because the state is an eigenstate of Px, which isn't the same as the Pz basis. Oh, wait, no, the basis is the Pz eigenvectors. So the state vector is in that basis. So to find the expectation values, I can just compute ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| Pz² |ψ⟩.

But wait, let me make sure. So the state is given as a column vector, and the basis is the eigenvectors of Pz. So the state is a linear combination of these basis vectors. So when I apply Pz to the state, it should act as diagonal, since the basis vectors are eigenstates of Pz.

Wait, so the state is |ψ> = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that as a column vector. So each component is the amplitude of the corresponding Pz eigenstate.

So, the first component is -1/2: that would be the amplitude for the eigenstate corresponding to Pz = hbar. Because looking at the Pz matrix, the diagonal entries are (hbar, 0, -hbar), right? So for Pz, the eigenvalues are hbar, 0, -hbar?

Wait, wait. Let me look at the Pz matrix. It's given as:

[ hbar       0          0        ]
[ 0         0          0        ]
[ 0         0        -hbar ]

So the diagonal elements are hbar, 0, -hbar. So the eigenstates are the basis vectors. So the state |ψ> is a vector in this basis. So the first component is (-1/2), which corresponds to the state with eigenvalue hbar. The second component is 1/sqrt(2), which is the middle state with eigenvalue 0. And the third component is -1/2, which is the state with eigenvalue -hbar.

So each component of the state tells me the amplitude for each eigenstate. So the expectation value of Pz is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

So let me compute ⟨Pz⟩.

Each component is (a, b, c) where a is for eigenvalue +hbar, b for 0, and c for -hbar.

So the expectation value is |a|^2 * hbar + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-hbar).

Wait, but the state isn't normalized. Let me check that. The components are (-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1. So yes, it is normalized.

So, |a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, |b|^2 = 1/2, and |c|^2 = 1/4.

So, ⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)* hbar + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-hbar) = (1/4 - 1/4) hbar = 0.

Hmm, that's zero. So the first term in the uncertainty is ⟨Pz²⟩, and the second is (⟨Pz⟩)^2, which is zero. So ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩).

Now, ⟨Pz²⟩ is the expectation value of Pz squared. Since Pz is diagonal in this basis, Pz squared is just the square of the diagonal elements. So each eigenvalue squared times the probability.

Wait, eigenvalues of Pz are hbar, 0, -hbar. So their squares are hbar², 0, hbar².

So, ⟨Pz²⟩ = |a|^2*(hbar)^2 + |b|^2*(0)^2 + |c|^2*(hbar)^2.

Which is (1/4)(hbar²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(hbar²) = (1/4 + 1/4) hbar² = (1/2) hbar².

So, ⟨Pz²⟩ = (1/2) hbar².

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - 0) = sqrt(1/2 hbar²) = hbar / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is hbar / sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state is given as the column vector $|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}$. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, so the state is already expressed in the $P_z$ basis. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal entries of the $P_z$ matrix.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$) and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. From the state $|\psi\rangle$, the components are $|c_1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$, $|c_2|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$, and $|c_3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \lambda_i^2.
\]

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, so their squares are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Using the same probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
