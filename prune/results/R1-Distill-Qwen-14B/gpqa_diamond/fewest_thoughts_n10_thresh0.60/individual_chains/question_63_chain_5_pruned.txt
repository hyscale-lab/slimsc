Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, the question is about what momentum a photon must have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. 

Let me read the given details again. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. The elements are X and Y with masses 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s. The options are various momenta in N*s units.

Wait, so the molecule can rotate and vibrate. The model probably considers both rotational and vibrational energy levels. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I need to figure out whether the transition is from the ground state to the first excited state, which is either a vibrational or rotational transition.

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). To get the next lowest energy state, maybe it's the first vibrational excited state (v=1) or the next rotational state (J=1). 

But wait, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J +1), where B is the rotational constant. Similarly, the vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number (starts at 0).

So the ground state is v=0, J=0. The next possible state with the lowest energy could be either the next rotational state (J=1) or the next vibrational state (v=1). Which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference.

I should calculate the energy differences for both possibilities and see which is smaller. The photon must supply the difference. 

Let's compute the vibrational energy first. The energy for v=0 is (1/2) h w. When it goes to v=1, the increase is h w. So the energy difference is h w.

For the rotational case, when J=0, the energy is 0. When J=1, it's B * 1*(1+1)=2B. So the energy difference is 2B.

I need to find which is smaller between h w
