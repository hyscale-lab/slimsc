Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving relative to an observer. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, and the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass? Or same direction as the beam? Let me read again: the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion, but the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think. Oh, no, wait: the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer. Oh, wait, perhaps the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well? Or maybe the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity vector, which is towards the observer. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to visualize. Imagine the lab frame: the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So if the observer is at rest, and the glass is moving towards them, the glass's velocity is towards the observer. Now, the light beam is propagating through the glass. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the beam is going towards the observer as well, but the glass is moving towards the observer, carrying the beam with it.

Wait, but the beam is inside the glass, so the speed of light in the glass isn't c, it's c/n. Because the refractive index n reduces the speed. So normally, in the glass's rest frame, the speed is c/n. But since the glass is moving, we have to consider how the observer in the lab frame measures the speed.

So this is a case where both the medium (glass) and the light are moving relative to the observer. So we probably need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the speed of the light beam in the lab frame.

Wait, but wait. The index of refraction affects the speed, but in special relativity
