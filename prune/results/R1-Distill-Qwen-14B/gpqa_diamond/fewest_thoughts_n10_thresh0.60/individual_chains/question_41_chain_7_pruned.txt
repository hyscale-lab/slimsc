Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving relative to a lab frame. Hmm, my head's a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab?

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is going in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is also moving towards the observer. But the beam is inside the moving glass.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the medium itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of the light beam?

I think this has to do with the principle of relativity and how velocities add up, but I'm not sure. Oh right, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly; you have to use the velocity addition formula. But wait, the velocity of light in a medium is a bit different than in a vacuum. Oh wait, no, in special relativity, nothing can go faster than c, but here we're dealing with light in a medium. Hmm.

Wait, let's think. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is moving at speed c/n within the glass, but
