Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of detecting them using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the sizes of the star and planet and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. Specifically, Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits and their host stars have the same radii, but the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host.

Wait, the key here is to figure out which planet is more likely to transit. I think the probability of a transit depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. Oh right, the formula for the transit probability is something like R_star / a_planet, where a_planet is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, I'm not sure if it's exactly that. I remember that the probability P is approximately (R_star / a)², but maybe it's actually P ≈ (R_star / a)², but wait no, that might not be right. Or was it P is proportional to (R_star / a)²? Or maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, let me think. The transit probability is given by P = (R*/a)² * (something) — but I think the exact formula is P = (R* / a)^2 * ( (a sin i) / (a) )² — no, that doesn't make sense. Wait another approach: the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned so that it transits is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the distance from the star (semi-major axis). Because the planet has to be in the right orbital plane for us to see the transit. So, the probability is proportional to (R*/a), perhaps. Or maybe it's (R*/a)²? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the transit probability is approximately (R*/a)^2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star
