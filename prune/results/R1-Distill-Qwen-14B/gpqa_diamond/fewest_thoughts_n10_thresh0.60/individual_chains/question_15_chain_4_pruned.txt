Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. I'm a bit rusty on my transit probabilities, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says that researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time and want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both planets were already detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular, which is good because that might simplify some calculations.

The host stars are a bit different. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so maybe that affects something else, but I'm not sure right now.

The main thing I'm trying to figure out is which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The formula for the probability P is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, where R is radius and a is the semi-major axis. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, sometimes it's approximated as R_star / a. Hmm, but wait, I think I'm mixing it up. Let me recall the correct formula.

Wait, the transit probability can be calculated using the formula: P ≈ (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), it simplifies to P = (R_*) / a. But actually, I think the correct formula is P = (R_*/a) * ( (1 + m_planet/m_star) ) but wait no, that's not right. Wait, maybe it's more about the relative size of the star and the planet's orbit.

Wait, I'm confusing the formula. Let me think again. The probability of a transit is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So P = (R_*) / a. But wait, that's not exactly right either. I remember that the probability depends on the inclination of the orbit. For a perfectly edge-on orbit, the probability
