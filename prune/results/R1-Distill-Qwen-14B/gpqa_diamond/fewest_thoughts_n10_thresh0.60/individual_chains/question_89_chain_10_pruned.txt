Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on adamantane structures, but I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, very diamond-like in structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the first and third positions of the adamantane structure.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so maybe an elimination reaction is happening here. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with strong bases, they typically undergo an elimination, like the E2 mechanism, to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal—it's 1,3. Hmm. So maybe this isn't an elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation but that usually requires adjacent halogens. Wait, another possibility is that the base abstracts a proton, leading to a double elimination. Let me think: if the molecule is symmetric, maybe when KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen from each Br, it could form a double bond. But wait, 1,3 positions are not adjacent, so eliminating two Hs would require some sort of conjugated elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but with two bromines, perhaps forming a ketone? No, wait, substitution would give an alkoxide, but with two Brs, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a diene? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Looking at the product's NMR: a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester. The NMR peaks: 4.79 (2H) as a triplet. Wait, that could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. The 10H in the 2.4-2
