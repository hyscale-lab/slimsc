Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to break it down step by step. Let me think through each part carefully.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two bromines on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation, to form an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Oh, wait, no, in adamantane, the structure is a diamondoid, so carbons 1 and 3 might actually be adjacent in some way. Hmm, maybe I should visualize the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent carbons. So when KOH is added, it could cause elimination, but since the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond. Wait, noâ€”if they're on adjacent carbons, then each Br is on adjacent carbons. So, the elimination would produce an alkene between those two carbons. So the product would be 1,3-diene? No, wait, no, elimination forms a double bond between the two adjacent carbons where the Br was removed. So if the bromines are on adjacent carbons, losing two HBr molecules would form a double bond between those two, making an alkene.

So product 1 would be adamantane with a double bond between carbons 1 and 3, making it 1,3-diene? Or wait, does the structure of adamantane allow for that? Alternatively, perhaps it's a single elimination, but wait, KOH is in excess, so probably two eliminations occur. Wait, no, when you have two adjacent Br atoms, the elimination would form a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, but wait, that would require two adjacent Brs. Hmm, maybe I got the structure wrong. Oh, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane actually has the two Br atoms on opposite ends of
