Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, so I remember that when dealing with charges and their potential energies, it's all about the electrostatic potential energy between them. Since the system is isolated, I think the energy here must be the electrostatic potential energy stored in the system.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So each of those 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge. But wait, are all the 12 charges only interacting with the fixed one, or do they also interact with each other? Oh right, because they are all charged particles, there's potential energy between each pair. But in the problem, the 12 are constrained at a distance of 2m from P. So their mutual distances... Hmm, wait, it says they are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So maybe they are all on a sphere of radius 2m around P? So each of the 12 is at a distance of
