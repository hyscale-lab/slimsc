Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question involves a reaction scheme where a series of reactions leads to compound E, and I need to identify which option it is. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

There are also some hints provided. Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, I remember that phosphorous ylides are used in Wittig reactions, which typically convert aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So maybe compound A has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde.

Hint b tells me about the IR spectra. Compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde). Compound E has a peak at 1715 cm^-1, which is a bit lower, suggesting maybe a ketone again but perhaps in a different environment or ring structure.

Let me go through each step.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B.
HCN adds to carbonyl compounds. If A is a ketone, adding HCN would form an cyanohydrin. Wait, but wait, HCN typically adds to ketones to form cyanohydrins. The cyanohydrin would have an alcohol (-OH) and a nitrile (-CN) group adjacent to each other. So compound B would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile attached.

Wait, but the addition of HCN to a ketone forms a cyanohydrin, which is a molecule with a hydroxyl and nitrile group on adjacent carbons. So if A is a cyclohexanone, for example, B would be a cyclohexanol with a CN group attached.

But let's think about the structure of compound A. The hint a suggests that when A reacts with a Wittig reagent, it gives a specific cyclopentane derivative. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, right? So the Wittig reaction would add a CH2-C(CH3)= group to the cyclopentane.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4. The propan-2-ylidene is a substituted alkenyl group attached to the ring. So the Wittig reagent would have to supply that alkenyl group.

The Wittig reagent is usually generated from an aldehyde or ketone. The ylide would have a structure like Ph3P=CH-R. When it reacts with a carbonyl, it forms an alkene. So in this case, the product has a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached. So the ylide would have a structure where the R is CH(CH3)2, perhaps? Or wait, let's see.

The product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, which is a cyclopentane with a substituent that's a propenyl group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, so the Wittig reagent must have the structure Ph3P=CH-CH(CH3)2? Wait, maybe it's Ph3P=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)? No, wait, the propan-2-ylidene is CH2-CH(CH3)- which is connected via the double bond.

Wait, the substituent in the cyclopentane is propan-2-ylidene, which is (CH2C(CH3)=CH2?), but no, that's not right. Let me think again. Propan-2-ylidene would be the group CH2-C(CH3)=. So the substituent is a propenyl group where the double bond is between the first and second carbons, maybe. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or perhaps it's a substituent like CH2-C(CH3)= attached to the cyclopentane.

Wait, perhaps the ylide is Ph3P=CH-C(CH3)2, but that might give a different structure. Alternatively, the ylide could be Ph3P=CH-CH(CH2CH3) or something along those lines. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the product structure: the substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is (CH2)2C=CH2? No, wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, so it's a substituent with a double bond. So the structure is cyclopentane with substituents at positions 1,2 (methyl groups) and at position 4, a substituent that's (propan-2-ylidene), which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group.

Wait, perhaps the Wittig reaction is adding a CH2-C(CH3)= group to the cyclopentane. So the starting material for the Wittig would be a ketone or aldehyde that, when reacted with the appropriate ylide, forms that substituent.

So if the product is
