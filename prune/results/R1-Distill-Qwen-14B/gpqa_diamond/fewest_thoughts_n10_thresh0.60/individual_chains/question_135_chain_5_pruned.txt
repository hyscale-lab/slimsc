Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what all the terms mean, but I think the important part is that the boson X interacts with fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which decay options are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have enough energy, right? So the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of each of the decay products. Because for a particle to decay into two particles, each must have rest mass less than or equal to half the mass of the parent. Otherwise, it's not possible.

So first, I need to figure out what fermions are in the possible decay channels. The interaction term probably couples X to fermion-antifermion pairs. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum of their rest masses is less than or equal to the mass of X.

The given options are A to D, each listing possible decay channels. Let me list the fermions and their masses to check which ones are allowed.

Fermions and their approximate masses (in GeV/c²):

- Up quark (u): ~0.005 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.005 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV

The X boson has a mass of 6 GeV. So for any fermion pair, 2m_fermion <= 6 GeV. So m_fermion <= 3 GeV.

Let's go through each possible fermion pair:

1. b quark: mass ~4.7 GeV. 2 * 4.7 = 9.4 GeV. But X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9.4. So b quark can't be decay product. So any option that includes b bar b is invalid. Wait, wait. Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV; the sum of the masses of the decay products (each fermion's rest mass) must be less than or equal to the mass of X. But wait, no—when a particle is at rest, the decay products have to each have rest mass less than or equal to half the parent's mass, because their combined rest mass can't exceed the parent's mass. So for a fermion pair,
