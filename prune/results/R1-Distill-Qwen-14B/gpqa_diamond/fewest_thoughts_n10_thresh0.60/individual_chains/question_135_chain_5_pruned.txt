Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question is.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by a Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, I think I'm getting the variables mixed up. So, the interaction term involves λ, which is a coupling constant, and the field X. The fermions involved here are ψ_f. 

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to find all the possible fermion-antifermion pairs that X can decay into.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermions involved. Because, you know, energy and mass equivalence—E=mc². So, the decay products' combined rest mass must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

So, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let me list the possible fermions and their masses. Wait, but what fermions are we considering here? The problem gives a Lagrangian involving, I think, different fermions like quarks and leptons.

Wait, the Lagrangian term is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, the interaction is between the scalar X and the fermion ψ_f. So, X can couple to any fermion ψ_f, provided the Yukawa coupling λ is non-zero. But in this problem, I think we can assume that X can couple to all the fermions, but the decay depends on whether their rest mass is less than X's mass divided by two.

So, the possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs. Let me think about the masses of various fermions. But wait, in particle physics, the relevant masses are the ones of the quarks and leptons.

Let me list the masses (approximate) of all the known fermions:

Quarks:
- Up (u): around 2-5 MeV (so like 0.002-0.005 GeV)
- Down (d): similar to u, around 3-6 MeV
- Strange (s): about 95-105 MeV (~0.1 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5-5 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, like ~173 GeV.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: almost massless, but usually negligible unless considering their small masses, but for this problem, probably not considering them.

Wait, but the question is about decays of X into pairs. So, the decay products can be any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Since each is m, the sum is 2m, so 2m ≤6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

So, the fermions whose mass is ≤3 GeV can be decay products.

Looking at the fermions:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → yes
- μ: 0.105 → yes
- τ: ~
