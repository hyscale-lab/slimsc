Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which have a similar backbone but varying substituents.

First, I'll look at the FTIR data. The broad absorption at 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid. The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 probably corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch of the carboxylic acid. So, all the options provided have a carboxylic acid group because each ends with COOH.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data: none of the signals are vinyl hydrogens, meaning there are no double bonds. That makes sense because all the options are aliphatic structures, without any alkenes.

Now, the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. I need to figure out what these splitting patterns imply about the structure.

Let me think about splitting in NMR. Each split is due to coupling with neighboring protons. The more neighboring groups, the more splits, and each additional neighboring set of protons adds another level of splitting.

A quartet (four peaks) comes from coupling with a group of three equivalent protons. But wait, in a quartet, it's when a proton is next to a group with 3 H (like a CH3). So, for example, if a proton is adjacent to a CH2CH3 group, but that's CH2, which has 2 H. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, splitting is based on neighboring groups. The number of neighboring H's determines the order. So, if a proton is next to a CH2 group (2 H), it will split into a triplet. If it's next to a CH group (1 H), it splits into a doublet. But when you have multiple neighboring groups, each contributes their splitting, and the overall pattern is the product.

So, let's break down the given NMR signals:

1. Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq): So, each step of splitting. Let me think, each split adds a multiplication in the pattern.

But maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of neighboring groups. For example:

- A quartet of a triplet: that would be each proton in the quartet being split by a triplet, which would lead to 4 x 3 = 12 peaks, but that's a lot. Alternatively, the structure might have a proton that is split by two different groups, each with different numbers of protons.

Wait, perhaps the first signal is from a proton that's adjacent to two different sets of neighboring protons. For example, imagine a CH group
