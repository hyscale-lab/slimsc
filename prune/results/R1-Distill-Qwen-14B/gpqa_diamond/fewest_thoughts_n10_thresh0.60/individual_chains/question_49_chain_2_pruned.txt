Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which are pericyclic reactions. I remember that sigmatropic shifts involve the movement of a sigma bond along with the simultaneous shift of a pi bond. The classic examples are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements. Both of these are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts, right? So the sigma bond moves along with the pi bond moving in a concerted manner.

The problem has three parts, each requiring a reaction to be completed, and I need to pick the correct products from the options A to D. Let's tackle each part one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to give product A.

Hmm, I think this might be a Claisen-like rearrangement. Wait, but 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine sounds like a molecule with two methoxy groups on an ethylamine. So the structure is (CH3O)2CHNH2. Hmm, when I think of the Claisen rearrangement, it typically involves an allyl vinyl ether. Wait, but here we have an amine. Oh, wait, but maybe it's undergoing a similar type of rearrangement.

Wait, but the second compound is but-3-en-2-ol, which is an allyl alcohol. So maybe they're combining to form an intermediate that can undergo a sigmatropic shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the amine is acting as a base, but with H+ present, maybe it's protonated. Alternatively, maybe it's a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. Let me think.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is H2N-CO(CH3)2. Wait, no. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2. So that's a tertiary amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine.

But I
