Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

Astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The problem says that the star's brightness variation due to these spots, when observed over time, looks similar to what we'd see if there were an exoplanet causing the signal. The question is, what's the radius of such an exoplanet relative to the star's radius to produce the same brightness variation amplitude?

Hmm. So the key here is to compare the brightness variation from the star's spots to that from a planet transiting the star. Because when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness proportional to the planet's area relative to the star's. Similarly, the spots on the star can cause a variation when they rotate into and out of view.

Wait, but wait. The star has spots on one hemisphere, and as it rotates, those spots come into and go out of view. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, more of the cooler (dimmer) spots are visible, and when it's not, the brighter (unspotted) side is visible. But wait, no, because the spots are cooler, so the star's total brightness would decrease when more spots are visible. But the problem says that the observed brightness variation is similar to a planet's transit. So I need to calculate the amplitude of this variation and then find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

First, let's figure out the brightness variation caused by the spots. The star's brightness without spots is given as Teff = 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots.

But wait, how does the temperature of the spots affect the total brightness? I remember that the flux from a star is proportional to T^4. So the star's total flux without spots is, well, let's calculate the flux from the star and then subtract the flux from the spotted regions.

Wait,
