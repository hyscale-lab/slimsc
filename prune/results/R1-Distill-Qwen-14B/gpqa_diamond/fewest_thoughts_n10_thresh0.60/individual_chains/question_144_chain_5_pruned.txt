Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various distances in meters.

Wait, what do I remember about meson decay? Oh right, the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the further it can travel before decaying. But since mesons are bosons and are usually produced in pairs, I think their decay is governed by their width and energy.

I remember something called the uncertainty principle. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ/τ. So τ is inversely proportional to Γ. But how does that tie into decay distance?

Oh, right! The mean decay distance L is the product of the velocity v and the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ. But wait, how do I find v? The velocity can be found from the energy and mass of the particle.

The energy E is given as 8 GeV. For a relativistic particle, the total energy is related to the rest mass and momentum. I think E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for the momentum p.

Let me write that equation down: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Solving for p, I get p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)²) ) / c². Hmm, but units might be tricky here. Oh wait, in natural units (where c=1), E and m are in GeV, so E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E² - m²).

Plugging in the numbers: E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So p = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV/c. Let me calculate that: 8 squared is 64, 1.2 squared is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 is 62.56. The square root of 62.56 is about 7.91 GeV/c.

Wait, wait. So p is approximately 7.
