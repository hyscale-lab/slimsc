Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when a particle decays, the mean decay distance depends on its lifetime and the speed at which it's moving. Oh right, the formula involves the lifetime, the speed, and maybe some other constants.

Wait, the decay distance is given by c multiplied by the lifetime (tau) multiplied by the velocity (beta) of the particle. So the formula should be something like L = c * tau * beta. But wait, what's beta? Beta is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light, so beta = v/c. So if I have beta, then I can calculate the distance.

But how do I find the lifetime tau? Oh right, the relation between the decay width (Gamma) and the lifetime is given by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy (Gamma) and the uncertainty in time (tau) are inversely related. So tau is approximately equal to h-bar divided by Gamma. So tau ≈ ħ / Gamma. But wait, Gamma is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s, so I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, let me get the constants straight. Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But h-bar (ħ) is h divided by 2π. So ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But the energy is given in GeV, so maybe I should
