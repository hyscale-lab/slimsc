Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space.

The density matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), but this one looks like a mixed state because it's an average of two projectors.

Wait, |0><0| is the projector for the state |0>, and |1><1| is for |1>. So when I add them and multiply by 1/2, this is like taking an equal mixture of the |0> and |1> states. Oh right, that's a completely mixed state for a single qubit. So the system is in a completely mixed state, meaning maximum uncertainty about the state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I remember that the Bloch sphere represents qubit states. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state must be at the center. Because when you have equal probabilities for |0> and |1>, the vector on the Bloch sphere should point to the origin.

Wait, the Bloch vector r for a density matrix ρ is given by something like r = [x, y, z], where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. That is, for ρ, the vector components are <σ_x>, <σ_y>, <σ_z>, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So for the given ρ, let's compute each component. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

The expectation value for σ_x is Tr(ρ σ_x). Let me compute that. ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So ρ σ_x would be (|0><0|σ_x + |1><1|σ_x)/2.

Wait, σ_x |0> = |1>, and σ_x |1> = |0>. So |0><0|σ_x would be
