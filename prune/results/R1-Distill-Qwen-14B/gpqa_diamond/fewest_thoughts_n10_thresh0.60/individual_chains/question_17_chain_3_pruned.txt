Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 0.02 M. So, the solution contains the complex, and we need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, the formation constant K is given as 5e10. Formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, when it's made, the concentration is 0.02 M, and assuming the complex doesn't dissociate much, but considering Kf is large, it probably doesn't dissociate much. Wait, Kf is 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So, the dissociation would be minimal, right? So, the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA would be very low.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. So, the complex is mostly intact, but a tiny bit dissociates. So, we can set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to model the dissociation.

Let me think. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are zero because the complex doesn't dissociate much. But wait, no. Wait, no. When you have the complex, it's in solution, and if it dissociates, it forms Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the initial setup. Let's correct that. The initial concentrations: [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and both [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are zero. But that can't be right because when the complex forms, it's the product, so the initial concentrations of the reactants (Ca and EDTA) should be from the dissociation. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, the complex is in solution, and it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, let's write the reaction:

CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2- ] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) = 5e10.

Wait, no, wait. Formation constant is for the formation of the complex. So, the reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-; Kf = 5e10.

In this problem, the solution is the complex. So, the reverse reaction is the dissociation.

So, the dissociation reaction is:

CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-; Kd = 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, because the dissociation constant Kd is the reciprocal of the formation constant Kf.

So, Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-] = 2e-11.

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 M,
