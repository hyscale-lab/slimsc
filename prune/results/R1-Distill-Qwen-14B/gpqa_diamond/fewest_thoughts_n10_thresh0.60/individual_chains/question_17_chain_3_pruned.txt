Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to find which one is the correct concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. So, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like Ca²+ and forms a complex. The problem gives me the formation constant, K, which is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA form the complex.

The formula for the formation constant K is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Oh wait, but in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, I think the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the rest is the dissociation into Ca²+ and free EDTA.

But wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1, right? So the complex is CaY²- (where Y is EDTA), and it dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4- (EDTA^4-). So the reaction is Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²-.

So the formation constant K is given as 5e10, which is very large, so the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. But the question is about the concentration of Ca²+ ions, which I'm assuming comes from the dissociation of the complex.

But wait, wait. If the solution is 0.02 M CaY²-, and it's in a state where the complex dissociates a little bit, but since K is so large, the dissociation is minimal. But how do I find [Ca²+]?

Let me think about the equilibrium expression again. The formation constant K is [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]). Let's denote the dissociation as:

CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-

Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ produced. Then, the concentration of Y^4- would also be x, because each complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one Y^4-. The concentration of the complex would be 0.02 - x. But since K is so large (5e10), that the dissociation x is probably very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So plugging into the K expression:

K ≈ (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

Wait, that can't be right. Because K is 5e10, which is a big number. Let me rearrange the equation. So,

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13
