Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots that cause brightness variations, and how that compares to the brightness dip caused by an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius ratio of a planet that would produce the same signal as the spots.

Alright, let's break down the problem. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would block some light, causing a dip in brightness.

So the question is, if instead of spots, we had a planet, what size (radius) would that planet need to be to cause the same change in brightness. The key is to find Rpl/Rstar.

Wait, so the brightness variation comes from the blocked light. For a planet, the blocked area is the area of the planet's disk relative to the star's disk. For the spots, it's more complicated because the spots are cooler regions, so when they rotate into view, the total brightness of the star changes.

Hmm, but the problem states that the brightness variation due to the spots is equivalent to that caused by a planet. So I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find the planet's radius that would cause the same dip.

Let me think about the two scenarios.

First, the planet scenario: When a planet transits in front of the star, the observed brightness drops by an amount proportional to the area blocked. The area is (Rpl / Rstar)^2. So the fractional change in brightness is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, right? Because the area scales with the square of the radius.

But wait, the spots are causing a brightness change because they are cooler. So when the star rotates and the spots come into view, the total emitted light increases because more of the hotter (or less cool) parts are facing us. Wait, no. Dark spots are cooler, so the star's brightness would decrease when the spots are
