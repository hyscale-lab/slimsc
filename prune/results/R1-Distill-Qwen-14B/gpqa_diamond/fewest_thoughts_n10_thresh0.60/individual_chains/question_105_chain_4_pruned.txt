Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, but with some spots on one hemisphere. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's. The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The setup is that as the star rotates, these spots come into view and change the observed brightness, which could look like an exoplanet transiting the star. The task is to find what radius a hypothetical exoplanet should have to produce the same brightness variation as these spots, assuming no spots.

Hmm. So I think the key here is to calculate the change in brightness due to the spots and then find what planet size would cause the same change.

First, let me recall that the brightness variation (the dip in light curve) caused by a planet is given by the formula:

ΔF = (R_planet / R_star)^2

But wait, that's only when the planet transits the star, right? So the dip is proportional to the area blocked, which is the square of the radius ratio.

Now, in this case, the star isn't being transited by a planet, but has spots. So the brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. Since one hemisphere is covered, as the star rotates, the spots will come into the observer's view and then go away, causing a dip in brightness.

Wait, but how does the spot coverage and temperature affect the brightness variation?

The star's total brightness is the sum of the light from all its surface. Without spots, the star emits uniformly. Spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the total brightness decreases.

So the change in brightness (ΔF) would be the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when the spots are visible.

The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σTeff^4 * (area). The area is proportional to the radius squared, but in this case, the star's radius is fixed as the Sun's.

The spot coverage is 20% on one hemisphere. Wait, the
