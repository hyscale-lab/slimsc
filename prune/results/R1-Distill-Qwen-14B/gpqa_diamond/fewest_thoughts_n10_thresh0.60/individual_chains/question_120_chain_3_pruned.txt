Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to the concepts, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Hmm, let's see.

So the setup is that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if a star is closer, its parallax is higher, right? Because as you go farther away, the parallax decreases.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax range changes with parallax. So we're looking for N(∆plx) ∝ something with plx.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, that probably means that the number density of stars is constant. Wait, but how does that translate to parallax?

I remember that the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a volume would be proportional to the volume itself.

But parallax comes into play because when you look at stars with higher parallax (closer stars), you might have more of them in a certain range. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Let me think about the relation between distance and parallax. Plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. The volume around the Earth up to distance d is (4/3)πd³. But wait, if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars within a sphere of radius d is proportional to the volume,
