Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. So, it's about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

The question says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both orbits are circular. So planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift, and planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method's Doppler shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets are detected, the inclination must be such that the Doppler shift is measurable, so maybe we can ignore inclination differences because both are detected. Or maybe the same inclination assumption is valid here.

So, the formula I recall for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2))) ) ) * something... Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for K.

Alternatively, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²) ) )

But since both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like) and the stars are similar (solar mass), M_* is about the same, and M_p is the same for both. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so the denominator (1-e²) is 1. So, K should be proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) * (1/P)^(1/3).

Wait, but the star and planet masses: M_* is much larger than M_p. Since M_p is Neptune-like, which is about 17 Earth masses, and the star is solar mass, which is about 333,000
