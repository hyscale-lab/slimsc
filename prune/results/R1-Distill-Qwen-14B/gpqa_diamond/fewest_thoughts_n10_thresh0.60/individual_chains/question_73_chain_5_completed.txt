Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I should use the theory of relativity, specifically Einstein's equations.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, the first thing I need to determine is their relative speed. Wait, relative to each other? Or relative to the ground? Oh wait, the question says "relative speed," which I think means the speed of one as observed from the other's frame. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the speed at which one catches up to the other, but since they're both moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but relativistic addition is more complicated than that.

Wait, no. When considering the relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds, I can't just subtract their velocities. I remember that the correct formula to find the relative velocity in special relativity is given by the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If object A is moving at u relative to an inertial frame, and object B is moving at v relative to the same frame, then the speed of B as seen from A is (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Or is it (u - v) over something else? Wait, no, it's (v - u) divided by (1 - (u*v)/(c²)) because when you switch frames, the velocity goes the other way.

Wait, let me get this straight. Suppose astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c in the +x direction, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c in the +x direction. So from A's frame, what's B's velocity?

Wait, no. Wait, if both are moving in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving slower. So the relative velocity would be (B's speed - A's speed) divided by (1 minus (B's speed * A's speed)/(c^2)).

Wait, more accurately, the velocity of B as seen from A's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Let me plug in the numbers. u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c.

So (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) → (-0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²)) → (-0.1c)/(1-0.3) → (-0.1c)/(0.7) → approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction. So the magnitude is about 0.1428c, which is roughly 0.14c. So the relative speed would be 0.14c. So looking at the options, both options C and D have 0.14c as v_rel.

Now, for the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

First, calculate the energy for each astronaut.

Astronaut 1: mass = 2m, speed = 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass = 3m, speed = 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c. That matches our calculations.

Let me double-check the relative speed. Using the formula (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, wait — no, I think I may have mixed up the order. Because the velocity of B as seen from A is (v - u)/[1 - (u v)/(c²)]. Since u is A's speed, and v is B's speed as measured in the lab frame. So in this case, A is moving at u=0.6c, and B is moving at v=0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²) ) = (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3 c²)/c²) → (-0.1c)/(0.7) → approximately -0.1428c. The magnitude is 0.1428c, so 0.14c when approximated. So that part is correct.

Therefore, relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So option C is the correct choice.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as observed from the other is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, so the magnitude of the relative speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 1
- Mass: \(2m\), Speed: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- \(E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2\)

#### Energy of Astronaut 2
- Mass: \(3m\), Speed: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- \(E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2\)

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(E \approx 5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**
