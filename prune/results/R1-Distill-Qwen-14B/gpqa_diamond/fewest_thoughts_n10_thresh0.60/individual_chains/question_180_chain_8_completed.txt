Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. 

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where one charge is, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. 

Wait, energy in an electric system usually refers to the potential energy. Yes, because when you bring charges together, you do work against the electric force, which stores potential energy. So the minimum energy probably refers to the configuration where the potential energy is lowest.

But wait, how does the configuration affect the potential energy? For a system of charges, the potential energy is the work done to assemble those charges from infinity to their current positions. Since the charges are all identical and of the same sign (assuming e is positive), bringing them closer would increase the potential energy because like charges repel. But wait, in this case, the 12 charges are already at 2 meters, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th is fixed, so maybe I don't need to consider bringing it from infinity because it's fixed.

Wait, no. Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the other 12 are being placed at 2m from P, which is where the 13th is. So each of those 12 charges is located 2 meters away from P, where the 13th charge is. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters from that central charge. 

But wait, the problem says it's an isolated system. So I think we're considering the potential energy between all pairs of charges. So we have to compute the potential energy between each pair and sum them all up. 

So the charges are all identical, each with charge 2e. The 13th is fixed, so the 12 others are each at 2m from it. But also, the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but are they fixed in space relative to each other? Or can they move as long as they stay 2m from P? Hmm, the problem says they're "constrained to stay at 2m from P." So their positions are fixed relative to P. But their mutual distances are not specified. Wait, that complicates things because the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves would depend on their arrangement.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So I think the minimum potential energy would be achieved when the 12 charges are placed as far apart as possible, to minimize the repulsion between them. But wait, if they are constrained to remain 2m from P, their positions form a sphere of radius 2m around P. So the minimal potential energy would be when their mutual distances are maximized. That would be if they are placed at the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something, but maybe it's easier to think of them as being uniformly distributed on the surface of the sphere. But perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential between the 12 charges is negligible compared to their potential with the central charge. Or maybe the problem is considering only the potential between the 12 and the 13th charge, fixed at P, and not considering the mutual potential between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, why? Because if the 12 charges are all on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m, then the distance between any two of them would be at least some value, say, the distance between adjacent points on the sphere. But for a large number of charges, the mutual potential could be significant. But with 12 charges, perhaps the mutual potential is non-negligible. But this problem is a bit tricky because the question is about the minimum energy of the system.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum energy is achieved when the 12 charges are as far apart as possible, so their mutual repulsion is minimized. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, because the potential energy between two positive charges is positive and increases as they get closer. So to minimize the potential energy, we would want to maximize the distance between them. But since they're constrained to be at 2m from P, their mutual distances can't be increased beyond what's possible on the sphere.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to ignore the potential energies between the 12 charges and only consider the potential between each of them and the 13th charge at P. Because that would simplify the calculations, and perhaps the mutual potential is not part of the question.

So perhaps the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge. Because if that's the case, then the mutual energies between the 12 charges are ignored, which might make sense if the problem is intended to be simpler.

So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge. So the potential energy between each pair is U_i = (k * q1 * q2) / r. Here, q1 is the 13th charge (2e), and q2 is each of the 12 charges (2e). So U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

But wait, the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. So that's correct.

So each of the 12 pairs contributes this value. So the total potential energy would be 12 * U_i.

Wait no, wait. The 12 charges are each at 2m from P. So each has a potential energy with the charge at P. So the total is 12 times the potential energy between one of them and the central charge.

So let's compute that.

First, the elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

So each charge is 2e, so 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988e9 N m²/C².

So for each pair, U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m).

Wait, wait. Wait, the distance between the central charge and each of the 12 is 2 m. So r = 2 m.

So U_i = k*(2e)(2e)/2m.

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

Compute (2e)^2: (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = let's compute that. 3.204^2 is approximately 10.2656, so 10.2656e-38 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 10.2656e-38 = (8.988 * 10.2656) * 1e-29.

Hmm, 8.988 * 10 is about 89.88, but 10.2656 is a bit more. Let's compute 8.988 * 10.2656.

8 * 10.2656 = 82.1248,

0.988 * 10.2656 ≈ 10.2656 * 0.988 ≈ approximately 10.2656 - (10.2656 * 0.012) ≈ 10.2656 - 0.123 = 10.1426.

So total is 82.1248 + 10.1426 ≈ 92.2674. So 92.2674e-29 J.

Then divide by 2m (r=2m):

So 92.2674e-29 / 2 = 46.1337e-29 J.

So each pair contributes approximately 4.61337e-28 J.

Wait, wait, 46.1337e-29 is 4.61337e-28 J.

Wait no, 1e-29 is 0.1e-28, so 46.1337e-29 = 4.61337e-28.

Each pair contributes that, and there are 12 such pairs.

So total U = 12 * 4.61337e-28 = 55.3604e-28 J.

Wait, 12 * 4.61337e-28 = 55.36044e-28 J.

Which is 5.536044e-27 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, option B is 2.822e-26, A is 5.645e-26, D is way bigger.

Wait, wait, maybe I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, let's compute each step precisely.

First, k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Each charge is 2e, so q = 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

Each pair contributes U_i = k * q1 * q2 / r.

q1 is the charge at P, which is 2e, same as q2. So it's (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute numerator: (3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 * 1e-38 = approximately 10.2656e-38.

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 10.2656e-38 = let's compute 8.988 * 10.2656 first.

8.988 * 10 = 89.88,

8.988 * 0.2656 ≈ let's compute 8 * 0.2656 = 2.1248, 0.988 * 0.2656 ≈ 0.2622. So total ≈ 2.1248 + 0.2622 ≈ 2.387.

So 89.88 +2.387 ≈ 92.267.

So 92.267e9 * 1e-38 = 92.267e-29 = 9.2267e-28 J.

Then divide by r=2m: 9.2267e-28 / 2 = 4.61335e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.61335e-28 * 12 = 55.3602e-28 = 5.53602e-27 J.

So that's approximately 5.536e-27 J.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27 and option B: 2.822e-26, which are higher. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs.

Wait, wait, the system has 13 charges. The 13th is fixed, so the 12 others are each interacting with it. So each of the 12 contributes a potential energy term with the 13th.

So that's 12 terms, each of U_i = k*(2e)^2 / 2.

So that's 12 * (k * (2e)^2 / 2).

Which is 6 * k * (2e)^2.

Wait, because 12 * (something /2) is same as 6 * something.

So 6 * k * (2e)^2.

So let's compute that:

6 * 8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2 = 10.265e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 10.265e-38 * 8.988e9 = 10.265 * 8.988e-29.

Wait, 10.265 * 8.988 ≈ 92.267.

So 92.267e-29 = 9.2267e-28.

Multiply by 6: 9.2267e-28 *6 = 5.536e-27 J.

Which brings us back to the same number as before.

So the total potential energy is approximately 5.536e-27 J.

Looking at the options: option C is 7.056e-27, which is a bit higher. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is ten times higher. Hmm, so why isn't there an option matching our calculation of ~5.536e-27?

Wait, perhaps I missed mutual potential energies between the 12 charges. Because the problem says it's an isolated system of 13 particles; so all pairs contribute to the potential energy. So perhaps I should consider the mutual potential between the 12 charges as well.

Oh wait, that would increase the total energy. So including their mutual interactions would add more energy, making the total higher than 5.5e-27.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum energy." Hmm, if the mutual potential between the 12 charges is positive, adding it would increase the total, so the minimum would be when the mutual potential is as low as possible. But how?

Wait, but for like charges, the mutual potential is positive, so to minimize the total energy, perhaps we can arrange them in a way that minimizes their mutual potential. But since they repel, the minimal mutual potential is when they're as far apart as possible.

But if they are constrained to be at 2m from P, the distances between them can't be increased beyond the maximum possible in that sphere. But for 12 charges, what's the maximum possible minimal distance between any two? It's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential between the 12 charges is zero, which isn't the case because they have the same charge. So perhaps the question is only considering the potential between each of the 12 and the 13th, and not the mutual between the 12. But that would mean the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial energy. Let me recompute.

Wait, let's recompute each step.

Each charge is 2e, so 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

The potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is:

U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2.

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2: 

3.204 squared is approximately (3.2)^2 = 10.24, but more accurately:

3.204 * 3.204 = let's compute:

3 * 3 =9,

3 * 0.204 = 0.612,

0.204 *3 =0.612,

0.204 * 0.204 ≈ 0.0416.

Wait, perhaps a better way: (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=3.2, b=0.004.

Wait, actually, 3.204 is 3.2 + 0.004. So (3.2 +0.004)^2 = (3.2)^2 + 2*(3.2)(0.004) + (0.004)^2.

3.2^2=10.24,

2*(3.2)(0.004) = 0.0256,

0.004^2= 0.000016.

So total is 10.24 + 0.0256 + 0.000016 = 10.265616.

So (3.204e-19)^2 = 10.265616e-38 C².

Multiply this by k (8.988e9):

8.988e9 * 10.265616e-38 = (8.988 * 10.265616) * 1e-29.

Compute 8.988 * 10.265616:

Let me compute 8.988 *10 =89.88,

8.988 *0.265616= let's compute 8.988 *0.2=1.7976,

8.988 *0.06=0.53928,

8.988 *0.005616= ~0.05033.

Adding up: 1.7976 + 0.53928=2.33688; 2.33688 +0.05033=2.38721.

So total is 89.88 +2.38721=92.26721.

So 92.26721e-29 J per pair.

Divide by 2: 92.26721e-29 / 2 = 46.1336e-29 =4.61336e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 pairs: 4.61336e-28 *12 =55.36032e-28 =5.536032e-27 J.

Hmm, same result as before. So around 5.536e-27 J.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match. The closest is option C:7.056e-27, but that's higher than our calculation. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is about ten times larger. Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, wait a minute. Could I have made a mistake in the number of pairs? The 12 charges each have a potential with the 13th. So that's 12 pairs. But what about the mutual potential between the 12 charges? If the problem is considering that, then I need to calculate that as well.

So, the potential energy between two same charges is positive, so adding that would increase the total potential energy. But wait, if the problem is to find the minimum energy, perhaps the mutual potential is considered, making the total higher, but the minimum would be when mutual potential is as low as possible, i.e., when the 12 charges are as far apart as possible.

But if I'm to include the mutual potential, I need to find the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. So how many such pairs are there? For 12 charges, the number of unique pairs is (12 choose 2) = 66 pairs.

Each of these pairs is at a certain distance from each other. But since all 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two can vary, but the average or the minimum would depend on the arrangement.

Wait, but for the minimum potential energy, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged as far apart as possible, which would be when they're uniformly distributed on the sphere, maximizing the average distance. But calculating the exact potential energy in that case is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential between the 12 charges is zero, which would be an oversimplification. But that's not correct because the charges are all the same and repel each other, so their mutual potential energy is positive.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only the potential energy between the charges and the fixed charge, not their mutual interactions. Otherwise, the answer would be higher than what I calculated, but none of the options match.

Hmm, wait, perhaps the problem states that the system is isolated, and thus the potential energy is calculated as the sum of all pairs. So the 13th charge is fixed, but the other 12 are all moving, so their mutual potential is part of the system's energy.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of three parts:

1. The potential between each of the 12 and the 13th: 12 * U1.

2. The potential between each pair of the 12: 66 * U2 (since there are 66 pairs).

But to compute U2, I need the distance between each pair of the 12. But without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't compute this exactly.

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So their positions are fixed on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m. So the mutual distances depend on their arrangement.

To minimize the total potential energy, the charges should be placed as far apart as possible on the sphere. The most efficient way to maximize the distance between any two charges is to arrange them as vertices of a regular polyhedron inscribed in the sphere.

But for 12 charges, the configuration would be a cuboctahedron or similar. However, calculating the exact distance between each pair is non-trivial, and I'm not sure if that's intended for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the potential between the 13th charge and the 12, and ignore the mutual potential between the 12. In that case, the energy would be approximately 5.5e-27 J, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking again at the options:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Wait, our calculation was about 5.5e-27, which is closest to option C, which is 7.056e-27. Hmm, but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B (2.822e-26) which is about 5 times higher.

Wait, did I miscalculate the number of pairs? Maybe the 13th charge isn't part of the 12, but maybe I mistakenly considered only 12 pairs. Wait, no, the 13th is fixed, so each of the 12 charges interacts with it, giving 12 pairs. But perhaps I forgot that the 13th is also a charge, so maybe the potential includes all possible pairs, including the 13th. But in that case, the 13th is fixed, so the 12 charges affect it, but the 13th doesn't move, so its potential is only with the 12.

Wait, no. The 13th charge is fixed, so the potential energy is between the 13th and each of the 12. So that's 12 terms.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps each of the 12 charges is being held fixed, and the 13th is brought into place. So the energy is the work done to bring the 13th charge from infinity to P, considering the presence of the 12 charges. Hmm, but in that case, the energy would be the potential energy of the 13th charge due to the 12 charges already present.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think.

If I bring the 13th charge (2e) from infinity to point P, which is surrounded by 12 charges each of 2e at 2m. The potential at point P due to the 12 charges would be the sum of their potentials.

Each of the 12 charges contributes a potential V = k*(2e)/2m. So V_i = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19 C) / (2 m).

So V_i = (8.988e9 * 3.204e-19) / 2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *3.204e-19 = let's compute 8.988 *3.204 = approx 28.81, so 28.81e-10 = 2.881e-9.

So V_i = 2.881e-9 / 2 =1.4405e-9 V.

There are 12 such potentials, so total V at P is 12 *1.4405e-9 =17.286e-9 V.

Then the potential energy of bringing the 13th charge (2e) to P is U = q * V = (2e) * (17.286e-9 V).

e is 1.602e-19 C, so 2e =3.204e-19 C.

U =3.204e-19 *17.286e-9 = let's compute 3.204 *17.286 ≈55.37e-28.

Wait, 3.204 *17.286:

3 *17.286=51.858,

0.204 *17.286≈3.528.

Total ≈51.858 +3.528=55.386.

So U ≈55.386e-28 J =5.5386e-27 J.

Which is the same as before. So the energy is about 5.5386e-27 J.

But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, but I think that when the 13th charge is brought to P, the 12 charges are already there. But does that affect the potential energy? Or is the potential energy already calculated correctly?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the total potential energy of the system, which includes the energy stored in assembling the 12 charges around P and then bringing the 13th. So the total energy would be the sum of the energy to place the 12 charges (which, since they are fixed, perhaps that energy is zero) and the energy to bring the 13th charge into place, which is what I calculated as ~5.5e-27 J.

But in that case, the answer would be approximately 5.538e-27 J, which isn't an option. The closest is option C, which is 7.056e-27. Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the potential at P due to the 12 charges.

Each charge is at 2m, so the potential each contributes is (k * 2e) / 2m.

Which is (8.988e9 * 3.204e-19) / 2.

Wait, let me compute this again.

8.988e9 *3.204e-19 = (8.988 *3.204) *1e-10.

8.988 *3 =26.964,

8.988 *0.204= approx 1.832.

Total is 26.964 +1.832=28.796.

So 28.796e-10 =2.8796e-9.

Divide by 2: 1.4398e-9 V per charge.

12 charges: 12 *1.4398e-9=17.2776e-9 V.

Multiply by 2e (3.204e-19 C):

3.204e-19 * 17.2776e-9 = let's compute.

3.204 * 17.2776:

3 *17.2776=51.8328,

0.204 *17.2776≈3.523.

So total ≈51.8328 +3.523≈55.3558.

So 55.3558e-28 J=5.53558e-27 J.

Hmm, same result. So again, approximately 5.536e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects me to include the mutual potential of the 12 charges.

Wait, let's compute the mutual potential energy between all 12 charges. Since each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between the i-th and j-th charge.

But without knowing r_ij, it's hard. However, perhaps for the sake of the problem, the mutual potential is considered negligible, or perhaps the problem expects only the central charge's potential to be considered.

Wait, but option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 28% higher than my calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs.

Wait, wait a second. The 13th charge is fixed, and the 12 are each at 2m. So each of the 12 has a potential energy with the 13th. So 12 terms.

But in calculation, I considered 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = 12 * (k*(4e²))/(2m).

But wait, (2e)^2 is 4e². So 4e² = (2e)^2.

So, 12 * (k *4e²) / (2m) = 24 * (k e²) / m.

Wait, perhaps this is a simpler way to compute it.

e is 1.602e-19 C, so e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

So 4e² = 4 *2.566e-38 =10.264e-38 C².

Wait, no,  e is 1.602e-19, so (2e)^2=4e²=4*(1.602e-19)^2=4*(2.566e-38)=10.264e-38 C².

So U = 12 * (k *10.264e-38)/(2*2).

Wait, wait, no. No, the denominator is 2m (r=2m).

So U = 12 * (k * (2e)^2) / (2m) = (12 * k *4e²)/(2m) = (48 k e²)/(2m) =24 k e²/m.

So 24 * k * e² / m.

Compute this:

k=8.988e9,

e²= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 C²,

m=2 meters.

So U=24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 / 2.

Wait, let me compute:

24 /2 =12.

So U=12 * 8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) * 1e-29.

8 *2.566=20.528,

0.988 *2.566≈2.535.

Total ≈20.528 +2.535=23.063.

So 23.063e-29.

Multiply by 12:23.063e-29 *12 =276.756e-29 =2.76756e-27 J.

Hmm, about 2.768e-27 J. But wait, that's different from the earlier 5.5e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 =8.988 *1e9,

2.566e-38 =2.566 *1e-38.

Multiply: 8.988 *2.566 ≈23.063, and 1e9 *1e-38=1e-29.

So 23.063e-29.

Multiply by 12: 23.063e-29 *12=276.756e-29 =2.76756e-27 J.

Wait, that's about 2.77e-27 J.

But this is significantly different from the previous calculation. What did I do wrong earlier?

Wait, earlier I computed each U_i as (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), which is (k*4e²)/(2m) = (2 k e²)/m.

Then times 12: 24 k e²/m.

Wait, now I'm getting 24 k e²/m = 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, wait, no, because 4e² is (2e)^2 =4e², which is correct. So when I computed earlier, I think I multiplied by 12 correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it differently. Let me redo the entire calculation in a step-by-step manner.

Compute (2e)^2 = (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 =10.265e-38 C².

Then, U for one pair: (8.988e9) * 10.265e-38 / (2 *2) [since r=2m].

Wait, no, r is 2m, so denominator is 2m.

So U_i = (8.988e9) *10.265e-38 / 2 = (8.988 *10.265) /2 *1e-29.

Compute 8.988 *10.265: 

8 *10=80,

8 *0.265=2.12,

0.988 *10=9.88,

0.988 *0.265≈0.261.

So sum up:

80 +2.12=82.12,

+9.88=92,

+0.261=92.261.

So 92.261 /2=46.1305.

So 46.1305e-29 =4.61305e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.61305e-28 *12=55.3566e-28=5.53566e-27 J.

Ah, so the earlier calculation is correct. So where did I go wrong in the second approach?

Wait, in the second approach, I computed U=24 * k *e² / m.

But let's compute that:

24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 =8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 =2.306e-28.

Multiply by 24: 2.306e-28 *24=55.344e-28=5.5344e-27 J.

Ah! Wait, I see. Earlier, I think I forgot to multiply by 4 in the second approach because (2e)^2 is 4e², not e².

So the correct calculation would be:

U = 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) =12 * (k *4e²)/(2m) =12 * (2 k e²)/m =24 * (k e²)/m.

But in my second approach, I used e² (without the 4), which was a mistake. No, wait, in the second approach, I correctly used 4e².

Wait, no, in the second approach, when I used 4e², I got 2.767e-27 J, but that must be incorrect because the correct approach is 5.53e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach's calculation. Let me compute 24 * (k *4e^2)/ (2m).

Wait, no, the correct formula is U = 12 * (k (2e)^2)/(2m) = 12 * (k *4e²)/(2m) = 24 * (k e²)/m.

So, compute:

24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, 24/(2) =12.

So 12 *8.988e9 * (2.566e-38).

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =23.06e-29.

Multiply by 12: 23.06e-29 *12=276.72e-29 =2.7672e-27 J.

Wait, that's different from the other approach. So this suggests a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the factors. Let me clearly write:

U = 12 * (k * (2e)^2) / (2m).

(2e)^2 =4 e².

So U=12 *k*4 e²/(2m) = (12*4)/(2) * (k e²/m) =24 * (k e²/m).

So U =24 * (8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 ) /2.

Wait, no, wait, the denominator is 2m, so:

U=12 * (k *4 e²) / (2m).

Which is 12 * (4) / (2m) *k e².

Which is 12 *2 * (k e²/m) =24 (k e²/m).

Wait, no, 4/(2m) is 2/(m), not (2/m) * (1/m). Wait, no, denominator is 2m. So 4/(2m) = 2/(m).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recompute.

U =12 * [ (k * (2e)^2) / (2m) ]

(2e)^2 is 4e².

So:

U=12 * [ (k *4 e²) / (2m) ) ]

=12 * [ (4 k e² ) / (2m) ) ]

=12 * [ (2 k e²) / m ) ]

=24 * (k e² / m )

Yes, correct. So U=24 * (8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 ) / 2.

Wait, where did the division by 2 come from? Oh, because I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering the units correctly.

Wait, no. The formula is U=24*(k e²)/m.

So let me compute it:

k =8.988e9,

e=1.602e-19,

m=2.

So,

U=24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 /2.

Wait, no, the formula is 24 * (k e²)/m.

So,

(8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 =8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 =2.306e-28.

Then divide by m=2: 2.306e-28 /2 =1.153e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *1.153e-28 =27.672e-28 =2.7672e-27 J.

Wait, that's the same as before, but earlier when I considered U_i for each pair, I got 5.53e-27 J.

So which is correct?

Ah, wait a second. I think I see where I went wrong. In the first approach, I considered each of the 12 pairs contributing U_i = (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). So 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = 12*(k*(4e²))/(2m) )=12*(2 k e²/m )=24 k e²/m.

But in the second approach, when I computed it, I mistakenly did 24 * (k e²)/m, which actually is incorrect because it should be 24 * (k *4 e^2)/m, because (2e)^2 is 4e².

Wait, no, wait. 24 comes from 12 * (4e²) / (2m) *k.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it directly.

So, (2e)^2 =4e².

So,

U =12 * (k *4e²)/(2m) ) =12 * (4 k e² )/(2m) ) =12*(2 k e²/m) )=24 * (k e²/m).

So, U=24 * (8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 ) /2.

Wait, no, m is 2, so the denominator is 2.

So,

U=24 * (8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 ) / 2.

Hmm, let me compute 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

8.988e9 * (2.566e-38) = (8.988 * 2.566) *1e-29.

Which is about 23.06 *1e-29 =2.306e-28.

Then, 24 * (2.306e-28) /2.

24/2=12.

So 12 *2.306e-28=27.672e-28=2.7672e-27 J.

But this contradicts the earlier calculation where I got 5.53e-27 J. So which is correct?

Ah, wait. Because in the first approach, I correctly calculated that each pair contributes 4.613e-28 J, and 12 pairs give 5.536e-27 J, which is about 5.5e-27.

In the second approach, I think I made a mistake by forgetting that (2e)^2 is 4e², so when I used e² instead of 4e², I got a lower value. Oh wait, no, in the second approach, I used e² correctly because I considered (2e)^2=4e².

Wait, no, in the second approach, I correctly used 4e², which gives me 2.767e-27 J, which is about half of the first approach's result. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the second approach is incorrect, and the first approach is correct. Because in the first approach, I correctly accounted for each pair's potential.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach's formula.

Let me re-express it:

U =12 * [ k*(2e)^2 / (2m) ].

Which is 12 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)] =12* [2 k e²/m] =24 * [k e²/m].

Which is correct.

But then, in the calculation, I think I incorrectly computed e² as 1.602e-19 C instead of (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 C, so e squared is (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 C².

So,

k=8.988e9,

so,

k *e² =8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.306e-28.

Then, divide by m=2: 2.306e-28 /2 =1.153e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *1.153e-28 =27.67e-28 =2.767e-27 J.

But earlier, when I calculated each pair, I got 5.53e-27 J. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, I think I see the error now. In the second approach, I used e as 1.602e-19 C, but when computing (2e)^2, it's 4*(1.602e-19)^2, which is 4e², not e².

Wait, no, in the second approach, I correctly accounted for (2e)^2 =4e². So the calculation is correct, but that leads to 2.767e-27 J, which is about half of the first approach's result.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

In the first approach:

Each pair contributes U_i =k*(2e)^2/(2m) = (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 ) /2.

Which is (8.988e9 *10.265e-38 )/2 = (9.226e-29)/2=4.613e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12:55.35e-28=5.535e-27 J.

In the second approach, formula:

U=24 * (k e² / m ).

Which is 24 * (8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 )/2.

Which is 24 * (8.988e9 *2.566e-38 )/2.

=24 * (2.306e-28)/2 =24 *1.153e-28=27.67e-28=2.767e-27 J.

So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because the second approach is wrong. Because (2e)^2 is 4e², so when you compute (k * (2e)^2 ), it's k *4e², not k *e².

Wait, wait a minute, in the second approach, I used e² correctly, but I think I messed up the formula.

Wait, let's clarify:

U =12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)].

Which is 12 * [k*4e²/(2m)].

Which is 12 * [2 k e²/m ].

Which is 24 * [k e²/m ].

So, the correct formula is 24 * [k e²/m ].

Which is 24 * [8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 ] /2.

So,

8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 =8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.306e-28.

Then, 24 * (2.306e-28 ) /2 =24 *1.153e-28=2.767e-27 J.

But wait, earlier in the first approach, I calculated 5.53e-27 J, which is double this value. What's wrong?

Ah! Oh no, wait. Because in the first approach, I used (3.204e-19)^2, which is (2e)^2. So 3.204e-19 =2e.

So (3.204e-19)^2 =10.265e-38.

Then, 8.988e9 *10.265e-38 =9.226e-29.

Divide by 2:4.613e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.536e-27 J.

So in the second approach, I think I made a mistake by not using (2e)^2 correctly. Because when I use (2e)^2=4e², and proceed, I get a lower value.

Wait, no, I'm getting myself tied in knots. Let me recompute the terms correctly.

Each pair's potential energy is U_i =k*(2e)*(2e) / (2m) =k*(4e²)/(2m) =2 k e²/m.

So for 12 pairs, U =12 *2 k e²/m =24 k e²/m.

So,

24 * (8.988e9 ) * (1.602e-19 )^2 / (2).

Wait, m is 2.

So,

24 * (8.988e9 ) * (2.566e-38 ) / 2.

=24 * (8.988e9 *2.566e-38 ) /2.

=24 * (2.306e-28 ) /2.

=24 *1.153e-28.

=27.67e-28 =2.767e-27 J.

But in the first approach, when I calculated each pair's energy as k*(2e)^2/(2m), which is 2k e²/m, and multiplied by 12, I get 24 k e²/m, same as above, which gives 2.767e-27 J.

Wait, wait, no! Because in the first approach, I used (2e)^2 as 10.265e-38 (because (3.204e-19)^2=10.265e-38), which is correct. So why is this different from the second approach?

Ah, I think I'm making a mistake in the second approach by using e instead of 2e in the formula.

Wait, no, in the second approach, I correctly used (2e)^2 =4e². So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach's calculation. Let me recompute using exact numbers.

Compute U:

U=24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

So,

8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) *1e-29.

8.988 *2.566 ≈23.06.

So 23.06e-29.

Multiply by 24:23.06e-29 *24=553.44e-29=5.5344e-27.

Divide by 2:5.5344e-27 /2=2.7672e-27 J.

Wait, that's the same as before. But when I compute using the first approach, I get 5.536e-27 J.

So what's the mistake here?

Ah, I think I see the error now. In the second approach, I mistakenly divided by 2, but perhaps it's not needed.

Wait, the formula is U=24 * [ (k e²) / m ].

But m is 2, so it's 24 * [ (8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 ) / 2 ].

Which is 24 * [ (8.988e9 *2.566e-38 ) /2 ].

Compute the numerator:8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.306e-28.

Divide by 2:1.153e-28.

Multiply by24:27.67e-28=2.767e-27 J.

But in the first approach, the correct method gives 5.536e-27 J.

Wait, but wait, the first approach uses (2e)^2 which is 10.265e-38, while the second approach uses 4e²=4*(2.566e-38)=10.264e-38.

So the first approach is correct.

Wait, let me do the second approach correctly.

U=24 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)].

But (2e)^2 is 4e².

So,

U=24 * [ (8.988e9 *4e²) / (2*2) ].

Wait, m=2.

So,

U=24 * [ (8.988e9 *4e² )/(4) ].

Because denominator is 2m=4.

So,

8.988e9 *4e²=8.988e9 *4*(1.602e-19)^2.

But wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the first approach, which correctly gives 5.536e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mutual potential between the 12 charges, and only consider their potential with the 13th.

In that case, the correct answer would be approximately 5.536e-27 J. But none of the options match this. The closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the potential energy.

Each pair contributes:

U_i = k * (2e)^2 / (2m).

Which is 8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 /2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2 =10.2656e-38.

So,

8.988e9 *10.2656e-38 =9.226e-29.

Divide by 2:4.613e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.536e-27 J.

So, 5.536e-27 J.

Looking back at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be expressed in terms of eV, but the options are in J. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot that each charge contributes to the potential of the others. For example, each charge contributes to the potential of the 13th, but the 13th is fixed. Or perhaps the problem includes the potential energy between the 12 charges.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are fixed on the sphere, their mutual potential energy would be a sum over all pairs, each contributing U_ij =k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j.

But without knowing their exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute the exact value. However, perhaps the problem considers that the mutual potential is negligible, so only the potential between the 13th and the 12 is considered.

In that case, the correct answer would be approximately 5.536e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps I should reevaluate the problem.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential is zero, which is impossible because they're all positive. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is considered but the problem is simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use a different formula, such as considering the potential energy as U= (k q^2 )/(2 r), treating the 12 charges as a single entity. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if the 12 charges are treated as a single charge 12*2e=24e, then the potential energy between the 24e and the 2e is U= (k*(2e)*(24e))/(2m).

Which is (8.988e9)*(48e²)/(4).

So,

48e² =48*(1.602e-19)^2=48*2.566e-38=1.2277e-36.

Multiply by 8.988e9:8.988e9 *1.2277e-36 =1.098e-26.

Divide by 4:1.098e-26 /4=2.745e-27 J.

Which is close to the earlier 2.767e-27 J. But again, this doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential is zero. But that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the potential energy between the 12 charges as a single term, but that's unclear.

Given the confusion and time I've spent, perhaps the intended answer is option A:5.645e-26 J. But wait, that's ten times higher than my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me check.

In the first approach, the calculation was 5.536e-27 J.

Looking at option C:7.056e-27 J.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for any possible error in exponents.

Wait, let's recompute:

(2e) =3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2= (3.204e-19)^2=10.2656e-38 C².

k=8.988e9 Nm²/C².

So, U_i = (8.988e9) *10.2656e-38 / (2 *2).

Wait, r=2m, so denominator is 2*2=4 m.

Wait a second! Oh! I think I found the mistake.

Yes! I think I made a mistake in the denominator. Earlier, I thought r=2m, so denominator is 2 m. But wait, no: the distance is 2 meters, so r=2 m. So the denominator is 2 m, not 2 meters multiplied by something else.

Wait, no, the denominator is just 2 meters, so the calculation was correct.

Wait, no, in the first approach, I used 2m as the denominator, which is correct. So U_i = k*(2e)^2/(2m) = (8.988e9 *10.2656e-38)/2.

Which is (9.226e-29)/2=4.613e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 gives 5.536e-27 J.

But wait, perhaps I should have used 2 *m, which is 4 meters? No, because the distance from P is 2 meters.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. The potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r.

Yes, so for each pair, r=2m. So the denominator is 2, not 4.

Yes, so the denominator is 2 meters.

So the correct calculation is 5.536e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects us to consider the mutual potential between the 12 charges, leading to a higher total energy.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use a different approach.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering all possible pairs, including the 13th charge with the 12, and the 12 mutual pairs.

So the total potential energy is the sum of:

1. 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

2. (12 choose 2) * (k*(2e)^2)/(r_ij).

But without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential is zero, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is considered, but I'm not given enough information, so the problem expects only the first term to be considered.

Given that, and none of the options matching, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27.

But why? Let me compute 7.056e-27 /5.536e-27 = ~1.274. So perhaps I missed a factor of 1.274, which is approximately 4/3.14 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are arranged in a circle around P, leading to a different mutual potential.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the potential energy in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the potential energy as U = (k q^2 )/(2r), treating the 12 charges as a single entity.

Where q=12*2e=24e.

So, U = (8.988e9) * (24e)^2 / (2*2m).

Wait, (24e)^2= (24)^2 *e²=576 e².

So,

U=8.988e9 *576 e² / (4m).

Which is (8.988e9 *576 * (1.602e-19)^2 ) / (4*2).

Compute step by step:

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

Multiply by 576:576 *2.566e-38=1.481e-35.

Multiply by8.988e9:8.988e9 *1.481e-35=1.329e-25.

Divide by (4 *2)=8:1.329e-25 /8=1.661e-26 J.

But this is option B:2.822e-26 J, which is about twice this value. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula U= (k q^2)/(4r) is used, leading to 1.329e-25 /4=3.322e-26 J, still not matching any option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option B:2.822e-26 J.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me compute 5.536e-27 J as 5.536e-27 =5.536 *1e-27.

But option C is7.056e-27, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem includes the mutual potential of the 12 charges, which would increase the energy.

But without knowing the exact mutual distances, it's impossible to compute accurately. However, perhaps for simplicity, the mutual potential is considered to be negligible, leading to the energy being approximately 5.536e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have the 12 charges arranged in a way that their mutual potential is considered as part of the total, leading to a higher value.

Given the options, and the fact that option C is approximately 7e-27, which is about 28% higher than 5.5e-27, perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of pairs. Wait, 12 charges, each interacting with the 13th, gives 12 terms. But perhaps each term is being considered as two, leading to 24 terms, which would double the energy, giving 11.07e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the charges are arranged in a way that the mutual potential is being considered, but without more information, it's impossible to say.

Given the time I've spent, I'll go with the initial calculation of 5.536e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. The closest option is C:7.056e-27, which is about 28% higher. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for potential energy when bringing a charge into a field created by others. The potential energy of the 13th charge is q multiplied by the sum of potentials from the 12 charges.

Each charge contributes a potential V= k q / r. So each of the 12 charges contributes V= k*(2e)/2m.

So total potential at P is 12*(k*(2e)/(2m)).

So V=12*(k*(2e)/(2m))=12*(k e/m).

Then, the potential energy is U= q * V = (2e) * (12 k e/m) )=24 k e²/m.

Which is the same as 24*(8.988e9)*(1.602e-19)^2/(2).

Wait, m=2.

So,

24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 /2.

Which is 24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 /2.

=24 * (8.988e9 *2.566e-38) /2.

=24 * (2.306e-28)/2.

=24 *1.153e-28=2.767e-27 J.

Same as before.

So the correct answer is 2.767e-27 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J.

But in that case, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have 13 charges, not 12.

Wait, the problem says 12 charges are at 2m, and the 13th is fixed. So 13 charges total.

But in any case, the calculation remains the same.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll go with the initial calculation of 5.536e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26 J, which is 10 times higher than my initial calculation. But I can't find a reason for that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (2e)^2.

Wait, 2e is 3.204e-19 C.

So (3.204e-19)^2 =3.204^2 *1e-38.

3.204^2=10.2656.

So 10.2656e-38 C².

Yes.

So,

k * (2e)^2/(2m) =8.988e9 *10.2656e-38 /2.

=9.226e-29 /2=4.613e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12:55.356e-28=5.5356e-27 J.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is placed at a distance of 2 meters from each other, but that's not what the problem states.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all 12 charges are placed at a distance of 2 meters from each other, which would be a different scenario.

But the problem states that each is 2 meters from P, not from each other.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer based on the calculations is approximately 5.536e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total electric potential energy of the system, which is the sum of the potential energies between all pairs of charges. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( q = 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 12 charges are constrained to remain at a distance of \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \) from a fixed charge at point \( P \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy Formula**:  
   The potential energy between two charges is given by:  
   \[
   U = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
   \]  
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) is Coulomb's constant, \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).

2. **Energy Between the 13th Charge and Each of the 12 Charges**:  
   Each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy term with the fixed charge at \( P \). For one pair:  
   \[
   U_i = \frac{k \cdot (2e) \cdot (2e)}{2} = \frac{k \cdot 4e^2}{2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \):  
   \[
   e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
   \]  
   \[
   U_i = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 4 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38}}{2} = \frac{9.226 \times 10^{-29}}{2} = 4.613 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such pairs:  
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot U_i = 12 \cdot 4.613 \times 10^{-28} = 5.536 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Mutual Potential Energy Between the 12 Charges**:  
   The problem does not explicitly state whether the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is to be included. If included, the total energy would increase due to the repulsion between the charges. However, the exact distances between the charges are not specified, making it difficult to compute their mutual potential energy. Assuming the problem only considers the energy between the 12 charges and the fixed charge at \( P \), the total energy remains \( 5.536 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \).

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated energy \( 5.536 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. The closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is approximately 28% higher than the calculated value. This discrepancy could arise from additional assumptions or approximations not explicitly stated in the problem.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the given options, the most reasonable answer is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, assuming the problem accounts for factors not explicitly detailed in the analysis.
