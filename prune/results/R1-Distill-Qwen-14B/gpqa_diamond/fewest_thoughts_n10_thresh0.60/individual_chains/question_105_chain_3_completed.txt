Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about starspots and exoplanets. Hmm, the question is about how the brightness variation caused by a star with spots compares to the variation caused by a planet. So the scenario is that a star with the same radius as the Sun has one hemisphere covered in dark spots. The spots have a filling factor of 20%, which I think means they cover 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K.

The problem says that when only one hemisphere is spotty, the photometric observations will show brightness variations due to the star's rotation. These variations can look like those caused by an exoplanet. The question is asking what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve if the star wasn't spotted.

Wait, so without spots, the exoplanet's transit would cause a dip in brightness. But with spots, the star itself has varying brightness which mimics a transit. So to get the same signal (same amplitude) as a planet, I need to calculate the planet's radius relative to the star's radius.

First, I think I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the maximum effect would be when the spots are on the side facing us. But since the star is rotating, the spots will move, causing the observed brightness to dip periodically.

The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, the star's overall brightness decreases. The variation in brightness (the amplitude) is due to the change in the star's flux when the spots are visible.

The flux from a star is proportional to its surface area multiplied by the temperature to the fourth power. But wait, when computing the brightness variation, we're looking at the change in flux when parts of the star (spots) are blocked or come into view.

Wait, no, the spots are not blocked, but they are cooler. So when the spotted area is visible, the total flux is less than when it's not. So the change in flux would be the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when the spots are visible.

Alternatively, when a spot is on the side we can see, it contributes less flux than the surrounding area. So the total flux from the star would be lower. The variation in flux depends on the area of the spots and their temperature compared to the rest of the star.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So each hemisphere has an area of (1/2) * 4π R² (since the surface area of a sphere is 4π R²). So the area covered by spots in one hemisphere is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R². Wait, wait, no: the hemisphere area is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So the total area of spots on the star is 0.4π R². Wait, but the star has two hemispheres. But the question says only one hemisphere is spotty. Oh right, so the other hemisphere is spot-free. So when the star rotates, the spotty side comes into view only once per rotation. Wait, no, that depends on the rotation period and how the spots are arranged. But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, it's better to model the maximum possible variation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view as the star faces us. So the maximum effect would be when the spots are fully visible, and the minimum when they're on the far side.

But more accurately, the brightness variation due to spots would be periodic, with an amplitude depending on the area of the spots and their temperature compared to the rest of the star.

So the brightness variation (ΔF) caused by the spots is the difference between the star's flux when the spots are on the near side and when they're on the far side.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = 4π R² σ T^4. Wait, no. The flux from the star is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4, but integrated over the surface area. So the total luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T^4.

But when parts of the star are cooler, the total flux is reduced by the area of the spots times the difference in their flux.

So the observed flux when the spots are visible is L = L0 * (1 - f * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4)), where f is the filling factor. Wait, no. Let's think: the total flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions.

The unspotted regions have flux σ T^4, and the spotted regions have σ (T-ΔT)^4. The filling factor f is the fraction of the area covered by spots. So the total flux would be F = F_unspotted * (1 - f) + F_spotted * f.

Wait, more accurately: the star's surface is divided into two parts: the spots and the non-spots. The area of the spots is f times the area they cover. But in this case, the spots cover one hemisphere, with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, no, the star's radius is R, so each hemisphere is 2π R².

But the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere, so the area of spots on the visible hemisphere is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R².

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots on the other hemisphere (non-spotty) will come into view. No, no, because the problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots, the other isn't. So when the star rotates, the spots on one side are presented to us, then when it rotates 180 degrees, the non-spotty side is visible.

So the total flux when the spots are on the near side is L = (L0 * (1 - f) ) + (L_spots * f )

L0 is the luminosity per unit area of the non-spots: σ T^4. So L0 = σ T^4.

L_spots = σ (T - 1000K)^4 = σ (5000 K)^4.

The area of the spots as seen from Earth is f * (area of hemisphere) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

Wait, but actually, the entire area of the star is 4π R². So when the star is viewed such that one hemisphere is entirely visible, the area we see is 2π R². But the spots are 20% of the hemisphere's area. So the area of spots visible is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me perhaps compute the total luminosity when the spots are on the near side and when they're on the far side.

When the spots are on the far side, the entire near side is unspotted. So the flux is L0 = 4π R² σ T^4.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's total flux is always the same unless the spots are on the near side. Because when the spots are on the far side, they don't contribute to the flux we observe. So the flux when the spots are on the near side is L = (2π R²) * σ T^4 + (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, let me think again. The star's surface has two hemispheres: one with spots (covering 20% of its area) and one without. The area of each hemisphere is 2π R². So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the total flux would be the sum of the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

The unspotted area on the near side is (2π R² - 0.4π R²) = 1.6π R². The flux from this is 1.6π R² σ T^4.

The flux from the spots on the near side is 0.4π R² σ (5000)^4.

So the total flux when the spots are on the near side is F_spotty = 1.6 π R² σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

When the star rotates so that the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_clean = 2π R² σ T^4.

So the difference in flux is ΔF = F_clean - F_spotty.

Compute that.

ΔF = 2π R² σ T^4 - [1.6π R² σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

= (2π R² σ T^4) - 1.6π R² σ T^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4

= (0.4 π R² σ T^4 ) - (0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 )

= 0.4 π R² σ ( T^4 - (5000)^4 )

But wait, the star's Teff is 6000 K. So T is 6000 K.

So,

ΔF = 0.4 π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ]

The maximum variation in flux is ΔF when the star rotates into and out of spot visibility. So the amplitude of the variation is ΔF divided by the total flux when clean, or perhaps the peak to peak.

Wait, the amplitude is the difference between F_clean and F_spotty. So the maximum dip is ΔF.

Now, the question is, what would be the radius of a planet such that when it transits the star, the dip in brightness is the same as this ΔF.

The flux dip due to a planet is when the planet blocks some of the star's light. The amount blocked is the area of the planet's disk divided by the star's area.

So when the planet transits, the flux drops by (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) * F0, where F0 is the star's flux.

Wait no, the flux is proportional to the area blocked. The area blocked is (R_planet / R_star)^2 times the star's area (since the star's area is π R_star², but wait, the planet would block a part of it, so the blocked area is π R_planet^2. So the fraction of the star's area blocked is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So the dip in flux is (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) * F0.

Wait, but F0 is the star's flux, which is 4π R_star^2 σ T^4.

So the dip (ΔF_planet) is:

ΔF_planet = ( (R_planet^2) / (4π R_star^2) ) * 4π R_star^2 σ T^4 )

Wait, no, that's incorrect. The flux when the planet is not transiting is F0 = 4π R_star^2 σ T^4. When the planet transits, the flux is F0 minus the flux blocked by the planet, which is (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) * F0. Because the planet blocks an area (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) fraction of the star's surface.

So the dip is ΔF_planet = F0 * (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The star's flux when not transited is F0 = 4π R_star^2 σ T^4.

When the planet transits, it blocks an area of π R_planet^2. So the blocked flux is (π R_planet^2) * σ T^4. So the observed flux is F0 - (π R_planet^2 σ T^4).

So the dip is:

ΔF_planet = (π R_planet^2 σ T^4 ) / (4π R_star^2 σ T^4) ) * F0

Wait, no, perhaps the dip is (π R_planet^2) / (4π R_star^2) ) * F0.

Because the fraction of the star's area blocked is (R_planet^2)/(R_star^2).

So the dip is ΔF_planet = (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) * F0.

But wait, F0 is 4π R_star^2 σ T^4. So substituting, the dip is:

ΔF_planet = F0 * (R_planet^2 / R_star^2)

Which is the same as (R_planet / R_star)^2 * F0.

But in our case, the dip due to the spots is ΔF = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4).

Wait, so I'm getting confused. Let's set the two dips equal.

ΔF_spot = ΔF_planet.

So,

0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4) = (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) * F0.

But F0 is 4π R_star^2 σ (6000)^4.

Wait, since R_star is the same as R (the star's radius is same as Sun's, which is R_sun), but in the problem, R is the star's radius, and R_planet is the planet's radius. So substituting R = R_star.

So,

0.4 π R^2 σ (6000^4 -5000^4) = (R_p^2 / R^2) * 4 π R^2 σ (6000^4 )

Simplify:

0.4 π R^2 σ (6000^4 -5000^4) = 4 π R^2 σ (6000^4) * (R_p^2/R^2)

We can cancel terms on both sides. Let's see:

Left side: 0.4 π R^2 σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Right side: 4 π R^2 σ (6000^4) * (R_p^2/R^2 )

Divide both sides by π R^2 σ:

Left: 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Right: 4 (6000^4) R_p^2 / R^2

Wait, no, because R_p^2 / R^2 is a fraction, so the right side becomes 4 * 6000^4 * (R_p^2 / R^2 )

Wait, wait, let me write it as:

0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) = [4 * 6000^4 * R_p^2 ] / R^2

Wait, but R is the star's radius, which is the same as R_star, so R = R_star.

So,

0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) = 4 * 6000^4 * (R_p^2 / R^2 )

We can solve for (R_p^2 / R^2) = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 * 6000^4 ]

= [0.4 /4 ] * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4

0.4/4 is 0.1.

So,

(R_p^2 / R^2) = 0.1 * [ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 ]

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4.

Let me compute each term.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 5^4 *1e12 = 625e12=6.25e14.

So,

6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = (1.296 - 0.625) e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So,

(6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 = 6.71e14 / 1.296e15 ≈ 0.5179.

So,

(R_p^2 / R^2 ) ≈ 0.1 * 0.5179 = 0.05179.

Take the square root to find R_p / R = sqrt(0.05179) ≈ 0.2276.

Wait, wait, 0.05179 is approximately 0.0518. The square root of that is approximately 0.2276, which is about 0.228.

Wait, but this is the value of R_p / R, so about 0.228.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, none of these match 0.228. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated somewhere.

Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the flux dip due to the spots.

Wait, when the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower than when they are on the far side. The difference between these two fluxes is the variation.

I think perhaps the initial approach is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recompute:

Compute (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) = 6000^4 = (6e3)^4.

Compute 6e3^4: 6^4 = 1296, so 1296*(1e3)^4 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5e3^4: 5^4 =625, 625e12 =6.25e14.

So, 6e3^4 -5e3^4 = (1.296e15) - (6.25e14) = 6.71e14.

Then, 6.71e14 /1.296e15 = 6.71 / 12.96 ≈ 0.5178.

So, that part is correct.

Now, 0.1 * 0.5178 ≈ 0.05178.

Taking square root: sqrt(0.05178) ≈ 0.2276, which is about 0.228.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not just the hemisphere. Because the question says, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

Ah! Wait, that's a crucial detail. So the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere.

Wait, because the star's total surface area is 4π R². And one hemisphere is covered, but the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again.

"The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation."

So the star has one hemisphere covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere.

So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R².

The star's total surface area is 4π R², so the fraction of the star covered by spots is (0.4π R²)/(4π R² )= 0.1, or 10% of the entire star.

Wait, but the problem says "the star has a radius equal to that of the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So it's 20% of that hemisphere.

So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

Thus, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the area of spots visible is 0.4π R².

Wait, but the calculation I did earlier considered the flux when the spots are on the near side and when they're not.

So the calculation of ΔF is correct.

But the answer I got doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, another approach: the variation in brightness due to the spots is the same as the variation due to a planet's transit. So the amplitude of the light curve dip caused by the spots should equal that caused by the planet.

The dip due to spots: when the star is fully unspotted (no spots visible), the flux is F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is F0 - deltaF_spot.

Wait, no. Wait, when the spots are on the far side, all the flux is F0. When they're on the near side, the flux is F = (unspotted area flux) + (spotted area flux).

The unspotted area when the spotty hemisphere is visible is (2π R² - 0.4π R²) = 1.6π R².

Flux from unspotted area: 1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Flux from spots: 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

So total flux when spots are visible: [1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ] * π R² σ.

When the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, flux is 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the difference between these two is:

ΔF = (2 * 6000^4 - [1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ]) * π R² σ.

= [ (2 -1.6) 6000^4 + (-0.4)*5000^4 ] * π R^2 σ.

= [0.4 * 6000^4 - 0.4 *5000^4 ] * π R² σ.

= 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) * π R² σ.

Which is the same as before.

So the dip is 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) π R² σ.

The dip due to a planet is when the planet blocks a part of the star's surface. The dip is (R_p^2 / R^2) * F0, where F0 is the total flux.

F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So set the two dips equal:

0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) π R² σ = (R_p^2 / R^2) *4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

Simplify:

0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) R² = 4 R² (R_p^2 / R^2) (6000^4 )

Wait, wait, no. Let's divide both sides by π R² σ:

0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) = 4 (6000^4) (R_p^2 / R^2 )

So,

(R_p^2 / R^2 ) = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 *6000^4 ]

= [0.4 /4 ] * [ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 ]

= 0.1 * [ 0.671e15 / 1.296e15 ].

Wait, earlier calculation was 6.71e14 /1.296e15 = 0.5178.

So, 0.1 * 0.5178 = 0.05178.

So (R_p / R )^2 = 0.05178.

Taking square root, R_p / R ≈ sqrt(0.05178) ≈ 0.2276, which is approximately 0.228.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should model the maximum variation in brightness.

Wait, the brightness variation when the spots are on the near side is F_spotty = F0 * (1 - f * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 )).

Wait, yes, perhaps that's a more straightforward approach.

The flux from the star when the spots are visible is F_spotty = F0 * (1 - f * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4 )).

Wait, but the filling factor f here would be the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Earlier, I thought f was 20% of the hemisphere, which is 10% of the entire star. So f = 0.1.

So, F_spotty = F0 * (1 - 0.1 * (5000^4 /6000^4 )).

The dip would be F0 - F_spotty = F0 * 0.1 * (5000^4 /6000^4 ).

Wait, no. Let me recalculate.

F_spotty = F0 * (1 - f * ( (T_spot / T_star )^4 )).

So,

F_spotty = F0 (1 - 0.1*(5000/6000)^4 )

The dip would be F0 - F_spotty = F0 * 0.1*(5000/6000)^4.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the spots contribute less flux. So the total flux when spots are visible is F0 * (1 - f * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) / T_star^4 ), but this might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is:

The unspotted part contributes F_unspotted = (1 - f) * F0, and the spotted part contributes f * F_spot.

So F_spotty = (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot.

F_spot = F0 * (T_spot / T_star )^4.

So,

F_spotty = (1 - f) F0 + f F0 (T_spot / T_star )^4.

= F0 [ (1 -f) + f (T_spot / T_star )^4 ]

= F0 [ 1 - f (1 - (T_spot / T_star )^4 ) ]

So the dip is F_clean - F_spotty = F0 - F0 [ 1 - f (1 - (T_spot / T_star )^4 ) ] = F0 * f (1 - (T_spot / T_star )^4 )

Which would be the maximum dip when the spots are fully visible.

So,

ΔF = F0 * f (1 - (T_spot / T_star )^4 )

Now, the dip due to the planet is ΔF_planet = F0 * (R_p / R )^2.

Set these equal:

F0 * f (1 - (T_spot / T_star )^4 ) = F0 (R_p / R )^2.

Cancel F0:

f (1 - (T_spot / T_star )^4 ) = (R_p / R )^2.

So,

(R_p / R )^2 = f ( 1 - (T_spot / T_star )^4 )

Compute this:

f = 0.1 (since the spots cover 10% of the star's surface).

T_spot =5000 K, T_star=6000 K.

(T_spot / T_star ) =5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So,

1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by f=0.1:

0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775.

So,

(R_p / R )^2 = 0.051775 → R_p / R = sqrt(0.051775 ) ≈ 0.2276.

Again, same result as before, about 0.228 R.

Hmm, but none of the options match. The closest option is D) ~0.32, but that's larger. Alternatively, maybe I have some miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the filling factor. Let me go back to the problem statement.

The problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R².

The total surface area of the star is 4π R². So the spots are 0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface.

So f=0.1, correct.

Hmm. So the calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't one of the options. Am I missing something?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the variation in brightness, which would be the peak-to-peak amplitude, not the dip. Wait, but in that case, the maximum variation would be from the dip and then back to normal, so the peak-to-peak amplitude is twice the dip. Let me check that.

Wait, no. The dip is the decrease in flux when the spots are visible. So the amplitude of the light curve is the maximum dip, which is the same as the ΔF we calculated. So the planet's dip is (R_p / R )^2 * F0, which we set equal to the spot dip.

Wait, perhaps I should instead calculate the relative change in flux. Because when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0. When on the near side, it's F0 - deltaF.

So the amplitude is deltaF. So the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p / R )^2 * F0.

So the setup is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is larger because the spots are cooler. Wait, but the calculation already took that into account, as the spots contribute less flux.

Wait, maybe I should think about the brightness variation being the same as the planet's transit, but perhaps the observer would see the same amplitude in the light curve whether it's a planet or spots. So the amplitude for the spot is the delta F, and the planet's is (R_p / R )^2 F0.

But according to my calculations, R_p/R is about 0.228, which is approximately 0.23. None of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative flux change caused by the spots.

The relative change is (F_clean - F_spotty ) / F_clean.

Which is [ F0 - F_spotty ] / F0 = [ deltaF ] / F0.

Which is equal to f (1 - (T_spot/T_star )^4 )

So [ deltaF ] / F0 = 0.1 (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775.

The relative dip is 5.1775%.

The planet's relative dip is (R_p / R )^2.

So setting these equal, (R_p / R )^2 = 0.051775 → R_p/R ~ 0.2276.

Again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots as 20% of the entire star, not just the hemisphere. So the area of spots would be 0.2 *4π R² = 0.8 π R².

In that case, f=0.2.

Then,

(R_p/R )^2 = 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

So R_p/R = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.322, which matches option D (~0.32).

Ah! So perhaps I misinterpreted the filling factor. The problem says the hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, which could mean 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere.

Wait, but the problem states: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

So the "filling factor" is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

But if the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then the area is 0.2 *4π R² =0.8 π R².

But that would change the calculation, making f=0.2, leading to R_p/R ~0.32.

So perhaps this is the correct approach.

But the question says "filling factor of 20%", which typically refers to the area they cover on the surface they're on. So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, not the entire star.

But perhaps in the problem, the filling factor is 20% of the entire star. So I should recalculate with f=0.2.

So,

(R_p/R )^2 = 0.2 (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 *0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

R_p/R ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218 → ~0.32.

Which matches option D.

So perhaps my initial approach was wrong because I thought the filling factor was for the hemisphere, but perhaps it's for the entire star.

But the problem says the spots are on one hemisphere. So f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots, which is 20% * (hemisphere area / total area).

Wait, no. The problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Thus, f is 0.2 * (2π R²) divided by 4π R² = 0.1.

So f=0.1.

But if the problem intended that f is 20% of the entire star, then f=0.2. So which is correct?

The standard definition of filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. So if the spots are on a hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere, then f is 0.1.

But perhaps the question intended that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, so f=0.2.

In that case, the answer would be D) ~0.32.

But considering the wording, I think the correct approach is f=0.1.

Hmm, but that leads me to a contradiction since the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is applied per hemisphere but in a way that the overall coverage is 20% of the star's surface.

Wait, if one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%, then the area is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 20% of 2π R², so 0.4π R².

Thus, f=0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1.

Yes, that's correct.

So with f=0.1, R_p/R is ~0.2276, which is not one of the options. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to come into view only when the hemisphere is facing us, and the other hemisphere is spot-free.

Wait, when the star rotates, the spot coverage alternates between the near and far side.

But in any case, the maximum dip is when the spotty hemisphere is fully facing us, and the minimum when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us.

So the approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative brightness variation. The relative variation is deltaF / F0.

Which is 0.051775.

The planet's relative variation is (R_p / R )^2.

Set them equal:

(R_p / R )^2 = 0.051775 → R_p/R = 0.2276 → ~0.228.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the question is about the planet causing a variation equal to the maximum variation, which would be the case when the planet blocks the same area as the spots.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the total area of the spots, but in a way that when the star rotates, the spots can be either on the near or far side.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the planet's radius such that the maximum dip in the light curve due to the planet equals the maximum dip due to the spots.

In that case, the calculation is correct, but perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of flux:

The flux from the star varies between F0 and F0 - deltaF.

The relative variation is deltaF / F0 = 0.051775, which is about 5.18%.

The planet's transit causes a relative variation of (R_p / R )^2.

Set these equal: (R_p / R )^2 = 0.051775 → R_p/R ~ 0.228.

But no option matches this. So perhaps the problem intended to have the spots cover 20% of the entire star, leading to f=0.2 and R_p/R ~0.32.

So the answer would be D) ~0.32.

I think I must have made a mistake in interpreting the filling factor. Given that the options don't match my calculation, I'll proceed under the assumption that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, leading to the answer D.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using f=0.2, leading to R_p/R= ~0.32, which is option D.

So I'll choose D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} = R \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler by \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Filling Factor**:
   - The filling factor of 20% refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. The area of one hemisphere is \( 2\pi R^2 \), so the area of the spots is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2 \).
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R^2 \), so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is \( f = \frac{0.4\pi R^2}{4\pi R^2} = 0.1 \).

3. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The flux from the star when spots are visible is reduced because the spots are cooler. The total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted regions:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = F_0 \cdot \left( 1 - f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} \right)^4 \right) \right),
     \]
     where \( F_0 \) is the total flux of the star without spots.
   - The dip in flux (\( \Delta F \)) when the spots are visible is:
     \[
     \Delta F = F_0 \cdot f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]

4. **Brightness Variation Due to a Planet**:
   - When a planet transits the star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet's disk relative to the star's surface:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = F_0 \cdot \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]

5. **Equating the Two Variations**:
   - To produce the same amplitude in the light curve, set \( \Delta F = \Delta F_{\text{planet}} \):
     \[
     F_0 \cdot f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} \right)^4 \right) = F_0 \cdot \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - Cancel \( F_0 \) and solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]

6. **Substitute Values**:
   - \( f = 0.1 \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_{\text{star}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Compute \( \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225 \).
   - \( 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775 \).
   - \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1 \cdot 0.51775 = 0.051775 \).
   - \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2276 \).

7. **Revisiting the Filling Factor**:
   - If the filling factor is interpreted as 20% of the entire star's surface (\( f = 0.2 \)), the calculation changes:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.2 \cdot 0.51775 = 0.10355,
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The problem's wording is ambiguous regarding the filling factor. If \( f = 0.1 \), the result is \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.228 \), which does not match any option. However, if \( f = 0.2 \), the result is \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.32 \), which matches **Option D**. Given the options, the intended interpretation likely assumes \( f = 0.2 \).

**Answer: D**
