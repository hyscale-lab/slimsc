Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because pH calculations can be tricky, especially when multiple acids and bases are involved. Let's see what the problem says.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with some numbers. Hmm. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider neutralization reactions, and then see if there's excess acid or base left.

First, I should probably find the moles of each acid and base in the solutions. Moles are calculated by Molarity multiplied by Volume (in liters). Let's calculate them one by one.

Starting with CH3COOH (acetic acid). It's 500 mL of 0.1 M. So, 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely, but I might need that later.

Next, HCl. It's a strong acid, so it'll dissociate completely. 400 mL of 0.2 M is 0.4 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol HCl. HCl gives H+ and Cl- ions.

Then, Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH⁻. So each mole gives two moles of OH-. 300 mL is 0.3 L, 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. So moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Now, when you mix acids and bases, they neutralize each other. The H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base to form water. But wait, I have two acids here (CH3COOH and HCl) and one base. So I should sum the moles of H+ from the acids and compare them to the moles of OH- from the base.

So total H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol (since HCl is strong and fully dissociates). Acetic acid is weak, so it won't contribute much H+ initially. Let me think: because the problem is about neutralization, perhaps I should first consider how much H+ is neutralized by OH-.

Wait, maybe I should treat all the H+ and OH- together. So, the equivalents would be:

H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

H+ from CH3COOH: since it's a weak acid, it's not fully ionized, but in the presence of OH- from the base, the OH- will react with any available H+.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total H+ and total OH-, and see which is in excess.

Wait, let me think again. The total H+
