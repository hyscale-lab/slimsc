Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, are involved here. 

So, the problem states that we have Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. Wait, I think beta values are for the complexes in order of increasing ligand count. So, beta1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, beta2 is [Co(SCN)2]^2+, beta3 is [Co(SCN)3]^0, and beta4 is [Co(SCN)4]^2-? Or maybe I should double-check the order. Oh right, the stability constant increases with the number of ligands for stronger complexes.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I'm assuming is the [Co(SCN)2]^2+ ion. So that's the second complex, the one with beta2=40.

I think I need to calculate the distribution of each cobalt species and then find the fraction that's the dithiocyanato complex.

The general approach is to model the different complexes and use their stability constants to find their concentrations. Since the solution has free Co(II), SCN-, and all the possible complexes, the total concentration of Co is the
