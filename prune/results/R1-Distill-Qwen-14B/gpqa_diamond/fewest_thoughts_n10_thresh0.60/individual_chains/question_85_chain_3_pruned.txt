Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature, right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it balanced the incoming and outgoing radiation. I remember that the formula for equilibrium temperature involves the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and some constants.

Wait, the star's parameters are given: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets have masses of 7 and 5 Earth masses, but I don't think the mass affects the equilibrium temperature because that's more about the gravitational pull and maybe the RV method. The radii of the planets are 1.7 and 1.3 Earth radii, but again, not sure if that's needed for temperature.

The question gives me information about the Doppler shifts from the RV method. Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 0.04 Å. Oh wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement because of the planet's gravity. So the Doppler shift relates to the mass and orbital period of the planet, but maybe also the distance from the star.

But wait, equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) ), right? Because the star's flux at the planet's orbit is (L / (4π a²)), and the planet emits as a blackbody, so L/(16 π a²) = σ T_p^4. Oh wait, L is the star's luminosity. The star's luminosity depends on its radius and effective temperature: L = 4 π R_star² σ T_eff^4.

So putting it all together, the equilibrium temperature of a planet is T_p = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2a) ) * ( (M_planet / M_sun) ) wait, no, no, M_planet isn't in the equilibrium temperature formula. Oh wait, no, equilibrium temperature doesn't depend on the planet's mass. It's all about the distance from the star and the star's properties.

Wait, but how do I get the distance a for each planet? Because the Doppler shift data probably relates to the distance. Oh, right! The RV method gives the
