Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let's break it down. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just add them normally. Oh right, we have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when they say relative speed, I think they mean the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. Or maybe the relative speed between them? I'm not entirely sure, but in any case, it's the speed addition part.

So for two velocities u and v in the same direction, the relativistic formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/(c²)). Let me plug in the numbers. Wait, wait, let me get the formula right. Oh, right, the formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(c²)).

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. But wait, are they moving in the same direction? The problem states both are in the positive x-direction. So, from A's frame, what's the speed of B? Or maybe from the system's perspective, the relative speed between them? No, the question asks for the relative speed of the system. Wait, no, the question is about the relative speed between the two astronauts. Or does it mean the speed of one relative to the other's frame?

Wait, no, the question says "the relative speed and the total energy of the system." So maybe the relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other's frame? Or perhaps the speed of each astronaut relative to the center of mass? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem is about two astronauts moving in the same direction. So their relative speed is the difference in their speeds, but relativistically. Let's think about it. Let's say we're in the frame where astronaut A is moving at 0.6c. Then, what's the speed of astronaut B in that frame? Oh right, because A is moving at 0.6c in the same direction as B's 0.5c in the lab frame, but from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) adjusted relativistically. Wait, no. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in relativity, you can't just subtract speeds. You have to use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, actually, in the lab frame, both are moving in the same direction. So if I want to find the speed of astronaut B as seen from astronaut A's frame, I'd need to use the velocity addition formula. Let me correct that. Let's say the lab frame is S, and the frame of astronaut A is S'. In S, A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c. So from S' (A's frame), what's the velocity of B?

The formula for transforming velocities is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)), where v is the speed of S' relative to S. Here, S' is moving at v = 0.6c in the positive x-direction relative to S (the lab frame). So in S', the velocity u' of B is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the magnitude is about 0.1428c. So the relative speed between A and B is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. That would match one of the options.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc², and option D is 0.14c with E=5 mc². So that's one part done.

Now for the total energy of the system. So each astronaut has relativistic kinetic energy, but wait, the question is about the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Or wait, no, in relativity, the total energy is gamma times m c squared. So for each, E = γ m c².

So for astronaut A, mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Let's calculate gamma for A: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B, mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma for B: 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 m c². So looking back at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. So option C looks correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of the relative speed. Oh, I think I made a mistake in considering the direction. The relative speed's magnitude is 0.14c, so the correct relative speed is 0.14c, which is option C or D. Option D has the same speed but a different energy.

Wait, what's the problem statement again? Oh, the question is about the relative speed and the total energy. So option C has the correct relative speed and the correct total energy. So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame:
\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]
Here, astronaut A moves at \(v = 0.6c\), and astronaut B moves at \(u = 0.5c\) in the same direction. Substituting these values:
\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]
The negative sign indicates direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]
For astronaut A (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For astronaut B (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.5^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 = 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching the Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).
- The total energy is approximately \(5.96m c^2\).

These values match **Option C**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\).
