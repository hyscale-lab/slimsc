Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when a specific compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A to D, with possible indices of 1, 3, 5, or 0.

First, I need to figure out what the starting material looks like. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure.

So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with one double bond. The numbering is such that the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (which is a CHO group). And at position 5, there's a vinyl group (which is CH₂CH₂, but wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached, right? So the substituents on the cyclohexene ring are: at C2, CHO; at C5, CH₂CH₂? Wait, no, no. Wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH–. So the substituent is a vinyl group, which is a CH₂CH₂ group with a double bond? No, wait, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH– attached to the ring.

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring (double bond between C3 and C4), with a formyl group on C2 and a vinyl group on C5. Also, there's a carboxylic acid group. Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1? Because the numbering would go so that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. Wait, the cyclohexene ring is numbered such that the double bond is between 3 and 4. The carboxylic acid is part of the parent chain, so the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid end. So for a cyclohexene, the carboxylic acid would be at position 1, then the next positions go around the ring.

Wait,
