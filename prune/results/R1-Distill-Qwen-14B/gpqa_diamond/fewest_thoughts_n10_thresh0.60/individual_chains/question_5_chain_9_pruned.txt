Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied. So, I need to find the vector that corresponds to this eigenvalue.

The question gives me the components of the operator P: P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down to visualize better.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

Wait, but the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, any direction in the x-z plane implies that the direction is in the form where the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So, the direction vector n can be written using spherical coordinates. Since it's in x-z, the y-component is zero. So, n would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, angles are usually θ from z-axis and φ around. But for direction in x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π. Hmm, but perhaps the direction is given by an arbitrary angle θ in the x-z plane, which would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ)? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of direction vectors. Alternatively, perhaps the operator is a combination of P_x, P_y, P_z, but since it's along a direction in x-z plane, the y-component of the operator might be zero? Or maybe the direction is along a vector n=(nx, 0, nz) because it's in the x-z plane. So the operator P should be proportional to n · σ, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. Oh wait, because σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, which are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

So the
