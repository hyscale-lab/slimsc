Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

The operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ℏ/2. Wait, so I'm looking for the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue. 

The problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of their matrix representations. Specifically, P_x, P_y, and P_z each are given as (ℏ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix.

Let me write down each component matrix:

P_x is (ℏ/2) * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ].
P_y is (ℏ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].
P_z is (ℏ/2) * [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ].

So the operator vector P would be the sum of these components multiplied by the direction cosine along each axis. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the direction vector n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no, in the x-z plane, φ is zero or 180, so the direction is along θ measured from the z-axis perhaps. Or maybe more accurately, since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be from the z-axis towards x. So the direction vector components would be ( sinθ, 0, cosθ ), right? Because if φ is 0, that would point along the x-axis, and φ 90 would be along z. Wait, no: in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle. So for x-z plane, φ=0 or π, so direction vector is ( sinθ, 0, cosθ ). 

The operator P is in the direction of n, so the operator is P·n, which is P_x * (n_x) + P_y * (n_y) + P_z * (n_z). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P becomes P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z.

Wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x =
