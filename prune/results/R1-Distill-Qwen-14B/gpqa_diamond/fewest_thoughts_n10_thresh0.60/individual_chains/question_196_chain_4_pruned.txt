Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass is attached to a spring and it oscillates. But wait, this one is relativistic, so we have to consider special relativity effects, right? Oh, right, because when speeds get close to the speed of light, Newtonian mechanics don't apply anymore.

The question is asking about the maximum speed of the mass. The options are A to D, and each has a different formula. Let me think about how to approach this.

In the Newtonian case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy is maximum when the mass is at the amplitude A, and kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum. So, the potential energy is (1/2)kA^2, which equals (1/2)mv_max^2. Solving for v_max gives v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so C might not be the right answer here.

Relativistically, the energy isn't just kinetic; there's also rest mass energy. The total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, the oscillator's energy in relativity isn't the same as in the classical case. Or maybe it's quantized? No, the question says it's obeying Hooke's law, so it's a classical oscillator.

So, the energy of a relativistic harmonic oscillator must take into account relativistic effects on momentum and energy. The potential energy for a spring is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². Wait, no—relativistically, kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². But how does this tie into the oscillator's maximum speed?

Wait, in the Newtonian case, maximum speed is when all potential energy is converted to kinetic. But in relativity, the energy is different. The total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. But I think for a relativistic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². So, E_total = (gamma -1)mc² + (1/2)kx².
