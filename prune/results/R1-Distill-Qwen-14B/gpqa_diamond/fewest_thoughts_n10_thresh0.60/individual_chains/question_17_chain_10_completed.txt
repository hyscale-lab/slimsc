Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium. 

The given concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, but EDTA forms a complex with Ca²+ ions. The problem also mentions that the pH is ideal, so maybe activity coefficients are close to one, and the formation constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is 5x10^10. 

Wait, I think the formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (I'm not sure about the exact charge, but the idea is that they form a complex). 

So initially, the solution has the Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, it would release some Ca²+ ions and EDTA^4-. But wait, since the solution is at stoichiometric ratio, I think the initial concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be the same before they form the complex. 

Wait, actually, in the solution, the complex is present, and it's dissociating into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The formation constant K is given, which is very large, so the complex is stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be low.

I think the formula here is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the solution is stochiometric, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- before complexation were equal, but after forming the complex, each contributes to the concentration of the complex. 

Let me think, let's denote the concentration of the complex as C, which is 0.02 M. Then, when the complex dissociates, each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. But wait, the amount of dissociation is so small because K is so large. So maybe the concentration of free Ca²+ is equal to the concentration of free EDTA^4-.

Let me set up an ICE table. Initial concentrations: [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. [Ca²+] = 0, [EDTA^4-] = 0. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the complex is formed from the initial solution. Wait, perhaps the initial solution is made by mixing Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in a 1:1 ratio, then they form the complex. But the problem states that the solution contains the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

So the dissolution would be: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. So at equilibrium, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. But since K is so large (5e10), x must be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. 

So the expression becomes K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x². 

So 5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / 5e10. 

Wait, let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 2/(5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13? Wait, wait, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x² =4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-12)=1e-6, so 2e-6. So x is 2e-6 M? Wait, but that's not in the options. The options are 2e-2, 5e-3, 6.3e-7, 1e-2.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the problem. Let me think again. 

Wait, another way. The formation constant Kf is [Complex]/([Metal][Ligand]). But in this case, the complex is already present. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. 

But wait, the EDTA in solution could be either in the form of the complex or as free EDTA^4- or other species, but given that the pH is ideal, perhaps the EDTA is fully deprotonated. So, the total EDTA concentration is the sum of free EDTA^4- and the complex. 

Wait, no, the solution only contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial setup is that the total concentration of Ca from the complex is 0.02 M, and the same for EDTA, since it's a 1:1 complex. Wait, no, if the complex is 0.02 M, then the total Ca is 0.02 M (since each complex has one Ca) and the same for EDTA.

But wait, when the complex dissociates, it's into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the initial assumption was that x is the concentration of Ca²+ from the dissociation. So the setup is correct: K = (0.02)/(x²) =5e10 → x²= 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-12 / 5 → 2/(5) is 0.4 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 1e-6.5. Hmm, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 6.3e-7 is approximately sqrt(4e-13) * sqrt( (approx 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13, so sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5). Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7, which is about 6.32e-7 M. Oh wait, wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7 because 10^(-6.5) is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. 

Wait, that would make option C the answer, which is 6.3e-7 M. That's option C. Let's see, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck the calculation. 

So K = 5e10 = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since [CaEDTA] is 0.02, and assuming [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x, then 5e10 = 0.02/(x²). So x² = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7. Yes, that's correct. So the concentration of Ca²+ is 6.32e-7 M, which matches option C. 

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the formation constant is given as the inverse. Wait, no. Formation constant Kf is [Complex]/([M][L]). So if Kf is 5e10, then the formula I used is correct. So the answer should be C. Let me look at the options again. Option C is 6.3e-7, which is correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the equilibrium concentration of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \). Since the dissociation is small due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \), the concentration of the complex remains approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \) at equilibrium. The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \) and \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \), we get:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions is \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
