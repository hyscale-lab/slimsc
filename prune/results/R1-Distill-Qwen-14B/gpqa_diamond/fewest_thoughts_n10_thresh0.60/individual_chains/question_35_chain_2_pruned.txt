Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem says that the operator Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). Oh wait, that looks familiar. I think S must be the Pauli Y matrix or something similar.

Wait, Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall their forms. The Y Pauli matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh yes, so S is actually the Pauli Y matrix σy. Because that's exactly what S looks like here. So Ay = c * σy.

So c is h/(4π). But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin angular momentum operator is usually given by ħ times the Pauli matrices divided by 2, right? Because for spin-1/2 particles, S = (ħ/2) σ. So the eigenvalues of S would be ± ħ/2.

Wait, but here the operator Ay is c * S, with c = h/(4π). Let me compute c * S. So if S is σy, then Ay = (h/(4π)) σy.

Wait, but the actual spin operator is usually S = (ħ/2) σ. So maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. So if I can find the eigenvalues of S, then I can find the eigenvalues of Ay by multiplying by c.

Since S is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation. The trace of S is zero because the diagonal elements are zero. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = (i^2) = -1*(i^2= -1?), wait, wait. Let me compute the determinant of S.

The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] is ad - bc. So for S, a=0, d=0. bc is (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is 0
