Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about a star with certain properties and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. I remember that stars have things like their effective temperature, and when spots form, they can change the overall temperature we observe. Oh right, spots are cooler regions on the star's surface, so when a star has spots, its overall effective temperature decreases.

The star in question has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its Teff is 6000K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500K. Wait, but the spots themselves are cooler, right? So the star's average temperature is lower when the spots are present.

The main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes, so R_without_spots / R_with_spots.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in two energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy), E is the energy level, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

But wait, the problem says the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Let me think: the energy difference between the two levels can be found from the wavelength of the emitted photon. The energy E is related to wavelength by E = hc/λ. So maybe I can find the energy difference ΔE = hc/λ. Then, I can plug that into the Boltzmann factor to find how the ratio changes with temperature.

So first, calculate ΔE. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1
