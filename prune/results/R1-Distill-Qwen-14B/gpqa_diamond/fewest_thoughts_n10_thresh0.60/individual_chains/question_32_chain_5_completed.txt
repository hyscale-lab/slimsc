Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I remember RHIC collides heavy ions, right? The question is asking about the energy when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh wait, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think about what that means.

Li is lithium. Wait, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So this is a helium-6 nucleus? No, wait, no. Wait, Li is element 3, so Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number is 6, so the nucleus is a lithium-6 ion.

Wait, but in physics, when they talk about colliders, they often deal with ions as heavy as possible. So Li-6 is a nucleus that's being accelerated here.

The problem is to find the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. So speed v is 0.96 times the speed of light. I need to calculate the relativistic energy of this nucleus.

I remember that the relativistic energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can compute gamma first.

Let me calculate v first. v = 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c². Let's compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So the denominator inside the square root is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Hmm, 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857. Let me confirm that: 1 divided by 0.28. 0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857. So yes.

So gamma is 25/7 or approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass energy of the lithium-6 nucleus. Because the nucleus is X, which is Li-6, so it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of each proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for neutron, I think. Let me think: proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Wait, but in the nucleus, the mass is a bit less because of binding energy, but I think for this problem, we can assume that the rest mass is the sum of the individual nucleons.

Wait, but actually, the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But in the context of a physics problem like this, I think we are to use the rest mass of the nucleus as approximately the sum of the individual nucleons' rest masses. Let me see.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass is 3*(m_p) + 3*(m_n). Or wait, maybe the problem expects me to use the atomic mass of the nucleus. Hmm, but I don't have exact values. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a nucleon as about 1 GeV/c². Wait, 938 MeV is ~0.938 GeV. So each nucleon is about 0.938 GeV. So 6 nucleons would be 6 * 0.938 GeV ≈ 5.628 GeV. But wait, that's the rest mass, right? Because each nucleon contributes about 0.938 GeV.

Wait, but the actual rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is less than 6 * 0.938 GeV because of the binding energy. Let me get the exact mass.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of lithium-6. Oh wait, I can't look things up, but I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.017 g/mol, but wait, that's grams per mole. Hmm, maybe I can find the rest mass energy using the atomic mass.

Wait, I think the rest energy can be approximated using the mass of the nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides the mass of the nucleus as a known value. Wait, but the problem doesn't give any mass, so perhaps I'm supposed to use the mass of a nucleon as approximately 1 GeV/c² each.

Wait, let me think again. Let's see. The problem is about the energy of the nucleus, so perhaps the mass is the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. So for Li-6, 6 nucleons, each about 0.938 GeV. So rest mass energy is 6 * 0.938 GeV ≈ 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6 times the mass of a proton (since Li-6 is a charged nucleus, but I think that's not directly relevant). Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of protons and neutrons. Let me compute that.

Proton mass (m_p) is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², neutron (m_n) is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Total rest mass energy, m*c² = 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) MeV.

Calculating that:

3*(938.272) = 2814.816 MeV.

3*(939.565) = 2818.695 MeV.

Sum = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV.

Convert to GeV: 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is about 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, but that's the rest energy. Then the total energy is gamma times that.

So gamma is 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m c^2 = 3.57142857 * 5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute that.

First, 5.6335 * 3.57142857.

3 * 5.6335 = 16.9005.

0.57142857 *5.6335: Let me compute 0.5 *5.6335 is 2.81675, and 0.07142857*5.6335 ≈ 0.4047.

So 2.81675 + 0.4047 ≈ 3.22145.

Wait, wait, no, 0.57142857 is the same as 4/7. So 4/7 *5.6335 = ?

5.6335 * 4 = 22.534. Divided by 7: 22.534 /7 ≈3.21914.

So total is 16.9005 +3.21914 ≈20.1196 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20.1196 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. Hmm, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6335 more accurately.

Let's compute 5.6335 * 3.57142857.

To compute this, perhaps I can approach it more precisely.

5.6335 *3.57142857.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 is approximately 25/7.

So 5.6335 * (25/7) = (5.6335 *25)/7.

5.6335 *25 = 140.8375.

Divide by 7: 140.8375 /7 ≈20.11964286 GeV.

So that's about 20.1196 GeV.

But the options are: 

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So the closest one is C)20.132 GeV. But wait, my calculation gives about 20.1196 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV, but option C is 20.132.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma?

Wait, let me check gamma again. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). v=0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, 0.28^2=0.0784, so exactly, no problem. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So the calculation of gamma is correct.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is more precise than 5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute the rest mass more accurately.

Each proton: 938.272 MeV; each neutron: 939.565 MeV.

So 3 protons: 3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons:3 *939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV.

5633.511 MeV is 5.633511 GeV.

So that's precise.

So 5.633511 GeV multiplied by 3.57142857.

Hmm, let me compute that precisely.

Compute 5.633511 *3.57142857.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 is 25/7.

So 5.633511 *25 = 140.837775.

Divide by 7: 140.837775 /7 = 20.11968214 GeV.

So approximately 20.11968 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Wait, perhaps the nucleus has a binding energy that I should subtract. Because in reality, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy.

Wait, but in this problem, I'm not given the binding energy or the exact mass. So perhaps the intended approach is to treat the nucleus as a single particle with rest mass m. So maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses without considering binding energy.

Wait, but that would be a problem because the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.017 g/mol, which when converted to energy, would be approximately.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about how to find the rest mass energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the rest mass using the formula for kinetic energy, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, wait, another approach: since the speed is given as 0.96c, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic energy formula E = gamma m c², where m is the rest mass of the nucleus.

But I need the rest mass of the lithium-6 nucleus, which must be known or provided. Since it's not given, perhaps I'm to assume that the mass of X (Li-6) is 6 atomic mass units (u), but wait, no, that's not correct. Because the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017 u, but that's the mass of the entire atom, including electrons.

Ah, so the nucleus's mass is the atom's mass minus the electrons' mass. But that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon as approximately 1 GeV/c², so 6 GeV for the rest mass. Then, E = gamma * 6 GeV.

Wait, let me see. Gamma is 3.5714, so 3.5714 *6 GeV is about 21.428 GeV. That's close to option D (21.419), but it's a bit higher. But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach.

Wait, but earlier I calculated the rest mass as approximately 5.6335 GeV, and using that, I get about 20.12 GeV. So that brings me closer to option C.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as (number of nucleons) * (mass of a proton or neutron). Let me see.

Another way: maybe the problem considers the nucleus as a single particle with mass equal to the sum of the nucleons, but perhaps I should use the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me try to compute that.

The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.017 atomic mass units (u). One atomic mass unit is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is (6.017 u) * 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, but the atomic mass includes the electrons. Wait, no. The atomic mass is the mass of the atom, including electrons. So to get the nucleus mass, I need to subtract the electrons' mass.

Each Li atom has 3 electrons, each with mass about 0.00054858 u (since 1 u is about 1.66e-27 kg, and an electron is about 9.11e-31 kg, which is about 0.00054858 u).

So the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.017 u. So the mass of the nucleus is 6.017 u - 3*(0.00054858 u) = 6.017 - 0.00164574 = 6.01535426 u.

Then, the rest mass energy is 6.01535426 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Calculating that:

6.01535426 * 931.5 = let's compute this.

6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.01535426 *931.5 ≈0.01535426 *930 ≈14.26 MeV.

So total ≈5589 +14.26 ≈5603.26 MeV, which is 5.60326 GeV.

So m c² is approximately 5.60326 GeV.

Now, compute gamma * m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.60326 GeV.

Calculating that:

3 *5.60326 = 16.80978 GeV.

0.57142857 *5.60326 ≈ let's compute 5.60326 *0.57142857.

0.5 *5.60326=2.80163.

0.07142857*5.60326≈0.4026.

So total ≈2.80163 +0.4026≈3.20423 GeV.

Adding to 16.80978: 16.80978 +3.20423≈20.014 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.014 GeV. Hmm, but that's lower than the earlier calculation.

Wait, I must have made a miscalculation because the exact values are a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to stick with the initial calculation using the sum of protons and neutrons' masses without considering binding energy, leading to 5.6335 GeV, which when multiplied by 3.5714 gives about 20.12 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the proton (since Li is a light nucleus) as approximately 1 GeV, but that would be a rough approximation. Let's see: 6 *1 GeV is 6 GeV. Gamma of 3.5714, so E=21.428 GeV, which is close to option D (21.419 GeV). But that's a big discrepancy.

Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the calculations. Let me compute E using the exact gamma and exact m.

Wait, in my initial calculation, I took m as the sum of proton and neutron masses, which gave m=5.6335 GeV, leading to E≈20.1196 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV. Option C is 20.132, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is accurately 5.60326 GeV as computed from the atomic mass, which gives E≈20.014 GeV, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So 20.12 is closest to option C.

Wait, perhaps to be more precise, let's compute 3.57142857 *5.60326 GeV.

Let me compute 5.60326 *3.57142857.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 = 3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857.

So 5.60326 *3 = 16.80978.

5.60326 *0.5 =2.80163.

5.60326 *0.07142857 ≈5.60326 * (1/14) ≈0.400233.

Adding them up: 16.80978 +2.80163 =19.61141 +0.400233≈20.0116 GeV.

That's about 20.012 GeV.

But none of the options match that. The closest option is C) 20.132. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rest mass using the atomic mass. Let me think again.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017 u. The number of electrons is 3, each about 0.00054858 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.017 - 3 *0.00054858 ≈6.017 -0.00164574=6.01535426 u.

Now, 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c², so the nucleus mass energy is 6.01535426 *931.5 MeV.

Compute that: 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01535426 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00535426 *931.5 ≈5. (Wait, 0.005 is 4.6575, 0.00035426 is 0.328. So total ≈4.6575+0.328≈4.9855 MeV.)

So 9.315 +4.9855≈14.3005 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.3005=5603.3005 MeV =5.6033005 GeV.

So now, E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.6033 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6033.

3 *5.6033 =16.8099.

0.57142857 *5.6033 ≈0.5 *5.6033 =2.80165, 0.07142857 *5.6033 ≈0.400.

So 2.80165 +0.400 =3.20165.

Adding to 16.8099: 16.8099 +3.20165 =20.01155 GeV.

So that's about 20.0116 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the protons and neutrons without considering binding energy, which gives a higher rest mass, leading to a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the proton's mass as 0.938 GeV and the neutron as 0.939 GeV, summing for 3 each, giving:

3 *0.938 (protons) +3 *0.939 (neutrons) = 2.814 + 2.817 =5.631 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.631 = ?

3 *5.631 =16.893.

0.57142857 *5.631 ≈3.207 (since 5.631 * 0.5 is 2.8155, and 0.07142857 *5.631≈0.403, sum 3.2185).

So 16.893 +3.2185 ≈20.1115 GeV.

Which is about 20.1115 GeV, which matches option C (20.132 GeV) approximately, but not exactly. However, perhaps the calculation is a bit more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact gamma value without rounding and precise m.

Let me compute gamma as 25/7 exactly (3.571428571428571...).

So 3.571428571428571... *5.6033 GeV.

Let me compute it exactly.

5.6033 * (25/7) = (5.6033 *25)/7.

5.6033 *25 = 140.0825.

140.0825 /7 =20.0117857 GeV.

So approximately 20.0118 GeV.

But the option closest is C, which is 20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the rest mass.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a single particle with mass number A=6, but using the mass of the deuteron or something else. Or perhaps the problem expects me to find the kinetic energy, not total energy.

Wait, no, the question says the energy of the collider, which is the total energy, so relativistic energy including rest mass.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the options again. Let me see:

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So option C is 20.132, which is close to my initial calculation of 20.1196 GeV using the sum of the nucleons' masses. Perhaps the precise calculation would lead to 20.132 GeV when considering more precise values.

Wait, let me compute 5.6335 GeV *3.57142857 precisely.

5.6335 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.6335 *25/7.

5.6335 *25 =140.8375.

140.8375 /7 =20.11964286 GeV.

So about 20.1196 GeV.

Which is 20.12 GeV, but option C is 20.132. The difference is about 0.012 GeV, which is 12 MeV. That's small, but perhaps due to more precise values of the mass.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is more accurately 5.60326 GeV, but when the problem uses a different approach, maybe using the mass as 6 * 0.938 GeV =5.628 GeV.

So 5.628 *3.57142857 = ?

5.628 *3.57142857.

Compute 5.628 * (25/7) = (5.628 *25) /7.

5.628 *25 =140.7.

140.7 /7 =20.1 GeV.

Wait, that's 20.1 GeV. But the option is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the problem is using more precise values for the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of 3.57142857 (gamma) and the exact rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should take the rest mass as 5.633 GeV and compute E =3.57142857 *5.633.

3.57142857 *5.633.

Let me compute it as 5.633 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.633 *3 =16.899.

5.633 *0.57142857 = ?

0.5 *5.633 =2.8165.

0.07142857 *5.633 ≈0.4033.

So sum is 2.8165 +0.4033 =3.2198.

Total E=16.899 +3.2198 =20.1188 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.119 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.013 GeV higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as 6 * (938 MeV) =5628 MeV =5.628 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Compute that:

5.628 *3.57142857.

Break it down:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.628 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857 ≈2.142857.

0.028 *3.57142857 ≈0.100.

So sum 2.142857 +0.100=2.242857.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.242857 ≈20.100 GeV.

Hmm, about 20.100 GeV.

But again, the option is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the actual mass is 5.6033 GeV, and the exact calculation gives 20.0116 GeV, but none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma again. v=0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1- (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Since all my calculations point to around 20.12 GeV, which is very close to option C, I think the correct answer is C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 (Li-6) nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \), we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( m c^2 \) is the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \) as follows:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate rest masses of a proton (\( m_p \approx 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)) and a neutron (\( m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)), the total rest mass energy is:
\[
m c^2 = 3 m_p + 3 m_n = 3(938.272) + 3(939.565) = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total relativistic energy is given by:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]
Breaking this down:
\[
3.5714 \times 5.633511 \approx 20.1196 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.1196 \, \text{GeV} \), which is very close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps or the use of slightly more precise constants.

### Conclusion
The energy of the RHIC, when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is \( 0.96c \), is approximately \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \).
