Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I remember a bit from my solid state physics class. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let me think.

Alright, let's start by recalling what a rhombohedral crystal structure is. I think it's a type of hexagonal crystal system, but wait, no, wait. No, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system, right? Wait, no, wait again. No, rhombohedral is a separate crystal system where all edges are equal and all angles are equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a cube that's been skewed. So all the a, b, c lattice parameters are equal, but the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all the same but not 90 degrees. So in this problem, they've given the angles as 30 degrees each.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait. Is the interatomic distance the same as the lattice parameter a? Because in a crystal, the interatomic distance could vary depending on the structure. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is equal to 'a'. But in a rhombohedral structure, maybe the interatomic distance refers to the edge length 'a' of the rhombohedron? I think that's the case here because the problem states it's a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Angstrom. So I'll take a = 10 Angstrom.

Now, the question is about calculating the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * [1 + 2*cos(alpha)*(cos(beta) - 1) + ... ] Wait, no, that seems complicated. Oh, right, maybe I should use the formula specific for a rhombohedral system.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a² (hk cos gamma + hk cos beta + kl cos alpha )) / (h² + k² + l²) ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, no,
