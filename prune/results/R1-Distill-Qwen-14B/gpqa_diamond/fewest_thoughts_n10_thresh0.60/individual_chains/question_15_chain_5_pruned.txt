Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, transiting probability. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and their orbital configuration.

Wait, the planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star. Oh wait, but the host stars have different masses. Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but their radii are the same. Interesting.

I think the transit probability formula is something like (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by some factor related to the orbital distance. Or wait, no, I'm mixing things up. The formula for the probability that a planet will transit its star is approximately (R_p / a) * (sqrt(1 - e²)) / (1 + (M_p / M_s)), but since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity term (e) is zero. So it simplifies.

Wait, wait, no. The transit probability is actually given by the formula: (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by ( (a / R_star) )^(-1/2) ). Or is that not right? Or am I thinking about the occurrence rate?

Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1/a), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, that's not exactly it. Or maybe
