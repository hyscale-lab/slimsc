Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So, the probability of finding a particle outside this range is zero.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability density is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function. The integral of the probability density over all space should equal 1 because the total probability is 1.

Wait, but in this case, the wave function is given, and the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. That suggests that the wave function is zero outside this region. But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Oh, but maybe that's only the part where it's non-zero, and zero elsewhere? Because the problem states that none were found outside 1 and 3, so the wave function must be zero beyond that. So the wave function is defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere? Or perhaps the wave function is given only for this region, and zero outside.

Wait, the question says that the wave function in a part of space where it can exist is that expression. So, that is the expression for the region where the particle exists, which is between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function is zero outside that interval.

So, the wave function is:

ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3,

and ψ(x) = 0 otherwise.

Now, to find the value of a, I need to normalize the wave function. Normalization requires that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 equals 1.

So, |ψ(x)|² would be [a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i]^2? Wait, no. Wait, ψ(x) is a complex function. The absolute square is ψ*(x) *
