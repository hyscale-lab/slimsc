Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let's see what the question says.

The problem says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, forming complexes with metal ions like Ca^2+. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how strong the complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable, so the metal ion is more tightly bound.

Wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions. So, the solution has the Ca-EDTA complex, which is a 1:1 ratio, I think. So the formula would be something like CaY^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4-.

The formation constant Kf is given by the equation:

Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M.

But I also need to consider the dissociation of the complex. Since Kf is very large (5x10^10), the complex is stable, and the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions should be very low.

Wait, EDTA can exist in different protonated forms depending on the pH. The problem says the pH is ideal, so maybe all EDTA is in the Y^4- form. Or perhaps the solution is buffered such that the dominant species is Y^4-.

But wait, in the presence of the Ca-EDTA complex, the EDTA is mostly tied up in the complex. So the free EDTA^4- would be very low.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, but the Kf is so large, the dissociation is minimal.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me set up the equation again.

The complex is [CaY]^2-.

The dissociation is:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca
