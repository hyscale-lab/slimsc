Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is that the distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So if a star has a parallax plx, then distance d ≈ 1/plx parsecs.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So they want to know how the number of stars (n) changes with the parallax (plx). The options are various inverse powers of plx.

I think this relates to how the number of stars depends on the volume of space they occupy. Because stars are uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume available up to that distance. So more distant stars would have smaller parallax values.

So the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. Since r is 1/plx, the volume would be proportional to (1/plx)^3. Oh wait, but wait—each unit of parallax corresponds to a thin shell of stars at that distance. So the volume of a shell between plx and plx + dplx would be the surface area of the sphere (4πr²) multiplied by the thickness (dr). Since dr is the change in radius, which is -dplx (because as plx decreases, distance increases). Or wait, no, let me think about the differential.

Let me do this step by step. The distance d is 1/plx
