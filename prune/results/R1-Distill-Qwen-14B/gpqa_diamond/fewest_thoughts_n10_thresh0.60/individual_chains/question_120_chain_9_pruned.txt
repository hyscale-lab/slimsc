Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down. I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star, right? Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer the star, the larger the parallax. Oh wait, wait, no, actually, the closer the star, the larger the parallax because the angle is bigger when you're closer. Like how your thumb moves more against the background when you hold it close to your face.

So the formula for distance in terms of parallax is something like distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So plx = 1/d. Wait, no, the formula is d = 1/plx. Right, because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec away, which is about 3.26 light-years.

Now the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we're looking for how the number of stars N depends on plx. The options are all 1 over plx raised to some power: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Wait, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed. But in the real universe, stars aren't uniformly distributed because the density of stars increases with distance, but I guess this is a hypothetical scenario where they are uniformly distributed in space.

Wait, but if they're uniformly distributed in space, then the number density of stars is constant. So the number of stars in a region depends on the volume of that region. But how does this relate to parallax?

Parallax is a measure of distance. So, higher parallax means closer stars. So, given that, if we have a parallax range, like from plx to plx + dplx, what is the number of stars in that range?

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the distribution. For a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a volume element dV would be n * dV, where n is the number density (stars per cubic parsec, say). So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with
