Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition reaction. Let me take them one by one.

Starting with part (A): dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Dimethyl malonate is a diester, right? It's a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The enolate acts as a nucleophile. The other compound, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So, the Michael donor would be the enolate from dimethyl malonate, and the Michael acceptor is the acrylate.

Wait, wait. When the enolate attacks, it should add to the beta carbon of the acceptor. So the acrylate has the structure CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, but wait, actually, the structure is more like CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, no? But the substituents... Oh, wait, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should draw it out.

So, the acrylate is something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. The formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the acrylate chain. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)COOCH3. So when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks, it would add to the beta position, which is the CH2 part next to the double bond.

So the reaction would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate. The product would be an addition product where the two molecules are connected.

Looking at the options, for A, the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Hmm. Let me think. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When it adds to the acrylate, the enolate (from the malonate) would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the structure would be like CH2(CO2Me)2 adding to CH2-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. Wait, maybe I should write it more clearly.

The acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. The enolate from dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)CO
