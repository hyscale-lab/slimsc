Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and major products for each, then match them with the given options.

First, I remember that the Michael addition is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, which is conjugated to the carbonyl, leading to a resonance-stabilized enolate intermediate.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

**Part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) â†’ A**

So, the reactants here are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The conditions are NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol), which is a base. This likely deprotonates the alpha position of the malonate to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO2)2CH. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. When deprotonated, the enolate would have a negative charge at the alpha carbon (the CH part). The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which has the structure CH2=CHCO2Me, but with the substituents arranged in the E configuration. The E-configuration affects the geometry but since the Michael addition is about conjugate addition, I think the geometry might not change the outcome here.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate here). So the attack would be on the CH2 part of the acrylate.

Wait, wait. Let me structure this. The acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CO2Me? Wait no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So in (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group is attached to carbon 3. So it's CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. So the double bond is CH2-CH with the substituents on the third carbon.

Wait, maybe I should draw it:

Structure: CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl
