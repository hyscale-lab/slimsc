Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants are for the complexes, right? So each β corresponds to a different complex.

I remember that the stability constant, β, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. For Co with SCN-, the complexes would form stepwise. Let me think, the general form is Co(SCN)_n. So the first complex is CoSCN^2+, β1 is 9, then the second is [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-), β2 is 40, but wait no, the βs are cumulative? Or are they stepwise?

Wait, stability constants can be either stepwise or overall. Oh right, stepwise β is the constant for adding one more ligand. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would be the product of the stepwise βs up to n.

So the complexes possible here are Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, and Co(SCN)_4. Each with different βs. Wait, β1=9 is for the first, β2=40 is stepwise for the second, so the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) would be β1 * β2 = 9 *40 =360? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. No, the stability constant for the first complex is β1, the second is β2, which is the stepwise. So the overall β for the second complex would be β1 * β2, which is 9*40=360. Similarly for the third, it would be β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=25200. And the fourth would be β1*β2*β3*β4= 25200*16=403200. Wait, but wait, the β4 is 16. So the stepwise for the fourth is 16, so the overall for the fourth complex is 9*40*63*16.

But wait, the problem gives the βs as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each step adds another SCN. So the total number of complexes is four, each with n=1,2,3,4.

Wait, but what about the species in solution? The problem is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-). So that's the n=2 case.

Wait, but
