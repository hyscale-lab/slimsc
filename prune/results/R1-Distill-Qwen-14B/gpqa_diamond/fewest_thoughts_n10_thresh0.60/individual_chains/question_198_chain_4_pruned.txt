Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) indicate the stability of a complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The complexes are formed stepwise, right? So the first complex is [Co(SCN)]⁺, then the second is [Co(SCN)₂]³⁺, and so on up to the fourth complex.

So the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think blue refers to the [Co(SCN)₂]³⁺ complex. Because I remember that different Co complexes have different colors. The blue one is the dithiocyanato, which is the second complex. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the first complex is mono, the second is di, so the second complex is [Co(SCN)₂]³⁺. So the percentage they're asking for is the fraction of that second complex compared to all possible cobalt species.

But wait, the
