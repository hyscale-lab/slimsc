Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied. So P acting on the eigenvector gives (ħ/2) times the eigenvector.

The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So the overall operator P is a vector in the direction n, which is in the x-z plane. That probably means that the direction is some angle θ from the x-axis and φ from the z-axis, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π, maybe? Wait, the problem says "arbitrary direction," but it's in the x-z plane. So θ would be the polar angle, and φ would be zero because it's in the x-z plane. Or wait, is φ the azimuthal angle? Yes, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle from the x-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ is 0, right? So the operator can be written as P = P_x * something + P_z * something else.

Wait, actually, the operator in the direction n would be the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices times ħ/2. Because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ · n, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So in this case, the operator is similar, but it's P instead of S. So P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), maybe? Because in spherical coordinates, the direction in the x-z plane would have θ as the angle from the z-axis
