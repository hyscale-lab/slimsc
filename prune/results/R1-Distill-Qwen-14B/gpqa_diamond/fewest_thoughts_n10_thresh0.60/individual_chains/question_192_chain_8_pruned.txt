Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity is off-center—so the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity has radius r which is smaller than R, so it's entirely within the conductor.

Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, which makes sense since P is outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, any charges placed inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. Oh right, the charges inside the cavity (the +q) will induce a -q on the inner surface of the conductor, and since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface will have a +q.

Wait, but how does that affect the electric field outside the conductor? I think that the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the charges on the outer surface. Because the charges on the inner surface are shielded by the conductor's material. So the field outside is as if all the charge were at the center, but wait, only the outer charges contribute.

So at point P, which is outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if the charge were a point charge at the center of the conductor. Because the conductor's induced charges arrange themselves in such a way that their fields cancel inside the conductor, and outside, it behaves as a point charge.

But wait, the charge inside the cavity is +q, so the outer surface has +q, right? So the total charge outside is +q. So the electric field outside should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / (L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but the options don't all look like that. Let me check the options again. Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²),
