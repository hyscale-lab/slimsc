Okay, so I've got this question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly as expected, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and similar integrals, adding up to 1H. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So, why would there be two peaks for the same proton?

Wait, so if it's the same alpha-proton, maybe it's not a coupling issue. Because coupling would usually split a peak into multiple, but here they're separate. Oh, but the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling as the cause. So maybe it's something else.

Then there's the LC-MS part. The crude compound at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. So the masses are the same, meaning same molecular weight, so same molecular formula. But why two peaks?

Hmm, possible scenarios: if the compound has some kind of stereochemistry, maybe diastereomers or enantiomers. If it's a racemic mixture, the enantiomers would have same mass but in LC, they might come out as two peaks if the column isn't chiral. Oh, but wait, the question says LC-MS at elevated temperature. Wait, sometimes if the mobile phase is heated, maybe the separation is better? Or maybe the retention times change but the identity remains.
