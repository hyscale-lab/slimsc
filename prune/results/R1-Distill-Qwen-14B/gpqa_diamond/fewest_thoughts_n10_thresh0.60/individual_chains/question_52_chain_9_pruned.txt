Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem, and I need to figure out the factor by which the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the star has some parameters: 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh wait, wait. I think I need to clarify: when spots are present, the star's overall effective temperature decreases. But how does that affect the photosphere?

The problem mentions the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, the ratio is lower than when it's not. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes, so it's (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots).

I remember that in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Since the problem says the transition corresponds to a wavelength of ~1448 Å, which is in the near UV maybe? Let me think about the energy involved. The energy difference between the levels is E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 m). Let me compute that: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divide by 1.448e-7 m (since 1448 Å is 1.448e-7 meters). So 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

To get this in terms of eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV. Hmm, that's a pretty high energy. So the transition is between levels where E2 - E1 = 8.56 eV. Wait, that seems high for Ti. Maybe I miscalculated somewhere, but let's move on.

Wait, wait, maybe I should double-check the wavelength. 1448 Å is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448 * 1e-10 meters, so 1.448e-7 meters.

So
