Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on the spectral data provided. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me information from three different characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I'll need to analyze each piece of data to narrow down the possibilities.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The broad absorption around 3000 cm-1 suggests the presence of O-H groups, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the question also mentions two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Those are in the regions for carbonyl groups. 1700 is typically a strong peak for a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester or maybe an aldehyde. The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl, but maybe a conjugated one, like an ester or perhaps a conjugated ketone? Or wait, 1650 might also be an aromatic ring with conjugation, but I think more likely it's another carbonyl. Wait, another possibility: maybe the 1650 is from an amide or maybe an aromatic ring with C=C stretching. Hmm, but the problem says two strong peaks, so perhaps two different carbonyl groups. Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else.

Wait, let me think. The broad peak at 3000 is likely O-H. So if there are O-H groups, maybe it's an alcohol. But if there's a carbonyl at 1700, which is a strong peak, perhaps it's an ester or a ketone. Wait, but if the compound has both O-H and a carbonyl, maybe it's an acid or an ester with an alcohol group, but more likely an ester since esters have two carbonyls (but wait, no, esters have one carbonyl. Wait, no, esters have one carbonyl group. Hmm, but why two peaks at 1700 and 1650? Maybe one is an ester and the other is something
