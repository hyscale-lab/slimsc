Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me take it step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. The compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups because of the hydrogen bonding. So that's probably an alcohol or a carboxylic acid, or maybe an ester or something with an -OH.

Then it says there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, but given it's a strong peak, maybe another carbonyl group like a ketone or ester.

Wait, but two carbonyls? That's a bit tricky. Or maybe one is another functional group. Let me think. 1700 is often carbonyl, like ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. 1650 could be conjugated carbonyl, like maybe an acid derivative or an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, but that would be around 1600, perhaps.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl Hs are the ones on a double bond, like CH2=CH-. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, likely an alkene. So the structure has both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

The Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about what gives that. Well, 45 is often a CH3 group attached to something. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since 2*1 + 16 + 12 = 45?) Wait, no. Let me calculate: CH3O- would be 31, but wait, wait. Alternatively, m/z 45 could be a fragment like from an ester group. Hmm. Alternatively, think of common fragments. For example, (CH2CH3)O- would be 45 (CH2CH3 is 30, plus O is 16: 46. Oh wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone or an ester group. Or perhaps it's a CH2CO fragment.

Wait, another approach: 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's m/z 91. No. Alternatively, the fragment could be (CH3)2CO, which is 58? Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly. Let me think about the molecular formula options.

The options are:
A
