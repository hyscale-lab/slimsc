Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. So, the first thing I remember is that luminosity relates to how much light a star emits. I think the formula for luminosity of a star as a black body is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. So L depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

The problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, mass might not directly relate to luminosity here unless we're considering something like the mass-luminosity relation, but I think that's more for when you can't measure other properties. In this problem, they're giving us the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest, which are the same. Oh, that's important.

So the stars' peak emission wavelengths are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. Wait, but how is that possible? Because if their temperatures are the same, but their radii are different, their luminosities would differ based on radius squared.

Wait, let me get this straight. The problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, meaning λ_max is the same for both. So, using Wien's law, T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature. Interesting.

But wait a minute, Star_1 has a larger radius. So according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴, and L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴. Since R1 is 1.5 R2 and T1 = T2, then L1 = ( (1.5)^2 ) * L2. Because R1 squared is (1.5 R2)^2 = 2.25 R2². So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor would be 2.25. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25.

Wait, but the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Does that affect the observed wavelength? Hmm, because if a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. But wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the rest wavelengths are the same, but their velocities cause a shift. But I'm not sure how that plays into this.

Wait, no. Because the peak emission wavelengths are determined in the rest frame of the star. The observed wavelengths would be different if the star is moving. But the problem states that the determined wavelengths (I assume observed) are the same. So maybe we have to consider the Doppler effect.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. So, the peak wavelengths observed are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. But each star's actual λ_max (in their rest frame) could be different due to their velocities.

So star 1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed λ_max is the same as its rest frame λ_max. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Hmm, does that affect the calculation of its temperature?

Because when a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, and moving away, it's longer. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be λ2_observed = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), considering relativistic effects. But wait, 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me check what the speed of light is. It's about 3x10^5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.00233c, which is small but non-negligible. So relativistic Doppler shift might apply.

Wait, but the problem says the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So λ1_observed = λ2_observed. But since Star_1 has zero velocity, λ1_observed = λ1_rest. For Star_2, λ2_observed = λ2_rest * Doppler factor. So, setting them equal:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

But λ is proportional to 1/T. So λ1_rest = b / T1, and λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * Doppler factor.

So, 1/T1 = (1/T2) * Doppler factor.

Doppler factor depends on velocity. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But wait, radial velocity v is 700 km/s. Since Star_2 is moving (I think the velocity is radial, but the problem doesn't specify direction). Let me assume it's moving away from us. So v is positive.

So the Doppler factor would be sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), but wait, if it's moving away, then v is positive, and the observed wavelength is longer. So Doppler factor is greater than 1.

But let's compute that. v = 700 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s. So v/c = 700/3e5 = 0.002333...

So,

sqrt( (1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333) ) ≈ sqrt( (1.002333)/(0.997667) ) 

Let me compute that numerically. 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.00468. The square root of that is approximately 1.00234.

So Doppler factor is about 1.00234. So λ_observed for Star 2 is λ2_rest * 1.00234.

But from earlier, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler factor. So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 1.00234.

But since λ1_rest = b / T1 and λ2_rest = b / T2, this gives:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * 1.00234 → 1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.00234 → T1 = T2 / 1.00234.

So T1 is slightly less than T2. Wait, but earlier I thought T1 = T2 because the observed λ_max were the same. But maybe I was wrong.

Wait, no. Let me re-express.

The observed λ_max for Star_1 is λ1_rest because v1=0.

The observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

These observed λ_max are the same, so:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

But λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * Doppler → T1 = T2 / Doppler.

So, T1 = T2 / 1.00234 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So T1 is slightly less than T2. So the temperature of Star_1 is a bit lower than Star_2.

Hmm, that complicates things because earlier I assumed T1 = T2. So that assumption was incorrect.

So the initial approach might have been wrong because I didn't account for the Doppler shift affecting the observed temperatures, hence the actual temperatures are different.

So now, we have to find the luminosity ratio considering that T1 is slightly less than T2.

But wait, the problem states that the stars' observed wavelengths at their brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max for both is the same, which implies that their rest λ_max are adjusted by their velocities.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me re-express.

For Star_1: observed λ_max1 = λ_max1 (v1=0, so same as rest frame).

For Star_2: observed λ_max2 = λ_max2 * Doppler factor.

Given that observed λ_max1 = observed λ_max2, so λ_max1 = λ_max2 * Doppler factor.

But λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So,

λ_max1 = b / T1,

λ_max2 = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * Doppler factor.

So,

T1 = T2 / Doppler factor.

So,

T1 = T2 * (1 / Doppler factor).

So, since Doppler factor is about 1.00234, T1 is about 0.99767 * T2.

So, T1 is about 99.767% of T2.

So, the temperature of Star_1 is slightly lower than Star_2.

Okay, so now, let's compute the luminosity.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴,

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

So, the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

We have R1 = 1.5 R2,

T1 = T2 * (1 / Doppler factor) → T1 = T2 / 1.00234.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * (T2/1.00234)^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

Simplify:

= ( (2.25 R2²) * (T2^4 / (1.00234)^4 ) ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (1 / (1.00234)^4 )

Compute (1.00234)^4. Let me approximate this.

We can use the binomial approximation for small x:

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2)x² + ...

Here, x = 0.00234, n=4.

So,

(1.00234)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.00234) + 6*(0.00234)^2 + 4*(0.00234)^3 + (0.00234)^4.

Let me compute each term:

4 * 0.00234 = 0.00936,

6*(0.00234)^2 = 6*(5.4756e-6) ≈ 3.285e-5,

4*(0.00234)^3 ≈ 4*(1.26e-8) ≈ 5.04e-8,

(0.00234)^4 ≈ 2.95e-11.

Adding them up:

0.00936 + 0.00003285 ≈ 0.00939285,

plus 5.04e-8 is about 0.00939285 + 0.0000000504 ≈ 0.0093929,

plus the last term is negligible.

So,

(1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.0093929.

Wait, but wait: the first term is 1, then adding 0.00936, etc. So actually, 1 + 0.00936 = 1.00936, plus 0.00003285 gives 1.00939285.

So,

(1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.00939285.

So, 1/(1.00234)^4 ≈ 1 / 1.00939285 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ (2.25) * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which would be approximately 2.23.

So the factor is approximately 2.23.

Wait, but let me check if I did the calculation correctly. Because 2.25 * 0.9907 is:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275; 2.25 * 0.0007 ≈ 0.001575. So total ≈ 2.229. So approximately 2.23.

So the correct answer would be option D) ~2.23.

Wait, but why did we even consider the Doppler shift? Because the observed λ_max is same, leading to T1 and T2 being different. Without considering the Doppler shift, we would have thought T1 = T2, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25, which is option A. But the Doppler effect reduces the luminosity ratio because Star_1 is actually slightly cooler than Star_2.

So the correct answer is option D, ~2.23.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius Ratio**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
2. **Observed Wavelengths**: The stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{observed,1}} = \lambda_{\text{observed,2}} \)).
3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), and Star_2 has \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).

### Step 1: Temperature Ratio
The peak wavelength of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)). Using Wien's law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1, since \( v_1 = 0 \), the observed wavelength is the same as the rest wavelength: \( \lambda_{\text{observed,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,1}} \).

For Star_2, the observed wavelength is affected by the relativistic Doppler shift:

\[
\lambda_{\text{observed,2}} = \lambda_{\text{max,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Given \( \lambda_{\text{observed,1}} = \lambda_{\text{observed,2}} \), we equate the rest wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

\[
T_1 = T_2 \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
\]

For \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), \( v_2/c = 0.002333 \). Approximating the Doppler factor:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}} \approx 1.00234
\]

\[
T_1 = T_2 \cdot \frac{1}{1.00234} \approx 0.99767 \, T_2
\]

Thus, \( T_1 \approx 0.99767 \, T_2 \).

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_1 = 0.99767 \, T_2 \):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 (0.99767 \, T_2)^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 1.5^2 \cdot (0.99767)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot (0.9907)
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.23
\]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2. The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
