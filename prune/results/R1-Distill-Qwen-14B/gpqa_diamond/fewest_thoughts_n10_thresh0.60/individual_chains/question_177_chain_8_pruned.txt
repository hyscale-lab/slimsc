Okay, let's try to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, so the question is about luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that luminosity depends on both the radius and the temperature of a star. Oh right, the formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But maybe I don't need to worry about the exact formula since the problem says to assume they're black bodies.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! That's the peak wavelength, which relates to the star's temperature via Wien's Law. Wien's Law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

Oh wait, no, wait! Wait, if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature. Got it.

Now, the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. And the mass is also 1.5 times larger. But since luminosity here depends only on radius and temperature, the mass might not matter here? Or is it a red herring? Maybe the mass is just extra info.

We also have radial velocities of 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh wait, but the peak wavelengths are the same as determined through spectroscopy. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, but their rest wavelengths would differ because of their velocities?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem says that through spectroscopy, the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. But their actual rest λ_max would be different due to their velocities.

Right, because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength shifts. So the star with a higher radial velocity (Star_2, 700 km/s) would have a Doppler shift. But the problem states that their observed λ_max is the same.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. For example, if both have the same observed λ_max, but their actual temperatures might be different because of their velocities. So we might need to calculate their actual temperatures using the Doppler shift formula.

Doppler shift formula: λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when v is the velocity along the line of sight. Wait, but I think for small velocities (v much less than c), the approximation λ_obs ~ λ_rest (1 + v/c) is used. Oh, but if the velocities are significant, like 700 km/s is a decent fraction of the speed of light. Let me check: c is about 3e5 km/s. 700 is about 0.0023 of that, so maybe the approximation holds, but perhaps it's better to use the exact formula.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed λ
