Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, I remember that luminosity depends on radius and temperature for stars. Oh right, the formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 

The problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. And their masses are also 1.5 times larger for Star_1. Wait, but mass doesn't directly factor into luminosity unless we're considering other aspects like spectral class, but the question says they radiate as black bodies, so maybe we don't need to worry about mass directly here. 

The key data points are the wavelengths where the stars are brightest. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation, right? I remember Wien's Law, which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same because the λ_max is the same. Because λ1 = λ2, so T1 = T2.

Wait wait, no. Wait, no, because b is a constant. So λ_max1 = λ_max2 implies T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point. 

So, both stars have the same temperature. Then, the luminosity depends on R squared times T to the fourth.
