Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The gas W's molecules have the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially because of its analogs.

Hmm, let me break this down. Let's start with gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Well, protons and neutrons are in the nucleus, so the molecule must be made of atoms where each has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Wait, but each molecule might consist of atoms with the same number. Alternatively, perhaps each molecule of W is a single atom, but I'm not sure.

Wait, gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in each atom? Or that the molecule as a whole has the same number? Hmm, probably each molecule is a single atom because it's a gas, maybe something like H2, but wait, H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons? No, hydrogen has one proton and one neutron in deuterium, but H2 gas is H2, each H is H-1, so each has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Wait, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility. If the molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible molecules. For example, CO2 has 22 protons (C:6, each O:8, 6+8*2=22) and how many neutrons? Let me see, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, maybe W is CO2? No, because CO2 has a molecule of C and two O's. But wait, the number of protons would be 6 + 8*2 = 22. The number of neutrons would be (neutrons in C) + 2*(neutrons in O). But without knowing isotopes, maybe each atom has same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, perhaps each atom in W has equal protons
