Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Finally, we need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. 

Hmm, let me break it down. First, I think I should figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B are. 

The reaction is violent, so it might be something that reacts exothermically, maybe like a strong acid reacting with a metal? Or perhaps a carbonate reacting with an acid. Wait, but the product is a precipitate, so maybe Y is a solution and X is a salt that forms a precipitate when it reacts. 

The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That sounds like H2O, but wait, H2O has 2 H (each with 1p and 0n) and one O (8p and 8n). So total protons: 2+8=10, neutrons: 0+8=8. Oh, no, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe a different gas. Another possibility is NH3. Let's see: NH3 has 1 N (7p, 7n) and 3 H (1p each, 0n). Protons total: 7 + 3*1 = 10. Neutrons: 7. So 10 and 7 don't match. Hmm, not right. 

Wait, what about CO2? CO2 has 1 C (6p,6n) and 2 O (8p each, 8n each). Protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons:6 +2*8=22. Oh! So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That
