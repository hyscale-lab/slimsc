Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a large number of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. I know that in quantum mechanics, the wave function is crucial because it describes the state of the particle. The square of the absolute value of the wave function gives the probability density of finding the particle at a particular position.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait a second. So that's a complex function, right? Because of the 'i' which is the square root of -1. The general form of a wave function is usually a complex number, so that makes sense.

The question says that when they measured the positions of these particles, none were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. That means the probability of finding a particle at x <1 or x>3 is zero. So the wave function must be zero outside of that interval. But the wave function given here is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) -0.5i. Wait, so does that mean that this is the wave function only within x=1 to x=3, or is it defined elsewhere too?

Wait, the problem states that this wave function applies to a part of space where the particle can exist. So, the particle
