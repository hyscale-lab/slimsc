Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I probably don't need to worry about that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay, so this sounds like a problem involving electric potential energy. Because when charges are placed in an electric field, they have potential energy, and when you have multiple charges, their mutual interactions contribute to the total energy.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy. So I think this refers to the potential energy of the system. Since potential energy is involved, I'll need to calculate the work done when bringing each charge to their positions.

Let me think. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of these 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the central charge.

So the system consists of a fixed charge at P, and 12 other charges each located 2 meters from P. But wait, are the 12 charges all at point P? No, wait, the 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge.

Wait, but wait. Is the system isolated? So the charges can't move except as per their constraints. So I guess the potential energy comes from each of the 12 charges interacting with the fixed charge.

Wait, but also, each of the 12 charges might be interacting with each other. Because they are all 2 meters away from P, but how are they arranged relative to each other? Are they all at the same point? No, that can't be. Because if 12 identical charges are at the same point, that would cause a huge repulsion and perhaps a lot of potential energy. But the way the problem is phrased, it says 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps they are located on a sphere of radius 2 m around P, but their exact positions relative to
