Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem about electric potential energy. Hmm. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. They say the system is isolated, which probably means energy can't leave or enter, but I think that's just context for the problem.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. So these 12 are fixed on a sphere of radius 2m around P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the setup is like a central charge with 12 others arranged symmetrically around it.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. I'm guessing this refers to the electric potential energy, since it's about charges and their arrangement.

Wait, I remember that the electric potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula, but without the kinetic part. The formula is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But when there are multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

But wait, since the system is isolated, maybe we're considering all the interactions. So I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair
