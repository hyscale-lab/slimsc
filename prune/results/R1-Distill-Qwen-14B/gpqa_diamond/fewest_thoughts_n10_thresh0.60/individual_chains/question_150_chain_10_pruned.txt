Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. First, I'll read the question carefully.

The problem says that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO has the given NMR data. It's then reacted with a set of reagents: first, NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aq KOH and heat. We need to determine the final product from the options A to D.

Alright, so I think I need to start by figuring out the structure of the starting compound based on the NMR data. Once I know the starting material, I can track what happens with each reagent to find the product.

Let's look at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet around 9.7 ppm. High ppm, like 9-10, usually corresponds to an aldehyde proton. But wait, it's a triplet. Aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear as singlets or maybe doublets if coupled with something. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group? Or perhaps it's a ketone? Wait, no, ketones don't have protons. So maybe it's an aldehyde.

Wait, but in this case, the splitting is a triplet. So the aldehyde proton (1H) is coupled with two neighboring protons. That suggests that the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. Because each of the two protons in the CH2 would split the aldehyde into a triplet.

Next, 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): That's a doublet of 2H. Could be aromatic protons. Maybe two equivalent protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. Like, in a para-disubstituted benzene, each pair of protons could be a doublet.

6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet of 2H. Hmm. So perhaps this is another set of aromatic protons, maybe in a different substituent. Wait, the two doublets in the aromatic region might indicate two para-substituted benzene rings. Because each would have their own set of equivalent protons.

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an
