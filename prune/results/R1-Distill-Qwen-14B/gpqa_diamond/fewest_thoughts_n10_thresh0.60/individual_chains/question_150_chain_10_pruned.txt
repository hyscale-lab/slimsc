Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms. But let's break it down step by step.

The molecular formula given is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let's see, the molecular formula can give me some clues about the structure. The formula has 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. So, maybe it's an aromatic compound because of the high number of carbons and the presence of N and O.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet (t) integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the compound.

- 6.98 ppm: a doublet (d) for 2H. This could be two aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring since para protons are often split into doublets. So, perhaps a para-substituted benzene group.

- 6.51 ppm: another doublet for 2H. Maybe another aromatic group, but maybe in a different substitution pattern. Wait, if the first two are from one benzene ring, the next could be another. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system.

- 6.27 ppm: a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an acidic proton. Could be something like an -OH group or maybe conjugated alkenyl protons? Wait, but the integration is 2H. If it's an -OH, maybe it's a phenolic OH, but that usually appears broader and maybe around 5 ppm. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a vinyl group next to an aldehyde or ketone.

- 3.66 ppm: a doublet (d) for 2H. That's around the region for CH2 groups attached to something electronegative, like O. Maybe a CH2-O group, or maybe part of an enol or something else.

So putting this together. Let's try to imagine the structure. There's an aldehyde (from the 9.72 ppm peak), which suggests
