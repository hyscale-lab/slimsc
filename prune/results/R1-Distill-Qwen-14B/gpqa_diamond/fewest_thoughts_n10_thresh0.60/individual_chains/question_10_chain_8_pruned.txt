Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on planetary science, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. The options are all about mass and radius or density, so I guess I need to figure out each planet's density and then compare them.

Let me start by recalling what density is. Density is mass divided by volume, right? So, density = mass/volume. And for a planet, if we assume it's a sphere, the volume would be (4/3)πr³. So for each option, I need to calculate the density based on their mass and radius. Alternatively, if the density is given, that's easier.

Looking at the options:

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, so this planet would have the same density as Earth. I'll note that down.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but they already gave the density here. So this planet's density is 5.5 g/cm³. So same as Earth's. Hmm, but mass is double. Does that affect anything? No, because density is given, so it's the same. So same as a in terms of density.

Wait, wait. But wait a second: If the planet has 2 Earth masses, but same density, wouldn't its radius be larger? Because if density is mass/volume, and mass is double, radius would increase. But the question only asks for density, so for option b, the density is 5.5, same as Earth.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Oh, same composition. So same density as Earth. Because composition determines density. So Earth's density is about 5.5, so this planet would have the same. But wait, wait. Let me think. If it's the same composition, meaning same average density, but mass is 5 times. So if density is same, then volume is mass/density. So radius would be larger, but density remains same as Earth. So density is 5.5. So same as a and b.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "same composition as Earth." So if Earth's density
