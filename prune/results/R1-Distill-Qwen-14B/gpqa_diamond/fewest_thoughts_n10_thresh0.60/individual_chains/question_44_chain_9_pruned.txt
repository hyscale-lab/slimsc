Okay, I need to figure out which experiment won't help determine the mitochondrial role of the new anti-diabetes drug. Let me go through each option one by one.

The question is about a drug's effect on mitochondria. The experiments listed are various techniques that could assess different mitochondrial functions or their presence. So, which one is unrelated or doesn't involve mitochondrial function?

Option A: Differential centrifugation to extract mitochondria and then using a Glucose Uptake Assay. Wait, glucose uptake is usually related to the cell's ability to take in glucose, like in insulin signaling. But mitochondria are involved in cellular respiration, so maybe this assay is measuring something else. Or perhaps the glucose uptake is by the mitochondria? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe the assay is for the cells to take up glucose, which could be affected by mitochondrial function if, say, energy levels are low and glucose uptake is reduced. Not sure yet. I'll come back to this.

Option B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and adding luciferin. Hmm, luciferase is an enzyme used in reporter assays. If the cells have luciferase, adding luciferin would make them light up. But how does this relate to mitochondria? Well, luciferase might be in the mitochondria if it's a mitochondrial-targeted construct. Or maybe it's in the cytoplasm. Alternatively, maybe they're using it to measure ATP levels since luciferase requires ATP to emit light. Oh wait, because luciferase catalyzes a reaction where luciferin is converted to light, and
