Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it.

Parallax, plx, I remember, is the apparent shift in a star's position due to the Earth's movement around the Sun. The formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1 / plx. Oh right, so a higher parallax means the star is closer because the shift is larger when you're closer. 

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, if we have a range of parallaxes, how does the number of stars in each such range change as plx increases?

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. So the actual number of stars in a volume of space depends on that volume. But since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars should be proportional to the volume they occupy. 

Let me think about this. If I consider a spherical shell at a certain distance from us, the volume of that shell would be the surface area times the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², and the thickness is a small change in radius, dr. So the volume is 4π r² dr. 

But wait, distance r is related to parallax. Since r = 1 / plx, dr would be the change in distance, which is -1/(plx²) dplx. Wait, let me see: if plx increases, r decreases, right? Because r = 1/plx. So dr/dplx = -1/(plx²). So the thickness dr is negative when plx increases, but since I'm considering a small range, maybe I can just take the absolute value.

So the volume element (dV) between plx and plx + dplx is the surface area times dr. So,

dV = 4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/(plx²) dplx ) 

Wait, but since plx is increasing, and r is decreasing, the dr is negative. But I'm considering the absolute change, so perhaps I can ignore the sign, so dV is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) dplx? Wait, no, that would be 1/plx^4. But that doesn't make sense. Let me double-check.

Wait, no. Because r is 1/plx, so r = 1/plx. So dr = (-1/plx²) dplx.

So the volume element (dV) is 4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx² dplx). But since we're considering a positive dplx, the negative just indicates direction. So the magnitude is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the number of stars in that volume would be the volume multiplied by the number density of stars. If the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant, say n. So the number of stars, N, in that volume is n * dV.

So N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but that would mean the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. Hmm, but wait, that's per a unit change in plx, but how about when we consider the number per unit range of plx? So the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx)".

Wait, so they're asking for the number per unit plx. So for a given plx, N varies as 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx would go as 1/plx^4. So the function is inversely proportional to plx^4.

But wait, another angle: perhaps instead of thinking in terms of plx, think in terms of distance. As distance increases, the volume per unit distance increases as r² dr. So for a given distance interval dr, the volume is proportional to r² dr. But since r = 1/plx, r^2 is 1/plx^2, dr is (1/plx^2) dplx or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of differential. The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between those plx values. So that would be the volume element I calculated earlier.

Wait, but wait another approach. Let's consider that the number of stars in a small volume dV is n dV, and dV is 4π r² dr. Since plx = 1/r, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So,

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, but that would make dV proportional to 1/plx^4 times dplx. So the number of stars in that dV is n * (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the question is asking for the number per unit range of plx, which is dN/dplx. So that would be (dN/dplx) = n * 4π (1/plx^4).

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which would make the answer option A.

But wait, another way: if you consider the differential number of stars per unit distance, but that's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of distances. Let's say you have a range of distances, and for each distance, you have a certain volume. The number of stars in each shell (each distance interval) would be proportional to the volume of the shell.

So, for a shell at distance r with thickness dr, the volume is 4π r² dr. The number of stars in that shell is n * 4π r² dr.

But since plx is 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ). But again, focusing on magnitude, it's 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is (n *4π)/(plx^4). So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4), which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've heard that the number of stars per magnitude increases as you go fainter. But magnitude is related to distance, so perhaps that's a different way of looking at it. But the current question is about parallax, which is directly related to distance.

So, in this scenario, as plx increases (which means closer stars), the number of stars per unit plx would be higher, because the volume per unit plx is smaller. Wait, no, because when plx is small (large distance), the volume per unit plx is larger. Wait, no, because for each unit increase in plx, the volume it represents is 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the number of stars as a function of plx. So N(plx) dplx = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * dr. But dr = (1/plx^2) dplx? No, because dr = derivative of r with respect to plx. Since r = 1/plx, dr = -1/(plx^2) dplx. So the magnitude is 1/(plx^2) dplx.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx. So 1/plx^4 dplx. So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the number per unit plx is ~ 1/plx^4. So the answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. The distance to a star in parsecs is given by \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). For a small change in parallax \( d\text{plx} \), the corresponding change in distance is \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). The negative sign indicates that as parallax increases, distance decreases.

The volume of a spherical shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \) is given by:

\[
dV = 4\pi r^2 dr
\]

Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \), the volume becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right)
\]

Taking the absolute value (since we are interested in the magnitude of the volume), we get:

\[
dV \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume itself, assuming a uniform distribution of stars. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Among the given options, this corresponds to:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
