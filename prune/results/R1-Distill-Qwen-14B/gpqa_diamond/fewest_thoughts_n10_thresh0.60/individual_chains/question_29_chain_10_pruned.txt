Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about mutants and anti-nutritional compounds in barley. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

So the situation is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has this anti-nutritional compound which makes it unusable for food. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for which mutation would eliminate the compound.

The question is about which mutation would probably eliminate the compound. The options are Mutant 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me look at the sequences provided. The intact gene is given, and each mutant has some change in the first exon area.

The key is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, which in this case would stop the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. So, we're looking for a mutation that likely causes a loss-of-function allele. That could be a nonsense mutation (early stop codon), a frameshift, or a missense mutation that disrupts the protein's function.

Let's look at each mutant:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Each mutant starts with a change in the first exon.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact, let's see: The first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGT... in the intact. In Mutant 1, it's ATGTTCTACGCTGGT...

Wait, maybe I should line them up.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compare each part. Let me write each sequence in the same format.

Intact gene sequence (first part):

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 1:

ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So looking at the first few codons:

In intact: ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu)... etc.

Mutant 1: ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TAC ( Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp),
