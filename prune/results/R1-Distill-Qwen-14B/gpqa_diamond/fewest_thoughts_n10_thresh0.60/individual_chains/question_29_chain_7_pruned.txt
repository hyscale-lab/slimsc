Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The bad guy here is a gene that's responsible for synthesizing this compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. The goal is to find which mutation will eliminate the compound, probably by disrupting the gene so it doesn't work anymore.

They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a method that causes random point mutations. So each mutant probably has a change in the DNA sequence. The question gives us the wild-type gene sequence and four mutant sequences, and we need to pick the one that likely disrupts the gene function.

Looking at the options, each mutant's sequence is given. The wild type starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA and ends with TGA. The mutants have changes in the beginning, so probably in the first exon.

Hmm, the key here is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. The most common way is a frameshift or a premature stop codon. But let's look at each mutant.

First, let me note the wild-type and mutant sequences. The wild-type starts with ATGTTTC..., so the first few bases are ATG, which is the start codon, methionine.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild-type:
Wild: ATGTTT CT C GCT...
Mutant1: ATGTT C T A CGC...
Wait, let me line them up.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT...

Wait, so looking at the first part:

Wild:
Positions 1-9: ATG TTT CTC
Mutant1:
Positions 1-9: ATG TTC TAC

Wait, maybe I should look for where the change occurs. Let me write the wild-type and each mutant.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT...
So the first part where it changes is after the start. Let's see: The wild-type has TTTCTC, and mutant1 has TTC TAC.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compare each nucleotide.

Looking at the first few nucleotides:

Wild: 1-3: ATG
4: T
5: T
6: T
7: C
8: T
9: C
