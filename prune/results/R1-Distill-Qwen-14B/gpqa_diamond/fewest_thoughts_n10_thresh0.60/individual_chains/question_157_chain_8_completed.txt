Okay, so I have this question about designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Retroviruses are RNA viruses, right? So when they infect a host, they use reverse transcriptase to make DNA from their RNA. This DNA then integrates into the host's genome. So, for diagnosis, what would we target? Well, if we're looking for the virus itself, we might target either its RNA or the DNA it makes.

The question is about designing a kit. The options involve different methods: PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, and ELISA. Let's break down each step.

The first step in all options is identification of the virus. How is that done? Well, PCR-based methods require knowing specific sequences. So, to design primers, you need to know the genetic sequence of the virus. Without that, you can't design primers that will target it.

Option A says to identify the virus using symptoms and then design nested PCR. Wait, but how can you design PCR without knowing the sequence? Symptoms alone won't tell you the exact virus, and different viruses can cause similar symptoms. So maybe that's not the way. Nested PCR is a method where you do multiple rounds of PCR to increase specificity, but if you don't know the right primers because you don't have the sequence, it might not work.

Option B suggests using cDNA sequencing first. Wait, cDNA is made from RNA. So if the virus is RNA, you might extract RNA, make cDNA, and then sequence that to get the viral genome. Once you have the sequence, you can design primers and use real-time PCR. Real-time PCR is good for quick and quantitative results. That makes sense because it's a common method for virus detection.

Option C talks about DNA sequencing. But if it's a retrovirus, its genome is RNA. So unless it's integrated into the host's DNA, which may complicate things. But I think in the initial diagnosis, you would look for the viral RNA, not the DNA. So DNA sequencing might not be the first step for identification. Unless the virus has already integrated, but I think the initial detection would target RNA.

Option D is about IgG antibodies. ELISA tests detect antibodies, not the virus itself. So that would tell you if someone has been exposed but not if they're currently infected. Also, the question is about a quick diagnostic kit, which I think refers to detecting the presence of the virus, not antibodies. Because sometimes people can have antibodies from past infections, which doesn't mean they're infectious now. So ELISA might not be the best option for acute detection.

So putting it together: the correct approach would involve identifying the virus's genetic material. Since it's a retrovirus, RNA is the primary target. The initial step would be to extract RNA, make cDNA, and sequence it to get the specific sequences. Once you have the sequence, you can design primers for real-time PCR, which is efficient and quick for diagnosis.

Looking at the options again, option B says using cDNA sequencing first, then real-time PCR. That fits with what I was thinking. Option C says DNA sequencing, which isn't right for an RNA virus. So the answer should be B.


To design a molecular diagnostic kit for detecting a retrovirus, it is essential to consider the nature of retroviruses, which are RNA viruses. The first step in identifying the virus involves sequencing its genetic material. Since retroviruses are RNA-based, cDNA sequencing is the appropriate method to obtain the viral genome sequence. This sequence is necessary to design specific primers for downstream diagnostic methods.

Option A suggests using symptoms to identify the virus and designing nested PCR. However, symptoms alone are insufficient to pinpoint the exact virus, and nested PCR requires prior knowledge of the viral sequence, which is not provided in this case. Option C proposes DNA sequencing, but retroviruses are RNA viruses, and initial identification should focus on their RNA. Option D focuses on detecting IgG antibodies using ELISA, which identifies past exposure rather than active infection and is not ideal for quick viral detection.

Option B correctly outlines the process: cDNA sequencing is used to identify the virus, and real-time PCR is then developed for quick and accurate diagnosis. Real-time PCR is efficient and widely used for detecting viral RNA, making it the best choice for this scenario.

Answer: B
