Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Michael addition. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition is a reaction where a nucleophile attacks the beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. These are also called enones, right?

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, and each has different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the products for each and then match them to the options given.

Let's start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. Wait, malonate esters are good nucleophiles, I think. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups on a malonic acid structure. The other reactant is an acrylate, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the setup is for a Michael addition. 

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile (the enolate) attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the acrylate. Let me draw this out. The dimethyl malonate can form an enolate easily because the two ester groups stabilize the negative charge. The acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the 3-position, so the structure is more like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the 3-position. Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is propenoate, so positions are 1, 2, 3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the 3-position is the p-tolyl. Hmm, maybe it's actually CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? No, wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the 3-position would be the alpha and
