Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, at 2 parsecs it's 0.5, and so on.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly usually means that the number density is the same in all places. But wait, how does that translate when we talk about parallax? Because parallax is inversely related to distance. So if stars are spread out uniformly in space, their density in a given volume is constant.

Let me visualize this. Imagine we're looking at a spherical shell at a certain distance. The number of stars in that shell depends on the volume of the shell and the density. The volume of a thin shell is approximately 4πr² dr, where dr is the thickness. So the number of stars would be proportional to 4πr² dr times the density, which we can assume is constant.

But we want to find how the number of stars per unit parallax range (like per 1 unit of plx) changes. Since parallax plx = 1/r, r is 1/plx. So substituting r in terms of plx, we have r = 1/plx, so dr would be the change in r with plx. Let's see, if plx increases by dplx, then r decreases by dr. The relation is dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, maybe I need to express the volume in terms of plx.

Wait, the volume element in terms of parallax. Let's think: the volume of a shell at distance r is 4πr² dr. Since r = 1/plx, substituting gives us 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But dr is related to dplx. Because plx = 1/r, so dplx = - (1/r²) dr. Which means dr = - r² dplx. Substituting r = 1/plx, dr = -(1/plx²) dplx. So plugging that into the volume expression:

4π (1/plx^2) * (-
