Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let's try to think through this step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The matrix representation of Ay is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0).

I remember that angular momentum operators like these are related to the Pauli matrices. Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh right, the S matrix here looks familiar. Let me write down S:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i,  0]]

Wait, that looks like the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh wait, yes, exactly the same. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix, which is usually denoted as σy. So S = σy.

Since Ay = c·S, and c is h/(4π), let's compute Ay.

So, substituting, Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

To find the eigenvalues, I can compute the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

But wait, since Ay is proportional to σy, and σy is a Pauli matrix, its eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So if Ay is scaled by c, then its eigenvalues would be c * (±1). But wait, S is σy, so Ay = c σy.

So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of σy. The eigenvalues for σy are ±1. So a would be c*(±1). Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues a would be ±h/(4π). Wait, that's ± (h/(4π)) * 1, so ±h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second—I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact factors. Let me recall that the spin matrices for spin-½ particles (like the muon) have eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for each component. Oh wait, right. So for the Y-component, AY has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But wait, in this problem, they define Ay as c·S. Let me see.

Wait, c is given as h/(4π). So let's compute c: h is Planck's constant, which is 2πħ. So h = 2πħ. So c = (2πħ) / (4π) ) = ħ/2. Oh, that's interesting.

So c = ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) S, and since S is σy, which has eigenvalues ±1, the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2)(±1) ) = ± ħ/2.

But wait, the problem statement says that the matrix operator Ay satisfies Ay(φ) = a φ, so a is the eigenvalue. So the eigenvalues a are ± ħ/2. But let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and the real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real, as angular momentum components are Hermitian operators. So the eigenvalues should be real numbers, not complex. So any option suggesting imaginary parts would be wrong, right?

Option B: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Still, eigenvalues are real, so this must be wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm, because A is the angular momentum operator, which commutes with A². So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it should also be an eigenfunction of A². Because [Ay, A²] = 0. But does it necessarily commute with Az? No, because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something. So eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So Option C's statement could be correct. Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalue and eigenvectors.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the operator Ay. I'm not exactly sure what this means. Basis functions usually refer to the basis in Hilbert space. So for a 2x2 matrix, the basis is typically |+> and |
