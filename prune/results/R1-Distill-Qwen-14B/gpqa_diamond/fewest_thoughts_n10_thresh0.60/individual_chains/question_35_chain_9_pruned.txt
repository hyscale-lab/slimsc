Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can remember.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let's break it down.

So, the operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Wait a second, that matrix looks familiar. Oh right! That's the Pauli matrix multiplied by something. Or maybe it's the representation of the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle. Because for spin, the operators are proportional to the Pauli matrices. So the S matrix here is probably representing the spin part.

So the operator Ay is c times S. Let me write out Ay explicitly. Substituting c = h/(4π), so:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S
Which is (h/(4π)) times the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Wait, but wait. The Pauli matrices are usually σx, σy, σz. Oh, right, and the spin matrices S are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Because for spin 1/2, S = (ħ/2) σ. So in this case, if S is [[0,-i],[
