Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, wait. So, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when it absorbs a photon, it'll jump to the next higher energy state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. Oh, but wait, the question says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' So maybe that's the next higher energy state overall, considering both rotation and vibration.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the rotational quantum number J. The energy levels are given by E_rotational = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. Then, in the non-rigid rotor, which is the vibration-rotation model, the energy levels have both rotational and vibrational contributions. So the total energy E would be the sum of the vibrational and rotational parts.

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vibrational = (ν + 1/2) h ν̃, where ν is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational part is E_rotational = B J (J+1), as
