Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². So its magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm. I remember from my studies that the divergence of a vector field is a scalar field, right? So the divergence of f is a scalar. Then we integrate this scalar over the entire volume of the sphere.

Wait, but what's the divergence of a purely radial vector field? I think the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates might help here. Let me recall. In spherical coordinates, for a vector field that only has a radial component, say A(r), the divergence is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A(r)). So for a radial field, the divergence only depends on the radial derivative.

So in this case, the vector field f(r) is purely radial, and its magnitude is 1/r². So A(r) is 1/r². Plugging into the divergence formula, it would be (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)).

Let me compute that. Let's compute r² * (1/r²) first. That's just 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Oh wait, that would make the divergence zero everywhere except possibly at r=0. Wait, but r=0 is the origin, which is a point of zero measure in the integral. So the divergence is zero except at the origin.

Wait, but wait a second. So if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then when we integrate over the volume, the integral would be zero except possibly at the origin. But in the volume integral, we're including the origin. Hmm. But isn't the divergence undefined at the origin (r=0) because the field blows up? So maybe there's a delta function or something involved here?

Wait, I think I remember something about Gauss's Law. Oh right! For the divergence theorem, the integral of the divergence over a volume is equal to the flux through
