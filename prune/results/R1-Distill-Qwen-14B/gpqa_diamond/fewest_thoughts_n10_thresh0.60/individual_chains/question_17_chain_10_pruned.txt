Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me see what the question says.

So the problem states that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions, and the options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is written as CaY^2- or something like that. The K for the complex is the formation constant, which tells me how stable the complex is.

The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca^2+ and EDTA (Y^4-) combine to form the complex. The reaction is something like Ca^2+ + Y^4- ⇌ CaY^2-. So the K would be [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).

Wait, but the problem says the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. That means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, initially, I can assume that [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M.

But wait, in solution, some of the complex might dissociate into Ca^2+ and Y^4-. So, the actual concentration of Ca^2+ would be less than 0.02 M, right? Or wait, no. Because the complex is dissociating: CaY^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + Y^4-. But since K is large, that suggests the complex is stable, so not much dissociation. So the concentration of free Ca^2+ would be small.

Wait, but wait. Or maybe I should think in terms of the formation constant. Oh wait, no, the K given is the formation constant for the complex. So, K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) = 5x10^10.

But when the complex is in solution, the concentrations of Ca^2+ and Y^4- are both present. But wait, the problem says that the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex, but what
