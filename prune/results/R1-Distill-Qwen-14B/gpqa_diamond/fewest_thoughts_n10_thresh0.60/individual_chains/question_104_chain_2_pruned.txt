Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, so there are two stars, both with the same mass as each other and similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of these two planets.

The RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. So, the shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's movement. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think. Wait, but actually, the shift depends on the mass of the planet and the distance of the orbit, right?

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1.

I remember that the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude K is related to the Doppler shift. The formula for K is something like K = (v * sin i) / (1 + (M_planet/M_star))^(1/3), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude to the orbital period. Oh right, the formula is:

K = [ (G * P) / (2π * c) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_planet/M_star)) )

But wait, since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_planet/M_star is negligible, so we can approximate it as (M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ≈ (M_planet)^(1/3), since M_star is same for both planets. Oh wait, wait, no, the stars are the same mass. So each star's mass is same as the other, which is similar to the Sun. So M_star for both is same.

So for each planet, K is proportional to (M_planet)^(1/3) / (P^(1/1)) ), because the formula I think is K ∝ (M_p / M_s)^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), but maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better
