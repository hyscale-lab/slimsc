Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think about what I remember. Radial velocity detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift is periodic and depends on the planet's mass, the orbit's size, and the inclination.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both orbits are circular. The RV method detected shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 was 7 milliangstrom. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method's measured velocity is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( ( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) )) ) ) ) / (2π)

But wait, since the planets are Neptune-like and the stars are solar mass, M_p << M_star. So we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e≈0, which simplifies the equation. So sin i is approximately 1, because the planets are detected, meaning the orbits are likely edge-on, so sin i =1.

So the formula simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3) * 2π) ) ) * (1/( (M_star)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But because M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_p/M_star
