Okay, so I have this physics problem here about molecules and their energy states. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They're modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the same as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. 

The given data: mass of X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the options are all in units of momentum (N*s). So the question is asking for the momentum of the photon needed for this transition.

I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules have quantized energy levels for both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, I think. But when a photon is absorbed, it can cause transitions between these states.

Wait, but the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, the next state would be the first excited state. So I need to calculate the energy difference between the fundamental and the next state.

Wait, but wait. The model is the rotation-vibration model. So the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. Hmm, but wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), I suppose. So
