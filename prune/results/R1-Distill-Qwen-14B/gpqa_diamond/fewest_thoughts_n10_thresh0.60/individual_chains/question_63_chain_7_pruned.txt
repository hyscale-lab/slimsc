Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one's correct.

First, let's recall what the quantum rotation-vibration model is about. Oh right, it's a model that considers both rotational and vibrational energy levels of a diatomic molecule. The molecule is treated as a rigid rotor (rotation) and a simple harmonic oscillator (vibration) in this model.

The problem gives me the masses of the atoms, X and Y. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which I think is 2e-10 meters. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the question is about the transition when the molecule absorbs a photon. So I guess we're looking at a transition from one state to another. But what states are we talking about here?

In the quantum model, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. The fundamental state is probably the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either go to a higher vibrational state, a higher rotational state, or a combination of both. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, so I think that refers to the next higher state in either rotation or vibration, whichever is lower in energy.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = (ħ² / 2I) * J(J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number. For vibration, E_vib = (1/2) h w (for the zero-point energy) plus h w (n + 1/2), where n is the vibrational quantum number. So the fundamental state is probably the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0).

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either increase its rotational state (J increases) or its vibrational state (n increases). Since each transition has its own energy, the photon needs to supply the energy difference between the current state and the next higher state.

But the problem says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that must be the smallest possible energy increment from the current state. So which transition has a lower energy: increasing J by 1 (from J=0 to J=1) or increasing n by 1 (from n=0 to n=1)?

I need to calculate the energy difference for both transitions and see which is smaller. The photon with energy equal to the smaller delta E would be the one required for the next lowest transition.

So first, let's calculate the rotational energy difference. For J=0 to J=1:

E_rot_J1 = (ħ² / (2I)) * 1*(1+1) = (ħ² / (2I)) * 2 = (ħ²) / I.

E_rot_J0 is 0. So the energy difference ΔE_rot = E_rot_J1 - E_rot_J0 = ħ² / I.

Wait, but what is I, the moment of inertia? I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

Ah, right. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let me compute that. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ is 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 1.818 * 1.66 is roughly 3.01 (because 1.8 *
