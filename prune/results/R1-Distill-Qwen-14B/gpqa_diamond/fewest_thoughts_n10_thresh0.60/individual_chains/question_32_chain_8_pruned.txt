Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the formulas, but I'll try to work it out.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. Li-6 is a common isotope.

So, the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy isn't just (1/2)mv² like in classical mechanics. Instead, we need to use the relativistic energy formula.

The total energy (E) of a particle is given by E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the speed v. So I need to calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So plugging in v=0.96c, let's compute that.

First, let's calculate (v²/c²):
v² = (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So v²/c² = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Now take the square root of that: sqrt(0.0784) = approximately 0.28. Wait, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So yes, that's correct.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me calculate 0.0784's square root more precisely.

Wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, right. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857... which is about 3.5714.

But wait, let me be precise. Maybe I should use a calculator for sqrt(0.0784). Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as a fraction.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784/10000, which is 196/2500. Hmm, but maybe it's better to just compute it numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Let me calculate 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Then sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...
