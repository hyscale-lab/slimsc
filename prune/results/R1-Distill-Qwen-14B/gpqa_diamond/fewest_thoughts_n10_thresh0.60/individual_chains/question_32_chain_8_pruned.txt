Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to reach a certain speed for a nucleus. Hmm, I need to find the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should figure out what nucleus X is. Li typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So X is Li-6.

Now, the question is about relativistic energy. Since the speed is 0.96c, which is pretty high, relativistic effects are definitely important here. I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy (E = gamma * m0c²).

Gamma (γ) is the Lorentz factor, and it's calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v = 0.96c into that. So v² is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is... wait, 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. But wait, I should compute it more accurately. Let me double-check. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, yes. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 which is exactly 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of Li-6. I remember that the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, but considering binding energy, but for this purpose, I think we can use the rest mass of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I'll look up the approximate mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using the average mass of a nucleon. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, with 6 nucleons, the rest mass would be 6 * 938 MeV. Wait, but wait, the exact mass might be slightly less due to binding energy, but maybe the problem expects us to use the sum of individual nucleon masses.

Wait, let's think. The rest mass of
