Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and their speed in moving glass. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of the light beam is relative to the observer in the lab. The options given are A to D, with some formulas involving n and v.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But wait, this is when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. Now, the glass is moving, so I think I need to apply some sort of relativistic addition here because velocities don't just add up normally when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. Oh, but wait, the problem says the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. Hmm, maybe the units are in terms where c is 1, so v is probably a fraction of c, like maybe v is 0.5 or something, but the actual value doesn't matter right now.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify that v is a significant fraction of c. So perhaps I can use the classical velocity addition formula, but wait, that's only valid at non-relativistic speeds. Alternatively, maybe I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula because the glass is moving. But I'm a bit confused here. Let's think.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n, right? Because in the glass, the speed is v_light = c/n. But in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So we need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait, but how does the movement of the glass affect the speed of light inside it? Because from the lab's perspective, the light's speed isn't just simply v_light plus v, because according to relativity, you can't just add velocities like that. Wait, but when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the propagation speed of light in it?

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the frame transformations. Let's set up the problem.

In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the light is moving at speed u' = c/n in the same direction
