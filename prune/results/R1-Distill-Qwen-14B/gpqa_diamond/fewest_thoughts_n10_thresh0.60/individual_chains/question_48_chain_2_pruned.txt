Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question starts with cyclohexanone. So, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. The structure is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. So, it's like a chair where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a carbonyl.

First step: cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2), forming product 1. Hmm, what reaction happens when a ketone is treated with Br2? I remember that ketones can undergo various reactions, but Br2 is a dienophile in some cases, but wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a conjugated diene. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's an addition reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxidation? No, wait, that's with peracids. Or maybe it's a bromination, but where?

Wait, another thought: cyclohexanone can undergo a bromination via the enolate. So, under certain conditions, Br2 could add to the carbonyl. Wait, but usually, bromine adds to alkenes. Oh wait, maybe the cyclohexanone is undergoing a conjugate addition or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihalogenation.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. When ketones react with bromine, sometimes it's via the enolate. So, if cyclohexanone is treated with an aque
