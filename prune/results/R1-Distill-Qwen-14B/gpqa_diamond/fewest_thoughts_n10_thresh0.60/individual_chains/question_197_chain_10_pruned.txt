Okay, so I need to figure out what Compound X is, and then what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, alright. Let's start by looking at the IR and NMR data given.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches, but since it's an organic compound, probably O-H. But wait, the other peaks are 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 could be aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe it's a substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR now. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). Oh, that's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid, but that's usually a broad peak around 10-12. But wait, the 10.5 ppm is a broad signal, maybe an aldehyde or a phenolic OH? But phenolic OH would be broader and maybe a bit downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol form or something else.

Looking at the next NMR signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. Like two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which would be para substituents. So the structure might have a benzene ring with groups in the para positions.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These seem like they're from an isopropyl or some branched alkyl chain. Let's see: 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be adjacent to that CH2, maybe a CH connected to another CH. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) might be a CH connected to another group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something with two adjacent protons, maybe a CH(CH3) group.

Putting it all together: The benzene ring is para-substituted. One substituent is an isopropyl group (maybe in the form of a ketone or ester). Wait, let's think about the carbonyl.

The IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. 1720 could be a ketone (about 1700-1750 cm-1), but also possibly an ester or maybe an acid. But the 10
