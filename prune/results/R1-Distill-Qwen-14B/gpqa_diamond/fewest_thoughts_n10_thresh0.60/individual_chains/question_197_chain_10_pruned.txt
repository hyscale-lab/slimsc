Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these types of questions. But let's take it step by step. 

The question says that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for a specific reaction, maybe some kind of substitution or elimination. Wait, I think it's the HI and red phosphorus that's used for the Clemmensen reduction. Oh wait, no, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. Red phosphorus and HI might be for a different reaction, like maybe the reduction of a carbonyl group to an alcohol. Wait, no, waitâ€”red phosphorus and iodine are used for something else. Oh! Oh wait, maybe it's the Wittig reaction? No, the Wittig uses triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide, I think. Hmm.

Wait, wait another thought. When a carbonyl group is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to reduce ketones or aldehydes. Oh, right! I remember now. The Wolff-Kishner reaction uses NH2NH2 and heat, but that's for ketones and aldehydes to form amines. Wait, no, HI and red phosphorus is used in the reduction of carbonyl groups to alkanes. Oh wait, no, maybe it's the reduction of nitriles? No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's the reduction of ketones to secondary
