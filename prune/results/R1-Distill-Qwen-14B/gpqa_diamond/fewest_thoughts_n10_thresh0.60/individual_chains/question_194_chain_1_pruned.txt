Okay, so I've got this physics problem about partition functions and spins. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So each state contributes a term based on its energy.

First, I should find all possible states of the system. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3.

But maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8. Let me think about the energy expression. The energy depends on the products S_i S_j. So perhaps the energy can be expressed in terms of the sum of these products.

Wait, for each pair, S1S2 is 1 if both are same, -1 if different. Similarly for the other pairs. So the total energy is E = -J (sum of S_i S_j) for each pair. Let me compute that sum.

Wait, the expression is E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So the sum inside is the sum of the products of each pair.

I think it might be helpful to consider all possible values of these sums. Let me denote H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H.

So the energy for each state is proportional to H. So each state contributes exp(β J H), because E = -J H, so -β E = β J H.

Wait, no, because Z is sum over exp(-β E). Since E = -J H, -β E = β J H. So each state contributes exp(β J H).

So the problem reduces to calculating how many states have each possible value of H, and then summing exp(β J H) multiplied by the number of states with that H.

So what are the possible values of H?

H is the sum of three terms, each ±1. So possible H can be -3, -1, +1,
