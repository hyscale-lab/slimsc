Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options given are Lorentz Symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators that can be constructed from the Standard Model fields, respecting certain symmetries. So which symmetries are they?

I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely one of them. Because the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from it. So operators should respect Lorentz symmetry, meaning they have to be constructed in a way that's Lorentz-invariant. So option 1 is a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So, the full Poincare group. But wait, in an effective theory, do we require all operators to respect Poincare symmetry? I'm a bit confused. I think that since the effective theory is written in a way that works in any Lorentz frame, and it's a local theory, it must respect Poincare. So operators must be Poincare invariant. So option 2 is correct as well. So far, 1 and 2 are in.

Next, CP symmetry. I'm not so sure. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric, because of things like the CKM phase which leads to CP violation. So in the SMEFT, the operators can have CP violation. Because the operators include terms that break CP, right? So operators don't necessarily have to preserve CP symmetry. So option 3 might not be required. So maybe 3 is not a must-respect symmetry.

Then, CPT symmetry. I'm pretty sure that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. CPT is the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. Since the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT. So option 4 must be correct.

Putting it all together: the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetry. So that's options 1,2,4. Looking at the choices, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but wait. I thought Poincare symmetry is a subset that includes Lorentz. So if all operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So if an operator respects Poincare, it's already respecting Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries are required. So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4.

So the correct answer is option C, which includes 1,2,4.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect certain symmetries while incorporating all possible operators derived from Standard Model fields. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT
