Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let's see.

So, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy contributions from their movement or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at point P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the electric potential energy. Oh right, because in such a system, the charges are either fixed in place (so no kinetic energy), and we're concerned with their potential energy.

Wait, potential energy between point charges... I remember the formula for the potential energy stored in a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Each pair's potential energy is (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

So, the system has two kinds of interactions: between the fixed charge at P and the other 12 charges,
