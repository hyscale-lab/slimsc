Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And this one is a resonance, which probably means it's a short-lived particle because of a large decay width. The question is asking about the mean decay distance. 

The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Wait, wait, I should make sure the units are consistent. Oh yeah, Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert that to GeV. Let's see, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV, right? 

So, I think the mean lifetime (which relates to the decay width) is given by the uncertainty principle. The formula for the mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by the width Γ. Because the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, so when Γ is the energy uncertainty, τ is roughly ħ/Γ. 

Wait, but Γ is the total decay width, and it's related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ/τ. So yeah, τ = ħ/(Γ). 

Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance (L) would be the velocity (v) multiplied by the lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ. 

But wait, velocity depends on the particle's energy and mass. For relativistic particles, the velocity can be approximated using the energy. Oh, right, because for high energies, the velocity is close to
