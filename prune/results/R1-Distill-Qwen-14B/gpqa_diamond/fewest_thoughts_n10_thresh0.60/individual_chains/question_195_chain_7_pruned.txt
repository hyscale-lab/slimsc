Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled about how to approach it. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the question is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet in a system. Both planets are in circular orbits with the same orbital plane, so they must be aligned in a way that transits and occultations are possible. 

First, let me read the problem again carefully. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius. It's in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2 around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum period for this second planet so that both transit and occultation events occur.

Hmm. From what I remember, transit and occultation events depend on the orbital periods and the orbital distances. Wait, but I think it's more about the periods and the alignment of their positions relative to the star. Oh right, for both events to happen, the two planets need to orbit within each other's line of sight from our perspective. So their orbital periods must be such that when one transits, the other is in a position to occult, or vice versa. 

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when a planet is behind the star, so we don't see its light. So for both events to happen, the second planet must sometimes be in front (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation) the star relative to us. But how does that relate to their orbital periods?

Oh wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the transit and occultation conditions. For the second planet to transit, it must pass in front of the star, which requires that its orbital distance is such that it can reach the line of sight between Earth and the star. Similarly, for occultation, the planet must be behind the star, which would happen if the orbit is such that from our viewpoint, the planet sometimes moves behind the star.

Wait, but actually, for a planet to transit, it must have an orbital inclination such that its orbit is along our line of sight. If the two planets share the same orbital plane, their orbits are
