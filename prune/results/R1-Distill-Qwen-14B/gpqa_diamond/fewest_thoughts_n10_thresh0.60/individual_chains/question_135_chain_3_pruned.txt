Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, and I need to figure out the possible decay modes of a boson X. The problem gives me an interaction Lagrangian and some information about the mass of X. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf (y)(υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down. I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction between fields. In this case, the bosonic field X is interacting with some fermions. 

Wait, the fermion part is written as f-bar ψf(y). Oh, right, f-bar is the Dirac adjoint of the fermion field, and ψf(y) is the fermion field. So this interaction term probably describes X coupling to fermions. The lambda is a coupling constant, and υ might be another field, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's the Higgs field or something else, but perhaps that's not too important for this problem.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about its decay modes at the lowest order. So I need to find all the possible particles that X can decay into, considering conservation laws and energy-momentum constraints.

I remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, the fermions have to be a pair because bosons are spin-0 or spin-1 and fermions are spin-1/2. So X would decay into a pair of fermions, like f and f-bar. Each decay channel corresponds to a possible fermion-antifermion pair.

But wait, what determines which fermions X can decay into? The main factors are the mass of X and the masses of the fermions. Because in a decay, the rest mass of the parent must be at least twice the rest mass of each child particle (since energy and momentum must be conserved).

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that X can decay into must each have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV, because 6 GeV must be at least twice the mass of each fermion (since m_X ≥ 2 m_f for each fermion in the pair).

But wait, particles and their antiparticles have the same mass, so each fermion in the pair must have mass ≤ 3 GeV. So I need to list all fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, but I should think about all the known fermions and their masses. Let me list them:

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top.

Leptons: electron, muon, tau, electron neutrino, muon neutrino, tau neutrino.

But wait, the quarks are confined, so when considering decay products, it's usually the mesons (quark-antiquark pairs) or baryons (three quarks) that are observed. But the problem is about X decaying into fermion-antifermion pairs, so we're considering X → f f-bar. So the decay would produce a pair of free (or virtual) fermions, but in reality, they might hadronize into jets or leptons.

But perhaps the question is more theoretical, considering possible decay channels based on the fermion masses.

So, let me list the masses of the known fermions:

Electron: ~0.511 MeV (negligible)
Muon: ~105.7 MeV
Tau: ~1.78 GeV
Up quark: ~2.2 MeV
Down quark: ~4.7 MeV
Strange quark: ~95 MeV
Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV
Bottom quark: ~4.7 GeV
Top quark: ~172.5 GeV

Wait, but the top quark has a mass way higher than 3 GeV. So any fermion pair involving the top quark would require X to have a mass of at least 2*172.5 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So top quark can't be a decay product.

Similarly, the tau is about 1.78 GeV. So the tau pair would require X's mass to be at least 2*1.78 GeV = ~3.56 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, which is more than that, tau pair is allowed.

The bottom quark is about 4.7 GeV. So 2*4.7 = ~9.4 GeV. So X's
