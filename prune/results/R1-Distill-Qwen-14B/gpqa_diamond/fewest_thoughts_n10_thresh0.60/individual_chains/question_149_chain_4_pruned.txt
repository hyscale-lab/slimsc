Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to unpack it. Hmm. So the situation is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. They have similar shifts and their integrals together add up to 1H. Wait, so each peak is about half a proton? Or maybe the same because each is integrating to 0.5H? But wait, the question says they integrate to 1H together. So each is probably 0.5H each.

And the peaks aren't due to coupling because the coupling pattern rules that out. So it's not like a doublet of doublets or something. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Looking at the options, possible explanations are isomerism—enantiomers, diastereomers—or maybe some reaction issue like double coupling.

Then the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks at elevated temperature. Both have same mass, consistent with expected. Wait, so same mass, but two peaks. At elevated temps, maybe the compounds are more likely to lose some parts. So if they have the same mass, perhaps they are isomers of some sort.

So the options are A through D.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, it would have a different mass, right? Because a precursor is usually an earlier molecule in the synthesis, like missing a part that the peptide has. So the mass would be lower. But the LC-MS shows same mass. So maybe A is not right.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so the same mass. So in LC-MS, same mass would make sense. But how would that affect the NMR? Enantiomers have identical NMR spectra because the environment is the same, but wait, no—wait, no. Wait, if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same as pure because the peaks average out. Or maybe in some cases, if the peak is from a proton that's in a chiral environment, it would split. No, wait. For enantiomers, each enantiomer's NMR would be identical because the environments are mirror images. So if you have a racemic mix, the NMR would look like a single peak. Because each
