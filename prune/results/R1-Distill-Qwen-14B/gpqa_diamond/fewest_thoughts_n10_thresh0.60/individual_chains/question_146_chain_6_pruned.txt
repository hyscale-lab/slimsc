Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major product when 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene reacts with maleic anhydride. Hmm, I remember that maleic anhydride is a dienophile, right? So this sounds like a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, what's the structure of 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene? Let me sketch it out. Cyclopenta-1,3-diene would be a five-membered ring with double bonds at positions 1 and 3. So the structure is like a cyclopentene but with two double bonds? No, wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene would have two double bonds? Or wait, no, wait. No, a five-membered ring can't have two double bonds without being antiaromatic. Oh wait, no. Wait, 1,3-diene would have two double bonds? Wait, no, cyclopenta-1,3-diene would have a ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, right? So positions 1-2 and 3-4 are double bonds. So it's a conjugated diene? Hmm, but wait, a five-membered ring with two double bonds would have three single bonds. Wait, but a five-membered ring can't have two conjugated double bonds because that would create a conjugated diene in a ring, which is possible if it's a bicyclic structure or something else
