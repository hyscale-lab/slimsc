Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry in molecules, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me remember what C3h symmetry means. C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. I think it's the same as the point group D3h, but wait, no, C3h is a different point group. Wait, let me get this straight. The point groups include things like Cn, Dn, and others. Oh right, C3h is a subgroup of D3h, I believe. The C3h point group has a threefold rotation axis (C3), and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). So the molecule should have a threefold rotation and a mirror plane that's horizontal, probably cutting through the molecule in a certain way.

Now, looking at the options provided:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
Option C: triisopropyl borate
Option D: quinu
