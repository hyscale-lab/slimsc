Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But let's take it step by step. 

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of a nitrile group. Wait, no, or is it for something else? Oh right, I think when a nitrile is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes hydrolysis to form an amine. But wait, another thought: sometimes it's used for the hydrolysis of an ester, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's for the dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Hmm, no, wait. Oh wait, I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Because nitriles can react with HI in the presence of phosphorus to form amines. So that's the reaction we're dealing with here.

So the first step is to figure out what Compound X is. The question gives the IR and NMR data.

Let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests the presence of either an alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe an amine (N-H stretch). But the big peak at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a nitrile. Wait, nitriles have a strong peak around 2200 cm-1. Oh, but here it's at 1720, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Or perhaps a carboxylic acid? No, because the O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid would be around 2500-3300 and a broad peak. The IR shows 3400–2500, which is a broad region, maybe an O-H or N-H. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is probably an ester or a ketone. But let me think, for a nitrile, the peak is around 2200, so that's not matching.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data might help. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a really high chemical shift. What gives a peak around 10? An aldehyde proton is around 9-10, or perhaps a carboxylic acid proton. But in a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually a broad peak around 12 or so, but maybe in some cases lower. Or maybe an enol proton? Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Let's think: if it's an aldehyde, then the IR would have a strong peak around 2800 and 2700 (the aldehyde C-H stretch), but the IR given doesn't show that. Or wait, the 3400-2500 cm-1 could include some O-H or N-H. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Let's check the integration. The 10.5 ppm peak is 1H, possibly the -COOH proton. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, but sometimes it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde.

Wait, let's go through the NMR signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): probably an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid, but more likely aldehyde because the IR doesn't have the nitrile peak. Or maybe a ketone? No, ketones don't have protons. Wait, an aldehyde group has a CH proton. So the peak around 9-10 ppm. But the integration is 1H. So perhaps an aldehyde.

But looking at the IR again, the 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl. So if it's an aldehyde, the carbonyl would be around 1720 (aldehydes are usually 1700-1720). So that fits. But wait, in an aldehyde, the C-H stretch (the one in the aldehyde group) would be around 2800 and 2700, which are not mentioned in the IR. So maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Wait, the 1720 cm-1 is typical for an ester carbonyl. If the IR shows a strong peak around 1720, that's more likely an ester or ketone. But if it's an ester, the O-H stretch (from another group) might be in the 3400–2500 region. Wait, but if it's an ester, then maybe it's a methyl ester or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 3400–2500 region is from an amine. Because amines have N-H stretches around there. So perhaps the compound has an amine group. But then the 1720 would be a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an amide. Wait, but amide carbonyls are lower, around 1650. So maybe a ketone.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which doesn't fit a ketone because ketones don't have protons. So maybe the 10.5 is an acidic proton like an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Hmm. Let me think again. Maybe the compound is a nitrile. Because when nitriles react with red phosphorus and HI, they produce amines. So if the reaction is hydrolysis of a nitrile, the product would be an amine. So the starting compound would be a nitrile, which upon hydrolysis becomes an amine.

But wait, the IR of a nitrile has a strong peak around 2200 cm-1. The given IR doesn't have that, so it's unlikely. Unless the nitrile is not the functional group, but maybe it's part of another group.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an aldehyde group? That seems unlikely. Another approach: looking at the NMR.

Looking at the NMR data, the peaks at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are deshielded and give two doublets. So the structure likely has a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Looking at the integration, 2H each. So perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring, each having two protons. Wait, no, wait: the benzene ring in para substitution would have two sets of protons, each as doublets. So the structure is something like p-substituted benzene.

Now, the other NMR peaks: 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H). So that's like a chain of carbons attached to the benzene ring.

The 0.9 t (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2. Like a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, wait, 0.9 ppm triplet with 3H: that's a methyl group attached to a CH2. So perhaps a CH2CH3 group. Wait, but let's arrange the NMR:

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. Because the integration is 3H, which is a methyl. The coupling is a doublet, which suggests it's attached to a CH that has two neighboring groups. Or maybe it's a geminal coupling? Hmm, wait, no, in a doublet, it's coupled with one neighboring proton. So perhaps a CH group attached to two other groups.

Let me think about the structure. The benzene ring has two substituents, each perhaps being a chain. Wait, but the data shows 10.5 ppm (1H), so that's another group attached. Maybe the benzene has substituents at positions 1 and 4.

So perhaps the structure is something like para-substituted benzene with a side chain.

Putting it all together: the aromatic protons are in two doublets, which suggests a para substitution. The 10.5 ppm proton is an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. But then, considering the IR, which has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which could be a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propionyl group or something similar.

Wait, let's think about the NMR shifts. The 10.5 ppm is a proton that's likely deshielded. In a carboxylic acid, the proton is around 10-12, but sometimes lower if it's an aliphatic position. An aldehyde would be around 9-10, but the IR doesn't show a nitrile or aldehyde C-H stretch. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the 10.5 is a carbonyl group but without a proton. Wait, no, the integration is 1H, so it's a proton. Maybe it's a vinylic proton, but that's usually between 5-7 ppm. So perhaps it's a formyl group, like an aldehyde or an acid.

Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like in a phenol. But the IR would have a broad O-H around 3000, which is in the 3400–2500 region. But phenol O-H is usually broader and around 5-6 ppm in NMR, but wait, that's the aromatic region. No, wait, phenol protons are around 5 ppm. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, another approach: the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H). That suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2. So, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH2CH3) attached to a benzene ring. So maybe a substituent like ethyl or isopropyl? Wait, the triplet is from a CH2CH3 group. So for example, if the substituent is a CH2CH2CH3 group, the CH2 would be next to the CH, which could be the case in a propyl group.

Wait, the signals at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H) could correspond to a CH connected to two CH2 groups. For example, maybe it's a CH connected to a CH2CH2CH3 and a benzene ring. So the structure could be something like CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group. Let's think of the substituent as a chain of CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group.

Wait, the substituent could be a propyl group, like -CH2CH2CH3, but then the NMR would show a triplet at 1.4 ppm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary alkyl group, like isopropyl. Wait, but the triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) would correspond to a terminal methyl group. So if it's a propyl group, the structure would be -CH2-CH2-CH3. The NMR would show the CH2 as a quartet, but here the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H and 2.9 is a multiplet of 1H.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached via a CH. So the structure could be -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. No, wait, that would make the substituent a larger group.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a secondary carbon. Let me think about the NMR:

- 0.9 (t, 3H): this is the terminal methyl group of a propyl chain. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH3, but the middle CH2 would be split into a quartet, but in the NMR, it's a multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H). Hmm, maybe it's part of a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a butyl group. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a methyl group at the end of a chain. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH. So maybe the substituent is something like CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that would lead to more signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached via a CH. So the substituent would be -CH(CH2CH3)2? No, that would give a different NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, like -CH2CH2CH2CH3. But the NMR for that would have the triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) for the terminal methyl, and the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet (but in the data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H). Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an isopropyl group. Isopropyl would have a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to the benzene. The NMR for isopropyl would have a septet for the central CH, but in our data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H. That doesn't fit. So perhaps it's a different substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propan-2-yl group, like isopropyl. Wait, the isopropyl group would have the CH in the center, which would have a septet, but in our data, it's a multiplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a pentyl group or something else. Let me try to sketch the structure.

Looking at the substituent:

The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, broad singlet): possibly an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

- Aromatic protons: two doublets, 2H each, at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. So para-substituted benzene.

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): perhaps a methylene group adjacent to a CH.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): perhaps another methylene group.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a terminal methyl group.

So maybe the substituent is a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but I'm not getting it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group attached via a CH.

Wait, let's try to assemble the substituent:

The substituent on the benzene is a chain that goes like this: benzene-CH2-CH(X)-Y, where Y is another group.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look at the options to see what they represent.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, looking at these options, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which I think is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine. But wait, option C is a benzoic acid. Option A is a propanoic acid attached to ethylphenyl. Option D is a substituted toluene with a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but if the starting material is a nitrile, then the product would be an amine. But looking at the options, none of them are amines. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is different. Maybe it's a substitution reaction? Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. For example, esters (R-O-CO-R') when treated with HI and red phosphorus can undergo hydrolysis to form carboxylic acids. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. But I'm not sure. Let's think again about the question: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I think the reaction is probably hydrolysis of a nitrile to a primary amine. Because nitriles (RCN) with H2O and P/H+ (like HI) would produce amines.

Wait, but looking at the options, the products are various substituted benzoic acids or substituted toluenes. So perhaps the starting material is a nitrile attached to a benzene ring, and upon hydrolysis, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. Wait, when a nitrile is treated with strong acid (like H2SO4) and water, it becomes a carboxylic acid. But if it's done with HI and red phosphorus, maybe it's the hydrolysis to an amine, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, another reaction: if the starting material is a benzyl chloride or similar, red phosphorus and HI would be used for substitution, but I'm not too sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So, the product would be a carboxylic acid. Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which has a benzoic acid group.

So, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile attached to a benzene ring, and after hydrolysis, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

So, if the product is option C, then the starting material would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile. Let's see if the NMR and IR of the starting material (compound X) would fit.

But before that, let's think about the given data. So the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a nitrile's C≡N stretch? Wait no, nitriles are around 2200 cm-1. So that's conflicting. Oh wait, maybe it's an ester. Because esters have a carbonyl around 1720. But then how does the reaction work? Oh, because if it's an ester, and we treat it with HI and red phosphorus, what would happen? I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the IR peak at 1720 is a ketone. But then, the 10.5 ppm proton wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, the 1720 could be a carboxylic acid's carbonyl. Wait, but the O-H would be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. The NMR has a peak at 10.5, which is a singlet and broad.

Wait, if the starting material is a nitrile, then after hydrolysis, we'd get an amine. But the options don't have amines.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. Let's think: ester (RCOOR') with HI and red phosphorus. I'm not sure about that reaction. Usually, esters are hydrolyzed with acid or base. Maybe this is a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group (like Br) is replaced with an amine. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile (RCN) to an amine (RCH2NH2) using HI and red phosphorus. Then, if the starting material is a nitrile attached to a benzene ring, the product would be a benzylamine derivative.

But looking at the options, none are amines. So perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative. If it's a benzaldehyde with a substituent, but the reaction with red phosphorus and HI—what would that do? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a substituent. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The peak at 10.5 ppm (1H) could be a formyl proton (CHO). Then the IR has 1720 cm-1, which would be a carbonyl, so that fits. So maybe the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative.

Wait, but benzaldehyde's C=O is around 1700 cm-1. So 1720 is a bit higher, perhaps indicating an ester or a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an aromatic aldehyde, which would have the aldehyde proton around 9-10 ppm. So the IR would have a peak at around 2800 (stretch for aldehyde C-H), but the given IR doesn't mention that region. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the possible structures of options A, C, etc., and see if they fit the data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Benzoic acid has a COOH group. The NMR would show a broad peak around 10-12 ppm for the COOH proton, which matches the 10.5 ppm peak. The aromatic protons would be in the 7.2-8.0 region as doublets, which fits the data.

The substituent is sec-butyl, which is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene? No, wait, sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait. Let me clarify: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait. Wait, butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2-, iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2, and sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, correction: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-, but that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group attached at the second carbon.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. No, that can't be right. Let me think: the structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, no. Let me get this straight. For a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, maybe it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps I should draw the structure.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon chain where the point of attachment is the second carbon. So, the group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure as -(CH2)CH(CH3)-. No, that's iso-butyl. 

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the substituent structure, but let's consider the NMR of option C. If it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group on the benzene ring, and the benzoic acid group at position 1.

The benzoic acid proton would be around 10.5 ppm, which matches the NMR.

The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6 (if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4). Wait, but wait, if the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4 (para), then the aromatic protons would be at ortho and para positions relative to substituents. Wait, no, if both substituents are para to each other, then the remaining protons would be in positions 2 and 6. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the NMR.

Now, the substituent's NMR: the sec-butyl group would have a structure like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Wait, but that's not correct. Let me get the structure right.

Wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not correct because the chain is four carbons. Let me think: the correct IUPAC name for a butyl group attached through the second carbon is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, wait. Maybe it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but I'm not getting it right.

But regardless, the substituent's NMR would show protons from the alkyl chain. For a sec-butyl group, the protons would be: the terminal methyl group (0.9 ppm, triplet), a CH2 group (maybe 1.7 ppm, quartet or multiplet), and a CH group (2.9 ppm, multiplet). That seems to fit the NMR data.

So, the substituent's NMR fits a sec-butyl group: the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) from the terminal methyl, and the 1.7 ppm (2H) from the adjacent CH2, and the 2.9 ppm (1H) from the CH connected to the benzene.

So, the NMR data matches option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If the starting material is a nitrile, then the product would be an amine. But option C is a benzoic acid, so perhaps the starting material was a benzoyl chloride or something else.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is a benzaldehyde group attached to a substituent, and the reaction is oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, upon hydrolysis (with strong acid and water), it would become 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That matches option C.

So, the IR of the starting material (compound X) would show a peak for the nitrile around 2200 cm-1. But the given IR doesn't show that. Therefore, this might not fit.

Wait, the given IR doesn't have a peak around 2200, so perhaps the starting material isn't a nitrile. So then, what else could it be?

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is an ester. For example, if the ester is RCOOR', and upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by an amine. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a benzoyl chloride. But that's a different scenario.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid. Its IR would show a strong peak around 1700 cm-1 (carbonyl) and a broad O-H peak around 3000 cm-1. The given IR has 3400–2500 (which includes the O-H stretch) and 1720 cm-1 (carbonyl). So that fits. The NMR would show the COOH proton around 10.5, the aromatic protons as two doublets, and the substituent's protons as given.

So if the starting material is a nitrile (R-CN), and upon hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI, it becomes R-COOH. So the product is option C.

So the correct answer would be option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR and NMR data of Compound X are provided, and the reaction conditions suggest a hydrolysis reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. 

### Analysis of IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, characteristic of a carboxylic acid.

### Analysis of NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, consistent with the acidic proton (-COOH) of a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: These signals correspond to an alkyl chain attached to the benzene ring. Specifically:
  - The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** is a terminal methyl group.
  - The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** is a methyl group attached to a CH.
  - The **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** and **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** are methylene and methine protons, respectively, consistent with a sec-butyl group.

### Reaction and Product:
The reaction of Compound X with red phosphorus and HI indicates the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. The IR and NMR data of the product match **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**:
- The benzoic acid group explains the broad singlet at 10.5 ppm and the carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.
- The para-substituted aromatic ring explains the two doublets in the aromatic region.
- The sec-butyl group explains the alkyl chain signals in the NMR.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
