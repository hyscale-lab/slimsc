Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The question gives me the interatomic distance, which I think is the lattice parameter 'a', and the angles α, β, γ, which are all 30 degrees here. The plane in question is the (111) plane.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So that's a rhombohedral or trigonal crystal system. The interplanar distance formula for a cubic system is different, but rhombohedral is a bit more complicated.

I recall that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h² (cos² α) + k² (cos² β) + l² (cos² γ)))/(a² sin² θ)

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is derived from the Miller indices and the lattice parameters, including the angles between the lattice vectors.

The correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) ) / ( (h k l) ... wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the dot product. The formula for d is:

d² = a² (h² + k² + l²) /
