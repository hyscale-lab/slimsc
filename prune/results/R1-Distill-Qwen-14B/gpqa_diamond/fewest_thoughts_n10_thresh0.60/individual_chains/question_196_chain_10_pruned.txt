Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed when it passes through equilibrium. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are different. Oh right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects come into play.

The problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the equations to get the correct expression.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is when all potential energy is converted to kinetic. So the potential energy U is (1/2)kA², and kinetic K is (1/2)mv_max². So setting U = K gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The question is relativistic, so that might not apply directly.

In relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The total energy would include relativistic terms. The total energy E is gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is also (1/2)kx², but in relativity, does that change? Or is it still the same?

Wait, the oscillator is relativistic, so the equations of motion would be modified. The force is F = -kx, but in relativity, the momentum isn't just mv. So the equation of motion would involve d(p)/dt, where p is relativistic momentum, p = gamma m v.

So the equation would be d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x. Hmm, that seems complicated. But I'm supposed to find the maximum speed. Maybe I can consider the energy.

In the relativistic scenario, the total energy (kinetic + rest) would be E = gamma m c². The potential energy is (1/2)k A², because at maximum displacement x=A, potential is maximum. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So in that case, E = gamma m c² = (1/2)k A².

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy at A is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic is
