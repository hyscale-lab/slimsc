Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me break it down.

First, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule with multiple bridgehead carbons. The starting material has two bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3, probably on adjacent bridgeheads. 

The first step is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction, like an E2 mechanism. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halides) react with strong bases, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Oh, right, so maybe it's a di-elimination. Alternatively, perhaps each bromide leaves, but with such a structure, maybe the base abstracts a proton that's anti to one of the bromines, leading to elimination of HBr from each carbon. So two eliminations would occur, each releasing HBr and forming a double bond. But wait, in adamantane, the structure is such that each bridgehead is connected to three other carbons. So if two bromines are on bridgeheads, maybe each elimination forms a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but bridgehead double bonds are not usually possible due to Bredt's rule. Hmm, Bredt's rule says that bridgehead double bonds are not stable because of the strain and poor orbital overlap. So maybe instead, the elimination leads to a ring-opening or some other structure. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH isn't causing elimination but substitution. Wait, but with excess KOH and heating, which favors elimination. Hmm, but with two bromines, what's the product?

Wait, another possibility: 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoing dehydrohalogenation to form an allene. Because if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another, perhaps the elimination forms a double bond between the two. But wait, 1,3-dibromo would not be adjacent. Oh wait, no, 1 and 3 are two apart. So maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination would form a diene across the structure or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br leaves, and the structure undergoes some kind of ring expansion or contraction. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the product's NMR.

The product 1 has an H NMR with peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. The IR peak is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O), which suggests a ketone or an ester. But looking at the NMR, the 4.79 ppm peak is a doublet integrating for 2H. That's a singlet or a doublet? Wait, the description says 4.79(2H), which could be a singlet if coupled to nothing, but considering the IR, maybe it's more like an alcohol or a carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ether or an ester. Wait, but 1720 is more typical for a ketone or an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, which isn't seen here. So maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, but if the product is a ketone, how does that form from dibromoadamantane? Maybe through elimination. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, each from adjacent carbons, leading to the formation of a ketone. Wait, but that would require the formation of a carbonyl group, which would imply that each Br was on a carbon adjacent to another, leading to a conjugated diene, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a Hofmann elimination or something else. Oh wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, where each Br is removed and a double bond forms between the two carbons where the Brs were. But that would give an alkene, but then where's the carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Another possibility is that the product is a diketone. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane can't form that directly. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but then heating with KOH would cause substitution. Wait, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in substitution reactions unless it's a SN2. But adamantane is a very rigid structure, and the bridgehead positions are not very accessible for SN2. So substitution is less likely. Elimination is more likely.

Wait, perhaps the product is an enol. But wait, after elimination, maybe it's a diene. Hmm, but the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl. So maybe during the reaction, a ketone is formed. How?

Wait, another angle: When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps a double elimination occurs, with each Br removed as HBr and the formation of a double bond. But wait, that would give a diene, but where would the carbonyl come from? Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would require substitution. Maybe it's an epoxide, but I don't see an IR peak for that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane derivative. But that doesn't fit with the IR. Another thought: Maybe the KOH is leading to the formation of a geminal diol, but that doesn't fit the IR either.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case where two vicinal dihalides undergo elimination, but in this case, the two Brs are not vicinal. Hmm, so maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form a conjugated diene, but then that doesn't explain the IR. So I'm stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the product is an alkyl bromide, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but again, I'm not seeing the IR.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction conditions. KOH, heating. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Maybe it's a case of a double elimination forming an alkene. But with two Brs on adjacent carbons, that would form a double bond between C1 and C2. But in our case, the Brs are on C1 and C3. So maybe the elimination is from C1 and C2, and another from C3 and C4, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. So maybe it's a ketone. Let's think: If the product has a ketone, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches that. So perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would give a diol. But wait, KOH is a base, not a nucleophile, so substitution is unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Wait, let me think about the structure. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, each from a Br and a neighboring H, perhaps leading to a conjugated diene. But then where's the carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about the structure wrong. Adamantane has four bridgeheads. If 1 and 3 are two bridgeheads, then perhaps elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, which is not allowed, so maybe the structure rearranges. Alternatively, perhaps the product is not a diene but another structure, like a bicyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl group. Wait, but how? If each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another carbon, elimination could form a carbonyl. For example, if each Br is on a secondary carbon, elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps if the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the KOH is causing a ring-opening. For example, the adamantane structure could undergo ring-opening elimination to form a more open structure with a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, each from adjacent carbons, it would form a ketone. For example, each Br is on a carbon adjacent to the other, leading to the formation of a double bond, but then maybe the structure rearranges. But I'm not exactly certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that would require two carbonyl groups, which I don't see in the IR. The IR only shows a single peak at 1720, which could be a single ketone.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's probably a methylene group (–CH₂–) adjacent to an electronegative group. If it's a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone with a neighboring CH₂. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alcohol, but that would have a broader peak, possibly.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But the IR for epoxides usually shows a strong peak around 1250 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned. So that's probably not it.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the product as a diol. But the IR doesn’t show broad peaks that would suggest OH groups. Unless it's an ether, but then where's the carbonyl?

Wait, another approach: The IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl, so the product is likely a ketone. The product is formed via dehydrohalogenation, so each Br is removed as HBr, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond. But wait, no, because the two Brs are on 1 and 3, so perhaps each elimination forms a double bond, but that might not result in a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a carbon that, when eliminated, forms a carbonyl. So, each elimination would form a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require each Br to be on a different carbon that can form a carbonyl upon elimination. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ketone? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tricyclic ketone with a bridgehead.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an adamantanone derivative. Adamantanone is a derivative of adamantane with a ketone group. So, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But that would require two carbonyls, and the IR would show two peaks, which it doesn't. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps one of the Brs is eliminated as HBr, and the other is converted into a carbonyl. But how? Alternatively, perhaps the base induces an elimination where a Br leaves, and a neighboring H is abstracted, forming a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a case of the formation of a carbonyl via an elimination followed by tautomerism or some rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ether, but I don't see the IR peak for that either.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclo structure with a carbonyl group. Let's think: When 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes elimination, perhaps the two bromines are removed, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group. But I'm not exactly sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene. But that wouldn't have a carbonyl peak. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case where each Br is part of a cyclic structure that, upon elimination, forms a ketone. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a ketone but an ester. But why would KOH form an ester? That doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether, but again, not matching the IR.

Wait, maybe the product is an alkyne? No, because the IR peak for a carbonyl is still present.

Wait, perhaps it's a case where the product is a ketone formed via oxidation, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Hmm, maybe I should look at the NMR data. The product 1 has the following peaks:

4.79 (2H) – probably a CH₂ group next to an electronegative group.

2.41-2.23 (10H) – perhaps several CH₂ groups in a rigid structure, like adamantane.

1.94 (2H) – maybe a CH₂ group adjacent to something else.

So, putting this together, perhaps the CH₂ at 4.79 ppm is adjacent to a carbonyl group, making it a ketone. So the structure would have a carbonyl, and a CH₂ group next to it. So perhaps the product is a ketone where the carbonyl is at a bridgehead, and the adjacent CH₂ is deshielded.

Wait, but in adamantane, bridgehead positions are very rigid. So if one of the bridgehead Brs is replaced by a carbonyl group, that would make it a bridgehead ketone, which I think is possible. So, product 1 would be 1-adamantanone. Because when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, one of the Brs might undergo elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but 1-adamantanone has a structure where a bridgehead carbon is double-bonded to oxygen. I'm not sure if that's possible, because bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed. Wait, no, a carbonyl group is a double bond to oxygen, but that's a single carbon with three bonds: two to oxygen (double bond) and one to the rest of the structure. So in adamantane, replacing a Br with a carbonyl would be possible, perhaps.

So, product 1 is 1-adamantanone. Then, in the next step, product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. Hmm, what does that do? Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Wait, but 1-adamantanone is a ketone. So maybe it's undergoing some kind of acylation?

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the acid-catalyzed rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is undergoing some kind of addition or ring expansion.

Wait, another thought: 1-adamantanone could undergo a keto-enol tautomerism if it's in a polar environment, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, when heated with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it's undergoing a Claisen-like rearrangement or some other pericyclic reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone is reacting with the aluminum isopropoxide in a Friedel-Crafts-like reaction, but I'm not sure what would be the nucleophile here. Wait, but aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, so maybe it's acting as a catalyst for some kind of acylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 (1-adamantanone) is reacting with another molecule. Wait, but heating with Al(i-Pr)3 is a common condition for the formation of enol ethers or other enol derivatives.

Wait, another possibility: 1-adamantanone could undergo a ring-opening under acidic conditions. But I'm not familiar with that specific reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is causing the ketone to form an enol, which could then undergo some rearrangement or reaction.

Wait, maybe the product is undergoing a pinacol rearrangement, but that requires a 1,2-diol, which we don't have here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing a Aldol condensation, but that would require another carbonyl group.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what the second step does. But let's move on to the next step for a moment. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3.

Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond for this reaction. Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups based on the substituents on each end.

So, product 2 must have an alkene. Therefore, the second step must have introduced a double bond into the molecule. So, product 1 (probably a ketone) is converted into product 2, which is an alkene.

So, step one: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (a ketone, 1-adamantanone).

Step two: product 1 (1-adamantanone) heated with Al(i-Pr)3 to form product 2, which has a double bond.

Wait, maybe the second step is a ring-opening to form a double bond. For example, a keto group could rearrange under Lewis acid conditions to form an enol, which could then form a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is 1-adamantanol, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, but I thought the IR showed only one carbonyl peak. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step isn't forming a ketone but an ester. But KOH as a base wouldn't form an ester from a dihalide.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. But then the IR wouldn't have a strong carbonyl peak.

Wait, maybe I need to rethink the first step. Let's consider that 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH forms an epoxide. But earlier I thought that the IR wouldn't match, but wait, the IR peak is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which could be an ester or ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl in another form.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the product is a geminal diol. But that would require substitution, which is not likely for bridgehead positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But I don't see why two carbonyls would form, and the IR would probably show two peaks.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, each Br is eliminated as HBr, forming a bridged diene (two double bonds), but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is dehydrohalogenated to form a carbonyl group, but that would require each Br to be on a carbon that can form a carbonyl upon elimination.

Wait, maybe the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, leading to a conjugated diene, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. But since I can't do that, I'll proceed.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone (1-adamantanone), the second step involves heating with aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe this induces a ring-opening or a rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: 1-adamantanone could undergo a retro-aldol reaction under basic conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone reacts with the Lewis acid to form an acylium ion, which could then undergo some kind of cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product 2 is an enol ether. If product 1 is a ketone, then under acidic conditions, it could form an enol, which could then react with another molecule or form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing a keto-enol tautomerism, creating a double bond. But that's usually in more polar environments or with specific catalysts.

Hmm, perhaps in the presence of Al(i-Pr)3, the ketone forms an enol, which then loses a proton to form a double bond. So product 2 would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

So product 2 would be an enone, a conjugated enol with a ketone. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an enone (conjugated double bond) would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But the question is about the 1H NMR of product 3, focusing on the most deshielded hydrogen. The options are about coupling patterns.

Wait, but let's map this out. Let's say product 2 is an enone, so it has a structure like R-CO-CH₂-CH₂, but that's a simple example. In our case, it's likely a more complex structure, perhaps with a conjugated diene or a bridgehead double bond.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about the structure, so perhaps I should proceed to the ozonolysis step.

Assuming product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is something like (CH₂)₂C=CH₂, ozonolysis would yield two aldehyde groups. But in a more complex structure, the products would be more complex.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. Then, looking at the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons.

Wait, but in the NMR, the most deshielded hydrogen is probably on a carbon next to a carbonyl. For example, in a carbonyl group, the adjacent CH₂ groups would have protons that are deshielded.

If the structure after ozonolysis is something like O=C-R, the H on R would have coupling based on their neighbors.

Wait, but maybe the structure is such that the most deshielded H is on a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, and adjacent to another CH₂ group. So, for example, a structure like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-X, where X is some group.

The coupling pattern would depend on the number of neighboring Hs. For example, in a CH₂ group next to another CH₂ group, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. But if the adjacent group is more complex, the coupling could be more.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the most deshielded H is on a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group, it would be a triplet due to coupling with two Hs. But if it's adjacent to more than two Hs, the pattern would change.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogen is on a CH group adjacent to multiple Hs.

Wait, another possibility: After ozonolysis, the product might have a structure where the H is adjacent to two different sets of Hs. For example, it might be next to a CH₂ group and another CH group, leading to multiple couplings.

Wait, perhaps it's on a bridgehead or a position with multiple adjacent Hs, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible structures.

If product 2 is an enone, such as a cyclopropane with a conjugated double bond, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups attached to adjacent carbons.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the breaking of the double bond forms two carbonyl groups. So, each end of the double bond becomes a carbonyl.

If the double bond was between two CH₂ groups, the ozonolysis would produce two aldehyde groups. But if the double bond was between two more substituted carbons, it would produce ketones or other carbonyl compounds.

But considering the adamantane structure, the double bond in product 2 is probably in a bridgehead position, which is unusual but perhaps possible.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. Maybe I should focus on the NMR of product 3.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding exchangeables). So, in product 3, which is the ozonolysis product, what would that H look like?

In ozonolysis, the product typically has carbonyl groups. The Hs adjacent to these would be deshielded. For example, if there's a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, the Hs on that CH₂ would be deshielded and show a coupling pattern based on neighboring Hs.

If that CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH₂, resulting in a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is next to a CH group that has two Hs, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, but considering the options, one of the possibilities is a triplet of triplets. That would happen if each H is coupling with two sets of two Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, a doublet of triplets would mean coupling with two different sets of Hs.

Wait, perhaps the H is on a CH group, which is adjacent to two different CH₂ groups. Each of those CH₂ groups has two Hs, so the coupling would be first a doublet from one set and a triplet from another, leading to a doublet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the H is on a CH group next to a CH₂ group, which in turn is next to another CH group. That might lead to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis has a CH₂ group next to a CH₂ group and another H on the same carbon, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, another angle: The most deshielded H is probably on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's in a structure like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-X. The CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl would have each H coupling with the two Hs on the next CH₂. So the splitting would be a triplet.

But if that CH₂ is also adjacent to another group with more Hs, the pattern could become more complex.

Alternatively, if the H is on a bridgehead, it might be coupled with multiple Hs from adjacent bridge structures.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH group that's adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, each with two Hs. So each H on the CH would couple with two Hs from each adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, it might be a doublet of triplets if it's coupled with two different sets of Hs, such as coupling with two Hs on one side and three on the other, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, let's think about the ozonolysis product. Suppose product 2 has a structure where the double bond is between two CH groups. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is CH₂=CH-(adamantane part), then ozonolysis would form two aldehyde groups. But that might not fit with the structure.

Alternatively, if the double bond is in a bridge, perhaps ozonolysis would form two ketone groups.

But regardless, the key is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H, which is likely next to a carbonyl group.

If the H is on a CH₂ group next to another CH₂ group, it's a triplet. If it's on a CH group next to a CH₂ group, it might be a quartet. But the options don't include a quartet.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

Hmm.

If the H is on a CH group that's adjacent to a CH₂ group (two Hs) and another CH group (one H), the coupling would be a triplet from the adjacent CH₂ and a doublet from the CH group. So the overall pattern would be a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option. Alternatively, if it's a CH group adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, it would couple with both, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH group next to a CH₂ group (two Hs) and another CH₂ group (also two Hs), each coupling would be a triplet, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another possibility: The H is on a CH₂ group that's next to another CH₂ group, which is next to a CH group. So each H on the first CH₂ would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. Additionally, if the CH group has one H, each H on the first CH₂ might also couple with that H, adding another splitting. If that's the case, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, based on the options, I'm leaning towards a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Wait, but another angle: Ozonolysis of a cyclic diene would form two carbonyl groups, perhaps leading to a structure where each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH₂ group. The Hs on those CH₂ groups would be next to each other, leading to a triplet coupling. But if each CH₂ is also adjacent to another group with Hs, it could lead to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a bridgehead, leading to coupling with multiple Hs from different parts of the molecule.

Wait, another thought: The most deshielded H could be part of a conjugated system, leading to more complex coupling. Alternatively, it's on a CH group next to a CH₂ group and another CH group, leading to multiple couplings.

But without the exact structure, it's challenging. However, considering the options, the most likely answer is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a ketone due to the rigid adamantane structure. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carbonyl group. The NMR data supports this: the peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, while the remaining peaks align with the adamantane framework. Thus, the product is likely 1-adamantanone.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**:  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely induces a rearrangement or tautomerization of 1-adamantanone. This forms product 2, which contains a double bond (likely a conjugated enone structure). This is inferred because the subsequent ozonolysis step requires a double bond.

3. **Ozonolysis and workup**:  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 contains carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely on a CH₂ or CH group adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling pattern in product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group and coupled with neighboring hydrogens. If this hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group, it would exhibit a triplet due to coupling with two hydrogens. However, if it is coupled with hydrogens from two different groups (e.g., a CH₂ and a CH), the coupling pattern becomes a triplet of triplets. This matches the description of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR spectrum.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.

**Answer: B**
