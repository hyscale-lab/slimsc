Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. I remember that this relates to the Boltzmann equation and the Saha equation, but wait, maybe it's just the Boltzmann part here.

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that happen? Oh right, dark spots are cooler regions, so when a significant part of the surface is spotted, the average temperature of the photosphere goes down.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

So, the ratio is n1/n2, where n1 is the number in level 1 and n2 in level 2. The ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation: (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Here, g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels. The transition corresponds to 1448 Å, which is in the UV or perhaps near-UV range. But for the Boltzmann equation, the wavelength might relate to the energy difference between the levels.

Wait, the energy difference ΔE can be calculated using the relation E = hc/λ. So, I can compute ΔE as hc/lambda. But wait, the levels are E1 and E2, so E2 - E1 = hc/lambda. So that's positive, because higher energy level minus lower. So in the exponent, it's (E2-E1)/(k T) which is positive.

When the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. So the factor in the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T). If T decreases, the exponent becomes larger, so exp(-x) becomes smaller. That would make the ratio n1/n2 smaller because the denominator (exp) is smaller. So when the star has spots, the ratio decreases, which matches the problem statement.

So the question is, by what factor does n1/n2 change when the star goes from 6000 K to 5500 K? Wait, no, wait. When there are spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But the spots are cooler regions, so the rest of the star (60%) is hotter? Or does the entire photosphere cool? Hmm, this part is a bit confusing. Wait, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the entire photosphere's average Teff is 5500 K.

Wait, but wait a second. The effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity. So when spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall luminosity comes from both the spotted and
