Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully again.

So, the question is about a star with certain properties. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question deals with the ratio of the number of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They've observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The task is to find the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio when the star has no spots compared to when it does.

The problem also mentions that the transition between these energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And it's assumed that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means that each small region of the photosphere can be treated as having its own temperature and conditions, but on a large enough scale, it's uniform.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find the factor N1/N2 when no spots are present divided by when spots are present. Let's denote R = (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots.

From what I remember, the ratio of populations of two energy levels in LTE is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two states to the temperature and their energy difference.

The formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is N1/N2. So that would be the reciprocal. So N1/N2 = [ (g1/g2) ) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ) ]^{-1}?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Boltzmann equation says N_i / N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(kT) ). So if I have two energy levels, level 1 and level 2, and E2 > E1, then N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ). So the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ). 

Wait, but in the problem statement, when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. Wait, but what's the temperature in this context? Are we considering the temperature of the spots or the surrounding photosphere?

Wait, the problem says the photospheric effective temperature decreases. So when spots are present, the overall photosphere has a lower effective temperature. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler regions. Because when a star has a spot, it's
