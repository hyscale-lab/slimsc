Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO is reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to find out what the final product is based on the NMR data provided. The options are A to D.

First, let me try to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure.

Degree of unsaturation is calculated as: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for this compound: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That can be from a combination of rings and double bonds.

Five degrees could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds and one ring, so 4 degrees) plus a double bond or a carbonyl group. Or maybe a ring plus an aromatic ring. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's quite upfield for a triplet. Wait, wait, that's actually a triplet, but 9.72 is quite downfield. Hmm. What gives a triplet around 9.7 ppm? Maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, a triplet? Aldehyde protons are usually singlets because they don't have neighboring Hs. Unless it's in a situation where the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system or something else. Hmm, or maybe it's an aromatic proton near an electronegative group.

Wait, the NMR data also has peaks at 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). Let's parse each of these.

The 9.72 ppm triplet could be an aldehyde. But why a triplet? Maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde, like benzaldehyde, but maybe there's a coupling with adjacent protons. Wait, no, in benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is a singlet because it's only attached to the benzene ring. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an enal, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. The aldehyde proton in that case is conjugated, but I'm not sure about the splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents leading to some coupling.

Wait, let's look at the other peaks. The 6.98 and 6.51 peaks are doublets each integrating for 2H. These look like two sets of para-substituted aromatic protons. The 6.98 (d, 2H) is probably para-substituted on a benzene ring, as is the 6.51 (d, 2H). So maybe two benzene rings, each substituted in the para positions with something else.

Then there's a 6.27 (bs, 2H), broad singlet. Broad suggests maybe exchange with water or something, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a vinyl group or something else that's deshielded. And 3.66 (d, 2H), which is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an ether or an alkoxy group. The d (doublet) suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Or maybe it's a methylene attached to something else.

Putting this together, perhaps the compound has two benzene rings, each with substituents. Let me think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Each benzene ring is C6H5. So if there are two benzene rings, that would be 12 carbons, which doesn't fit. Wait, no, wait, perhaps each benzene is substituted once, so maybe two substituents. Or perhaps the compound has a benzene ring connected to another structure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's see, for example, if it's a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde group.

Wait, another approach: let's try to draw possible
