Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question involves identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated using the formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here since there's no halogen mentioned, right? So for this compound: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which contributes 4 degrees) and a double bond (another degree), so that adds up to five. Or maybe a ring and a carbonyl group, which also adds up. So the compound likely has a benzene ring and a double bond or a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H). That's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet might mean it's next to a CH2 group. Or maybe an aromatic proton? No, aromatic protons are typically lower, around 6-8 ppm. So this is likely an aldehyde.

6.98 ppm (d, 2H). Two protons as a doublet. Could be aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Wait, a doublet in an aromatic region suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe para-substituted benzene with two substituents?

Wait, looking again. The peaks are: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Let's map these.

The triplet at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde (-CHO). Aldehydes usually show a singlet or a triplet if next to a CH2 group. So maybe the structure has a CH2CHO group.

The aromatic region has 6.98, doublet (
