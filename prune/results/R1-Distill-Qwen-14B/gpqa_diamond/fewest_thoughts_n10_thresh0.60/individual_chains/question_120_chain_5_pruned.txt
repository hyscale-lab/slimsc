Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember parallax is related to distance, right? Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star due to Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So if parallax increases, how does that affect the number of stars in that range? Since stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that means they are spread out evenly in space, but how does that translate to the number we observe?

Let me think about the distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be the number density multiplied by 4πd² dr. 

But parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's express the volume in terms of plx. So, d = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, because dr is negative when plx increases, but maybe I can ignore the sign since we're dealing with absolute ranges.

So substituting d into the volume expression, we get 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dr). But since dr = -(1/plx²) dplx, we can write the volume as 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx² dplx). Wait, no, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx. 

Let me rearrange. The number of stars N in a shell between plx and plx + dplx would be proportional to the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is 4πd² * 2π (distance * thickness? Wait, no. Wait, the shell is a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr. So the volume is 4π d² dr.

Since d = 1/plx, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But dr is the change in distance, which is dr = (dd) = (1/plx^2) dplx. Because d =1/plx → dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx. So dr = (1/plx^2) dplx. 

Putting that into the volume expression, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. So that's 4π * (1/plx^4) dplx. 

So the number of stars in a small range of plx is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx. Therefore, the number per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. 

So looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm considering the number of stars per unit range of plx. So dN = (number density) * 4π d² dr. But number density is uniform, so let's say density n. So dN =
