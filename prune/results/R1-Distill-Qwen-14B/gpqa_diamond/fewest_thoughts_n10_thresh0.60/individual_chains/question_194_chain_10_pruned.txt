Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but let's see if I can work through this.

So the spins are S1, S2, S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

Wait, right. So each spin has two possible states, so for three spins there are 2^3=8 possible states. I need to calculate the energy for each state and then sum exp(-βE) for all of them.

But maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let's think about the possible values of the energy term. The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me denote the sum inside as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J H.

Each S_i is ±1, so each term in H is ±1. For example, S1S2 is +1 if S1 and S2 are the same, -1 otherwise. The same for the other terms.

Wait, but for each pair, S_i S_j can be +1 or -1. So the sum H can vary based
