Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about the intrinsic angular momentum operator, specifically the Y-component, denoted as A_y.

Wait, the operator A_y is given as c multiplied by S, right? Oh, right, c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, S looks like:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So, the operator A_y would be c times this S matrix.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So, eigenvalues a satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0.

First, let's compute Ay. Since c is h/(4π), let me substitute that in. So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So, the matrix becomes:

[ (h/(4π))(0) , (h/(4π))(-i) ] → [ 0, -i h/(4π) ]
[ (h/(4π))(i) , (h/(4π))(0) ] → [ i h/(4π), 0 ]

So, the matrix Ay is:

[ 0, -i (h/(4π)) ]
[ i (h/(4π)), 0 ]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation. The trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The determinant would be (tr(Ay)^2 - sum of squares of elements) / 4? Wait, wait. Let me think again.

The determinant for eigenvalues is |Ay - a I| = 0. So,

| [ -a     -i h/(4π) ] |
| [ i h/(4π)  -a   ] | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ (-i * i) (h^2/(16 π²)) ) ]

Wait, (-i * i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So,

Determinant = a² - (h²/(16 π²)) * (1) ) = 0.

So,

a² = h²
