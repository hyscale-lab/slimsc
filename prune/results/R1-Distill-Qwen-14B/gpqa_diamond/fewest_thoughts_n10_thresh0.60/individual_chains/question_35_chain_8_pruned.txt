Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I need to find the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Let me start by understanding the setup. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So, let me write down what S looks like.

S matrix:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Wait, because the first row is (0, -i) and second is (i, 0), right. So S is a 2x2 matrix. Since Ay = c * S, then Ay will have elements c*0, c*(-i) in the first row, and c*i, c*0 in the second row. So, substituting c = h/(4π), the matrix Ay becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S
First row: 0, -i*(h/(4π))
Second row: i*(h/(4π)), 0

So the matrix Ay is:
[ 0       -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  0       ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is Ay |φ> = a |φ>, so I need to find the eigenvalues a and their corresponding eigenvectors.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]], the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue.

So let's set up the matrix (Ay - λ I):

[ -λ          -i h/(4π)        ]
[ i h/(4π)     -λ           ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ]

Calculating determinant: λ² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So λ² = h²/(16 π²)
Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π)

Wait, so eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). Since the problem mentions the eigenvalue equation Ay φ = a φ, so a is the eigenvalue.

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh and real part ±h/(4π). But wait, my eigenvalues are real, h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, which means their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is wrong because it suggests the eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts.

Option B: Im
