Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension, like dimension 6, which is the most common. But the question is about which symmetries these operators must respect.

The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact symmetries. Let me think. Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because any operator in a relativistic theory must respect Lorentz invariance. So SMEFT operators should transform properly under Lorentz transformations. So option 1 is in.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh wait, Lorentz symmetry is part of the Poincare group. But wait, I think that when you talk about respecting Poincare symmetry, you're ensuring that the theory is invariant under translations and Lorentz transformations. But in the SMEFT, the basis for the operators is chosen so that they are Lorentz invariant. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, which is part of Poincare. But wait, the question is whether they must respect Poincare symmetry. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Because the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators in the theory must be Lorentz scalars, which implies they respect Lorent
