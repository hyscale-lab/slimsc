Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each with their own reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Let me start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a dienolate. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is the Michael acceptor. Since the reaction is a Michael addition, the enolate from the donor will attack the acceptor.

Wait, the acceptor here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The donor is dimethyl malonate, which is CH2(COOCH3)2. When the enolate attacks the beta position (the C of the acrylate), the donor's enolate adds to the acceptor.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is a strong base) would attack the beta carbon of the acceptor. The addition would create a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha of the donor and the beta of the acceptor. Let me draw this out in my mind. The donor's enolate has a negative charge on the central carbon (the malonate's central CH2). It attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the acrylate's structure is CH2- C(p-tolyl) - COOCH3. The attack would happen at the CH2 part, adding the malonate's CH2 group there.

After the attack, the product should have the two from the donor and the two from the acceptor connected. So the new molecule would be a combination of both. The product would have the structure where the malonate's CH2 is added to the acrylate's beta position.

Wait, but the acrylate is E-configuration. So the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. But when the attack happens, the geometry might not matter as much since the double bond is where the addition occurs. Once the attack happens, the double bond would shift, but in this case, since it's an addition, I think the double bond would be consumed. So the product would be a substituted malonate derivative.

The product of reaction A would be a tri-carboxylate. Let me think about the name. The starting materials are dimethyl malonate (which has two methyl esters on the malonate) and another methyl ester on the acrylate. After adding, the molecule would have three ester groups. So probably it's trimethyl something tricarboxylate.

Looking at the options, option A for A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Let me see. The main chain would be propane with three carboxylate groups. The substituents would be on carbon 2, which is the middle carbon. So the structure would be COOCH3 groups on carbons 1 and 3, and a p-tolyl group on carbon 2. That makes sense because the acrylate's p-tolyl group is attached to the beta carbon, which after addition is the middle carbon.

So I think option A for A is correct.

Next, reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of MeOH and H3O+. Wait, wait, no: the conditions are MeOH and H3O+? Or maybe that's a typo. Wait, the reagents are listed as (MeOH, H3O+). So it's probably an acid-catalyzed
