Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, what's a resonance exactly? Oh right, a resonance in particle physics is a particle that exists for a very short time before decaying. So, like, it's a way to describe the peak in the cross-section of a reaction as energy varies.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson resonance X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various distances in meters.

So I think the mean decay distance depends on how long the particle lives on average. The longer it lives, the further it can travel before decaying. Oh, right, that's the proper lifetime. The mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. I recall the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for a particle with a very short lifetime, the energy width (Γ) is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So Γ = ħ / τ. Therefore, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, the decay length is the distance the particle travels during its mean lifetime. So L = v * τ. But to get that, I need the velocity v of the particle. Since E_X is given as 8 GeV, which is much larger than the rest mass (1.2 GeV), the particle is ultrarelativistic. So the velocity v is approximately the speed of light, c. So L ≈ c * τ.

But wait, how do I calculate τ? I have Γ in MeV, and ħ in units that I need to convert. Let me think about the units. ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Its value is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and ħ is usually 197 MeV·fm (femtometers), but perhaps it's easier to convert everything into GeV and seconds.

So, let's compute τ first. Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers:
