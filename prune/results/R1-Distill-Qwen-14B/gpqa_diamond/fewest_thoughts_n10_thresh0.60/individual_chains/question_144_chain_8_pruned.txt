Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, with various values in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember that when a particle is produced, it doesn't live forever. It decays after some time, and the mean lifetime is related to its width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here.

So the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. Or wait, is it Γ = ħ τ? Wait, no, I think it's Γ is the decay rate, and τ is the mean lifetime. The relationship is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ has units of energy, and ħ has units of energy*time, so dividing by energy gives time. Yeah, that sounds right.

But wait, no. Let me double-check. The decay width Γ has units of energy. The uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ, so ΔE being Γ implies Δt ≈ ħ/(Γ). So the mean lifetime τ is on the order of ħ/(Γ). So τ is ħ divided by
