Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the answer step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me think about each step one by one.

First, the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. This is probably a dehydrohalogenation. So, the product here would be an adamantane with a double bond between the 1 and 3 positions? Wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is actually a dihalide where the bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Because in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others, so if it's 1,3-dibromo, maybe the structure is such that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in the same face. So when KOH is used, you eliminate HBr twice, forming a double bond.

So the product, product 1, would likely be 1,3-diacetylenic adamantane? Or wait, no, elimination would form an alkene. Wait, wait, no, elimination of HBr from vicinal dihalide would give an alkene. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination would form 1,3-diene? Or maybe a single double bond. Wait, no, because the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me think: the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings. If there are Br atoms on carbons 1 and 3, perhaps adjacent. So elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. So product 1 is 1,3-diene? Or perhaps a single double bond from each elimination. Wait, no, because elimination removes two HBr molecules, but in this case, maybe each Br is on a different position. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the product as an adamantane with a double bond between two adjacent carbons. So product 1 is 1,3-dibromo... no, wait, the
