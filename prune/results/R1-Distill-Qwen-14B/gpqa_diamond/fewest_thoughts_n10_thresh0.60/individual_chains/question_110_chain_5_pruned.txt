Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that both spectrographs have different brightness limits for the stars they can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. No, wait: the description says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So apparent magnitude V less than or equal to 17, right? Because lower magnitude means brighter. So ESPRESSO can see stars with V up to 17 mag.

And HIRES at Keck can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 mag. Because anything brighter (lower number) is okay. So which stars are bright enough in apparent magnitude for both instruments?

Wait, but the question is about which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be observable by both. So the apparent V magnitude of the star must be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). So the star's apparent V must be ≤16 mag because that's the stricter condition. So any star with apparent V ≤16 can be seen by both, right?

Wait, but let me make sure.
