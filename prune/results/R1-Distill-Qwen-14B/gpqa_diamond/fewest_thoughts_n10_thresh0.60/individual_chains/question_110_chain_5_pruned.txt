Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that both observatories have different capabilities. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to about 17, while HIRES can go down to a brighter limit of 16. So, the stars need to be bright enough for both instruments. Wait, no, actually, wait. Let me think. Oh right, no. Each spectrograph can't observe any star with a V magnitude brighter than their limit. Wait, no, the magnitude scale is a bit tricky. The lower (brighter) the magnitude, the better. So, if a star is too faint (high magnitude), the instrument can't see it. So, ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag, meaning that anything brighter than 17 (like 16, 15, etc.) is okay for ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can handle up to 16 mag. So for a star to be detectable by both, it must have a V magnitude that's ≤16, because HIRES can't go beyond that. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES can't. So the star needs to be bright enough for HIRES, which is V ≤16, because if it's brighter than that (like 15), both can see it.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says: with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, if a star is brighter than 17, meaning V ≤17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16, so V ≤16. So, a star must have V ≤16 to be seen by both. So, which stars have V magnitudes ≤16?

Looking at the stars:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. Oh, but we need apparent V mag, not absolute. So, I need to calculate the apparent magnitude.

Apparent magnitude m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. So M is 15.5, d =10.
