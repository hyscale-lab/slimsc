Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments and why some peaks disappear when using a different fixation method. Hmm, I remember that ChIP-seq is used to find where transcription factors bind on the DNA. The question mentions using PFA fixation and then PFA+DSG. I think PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a crosslinker. It makes the proteins stick to the DNA they're bound to. DSG is something else... Oh right, DSG is a detergent, but wait, no, I think DSG is Dithiothreitol, which is a reducing agent. But wait, in the context of fixation, maybe it's used for something else.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So normally, during fixation for ChIP, you treat the cells with a crosslinking agent like formaldehyde. This cross-links proteins to DNA, preserving their binding locations. But sometimes, especially for certain experiments, people use different methods. I remember that PFA is often used because it's a better crosslinker for certain proteins, maybe those that are harder to fix. So in this case, the initial experiment used PFA-fixed samples. Then, when they used PFA + DSG, the ChIP peaks disappeared. So why would that happen?

I think DSG is used in some protocols to disrupt disulfide bonds. Oh wait, wait. DSG is a reducing agent, so it breaks disulfide bonds in proteins. So maybe when you use PFA (which crosslinks via protein-DNA and other protein-protein interactions) and then use
