Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

The first part of the question is a reaction where butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and some reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is methyl propanone, right? So it's (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide source like NaCN, I think this is a nucleophilic addition. Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic, and the cyanide ion can attack.

So in the first reaction, it's probably a ketone undergoing addition with HCN (but in this case, NaCN in acidic conditions). Wait, but wait, when ketones react with CN- in acid, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. The product is a cyanohydrin. But the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So yes, that's a cyanohydrin formation. So the reagent A must be something that provides the acidic conditions, like H3O+ (which is sulfuric acid, for example) because the reaction is acid-catalyzed.

So A is H3O+. Looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. The options A and B have H3O+ for A, others have NaHSO3. So probably A is H3O+.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, the nitrile group is converting into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

The usual way to convert nitriles to carboxylic acids is hydrolysis. But under what conditions? Nitriles can hydrolyze in acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, using HCl and heat, or maybe H3O+ with some catalyst.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group (the cyanohydrin from the first step). So when it's treated with water
