Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization. Let me think about what I know.

Regularization is a process used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math blow up. So without regularization, the theories might not make sense or give infinite results. But some theories might not need it, maybe because they don't have those divergences in the first place or handle them another way.

Looking at the options:

A) Superstring Theory. I know that string theory is a theory of quantum gravity, and it's supposed to be a candidate for a theory that unites all forces. Strings are tiny, so their theory might have different behavior at high energies. Wait, but I remember that string theories require certain conditions, like specific forms of compactification. But do they have divergences? I think they might still have divergences that need handling, but perhaps through other mechanisms like the string tension or maybe because they're background-dependent. Or maybe not. I'm not too sure about this.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Quantum Electrodynamics but with SU(3) symmetry. I know that QCD has issues with things like Landau poles—problems where the coupling constant becomes infinite at high energies. Wait, but wait, in reality, QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak. So perturbative methods work better there. But do they still require regularization? I think in practice, when doing calculations, you might still need to regularize because of loop divergences. But maybe because it's non-abelian, it's renormalizable, so you can absorb the divergences. But do you still need to regularize? Hmm, perhaps yes, because even renormalizable theories need a way to handle infinities before renormalization.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a renormalizable theory. But even though it's renormalizable, when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergent integrals. So you need regularization techniques like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc., to handle those infinities before renormalizing. So QED definitely requires regularization.

D) Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, right! Classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones because they don't involve the same infinities. In classical electromagnetism, you don't have renormalization problems because you're not dealing with quantum fluctuations or virtual particles. So when you compute things, like the fields of a charge, you might get infinities, but those are handled by considering the charge as a point charge with a small structure—like a sphere with radius, beyond which the field is considered. But in the classical treatment, you don't use regularization in the same way as in quantum field theories. So classical electrodynamics doesn't require regularization in the same sense as the quantum theories. 

Wait, but wait. The question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So if the theory is classical, like option
