Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS problem to solve. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR of a crude compound shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Wait, so each peak is about half the integral. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Oh, right, because if it was coupling, you'd expect each peak to split into multiple lines, but since the coupling pattern is ruled out, it's not that.

Then, the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. So the mass is consistent, which suggests it's not a fragment or something else. Both have the same mass, so maybe they're isomers? Or maybe they're enantiomers or diastereomers. Because enantiomers would have the same mass but might not be separated by LC if the column isn't chiral. Wait, but the LC-MS shows two peaks, so the LC must be separating them. So the peaks are actually two different compounds because the same enantiomers wouldn't separate on a regular LC; you need a chiral column for that. So unless it's a chiral column, but the question says the LC-MS at elevated temperature shows two peaks. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says the MS has the same mass. So if they're enantiomers, the mass would be the same, but on a regular LC, they might not separate. But since the
