Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, same number of neutrons and protonsâ€”so that must mean that the gas is something like Argon-40, but wait, that's Ar, atomic number 18, so protons are 18 and neutrons would be 22 in the most common isotope. Hmm, wait, no, because that's not same. Oh, wait, maybe it's a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. Or perhaps the molecule as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, the problem says the gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So for a molecule like O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the common isotope. So O2 would have (8+8) * 2 = 32 protons and 32 neutrons. Wait, but the molecule's total would be 32 protons and 32 neutrons. Because each O has 8 p and 8 n. So O2 would have 16 p and 16 n? No, wait, O has 8 p and 8 n per atom. So O2 has 2
