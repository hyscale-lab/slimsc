Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's about.

The problem describes a reaction involving a substance X. It says that X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. When a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

Hmm. So I think I'll need to figure out what each of these substances might be. Let's break it down.

First, the reaction: X + Y â†’ W, G. Then G upon heating gives B. Let's think about possible reactions that fit this scenario.

The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. So, the total number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Let's think about possible gases. CO2? No, carbon is 12 (6p, 6n), O is 8 (8p, 8n?), but wait, CO2 would have C=12 (6p,6n), O=8 each. So each CO2 molecule would have 6 p and 16 n? No, because each O has 8n, so two O would be 16n. So total protons: 6 (C) + 16 (O) = 22? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, each O atom contributes 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So CO2 has 1 C (6p,6n) and 2 O (8p each, 8n each). So total protons per molecule: 6 + 8*2 = 6+16=22. Neutrons: 6 +8*2= 6+16=22. Oh wait, that would make 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So W could be CO2? Because that way, the molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons (22 each). Wait, CO2's molecular formula is CO2, so each molecule has 6+16=22 protons, and 6+16=22 neutrons. So yes, that fits the description.

So gas W is probably CO2. That would mean the reaction produces CO2 gas. So what reaction produces CO2 when X reacts with Y?

Another clue: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is perhaps a compound where one element is replaced by a heavier isotope. Maybe like how Cl can be 35Cl or 37Cl. But let's see.

Then, the precipitate G when heated gives B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Let's think about common substances. 277 K is about
