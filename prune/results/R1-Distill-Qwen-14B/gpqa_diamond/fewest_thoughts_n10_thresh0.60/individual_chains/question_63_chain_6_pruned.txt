Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, diatomic means it's two atoms bonded together, like X and Y. The question is about the rotation-vibration model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that the rigid rotor model assumes the bond doesn't change length, but the non-rigid one allows for some vibration too.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. They want to know what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between these two states.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So I guess the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. Oh right, quantum mechanically, the energy levels are quantized both for rotation and vibration.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B * J*(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And for vibration, the energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (n + 1/2) * h * ω, where n is the vibrational quantum number.

But since it's a non-rigid rotor, maybe the model includes both rotation and vibration. Or perhaps the energy is a combination. Alternatively, the problem is about the transition when a photon is absorbed, so maybe it's about the vibrational energy change.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the current state is the fundamental, which I think is the lowest vibrational state, n=0. The next state would be n=1. So the photon's energy must match the vibrational energy difference.

Wait, but the question is about momentum, not energy. Oh, right, because photons have momentum p = E/c, and the energy E is hν, which is also hω, since angular frequency ω is related to ν by ω = 2πν.

Wait, the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is ΔE = (n + 1/2)hω - (0 + 1/2)hω = hω. So the photon's energy should be hω. But the photon's momentum p is equal to E/c, because for photons, E = pc. So p = E/c = (hω)/c.

Wait, but let me double-check. The energy of a
