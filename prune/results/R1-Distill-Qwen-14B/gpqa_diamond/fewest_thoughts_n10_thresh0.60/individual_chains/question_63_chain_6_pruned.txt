Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we're supposed to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, first, I think I need to understand what the fundamental state is. From what I remember, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state of the molecule, which is the first vibrational state (v=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0). But wait, when the molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh right, the next state would be the next higher energy state, which could involve either a change in vibrational or rotational energy, whichever is lower in energy.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which probably means it's considering both rotational and vibrational energies. So the energy levels are a combination of both.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized and given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But since this is a non-rigid rotor, the bond length might change, so the rotational energy would also depend on vibrational changes. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that affects the calculation directly.

Wait, the problem mentions the angular frequency of vibration (w). So the vibrational energy levels are quantized as E
