Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ℏ/2. Hmm, wait, I think I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P are often related to angular momentum or maybe spin.

Wait, the operator is given as P, which I think is similar to spin operators. Oh right, for a spin-½ particle, the Pauli matrices are used, and the spin operator S is given by S = (ℏ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So in this problem, P probably represents the spin operator along some direction.

The problem gives the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. Let me write down each component:

Px is (ℏ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix.
Py is (ℏ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by -i? Wait, no. The standard Pauli Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so Py is indeed (ℏ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix.

Pz is (ℏ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix. So yeah, these are the spin matrices for a spin-½ particle.

The operator we're interested in is along a direction n in the x-z plane. So n has components (x, 0, z), since it's in the x-z plane. The general direction can be described by an angle θ from the z-axis, I think. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle. Wait no, usually θ is measured from the z-axis. So, the components might be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since φ is zero because it's in x-z plane, φ=0. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Or wait, sometimes people use θ as the angle from the x
