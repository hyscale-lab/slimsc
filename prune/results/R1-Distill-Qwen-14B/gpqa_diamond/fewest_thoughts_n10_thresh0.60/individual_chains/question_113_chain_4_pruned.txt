Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me jot down what I know and think through each part. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. The options are four different formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygens.

First, looking at the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests there's an O-H group present. O-H stretches usually show up in that region. But wait, the peak is very broad, which makes me think it's an alcohol because alcohols have broad O-H stretches. Alternatively, maybe a carboxylic acid, but those are usually even broader and maybe a bit lower? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but let's note that there's an O-H group.

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But why another peak at 1650? That might be a conjugated carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with some conjugation. Wait, another possibility: maybe an ester or a ketone with some adjacent group. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring with C=C stretching. Also, the 1700 is strong, so maybe it's a carbonyl like a ketone, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But I thought the broad peak was more likely an alcohol, not a carboxylic acid. So, maybe an ester?

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. That suggests maybe a structure with both a carbonyl and an alkene.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for certain functional groups. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) has a mass of 91, but wait, that's not it. Oh, wait, 4
