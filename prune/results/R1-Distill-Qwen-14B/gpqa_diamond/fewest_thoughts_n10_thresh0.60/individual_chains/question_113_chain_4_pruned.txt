Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of either an -OH group or maybe an amine, but I don't see any info pointing towards amines, so probably -OH. The broad peak is typical for O-H stretching in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids, but wait, there are other peaks too. There's a strong absorption at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 peak usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak could be an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or amide. Hmm.

Wait, if there's a broad peak and a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester. Because esters have both a carbonyl (around 1700) and an O-H (from the ester's R-O-R group, but wait, no, esters don't have O-H groups. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe a ketone and an alcohol? But the broad peak is likely O-H, which could be from an alcohol. Or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H peak around 2500-3300, which usually is a broad, sometimes split into two, but the given peak is at 3000. Also, the 1700 cm^-1 for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is similar to ester or ketone.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an ester with an alcohol group nearby? Or maybe a ketone with an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps an ester with an O-H from something else.

Moving on to the NMR. The 1H NMR has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has an alkene group. Also, since the IR shows a carbonyl, it's likely a carbonyl-containing compound with an alkene, maybe an ester with a double bond nearby.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that m/z 45 corresponds to the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but wait, no, the tropylium is m/z 91. Wait, 45 is a smaller fragment. Let me think. Common fragments: for example, the (CH2)2O fragment? Or perhaps a CH3CO+ which is 43, but maybe 45 is maybe CH3COO+ or something else. Alternatively, 45 could be a CH3CH2CO+ group? Wait, molecular weight of 45: CH3COOH is 60, so that's not it. Oh wait, 45 is
