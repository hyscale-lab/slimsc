Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The problem says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. The beam is in the same direction as the glass's movement. So the observer is in the lab, which is presumably stationary relative to the glass when it's not moving.

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula for adding velocities is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But this is when the object is moving at velocity u in the same direction as the observer's frame's velocity v. Oh wait, but light's speed in a medium is different. Because normally, in a medium, the speed of light is c/n, where n is the refractive index.

So in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n, right? Because the speed of light in the medium is v = c/n. Then, when the glass itself is moving, we have to apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be the speed of the light in the glass frame plus the glass's velocity, but using the relativistic addition formula.

So the light's speed in the lab frame,
