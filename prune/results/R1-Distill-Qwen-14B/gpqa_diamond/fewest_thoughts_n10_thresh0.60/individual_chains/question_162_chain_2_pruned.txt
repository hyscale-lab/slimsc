Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that the metric determines the geometry of the space. So, this must be a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. I'm a bit confused about what a pseudosphere is. From what I recall, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a hyperbolic space. Oh wait, maybe it's like a 2D hyperbolic space embedded in 3D, but here we're talking about the metric itself.

So, looking at the metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That looks similar to the form of the metric for a sphere, where the denominator would be (R² - x² - y²), but here it's 4 which is 2². So maybe this is related to a sphere of radius 2, but since the coefficient is positive and the denominator is subtracted, perhaps it's a hyperbolic metric instead.

Wait, in the case of a sphere, the metric would be ds² = (R²/(R² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), but that's for spherical coordinates. Alternatively, for a pseudosphere, the metric is usually written in terms of a Poincaré disk model, where the metric has a term like (
