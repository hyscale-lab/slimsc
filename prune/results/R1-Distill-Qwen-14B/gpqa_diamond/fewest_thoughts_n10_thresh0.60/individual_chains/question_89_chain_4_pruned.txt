Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-shaped molecule. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in this structure.

The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction. When dibromides react with strong bases, they often undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Since there are two bromines on adjacent carbons (1 and 3 positions), eliminating both would form an alkene. But wait, adamantane has a pretty rigid structure, so the elimination would lead to a double bond somewhere.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. I think when alkenes form from elimination, sometimes they can isomerize. Also, the product after KOH might be an epoxide, but no, KOH isn't typically used for that. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form an allene? Or perhaps a diene? Hmm, not sure yet.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: the 1H NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a triplet. That could be from an ether group, maybe an epoxide, but wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. IR peaks around 1700 are usually carbonyl groups. So maybe a ketone? Or an ester. But in this case, since it's KOH, perhaps an elimination to form a ketone?

Wait, if we have a dihalide reacting with a strong base, another possibility is that it's a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but how? Oh, maybe it's undergoing a Dieckmann elimination or something similar? No, Dieckmann is for cyclic esters. Wait, or perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation leading to a conjugated diene? But then where would the carbonyl come from?

Wait, maybe the starting material isn't just an alkane but a dihalide that can form a ketone upon elimination. Oh, wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so if
