Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy. But let's try to work through it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and ending up with product 3. Then, we need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Let me break down the problem:

1. **First Reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**
   - The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with KOH (a strong base) likely leads to an elimination reaction, maybe an E2 mechanism. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (assuming the structure is such), the elimination would form an alkene. Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of adamantane. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, each carbon is connected to three others. So, when KOH is added, elimination would happen between the two adjacent Br atoms. Wait, but 1 and 3 positions—are they adjacent? Let me visualize adamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected in a way similar to a diamond. The positions 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps another approach. KOH in high heat probably causes dehydrohalogenation. Since it's dibromide, elimination would form a double bond. So, the product would be a diene or an alkene. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. That makes me think it's perhaps an epoxide or something else. Alternatively, elimination would form a cycloalkane. Wait, no, elimination of two bromides from adjacent positions would form a double bond. But adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so perhaps the elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but bridgehead alkenes are possible, maybe. Or perhaps the elimination forms an alkene elsewhere.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a strong peak at 172
