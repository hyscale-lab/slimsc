Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy here.

Alternatively, perhaps for each state, the energy uncertainty is given by ΔE = ħ / τ. So for the two states, their energy uncertainties are ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

Wait, but the problem is about the difference between E1 and E2. So the minimum energy difference that can be resolved would be when the difference is much larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, or perhaps the sum. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the two lines (if they were spectral lines) could overlap.

Wait, think about resolving two peaks in a spectrum. The width of each peak is determined by their lifetimes. The minimum separation between the peaks should be such that the peaks don't overlap. So the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their half-widths, perhaps? Or maybe the full widths. But the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is usually proportional to the uncertainty, so yeah.

Wait, the FWHM is about 2.35 times the standard deviation (which is the uncertainty). So, if each state has an energy uncertainty of ΔE1 and ΔE2, the FWHM for each would be around 2.35ΔE1 and 2.35ΔE2. To not have the peaks overlap, the separation between E1 and E2 should be greater than the sum of their FWHMs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to think in terms of the uncertainty principle.

So let me compute ΔE for each state.

Given τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1.

Similarly, τ2 = 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

Since ħ is about 1.05e-34 J·s, let's compute the values.

First, converting to eV because the options are in eV. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So:

ΔE1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J.
Convert to eV: 1.05e-25 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.55e-7 eV. So approximately 6.5e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = (1.05e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.55e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, τ2 is longer than τ1, so ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1. Because lifetime and energy uncertainty are inversely related. So, longer lifetime means smaller energy uncertainty.

So E2 has a smaller uncertainty than E1. So when we consider the energy difference between E1 and E2, which I'll call ΔE = |E2 - E1|, to resolve them, ΔE must be larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. Or perhaps the sum?

Wait, no. Because the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1, so the measurement of E1 can vary within ±ΔE1. Similarly for E2, ±ΔE2. So for E1 and E2 to be distinguishable, the separation between them must be at least the sum of their uncertainties.

Wait, suppose E1 is known with uncertainty ΔE1, and E2 is known with uncertainty ΔE2. The distance between E1 and E2 must be more than ΔE1 + ΔE2 for them to be distinguishable.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if E2 - E1 is less than ΔE1 + ΔE2, the two energy levels could overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.

So let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2.

ΔE1 ≈ 6.5e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 6.5e-8 eV.

Adding them together: 6.5e-7 + 6.5e-8 = 7.15e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than about 7e-7 eV. Now we look at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → way too small.

B)1e-11 → even smaller.

C)1e-4 → 0.0001 eV. That's larger than 7e-7. So that's possible.

D)1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV. Also, 1e-8 is 0.01e-7, which is smaller than 7e-7.

Wait, wait. 7e-7 eV is 0.0000007 eV. Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's much larger, so it's well above the sum, so it's resolvable. Option D is 1e-8, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7 eV. So option D would not satisfy the condition.

But wait, what if the question is considering the uncertainty of the measurement? Let's think again.

Wait, the uncertainty principle gives a lower limit on the product of ΔE and Δt, but in practice, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than each individual ΔE.

Wait, but in that case, the energy difference must be larger than the larger ΔE. Because if it's larger than the larger uncertainty, it would automatically be larger than the smaller one.

So the larger ΔE is ΔE1, which is about 6.5e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV or 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001. That's much larger than 6.5e-7, which is 0.00000065.

So option C's energy difference would be clearly resolvable.

Option D is 1e-8, which is 0.00000001 eV. That's way smaller than 6.5e-7, so the energy difference isn't enough. So option D is too small.

So the correct option is C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, \( \Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \hbar \). Here, the lifetimes of the states, \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), correspond to the time uncertainties \( \Delta t_1 \) and \( \Delta t_2 \). The energy uncertainties are given by:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \approx 6.55 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \approx 6.55 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.55 \times 10^{-7} + 6.55 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much smaller than \( 7.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is also insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it satisfies the condition.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
