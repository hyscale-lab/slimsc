Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Not sure.

Wait, let me think. When you have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainty in their energies is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. To resolve them, the energy difference |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the peaks might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

Alternatively, sometimes I've heard that the energy difference should be much larger than the uncertainty of either state. Hmm, perhaps it's sufficient that the energy difference is larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me do the math. Let's compute the uncertainties for each state.

First, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1.

What's the value of ħ in eV·s? I remember that 1 eV is 1.6e-19 Joules. And ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. So plugging in τ1:

ΔE1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV. Now, the energy difference between the two states must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties to be resolvable.

Sum of uncertainties: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = approximately 7.238e-7 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → that's way smaller than 7e-7, so no.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller, so no.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → that's way bigger than 7e-7. So that would work.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → which is about the same size as ΔE2, which is about 6.58e-8 eV. So 1e-8 is close but perhaps not enough. Because the sum is about 7e-7, and 1e-8 is 0.01e-7, which is much smaller than the sum.

Wait, wait, I might have made a mistake in the sum. Let me compute it more accurately.

ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So sum is 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 6.582e-7 + 0.6582e-7 = 7.2402e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than about 7.24e-7 eV to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 * 1e6 meV = 100 meV. Wait, no, wait 1e-4 eV is 100 milli-eV? Wait, no, 1e-3 is milli, so 1e-4 is 0.1 milli-eV, or 100 micro-eV. Either way, 1e-4 eV is way bigger than 7.24e-7 eV.

So option C has a much larger energy difference, which would be resolvable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. That's about 1.5 times smaller than ΔE1. Because 1e-8 is about 0.15 times 6.58e-7 (since 6.58e-7 is roughly 6.58e-7 ≈ 6.58 * 1e-7 → 1e-8 is 0.15 times that). So 1e-8 eV is much less than the sum of the uncertainties, hence the energy difference is not enough to resolve them.

Wait, but wait another thought: perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the individual uncertainty of each state? Hmm, because each state's energy has an uncertainty, their separation must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think: the two energy levels each have their own uncertainties. If the energy difference between them is larger than the sum of their uncertainties, then they won't overlap. So the required condition is that |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

If that's the case, then the minimum required ΔE is around 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is larger than that.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 7.24e-7 is 0.000000724 eV. So 1e-4 is much larger than that. So option C is suitable.

But wait, the options have option D at 1e-8 eV. Which is about 1.5e-8, which is smaller than the sum of the uncertainties (7.2e-7), so not enough.

So the correct answer must be option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle. The principle states that the product of the energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E \)) and the time uncertainty (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar \) (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)).

The lifetimes of the two states are given as \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainties for each state are calculated as:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
|E_2 - E_1| > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} = 7.2402 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is even smaller than Option A and also insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it satisfies the condition.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the correct energy difference that allows the two states to be clearly resolved is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
