Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about eigenvectors. Hmm, let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, but the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

So first, I think the operator P isn't just one of the components, but a combination of them in the direction n. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction is arbitrary, but it's along some angle theta from the x-axis, maybe. So the operator P would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But wait, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the y-component of n is zero. Oh, right, because any direction in the x-z plane would have n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. So n_y is zero. So P reduces to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so general direction. So the operator P would be n · vec(P) = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so we're looking for the eigenvector |ψ> such
