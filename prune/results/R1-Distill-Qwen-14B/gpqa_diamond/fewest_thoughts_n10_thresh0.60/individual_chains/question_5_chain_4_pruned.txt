Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says that the operator is P, and it's given in terms of its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The question is about finding the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 when the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, so the operator is a vector operator, right? So the operator P is a vector made up of P_x, P_y, and P_z. Since we're looking along a direction n in the x-z plane, the direction is arbitrary but in that plane. So I think that the operator we need to consider is the component of P along n. Or maybe it's the expectation value along n. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the spin operator along an arbitrary direction.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin operator along a direction n is given by S·n, which is the dot product of the spin vector and the direction vector. So for the Pauli matrices, the spin operator along n is (n_x S_x + n_y S_y + n_z S_z). But here, the operator is called P, and it's similar to spin. So perhaps P is analogous to spin, and the components P_x, P_y, P_z are related to the Pauli matrices.

Wait, looking at the given matrices, let me write them out:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the same as (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is (ħ/2) σ_y.

P_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]], so that's (ħ/2) σ_z.

So the operator P is essentially (ħ/2) times the Pauli vector. So the operator along direction n would be P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, its
