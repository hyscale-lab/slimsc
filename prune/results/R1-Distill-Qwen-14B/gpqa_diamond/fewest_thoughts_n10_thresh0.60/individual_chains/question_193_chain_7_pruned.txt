Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, like, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Hmm, that's an interesting relationship. I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth as we orbit the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance d is approximately equal to 1 over the parallax plx in parsecs. So d ≈ 1/(plx) when plx is measured in arcseconds. Oh right, wait, actually the formula is d (in parsecs) = 1 / plx (in arcseconds). So plx is inversely proportional to distance. So when distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So we're looking for N as a function of distance r. But wait, the given relation is N proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So let's write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx is 1/d (because plx = 1/d in parsecs, I think?), substituting that into the equation would help. So plx = 1/d, so plx^5 would be (1/d)^5. So 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5.

Wait, let me check: 1/(plx)^5 equals (1/(plx))^5, but plx is 1/d, so 1/(plx) is d. So (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5, right? So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

But wait, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance r. Hmm. Oh, maybe they're asking about the differential, like the change in N when you move a small distance dr. So perhaps we need to find dN/dr.

Because sometimes when we talk about "how a quantity changes with distance", especially in terms of density or counts per unit volume, it's the derivative that matters.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then N = k d^5. Taking the derivative of N with respect to d would give dN/dd =
