Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, alright.

The spin state given is (3i, 4). Wait, wait, I think I should write that as a column vector, right? So the state vector χ is [3i, 4]^T. That makes sense because spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors in a two-level system.

Now, the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula: <S_y> = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Oh wait, right, S_y is the spin operator along the y-axis. The σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and since for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y. So I should remember that factor of ħ/2.

So first, let's write down σ_y. It's a 2x2 matrix:
σ_y = [ [0, -i],
         [i, 0] ]

And S_y would be (ħ/2) times that. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

To find the expectation value, I need to compute χ† S_y χ. Let me make sure I'm getting this right. The expectation value is the conjugate transpose of χ multiplied by S_y multiplied by χ.

Let me break it down.
