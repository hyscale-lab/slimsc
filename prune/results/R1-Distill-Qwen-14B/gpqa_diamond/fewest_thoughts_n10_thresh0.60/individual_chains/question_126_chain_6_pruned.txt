Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that an organic chemist performs two reactions. Reaction I is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH followed by acidic workup. Reaction II is treating pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4 and acidic workup. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral. The question is how many peaks will the chemist observe in each.

Hmm, I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but wait, what about when there are other functional groups? Oh, right, LAH is a strong enough reducing agent that it can also reduce esters, but in this case, Reaction I has (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure is a ketone, and there's a methoxy group attached at the 5th carbon. So when we reduce the ketone, that should become a secondary alcohol.

So let's think about Reaction I. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral center at C3? No, wait, the structure. Hexan-3-one means the carbonyl is on C3. The structure would be CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, actually, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a methoxy group on the fifth carbon. So the structure is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. So when you reduce the ketone with LAH, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CH-OH group. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, wait. Let me draw it out in my mind. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Structure: CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3
