Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm kinda new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants are about how stable a complex is. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So, the higher the beta, the more the complex tends to form.

Wait, but what's a dithiocyanato complex? Oh right, that's a complex with two SCN- ligands. So the blue one is probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ complex. But wait, what's the charge? Cobalt(II) is Co^2+. Each SCN- is -1. So two SCN- would make it [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^2-? No, wait, SCN- is a ligand, so each contributes -1. So Co^2+ plus two SCN- would be Co(SCN)_2^(0), because 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The problem is about the percentage of this particular complex relative to all cobalt species. So I think I need to calculate the fraction of Co that's in the [Co(SCN)_2] form.

But wait, the complexes can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 SCN- ligands. The stability constants are given as beta1 to beta4, which probably correspond to the complexes with 1, 2, 3, 4 SCN- respectively. So beta1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, beta2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, beta3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- ?, and beta4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Wait, let
