Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the constant, the more the complex will form. 

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species. The blue one is probably the Co(SCN)_2^+ complex, I think. So the dithiocyanato means two SCN- ions attached.

The given data is: Co(II) concentration is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the order. Stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands, but here β4 is 16 which is lower than β3. So maybe the complexes are Co(SCN)n^m+ with n=1,2,3,4? And each β represents the formation from the previous step.

Wait, no, stability constants are for the formation of each successive complex. So β1 is for CoSCN^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)2]^+, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^ something, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^ something else. So each subsequent β is the constant for adding another ligand.

The problem is to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^+ (the dithiocyanato complex) relative to all possible cobalt species.

I think I need to use the stability constants to find the distribution of each complex. The general approach is to calculate the formation of each complex step by step, using the β values and the concentrations of SCN-.

First, I should determine the formation of each complex starting from the simplest. The overall reaction for each step is:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+ (β1 =9)
[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^+ (β2=40)
[Co(SCN)_2]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_3]^ (β3=63)
[Co(SCN)_3]^ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_4]^ (β4=16)

Wait, the
