Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A. They represent Ay as a 2x2 matrix, and it's given by Ay = c·S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Oh right, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. So I need to solve this matrix equation.

First, let's write down the matrix S. S is:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

So Ay is c multiplied by this. So Ay = cS = (h/(4π)) * S.

So substituting, Ay becomes:

[h/(4π) * 0   h/(4π)*(-i)]
[h/(4π)*i     h/(4π)*0 ]

Which simplifies to:

[0          -i h/(4π)]
[i h/(4π)   0 ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The determinant equation is:

| (-a)      -i h/(4π) |
| i h/(4π)   (-a) | = 0.

Which is (-a)^2 - [ (-i h/(4π))*(i h/(4π)) ] = 0.

Wait, let me compute that. The (1,2) element is -i h/(4π), and the (2,1) is i h/(4π). So when you multiply them for the determinant, the product is (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)).

Let me compute that: (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is (h^2)/(16 π²) * 1.

So the equation becomes a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

Solving for a, a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π) * (1/
