Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let's see what I can remember from my studies. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, Ay. 

Alright, the setup says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and it's given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). So S looks like:

[0  -i]
[i  0]

Wait, and c is h/(4π), so Ay would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by S. So the matrix Ay is:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 , (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i , (h/(4π))*0 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0 , -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), 0 ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. To find eigenvalues, I'll compute the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

The matrix Ay - λ I would be:

[ -λ , -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π))*(i h/(4π)) ) ] = λ² - [ (-i)(i) (h²/(16 π²)) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is equal to -i², right? Because i times i is -1, so (-i)(i) is - (i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term is [ (1) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) ].

So the determinant equation becomes λ² - (h²/(16 π²))= 0. 

Solving this, λ² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π). 

Wait, but looking at the options, the eigenvalues mentioned in the options don't match exactly. Let me check the options again.

Option A: Imaginary part are ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Wait that doesn't make sense because our eigenvalues are real? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, our eigenvalues are real because the matrix Ay has real entries? Wait, no. Wait, the matrix Ay has complex entries because it's S multiplied by a real constant. Wait, no, let me see. The matrix S has imaginary entries, but when multiplied by c, which is real, the entries are still imaginary. So the matrix Ay has purely imaginary entries except for the diagonal, which is zero. So the matrix is anti-hermitian perhaps.

Wait, but the determinant equation I did earlier says the eigenvalues are real, ± h/(4π). Because the equation was λ² = (
