Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Wait, so first, I need to find the relative speed. Oh right, when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract them normally because that would give a speed faster than light, which isn't possible. So I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(cÂ²)). Right, because classical addition doesn't work at high speeds. So let me plug in the values.

Wait, wait. Are the two velocities both in the same direction? Yes, both are positive x, so the relative speed would be the difference. But which one is v1 and which is v2? Oh, the problem says 2m is moving at 0.6c and 3m at 0.5c. So astronaut 1 is 2m at 0.6c, astronaut 2 is 3m at 0.5c.

Wait, so from astronaut 2's frame, what's the speed of astronaut 1? Or from
