Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state given is a Schrödinger cat state, right? The state is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian states, so when you mix them with certain coefficients, you get a non-Gaussian state. That makes sense because the problem is about non-Gaussianity.

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). Oh wait, okay. So when phi is -pi/4, let me compute sin(2phi) first. 2phi would be -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1. And exp(-2alpha²) with alpha=0.5: alpha squared is 0.25, so 2*0.25 is 0.5. exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So N squared is 1 + (-1)*0.6065. Wait, that would be 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

But wait, how does that affect the state? The state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases (alpha and -alpha). The coefficients are cos(-pi/4) and sin(-pi/4). Let me compute those. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, which is about 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, which is approximately -0.7071. So the state is [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |−0.5>]/N. Since N≈0.6275, that's about [0.7071/0.6275]* (|0.5> - |−0.5>).

Now, the non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, but relative entropy between two states is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But in this case, the formula is different. Oh wait, wait, the problem says it's the relative entropy measure, which is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. That's a bit different. So it's the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and another entropy term, but for the Gaussian state tau.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because typically, the relative entropy would involve rho and tau both, like S(rho
