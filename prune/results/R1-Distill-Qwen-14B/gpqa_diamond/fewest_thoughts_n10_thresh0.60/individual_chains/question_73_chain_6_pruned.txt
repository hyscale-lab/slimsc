Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity, which I find a little tricky. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D with different values for both.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should handle the relative speed. Wait, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, you can't just subtract 0.6c and 0.5c to get 0.1c because that would be classical, and at high speeds, you need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Right, the formula for relative velocity u' when you have two velocities u and v is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(cÂ²)). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, I might confuse the order. Let me think. If one object is moving at u relative to another, which is moving at v relative to the observer. So in this case, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be the difference, but with that relativistic factor.

Wait, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5
