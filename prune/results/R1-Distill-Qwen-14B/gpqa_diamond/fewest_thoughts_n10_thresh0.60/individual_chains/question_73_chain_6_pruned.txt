Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me recall that formula. I think it's something like (v1 + v2)/(1 + (v1*v2)/c²). Let me make sure. Yeah, that's right. So the relative speed isn't just 0.6c - 0.5c, which would be 0.1c. Because in special relativity, velocities don't add that way when they're a significant fraction of c.

So the relative velocity between the two astronauts... Let me plug in the numbers. Wait, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? Or wait, which way is the relative velocity? Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, but A is faster than B. So from A's perspective, B is moving backward, right? So the relative speed would be (v_B - v_A) but adjusted with the relativistic formula.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the formula for relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction. Oh, I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)), but I'm getting confused. Wait, no, the general formula is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²) when you're finding the velocity of one frame from another. Let me think again.

So astronaut A is at rest in their frame, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c. So relative to A, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c*0.6c)/(c²)). Wait, that can't be right because 0.5c - 0.6c is negative,
