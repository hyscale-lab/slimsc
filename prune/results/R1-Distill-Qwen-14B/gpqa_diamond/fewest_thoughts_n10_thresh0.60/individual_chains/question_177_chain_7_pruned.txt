Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm.

Alright, the given information: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R₁ = 1.5 R₂. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so M₁ = 1.5 M₂. Interesting, but wait, how does mass relate to luminosity? Oh right, I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh, but wait, do I need to consider the mass here? The problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so maybe mass isn't directly involved in this calculation except perhaps through other properties.

The question mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember Wien's Law, which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. So T₁ = T₂. Because λ₁ = λ₂ implies T₁ = T₂. Got it.

Next, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But wait, how does that affect luminosity? Oh, right, there's the Doppler effect. When a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, which effectively increases the observed temperature. Conversely, if it's moving away, it's redshifted. But wait, does this affect the actual luminosity, or just our perception of it? Because luminosity is intrinsic, not observed. So if the star is moving, the observed wavelength shifts, but the actual radiation from the star is based on its rest frame. So maybe the Doppler effect affects the observed temperature, but the actual emission is based on the star's own temperature. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says that the
