Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and neutrinos are a big part of that. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch suddenly stops, and how that affects the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands.

Let me think about what the pp-III branch does. I recall the proton-proton chain is the main source of the Sun's energy. There are different branches in this chain. The pp-III branch is one of them. Wait, what's the pp-III branch about? Oh right, it involves the fusion of protons where one of them is captured by a positron, leading to the production of neutrons. These neutrons then can fuse with protons to make deuterium, which is a step in the overall process.

Neutrinos are produced in several steps of the proton-proton chain. I think the dominant neutrinos we detect are the electron neutrinos from the decay of boron-8, which comes from the pp-I branch, but the pp-III branch also produces some neutrinos, maybe like the electron antineutrinos or others?

Wait, no, I think the main neutrino emission in the proton-proton chains comes from the decay of beryllium-7 in the pp-I branch. When a beryllium-7 captures a proton, it becomes boron-8, which then decays into lithium-7 and a positron and a neutrino. So that's the main neutrino source.

But the pp-III
