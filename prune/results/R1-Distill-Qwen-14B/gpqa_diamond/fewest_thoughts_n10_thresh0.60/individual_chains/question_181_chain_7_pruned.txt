Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, if the pp-III branch stopped emitting neutrinos, we on Earth would notice a change in the flux after about 8.5 minutes. But wait, the question is asking about the ratio of fluxes in two specific energy bands right now. So the change has already happened, and we're looking at the current flux ratio.

I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the core of the Sun that produce energy. The pp chain has different branches, with the pp-III branch being one of them, I think. Oh right, the pp-I and pp-II branches are part of the proton-proton cycle, and the pp-III branch involves heavier elements. So stopping pp-III would mean that part of the neutrino production is affected.

Wait, what neutrinos are produced by the pp-III branch? I think the pp chain produces electron neutrinos, specifically. The main neutrino emission comes from the reaction where a boron-8 nucleus decays into carbon-8, which emits a neutrino. So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of these neutrinos would stop. But how much does the pp-III
