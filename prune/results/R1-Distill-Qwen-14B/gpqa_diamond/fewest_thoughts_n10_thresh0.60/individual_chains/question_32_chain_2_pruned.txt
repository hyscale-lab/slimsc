Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm... Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh right, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So lithium has a standard number of protons and neutrons. Let me recall: the atomic number of lithium is 3, which means 3 protons. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would be lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So X is lithium-6.

First, I need to find the rest mass of the lithium-6 nucleus because that's essential for calculating relativistic energy. The rest mass energy is given by E=mc². But wait, I don't remember the exact mass of lithium-6. Maybe I can look it up? Oh, no, I have to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the approximate mass using the periodic table. Wait, the mass number is 6. So the atomic mass is about 6 atomic mass units (u). One u is approximately 1.66e-27 kg.

So lithium-6 has a mass of about 6 u. Let me compute that. 6 * 1.66e-27 kg is 9.96e-27 kg. But wait, actually, the exact mass might differ because the binding energy and so on can affect the mass. But for this problem, I think we can approximate the rest mass as 6 u. So let's proceed with that.

Next, the speed is given as 0.96c. That's pretty relativistic, so we'll definitely need to use the relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0c².

Gamma (γ) is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v = 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation: 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

So what's the rest mass energy? m0c
