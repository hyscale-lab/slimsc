Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium atom has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So X is a Li-6 nucleus.

Now, the speed is given as 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle depends on its gamma factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So I need to calculate gamma when v is 0.96c.

Let me write down the formula: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Substituting v = 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². Let me compute that: 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... Approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. The total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is mc². So I need the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, the rest mass energy would be the sum of the masses of each nucleon. Let me compute that.

Each proton is about 938 MeV. So 3 protons = 3 * 938 = 2814 MeV. Each neutron is about 939.565 MeV. So 3 neutrons = 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV. Adding them together: 2814 + 2818.695 = 5632.695 MeV. Wait, but wait a second. Is the mass of the nucleus exactly the sum of the individual nucleons? No, because the mass of the nucleus is slightly less due to the binding energy (mass defect),
