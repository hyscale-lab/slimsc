Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about three different reactions, A, B, and C, and their products. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate; it has two alpha protons, so the enolate can form easily. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, actually, the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-COOR, but in (E) configuration.

In the Michael reaction, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate, which would be the enolate) attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the malonate acts as the donor, and the acrylate is the acceptor.

So the malonate enolate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Let's draw that. The attack would happen on the acrylate's CH2 group. Wait, no, wait. The acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOR? No, wait: the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2=CH–C(p-tolyl)–COOCH3? No, wait, the numbering might be different. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent at the third position. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3
