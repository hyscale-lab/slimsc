Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 is 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. 

Wait, but wait a second. The energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, I think. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be resolvable. Or is it that each state's uncertainty is about the minimum detectable difference? 

Hmm, the idea is that the energy difference ΔE should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart. So we need ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) ? Or maybe just larger than each individually? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, each state has its own uncertainty. So the total uncertainty when considering two states would be the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two? Or maybe the minimum. 

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in the energy measurement. Because when you measure the energy, your measurement's uncertainty is determined by the shortest lifetime, since that gives the largest uncertainty. Or wait, no, the lifetime is the time over which the state exists, so the longer the lifetime, the smaller the uncertainty in energy. 

Wait, because if a state has a longer lifetime (larger τ), then ΔE is smaller, since ΔE = ħ/τ. So for E2, which has a longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty is smaller. But the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps larger than the uncertainty from the state with the shorter lifetime, because that's the bigger uncertainty. 

Wait, perhaps I should think about it this way: The energy levels can be distinguished if their energy separation is much larger than the uncertainty in energy of either state. Because if the separation is larger than the uncertainty, you can measure that they are different. So, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2, because that's the dominant uncertainty.

Alternatively, since E1 and E2 are two different states, their energy difference is just ΔE = |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, this ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty that arises from the system's inability to measure small energy differences. 

Wait, but the uncertainty principle
