Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the question is about an electron in a specific state and calculating some probabilities and an average value of an operator. 

So, the state is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, S_z. Right, and for an electron, the spin-up and spin-down states have eigenvalues of ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

The first part is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. Oh, that operator has a matrix representation A where the elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait, so A is a 2x2 matrix because it's acting on spin-1/2 particles. Let me write this out.

So, for a 2x2 matrix, the elements would be:
A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Hmm, or wait, no, no. The problem says A_ij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. So that would make the diagonal entries zero, and the off-diagonal entries ħ/2. So yes, that's correct. So the operator A corresponds to a spin operator, but wait, it's not the usual Pauli matrices. Wait, the Pauli matrices have A_ij = 1 for i≠j and 0 on the diagonal, but here it's scaled by ħ/2. So the operator is (ħ/2)(σ_x), where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, let me think. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by ħ/2, it becomes A. So operator A is (ħ/2) times σ_x. So that operator is proportional to the spin-x operator.

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, where they have eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So the operator A would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Because A = (ħ/2) σ_x, so the eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(±1) = ± ħ/2.

So the problem is to find the probabilities of measuring the electron in the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, and then find the expectation value (average) of operator A.

But wait, how do I find the probability? Because the state |alpha> is in the z-basis, but the operator A is in the x-basis. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, and then find the coefficients squared.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize operator A and find its eigenstates, then project |alpha> onto them. Hmm.

But wait, before that, I need to make sure I have |alpha> normalized because the question says it's proportional to that vector. Let me compute the normalization factor first.

So, |alpha> = c [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ]

The square of the norm is |c|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2 ].

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So total norm squared is (2 +5) =7. So the normalization factor c is 1/sqrt(7), because |c|^2 *7 =1, so c=1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Now, to find the probability of measuring in each eigenstate of A. Since A is proportional to σ_x, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>. Let me recall what these states are.

The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

The |-x> state is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me check: for σ_x, the eigenstates are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>.

Yes, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, to find the probability that |alpha> is in |+x> state, I need to compute the inner product < +x | alpha >, and then take the squared magnitude.

Let me compute < +x | alpha >.

First, write |alpha> as (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So, < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) < up | +x > + (2 - i) < down | +x > ].

Compute < up | +x > = (1/sqrt(2)),
< down | +x > = (1/sqrt(2)).

So,

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)(1/sqrt(2)) + (2 -i)(1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

= (1/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2))) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ]

Simplify numerator:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i = 3.

So,

< +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (9)/(14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 9/14 as a probability. Let me check.

Wait, the options are A: 0.64, 0.36; B: 0.54, 0.46; C:0.28, 0.72; D: 0.61, 0.29.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is near 0.64 (option A). But let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product.

Wait, < +x | alpha > = (1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Wait, (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i. Correct.

So, yeah, that's 3/(sqrt(14)).

So |amplitude|^2 is (3^2)/(14) =9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

So probability of measuring |+x> is about 64.3%, and the other eigenstate is 35.7% (since 1 - 0.642857 is ~0.357143).

Wait, but option A says 0.64 and 0.36. That's close. Now, looking further, the average value (expectation value) of operator A.

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, that becomes (ħ/2) < alpha | σ_x | alpha >.

Hmm, what is < sigma_x > for the state |alpha>?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since |alpha> is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, we can compute this matrix element.

Let me write the state |alpha> as a vector. Since |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1), then |alpha> is the vector:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, operator A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal. So A is:

[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

Then, to compute <alpha| A |alpha>, which is the same as the expectation value.

So, let me compute it:

<alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, let's compute A multiplied by the state first.

A |alpha> = [ (0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7)), ( (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

So,

A |alpha> = [ (ħ/2)*(2 - i) , (ħ/2)*(1 + i) ] / sqrt(7)

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate of |alpha> dotted with A |alpha>.

So, let's compute the dot product:

( (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ) * [ (ħ/2)(2 -i) , (ħ/2)(1 + i) ] / sqrt(7)

Multiply each component:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) (ħ/2) /7.

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) (ħ/2) /7.

Sum these two and multiply by (ħ/2) /7.

Wait, wait, let me compute each term.

First term:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 = -1)
= 1 -3i.

Second term:

(2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
= 2 + 2i + i + i^2
= 2 +3i -1
= 1 +3i.

So, adding the two terms:

(1 -3i ) + (1 +3i ) = 2.

Multiply by (ħ/2) /7:

(2) * (ħ/2) /7 = ħ/(7).

So, <A> = ħ/7. 

Wait, but looking back, the options for the average are:

A) hbar /7.

Which is what I got. But let me check: is this correct?

Wait, alternative approach: The expectation value of A is (ħ/2) <sigma_x> for the state |alpha>.

So, perhaps compute <sigma_x> for |alpha>.

Sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix:

[[0, 1],
 [1, 0]]

So, <sigma_x> is the expectation value of sigma_x for |alpha>.

Which is:

( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )*(1)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (1+i)/sqrt(7)

Wait, more accurately, it's the sum over the matrix elements:

<sigma_x> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ [0,1], [1,0] ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Which simplifies to:

( (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (1 +i)/sqrt(7)

Because the first term is row 1 dot column 2, and the second term is row 2 dot column 1.

Compute each part:

First part:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2-3i -1 = 1-3i.

Second part:

(2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
= 2 +2i +i + (-1)
= (2-1) + 3i = 1 +3i.

Adding both parts: (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So, <sigma_x> = 2/(7) because each term is divided by sqrt(7)*sqrt(7)=7.

So, <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Then, <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/7.

So that's correct. So the average value is ħ/7, which is option A.

Wait, but the probabilities I computed were approximately 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14 (~0.357). 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which matches option A's 0.64 and 0.36 (since 5/14≈0.357, which is ~0.36). So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average ħ/7. That matches what I have.

But wait, why are the probabilities not exactly 9/14 and 5/14? Because 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. Similarly, 5/14 is ~0.357, which rounds to 0.36.

So the probabilities would be 9/14 ≈ 0.643 and 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

So, the first part of the answer is probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So the correct option would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I have an error in the calculation of the probabilities. Let me recheck.

Wait, the state |alpha> is in the z-basis. The eigenstates of A (which is proportional to sigma_x) are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So, the probability of |alpha> being in |+x> is | < +x | alpha > |^2.

Which I computed as (3/(sqrt(14)))^2 = 9/14.

Wait, but let me compute |alpha> projected onto |+x>:

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, the projection is:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ]

<up|alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7),
<down|alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So,

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) [ 3 ] / sqrt(7)
= 3/(sqrt(14)).

The square is 9/14, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

But wait, 9/14 + 5/14 =14/14=1, which is correct.

So 9/14 ≈0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places, and 5/14≈0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded. So the probabilities are about 0.64 and 0.36, matching option A.

But wait, looking at option A, the average value is ħ/7, which is correct.

So the answer should be option A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7.

Yes, that matches.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the operator A's expectation value is (1/2) ħ times <sigma_x>. Because operator A is (ħ/2) sigma_x? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, because A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j. So, the matrix is:

[ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

Which is exactly (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So yes, operator A is (ħ/2) sigma_x.

Therefore, <A> = (ħ/2) <sigma_x> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/7. Which is correct.

So the correct option is A.


The problem involves an electron in a state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, where |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |alpha>
The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize it, compute the norm:

\[
\| |alpha> \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is \( c = 1/\sqrt{7} \), and the normalized state is:

\[
|alpha> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> \right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of A
The operator A has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \hbar/2 \\
\hbar/2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This corresponds to \( A = (\hbar/2) \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:

\[
|+x> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up> + |down>), \quad |-x> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up> - |down>).
\]

These are the eigenstates of A, corresponding to eigenvalues \( \pm \hbar/2 \).

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring |+x> and |-x>
To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, compute the inner products \( <+x|alpha> \) and \( <-x|alpha> \), then take the squared magnitudes.

#### For |+x>:
\[
 <+x|alpha> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} + (2-i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \right].
\]

Simplify:
\[
 <+x|alpha> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability is:
\[
 P(+x) = \left| <+x|alpha> \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643.
\]

#### For |-x>:
\[
 <-x|alpha> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} - (2-i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \right].
\]

Simplify:
\[
 <-x|alpha> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability is:
\[
 P(-x) = \left| <-x|alpha> \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The expectation value of A is given by:

\[
 \langle A \rangle = \langle alpha | A | alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the matrix representation of A and the state |alpha>, compute:

\[
 \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle alpha | \sigma_x | alpha \rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) for |alpha> is:

\[
 \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{(1+i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:
\[
 \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates |+x> and |-x> are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, respectively. The average value of A is \( \hbar/7 \). These results match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
