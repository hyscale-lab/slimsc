Alright, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's read it carefully.

So, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Hmm, okay. I need to normalize this state first, right? Because the question mentions that the state is proportional, so I guess it's not normalized yet.

Wait, but then the question is about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation Aij where Aij is hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, so what's that matrix look like? Since it's a 2x2 matrix for spin-1/2 particles, probably.

Wait, the standard spin operators are 2x2 matrices. For the Pauli matrices, like sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Let me think: the given operator A has Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and zero otherwise. So in matrix form, that would be:

A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

Because the diagonal elements are zero, and all off-diagonal are hbar/2. Wait, no, wait: if i≠j, then Aij is hbar/2. So the matrix is zero on the diagonal, and hbar/2 elsewhere. So it's a 2x2 matrix where the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are hbar/2, and the rest are zero.

Wait, that matrix looks familiar. Oh, right! The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] is exactly A.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, but scaled by hbar/2. Because if you have an operator proportional to another operator, their eigenstates are the same, just the eigenvalues are scaled.

Wait, but wait: the eigenvalues of the Pauli X matrix are ±1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So the possible measurement outcomes are ±hbar/2.

But wait, the question says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator A. Oh, wait no, the eigenstates are the states in which the operator A has definite values. So if you measure A, you get either +hbar/2 or -hbar/2, with certain probabilities. So the question is, what's the probability of each outcome when measuring A.

Wait, no, the question says, "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator". Oh, I think that refers to the probability of getting each eigenvalue, but perhaps phrased differently. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. So we need to express the given state |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates, and then the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

Wait, but first, I need to normalize |alpha>. Because the state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, multiplied by a normalization constant.

So let's compute the norm of this state. The norm squared is <alpha|alpha> = |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2. Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, which can be written as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, no: the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), right?

So I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probabilities directly. Because the probability of measuring +hbar/2 is the square of the amplitude of |+x> in |alpha>, and similarly for |-x>.

So, let's compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and with |−x>.

First, write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all over sqrt(7).

So, |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Similarly, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Compute < +x | alpha >.

So < +x | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2)] * [1/sqrt(7)] * [ (1 + i) <up|up> + (1 + i) <up|down> + (2 - i) <down|up> + (2 - i) <down|down> ].

Wait, no, better to compute it step by step.

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]

Multiplying, the inner product is (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ].

But <up|up> is 1, <up|down> is 0, and similarly <down|up> is 0, <down|down> is 1.

So this simplifies to (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*1 ].

So (1+i + 2 -i) = (1 +2) + (i -i) =3 + 0i=3. So the inner product is 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, because sqrt(14) is about 3.74, and 3 is less than that, but the probability is the square of the modulus. So (3/sqrt(14))^2 =9/14≈0.6429. That's around 0.64, which is one of the options.

Wait, but let's compute this again because I may have made a miscalculation.

Wait, the inner product is [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i)*1 ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

So (1+i + 2 -i ) = 3. So it's 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14), so the probability is (3/sqrt(14))^2 =9/14 ≈0.6429.

Similarly, compute < -x | alpha >.

|−x> is (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So <−x|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| − <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the expression becomes (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i)*1 − (2 -i)*1 ].

Compute numerator: (1+i) − (2 -i) =1+i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So the amplitude is (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

The probability is |amplitude|^2. So |(-1 +2i)|^2 is (1)^2 + (2)^2=1+4=5. So 5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is about 0.3571. But wait, 9+5=14, so 14/14=1. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which matches closely.

Wait, but let's look at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Option D has 0.61, 0.29 and something else.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, when I calculated < +x | alpha >, I got 3/sqrt(14), which is about 3/3.7417≈0.801. So the square is ≈0.6416, which rounds to 0.64.

The other probability is 5/14≈0.357, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let's check the options. Option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average value hbar/7. So what's the average value?

The average value of operator A would be <alpha| A |alpha>.

Wait, but since A is the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2, the expectation value would be (hbar/2) times the expectation value of Pauli X.

The expectation value of sigma_x for |alpha> is <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

But another approach is to compute the expectation value via the given state.

Alternatively, since the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, the expectation value would be P_plus * (hbar/2) + P_minus * (-hbar/2), where P_plus is the probability of +x and P_minus is that of -x.

Wait, that's correct. Because if you have a state that's a superposition of |+x> and |-x>, then the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities times their respective eigenvalues.

So in this case, <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) )= [ (9 -5)/14 ] (hbar/2) )= (4/14)(hbar/2) )= (2/7)(hbar/2) )= hbar/(7).

So the average value would be hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says average value hbar/7, and probabilities 0.64 and 0.36.

So the answer should be A.

But wait, let me check the other steps.

Wait, another way to compute the expectation value is to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Because A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Sigma_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So let me compute sigma_x |alpha>.

sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so applying that to |alpha> gives [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is the inner product of [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] and [ (2-i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So this is (1+i)(2 -i) /7 + (2 -i)(1+i)/7.

Compute each term:

First term: (1+i)(2 -i) = 2(1) + 1(-i) + i*2 + i*(-i) = 2 -i +2i -i^2 = 2 +i +1 (since i^2=-1). So 3 +i.

Second term: (2 -i)(1 +i) = 2(1) +2 i -i (1) -i^2 = 2 +2i -i +1 =3 +i.

So sum is (3+i +3 +i)/7 = (6 + 2i)/7.

Wait, but wait, no, because each term is (1+i)(2-i) and (2-i)(1+i), which are the same. So each is (3 +i), so sum is 2*(3+i) =6 + 2i.

Wait, so the inner product is (6 +2i)/(7).

Then, <A> = (hbar/2) * (6 +2i)/7.

Wait, but wait, that would be a complex number, but expectation values are real, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, let me compute (1+i)(2 -i):

(1)(2) =2.

(1)(-i) = -i.

i (2) = 2i.

i (-i) = -i² = -(-1) =1.

So total: 2 -i +2i +1 =3 +i.

Similarly, (2 -i)(1+i) = 2*(1) + 2i -i*(1) -i^2.

Which is 2 +2i -i +1 =3 +i.

So both terms are (3+i).

So sum is 3+i +3+i = 6 + 2i.

Wait, but the inner product is (3+i + 3+i)/7 = (6+2i)/7.

Hmm, that's a complex number. But expectation values should be real because the operator is Hermitian.

Ah, I see. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait: sigma_x is Hermitian, so <sigma_x> must be real. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated the inner product.

Wait, the inner product is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )*(2 - i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (1 +i)/sqrt(7).

Wait, no, because sigma_x |alpha> is the vector [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7), (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the inner product is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So each term is the same: (1+i)(2 -i)/7 and (2 -i)(1 +i)/7.

Wait, but (2 -i)(1 +i) is the same as (1+i)(2 -i), so both terms are (3 +i)/7.

So the inner product is 2*(3 +i)/7 = (6 + 2i)/7.

But that's a complex number. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of sigma_x |alpha>.

Wait, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when applied to |alpha>, which is [a, b]^T, where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7), it becomes [b, a]^T.

So sigma_x |alpha> is [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is a* b' + b* a', where a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7), a' is (2 -i)/sqrt(7), b' is (1+i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b' is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Similarly, b* a' is [ (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Wait, wait, no. Let's do it correctly.

Wait, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is the inner product of (a, b) with sigma_x |alpha> which is (b, a).

So it's a* b + b* a, since the vector is (b, a)^T.

Wait, no, wait: (a, b) is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> because |alpha> is a column vector. So when you write <alpha|, it's [a*, b*].

So <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is [ a*, b* ] * [ b, a ]^T.

So it's a* b + b* a.

Wait, that's correct. So:

a = (1 +i)/sqrt(7), a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7), b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i)/(7).

b* a = (2 +i)(1 +i)/(7).

Compute each:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) - i*2 + i^2.

= 2 -i -2i + (-1) = 2 -3i -1 =1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2.

= 2 +2i +i -1 = (2-1) +3i =1 +3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7, and b* a = (1 +3i)/7.

Adding them together: (1-3i +1 +3i)/7 = 2/7.

So <sigma_x> is 2/7.

Thus, <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/(7).

Which matches what I found earlier. So the average value is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state:

The state is proportional to \( | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm of this state is calculated as:

\[
\| | \alpha \rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is equivalent to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right),
\]

with eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of \( A \), we compute the overlap of \( | \alpha \rangle \) with \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). The overlap is given by:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | + \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Expanding this:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} (3) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) is the square of the modulus:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

Similarly, for \( |-x\rangle \):

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | - \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Expanding this:

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} (-1 + 2i).
\]

The probability of measuring \( |-x\rangle \) is:

\[
P(-x) = \left| \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + (2)^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), we compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) for \( | \alpha \rangle \). The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]

The matrix representation of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying \( \sigma_x \) to \( | \alpha \rangle \), we get:

\[
\sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
1+i \\
2-i
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix}
2-i \\
1+i
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The inner product \( \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left( (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) \right).
\]

Expanding:

\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot (-i) - i \cdot 2 + i^2 = 2 - i - 2i - 1 = 1 - 3i,
\]

\[
(2+i)(1+i) = 2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot i + i \cdot 1 + i^2 = 2 + 2i + i - 1 = 1 + 3i.
\]

Adding these:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left( (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) \right) = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).
