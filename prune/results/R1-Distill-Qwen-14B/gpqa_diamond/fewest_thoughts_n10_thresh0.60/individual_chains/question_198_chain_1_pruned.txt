Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. The complexes are probably different in terms of the number of SCN- ions attached. So Co(II) can form complexes like [Co(SCN)]^n-, maybe [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where n varies.

Wait, the problem mentions "dithiocyanato" which I think means two SCN- ions. So the blue complex would be the one with two SCN- ions, maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^ something else. Wait, but the stability constants are given for β1, β2, β3, β4. So each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me think: typically, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 would be for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- perhaps? Wait, I'm a bit confused about the charges.

Wait, Co(II) is Co^2+. Each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^m+, the charge m would be 2+ - n*(-1) )? No, wait, each SCN- is a -1 ligand, so the charge on the complex would be Co^2+ + n*(-1) for each SCN. Wait, no, Co^2+ is +2, each SCN is -1. So for n SCN ligands, the charge is 2+ - n*(1-) )? Wait, no, each SCN- is -
