Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs—ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are visible to both instruments based on their magnitudes and other factors.

Let me start by recalling what I know. Spectrographs have different capabilities. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning anything up to 17 can be seen. HIRES can go down to 16 V mag. So the star's apparent magnitude has to be less than or equal to 16 for HIRES and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO for it to be detectable by both.

Wait, no—the way it's worded is "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, so V magnitude brighter than 17 means m_v < 17. Similarly, for HIRES, m_v <16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent magnitude has to be less than 16 because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Oh wait, brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So a magnitude of 17 is fainter than 16. So if a star is brighter (lower magnitude) than 17, it's acceptable for ESPRESS
