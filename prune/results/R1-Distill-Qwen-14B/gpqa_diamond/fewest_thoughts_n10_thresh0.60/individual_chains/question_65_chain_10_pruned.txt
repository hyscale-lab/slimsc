Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to choose the correct major products from the given options.

Reaction A is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, potassium hydride (KH), and then H+. Reaction B is (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol reacting with acetyl bromide in the presence of a base, which is LDA. The options give possibilities for A and B.

Let me start by breaking down reaction A. The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, in this case, the spiro atom is the alcohol's carbon. So, the structure would look like it has two rings: one 3-membered and one 5-membered? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the spiro notation is [3.5], which means the two rings have 3 and 5 carbons each, right? So the main ring is non-5-en-1-ol, so that's a 9-membered ring? Wait no, wait, the spiro compound. Let me think: the formula is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Oh, wait, non is 9 carbons, but the spiro is [3.5], so the molecule must have two rings connected at one carbon. So, the main structure is a spiro compound with two rings: one with 3 carbons (so a 3-membered ring?) and another with 5 carbons (5-membered). But wait, no, the spiro notation [m.n] refers to the number of carbons in each ring. So the first ring has m+1 carbons? Or wait, no, maybe each ring has m and n carbons, but the spiro atom is the bridge. Hmm, I think the spiro system has two rings connected by a single atom (the bridgehead). So, spiro[3.5]
