Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that a small peptidic compound was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly good, except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks integrate together to 1H, which is normal because it's just one proton. But they have similar shifts and it's not spin-spin coupling because the coupling pattern rules that out. So why are there two peaks for the same proton?

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, matching the expected molecule. Hmm.

So what could cause two peaks in NMR for the same proton? One possibility is that there's some kind of splitting, but the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out. Another thought is that the molecule might have some kind of symmetry or different environments that cause the same proton to split. Or maybe there's a diastereomer or enantiomer present.

Wait, but the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. Same mass suggests same molecular formula, so maybe enantiomers or diastereomers.

Enantiomers would have the same mass and same retention times if the column is not chiral. But since it's LC-MS, maybe under normal conditions, they elute at same time if it's a regular LC column (non-chiral), but if it's a chiral column, they'd separate. But the question says the peaks are clearly defined and equal intensity, same mass. So if the compound is a racemic mixture (enantiomers), the LC might not separate them unless it's a chiral column. But if the LC was run at elevated temperature, perhaps it's not a chiral column, leading to both enantiomers co-eluting. But wait, the question says two peaks, so maybe the LC is a normal column, and perhaps the mixture includes something else.

Alternatively, diastereomers would have different physical properties and would likely separate on a normal LC column, which matches the observation of two peaks. But wait, the mass is the same? Because diastereomers have the same molecular formula but different structures, so same mass. So the same mass would fit.

Now, going back to the NMR. If the compound is a diastereomer, then in NMR, the
