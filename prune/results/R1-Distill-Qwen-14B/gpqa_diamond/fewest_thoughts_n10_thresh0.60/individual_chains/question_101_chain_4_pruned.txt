Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A, producing 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to pick the right reagent (A) and catalyst (B) from the options given.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with a pyrrolidine structure. Pyrrolidine is a saturated five-membered ring with four CH2 groups and one NH. So 3-methyl would have a methyl group on the third carbon. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. That sounds like the pyrrolidine ring is attached to a cyclohexylidene group via a methylene bridge.

Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl... so the structure is probably a bridged bicyclic compound. Or maybe it's a ring expansion or some kind of addition. Maybe the pyrrolidine is undergoing a reaction that forms a new ring.

I remember that acid-catalyzed reactions with amines can involve various mechanisms like alkylation, acylation, or perhaps even some kind of ring-opening or ring-forming reactions.

Looking at the product structure, the substituent on the pyrrolidine is a cyclohexylidene group attached via a methylene. Cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexane ring with a double bond. So it's like a cyclohexene, but attached through a CH2 group. Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be CH2-Cyclohexene? Or maybe it's a cyclohexene substituent with a double bond adjacent to the connecting point.

Wait, wait. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is at position 1 of the pyrrolidine ring. So the substituent is CH2-cyclohexylidene, which suggests that cyclohexylidene is connected via a methylene group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring expansion. Maybe the pyrrolidine is reacting with an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound
