Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated so it can form the complex with calcium. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the calculation directly. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. 

Right, so I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, and when it complexes with a metal ion like Ca²+, it forms a stable complex. The K here is the formation constant, which tells us how much the complex is formed. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, the problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I think this means that [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, we can write the equilibrium expression.

The formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So, K = 5e10. But wait, in the solution, the total concentration of
