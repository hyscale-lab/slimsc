Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions and EDTA. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds to metal ions like calcium. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where it's part of a Ca-EDTA complex.

Alright, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stoichiometric means the molar ratio is 1:1, I think. So each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA^4- complex? Or wait, EDTA usually has four binding sites, but when it complexes with a metal, it's in a 1:1 ratio. So the complex is CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA.

The given K for the complex is 5x10^10. That's the formation constant, right? Formation constants are the equilibrium constants for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−, and K is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Wait, but in this solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So at equilibrium, the concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M? Or wait, no. Because the initial solution is the complex itself, so the initial concentrations would be [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] are zero? No, that can't be right because then there's no way for the complex to dissociate. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So when it dissociates, some of the complex breaks down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the total concentration of all species should add up. Let me think about the dissociation.

Let me write the equilibrium expression. Let's say the complex is formed as:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−

The formation constant K is given as 5x10^10.

But since we're dealing with the dissociation, maybe I should think in terms of the dissociation constant. Wait, the formation constant Kf is [Complex]/([M][L]), where M is the metal ion and L is the ligand. So Kf is 5e10.

But in this problem, we have the complex concentration, and we need to find [Ca²+]. So the setup is: we have 0.02 M of CaEDTA²−. It can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. Then, at equilibrium, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, x will be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02). Similarly, [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4−] = x.

Wait, no, wait. Because EDTA is a polydentate ligand, but in the case of the formation constant,
