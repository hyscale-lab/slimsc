Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when acetic acid is titrated with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I should probably start by understanding what's going on in the problem.

The question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The problem asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll need to calculate both values and match them to the options.

First, I should probably figure out the concentrations after dilution and then determine the moles involved in the titration.

Wait, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial amount of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is 20.00 cm³ * 0.05 M. Since the molarity is moles per liter, and 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, that's 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. So the new concentration is moles/volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But for initial calculations, maybe I need to think about the titration steps.

When titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid as follows: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO-Na+ + H2O. The Na+ is the spectator ion.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals moles of CH3COOH initially present. So let's compute that.

The initial moles of CH3COOH after dilution are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So the moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is also 0.001 moles.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So the volume required at equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. Hmm, so when we reach 10 cm³, that's the equivalence point.

But wait, the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of the way to the equivalence point. Let's compute that.

25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³, we have added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Let's find out how much of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so moles of
