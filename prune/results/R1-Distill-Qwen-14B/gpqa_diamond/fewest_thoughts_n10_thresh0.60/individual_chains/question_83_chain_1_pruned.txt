Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each providing two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react in a neutralization reaction. The equivalence point is where moles of acid equal moles of base.

First, I think I need to find out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that.

0.05 * 20 = 1 mmol. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then, when diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid has moles: M = moles/volume (L), so moles = M * volume (L). 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, we need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let me think about the equivalence point first. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid.

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol (from 0.05 M * 0.02 L). So, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume (L) = moles / concentration. 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration, so 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, for the 25% titration point, we have 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let me calculate moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So each mole of
