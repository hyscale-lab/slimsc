Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the partition function Z for a system of three spins, each being either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Where β is 1/(kT). So each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 each being +1 or -1. Since each spin has two possibilities, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.

But calculating each term individually might take a while. Maybe I can find a smarter way by looking at the energy expression. The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me see, each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. Because S can be +1 or -1, so S_i S_j is +1 if they're the same, -1 if opposite.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take various values. Let me compute what's the possible values of the sum. Let's denote each S_i as either +1 or -1.

Let me think about all possible combinations. Wait, maybe it's easier to find the number of states with a given sum.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the possible values of the sum and how many states correspond to each.

Wait, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me compute this for each possible configuration.

But that seems tedious. Maybe I can find a pattern. Let's see:

Each S_i is ±1. So S_i S_j is 1 if same, else -1.

Let me think about the sum: for three spins, the sum of all pairwise products. So each term is their product.

Wait, let's consider that for three variables, each being ±1, the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3?

Wait, for three spins, how many possible sums are there? Let me think of the possible total values.

Alternatively, maybe the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3. Let me check.

Wait, let's take S1, S2,
