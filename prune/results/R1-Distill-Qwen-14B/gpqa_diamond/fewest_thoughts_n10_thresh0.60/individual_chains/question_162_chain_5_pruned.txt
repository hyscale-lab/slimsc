Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on some of the concepts, but let's try to work through it.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks interesting. So this is in two dimensions, right? Because the differentials are dx and dy. But the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Oh, that makes me think of the equation of a circle. Because x² + y² = r² is a circle. So 4 - x² - y² would be zero when x² + y² equals 4. So that suggests that the metric becomes singular at x² + y² =4. So the points where x²+y²=4 are like the boundaries where the metric blows up. 

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is like a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a specific shape with a cusp, but in higher dimensions, maybe it's more general. Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is that of a pseudosphere.

Wait, but the metric is written in terms of x and y. So maybe it's a 2D space, but the question is about a pseudosphere which is a 2D surface embedded in 3D? Or maybe this is a 2D spacetime. Hmm, but the options talk about area, which is 2D, so probably it's a 2D surface.
