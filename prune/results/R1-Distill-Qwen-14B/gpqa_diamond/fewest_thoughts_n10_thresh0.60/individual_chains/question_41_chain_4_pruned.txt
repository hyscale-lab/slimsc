Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer? The options are A to D.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it. I remember that when you have a medium moving relative to an observer, you have to consider the Doppler effect or maybe the velocity addition formulas from special relativity.

But wait, the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. The speed of light in a medium is usually v = c/n, where c is the vacuum speed of light. Oh, but here the medium (the glass) is moving. So does the medium's motion affect the light's speed as measured in the lab frame?

I think in special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is always c. But wait, that's in a vacuum. What about in a medium? Oh, right, because the medium itself is a material, and its motion could influence the light's speed as measured by the observer. But wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.

In Newtonian mechanics, velocities just add up. So if the
