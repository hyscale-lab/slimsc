Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. It says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the laboratory. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, without any movement, the speed would be 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving. So I need to consider the motion of the glass and how it affects the observed speed of the light.

Wait, this is probably a problem involving the addition of velocities in special relativity, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, it might be a scenario where Galilean transformations apply because the speeds are non-relativistic, but I'm not sure about the exact setup.

Wait, the problem mentions the glass is moving towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v towards them, but the light inside the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light's speed relative to the glass is 1/n, but what about relative to the lab?

I think I should consider how velocities add. In Galilean relativity, velocities add linearly. So if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is
