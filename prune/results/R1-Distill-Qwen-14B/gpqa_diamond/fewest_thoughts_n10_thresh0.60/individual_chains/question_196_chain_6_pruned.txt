Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and spring constant. But since this is relativistic, I guess I need to consider how relativity affects the equations of motion or maybe energy.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, so it's obeying Hooke's law. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, I remember that the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But in relativity, things are different because as speeds approach the speed of light c, the relativistic effects become significant. So I probably can't use the classical formula here.

Relativistic mechanics uses the concept of total energy, which includes rest mass energy. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, energy is quantized, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Maybe it's a classical problem.

Wait, the question is about maximum speed, so maybe I should think about energy conservation. The total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of its rest energy and the kinetic and potential energy. But wait, in the relativistic case, the potential energy and kinetic energy are different from the classical expressions.

Wait, no, the problem says it's a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, which in the relativistic context might not be straightforward. I'm a bit confused here. Oh, wait, maybe in this case, they're assuming that the potential is the same as in classical mechanics, but the kinetic energy is modified by relativity.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy E would be the sum of the potential energy and the rest energy plus the kinetic energy. Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So when the mass is at x=A, all the energy is potential. And when it's at x=0, all the energy is kinetic.

So
