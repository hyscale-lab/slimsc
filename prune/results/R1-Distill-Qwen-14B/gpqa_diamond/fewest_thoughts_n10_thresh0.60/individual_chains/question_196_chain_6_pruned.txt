Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass attached to a spring oscillates. But this question is relativistic, which means I have to consider the effects of special relativity. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through this.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass. The setup is a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. So, it's a spring system, but relativistic.

In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy of a spring is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's the non-relativistic answer, which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so that can't be the right approach.

In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential and kinetic energies still exchange, but they might not sum up to a fixed total if we're considering relativistic speeds. Or do they?

Wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy should still be conserved
