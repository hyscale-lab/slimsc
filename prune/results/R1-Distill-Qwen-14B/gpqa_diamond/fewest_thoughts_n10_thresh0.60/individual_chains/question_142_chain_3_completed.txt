Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And the question is asking about its geometrical position in the qubits space, with options A to D. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (a statistical mixture of pure states).

Wait, what do I know about the structure of a density matrix for a qubit? A qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix should be 2x2. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written in terms of Bloch vector components. Oh right, the Bloch sphere representation! So any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on a unit sphere, right?

The density matrix in Bloch sphere terms is written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). If the state is a pure state, then the vector r has length 1, so it's on the surface of the Bloch sphere. If it's a mixed state, then r has length less than 1, so it's inside the sphere.

Looking at the given ρ: (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to express this in terms of the Bloch vector. Let me compute each term.

First, |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in (1,1). So adding them gives a diagonal matrix with [1,1] on the diagonal. Then multiplied by 1/2, so the diagonal becomes [1/2, 1/2], and the off-diagonal elements are zero. So the density matrix ρ is:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Hmm, this looks like the completely mixed state for a qubit. Because when you have equal probabilities of being in |0⟩ and |1⟩, with no coherence (off-diagonal terms are zero), it's the maximally mixed state.

Wait, the maximally mixed state has a Bloch vector of zero, right? Because r·σ would be zero when all components are zero, so ρ becomes (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which matches our matrix here. So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0), which is the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). That must be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I'm not confusing anything. Another way to think about this: the state is a uniform mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, so it's as far from being a pure state as possible, so it's at the center of the Bloch sphere.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with entries \([1/2, 1/2]\) on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. It represents a completely mixed state for a qubit, where the system has equal probability of being in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), with no coherence (off-diagonal terms are zero). 

In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\vec{r}\) is the Bloch vector and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given density matrix, the Bloch vector \(\vec{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), as there are no off-diagonal terms or components along the Bloch sphere axes. This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere, not the mixed state.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not the mixed state.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this corresponds to the maximally mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere, not the mixed state.  

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix represents the maximally mixed state with \(\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). 

Answer: C
