Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking me to find the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. RHIC collides heavy ions, and in this case, the nucleus X is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium normally has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the mass number as 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

So the first step is probably to find the rest mass of this nucleus. Because in particle physics, when dealing with energies, especially in colliders, we often deal with relativistic energies, so the rest mass is a key factor.

The rest mass energy of a nucleus is calculated based on its atomic mass. The formula for rest energy is E = mcÂ². But to get that, I need to find the mass m of the nucleus.

For a Li-6 nucleus, the mass can be approximated by taking the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, but considering binding energy. Wait, actually, for precise calculations, we can use the atomic mass. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the approximate mass of Li-6.

Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is
