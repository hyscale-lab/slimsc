Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves enolates reacting with alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyls. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. I need to find the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. Wait, NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. In such conditions, I think the base deprotonates the carbonyl compound to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH2(COOEt)2), right? When it reacts with a base like NaOEt, it should form the malonate enolate. The enolate will attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl as a nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, the substituents are at the beta position. The E configuration is important, but maybe the geometry doesn't matter too much for the addition here.

Wait, the Michael donor is the enolate, and the Michael acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So dimethyl malonate will form an enolate which attacks the acceptor's beta carbon. Let me draw it out mentally.

The methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure: CH2=C(CO2Me)(p-tolyl). So when the enolate attacks the beta (the CH2 end), it will form a new bond there.

After the attack, there's a conjugate addition. So the product should be a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So the product would add the malonate part to the acrylate. Let me think about the structure. The malonate is CH2(COOEt)2, so the enolate would be at the central CH, which attacks the CH2 group of the acrylate.

Wait, wait. The acrylate
