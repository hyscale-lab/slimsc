Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments and why some peaks disappear when using a different fixation method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through.

Alright, the question says they did a ChIP-seq on PFA-fixed human B cells using an antibody for IKAROS, a transcription factor. After sequencing, they found peaks, but when they switched to PFA+DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. I need to figure out where these peaks were most likely found initially.

So, first, I should remember what PFA and DSG are used for in ChIP experiments. PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a crosslinker. It fixes proteins to DNA, preserving their interactions. DSG is dithiothreitol, I think, which is a reducing agent. It's used to break disulfide bonds, which might help in crosslinking, maybe making the proteins more accessible for the antibody?

Wait, I've heard that formaldehyde (which PFA is) crosslinks DNA and proteins. So when you use PFA, you're crosslinking the cells, making sure that the transcription factors are attached to the DNA they're binding. But when you add DSG, it might be part of a more thorough crosslinking process, perhaps? Or maybe it's part of a different method like a more stringent fixation.

I remember that sometimes people use different fixation protocols. For example, some use formaldehyde only, others use formaldehyde plus something else. Oh wait, DSG is often used in a method called "formaldehyde + DSG" crosslinking. But how does that affect the ChIP results?

I think that DSG enhances crosslinking by breaking some of the disulfide bonds, which allows the formaldehyde to better penetrate and crosslink proteins to DNA. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, DSG is a reducing agent. It would break disulfide bonds, which might be between proteins. So if proteins are crosslinked together via disulfide bonds, DSG would reduce them, allowing more efficient crosslinking with formaldehyde. So using PFA+DSG leads to more efficient crosslinking.

But wait, the question says that when they used PFA+DSG, the ChIP peaks disappeared. So using a more stringent fixation made the peaks go away. What does that mean?

In ChIP experiments, the efficiency of crosslinking is
