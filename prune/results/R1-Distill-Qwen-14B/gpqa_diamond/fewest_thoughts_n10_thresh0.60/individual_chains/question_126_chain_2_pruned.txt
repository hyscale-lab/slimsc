Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about two reactions involving different compounds and what products they form. Then, we have to determine how many peaks appear when these products are run on two different HPLC columns.

Alright, let's start with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketones. So, the compound here is a ketoneâ€”specifically, a cyclic ketone? Wait, no, hexan-3-one means it's a six-carbon chain with the ketone on carbon 3.

So, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure would be something like CH2CH(OCH3)CH2COCH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think: hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. But the 5-methoxy means the methoxy group is on the 5th carbon. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me number the carbons. Carbon 1: CH3, carbon 2: CH2, carbon 3: CO, carbon 4: CH(OCH3), carbon 5: CH2, carbon 6: CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)2CH3. So, numbering from left to right: 1, 2, 3 (CO), 4, 5, 6.

So, 5-methoxy would be on carbon 5. So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3 ? No, wait. Let me get this right. Hexan-3-one: positions 1,2,3,4,5,6.

3 is the carbonyl. So, position 5 would be the fourth carbon after the carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's better to draw it:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2

Carbon 5: CH2-OCH3 ?

Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait. Maybe the structure is:

(CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So, carbonyl at C3. The substituents are two CH2 groups on the left and three CH2 and then a CH3 on the right.

But in this case, the 5-methoxy is on C5. So, the molecule is:

1: CH3

2: CH2

3: C=O

4: CH2

5: CH(OCH3)

6: CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

The molecule is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think of it as pentyl group on either side of the carbonyl. So, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is (S)-configured at C5, which has a methoxy group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, maybe I should move on and come back.

So, Reaction I: treated with LAH. LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the ketone at C3 will be reduced to an alcohol. So, the product from Reaction I would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no, because the starting material is
