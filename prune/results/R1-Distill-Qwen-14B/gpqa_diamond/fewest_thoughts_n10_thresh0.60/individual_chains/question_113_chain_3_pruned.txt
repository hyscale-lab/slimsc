Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let's go through each piece of data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate O-H stretching. So that suggests the compound has an alcohol group or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch, too. But another peak is at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a strong peak, which makes me think of either a carbonyl group like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is a bit lower than 1700. Could that be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents? Or perhaps it's an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not. Alternatively, a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or a ketone, might have a lower wavenumber than 1700. But wait, the 1700 is another strong peak—maybe it's a carbonyl group like an ester or maybe a ketone. If there's also a peak at 1650, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic compound or an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR: they mention peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has at least one double bond. Maybe it's an alkene or possibly part of a conjugated system.

Then, the Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. That's a crucial piece of information. Let's think about the possible ions that give m/z 45. Common fragments include CH3O+ (31?), but wait, 45 is higher. Maybe a (CH3)2CO+ ion? No, that's 58. Or maybe a fragment with more carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Let
