Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. I'm a bit new to organic chemistry, so I'll take it step by step.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and we need to figure out the major products for each. Then, match them with the options given.

Starting with Reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is reacting with THF, KH, H+. I remember that THF is a common solvent, KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. H+ is probably an acid workup at the end.

The compound given is a spiro compound. Spiro means it has two rings connected by a single atom. The structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro is between an 8-membered ring? Wait, spiro[3.5]non... Wait, non is 9 carbons. So the spiro has two rings: one with 3 carbons (so a 3-membered ring? Like cyclopropane) and another with 5 carbons? No, wait, spiro[m.n] means the two rings share one atom. So for spiro[3.5], that means one ring is 3 carbons (so a 3-membered ring, like cyclopropane) and the other is 5 carbons (cyclopentane). But wait, the main chain is non, which is 9 carbons. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the structure. Alternatively, maybe the spiro is part of a larger structure.

The molecule is 1-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group attached. The hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the vinyl. So maybe the structure is a spiro system where the hydroxyl and vinyl are on the same carbon.

When a spiro compound undergoes some kind of elimination, especially with a strong base like KH (which is a source of H-), it might form an annulene. I recall that when a spiro alcohol is deprotonated and undergoes elimination, it can form a ring. The reaction conditions here are THF, which is a good solvent for such reactions, and then H+
