Alright, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can detect stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can detect stars brighter than 16 mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, it must be brighter than 17 mag, because that's the stricter condition. Wait, no, wait. Wait, because if one can go to 17 and the other to 16, then any star brighter than 17 can be seen by both. But if a star is between 16 and 17, only the one with lower limit (HIRES) can see it. So, for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 mag, but wait, no. Because the question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO. Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Oh, wait, the apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So, for example, a star with V magnitude 16 is brighter than a star with 17. So, if a star is brighter (apparent mag ≤ 16), both can see it? No, wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So, V mag less than or equal to 17. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star's apparent V is 17, it's at the limit for ESPRESSO. If it's 16, that's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, meaning V mag ≤16.

So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16. Because that's within the limits of both. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES only up to 16. So any star that's brighter than 16 can be seen by both.

Wait, let me rephrase. The observable range is:

- ESPRESSO: apparent V ≤ 17
- HIRES: apparent V ≤ 16

So, if a star's apparent V is ≤16, both can see it.

If it's 17, only ESPRESSO can see it.

So the key is to find stars whose apparent V magnitude is ≤16.

Now, let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5, distance is 10 pc.

Apparent V = absolute V + distance modulus. The distance modulus is 5 log10(d) -5. So d=10 pc → modulus is 5*(1) -5=0. So apparent V is 15.5 + 0 =15.5. Which is ≤16, so both can detect.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5, so that's above 16. So only ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.5 <17
