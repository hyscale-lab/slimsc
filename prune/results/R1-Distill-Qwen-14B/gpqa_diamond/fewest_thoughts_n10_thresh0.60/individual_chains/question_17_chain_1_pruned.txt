Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex is Ca-EDTA, and the formation constant K is given. I think K represents the stability of the complex. So, higher K means more stable, right?

The complex is stoichiometric, which means the ratio of Ca to EDTA is 1:1. So when it dissociates, it would release Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- in some proportion.

The formula I think I need is the one for the dissociation of the complex. The formation constant K is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. So the K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M of Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates a little, but probably not much because K is very large (5e10), so the dissociation is minimal. But wait,
