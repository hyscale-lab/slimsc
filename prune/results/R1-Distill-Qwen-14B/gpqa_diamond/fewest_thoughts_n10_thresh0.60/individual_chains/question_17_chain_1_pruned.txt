Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The question says we have a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that the formation constant, Kf, relates the concentration of the complex ion to the concentrations of the ions it's made from. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. Oh wait, I think the complex is actually CaY²−, where Y is EDTA.

The formula for Kf is [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10. So given that, and the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, I need to find [Ca²+].

Wait, but EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, right? So the complex is 1:1. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But I'm being asked about the free calcium concentration.

Since the complex is formed, the total EDTA is the free EDTA plus the EDTA bound in the complex. But wait, in solution, the EDTA exists as H4Y and its various protonated forms. Oh, but the question says the pH is ideal, which I think means that EDTA is fully deprotonated, so it's Y^4-
