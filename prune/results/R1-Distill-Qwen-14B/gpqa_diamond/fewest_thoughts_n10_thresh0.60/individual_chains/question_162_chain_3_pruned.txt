Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that the metric tensor describes the geometry of a space. For a pseudosphere, which is like a hyperbolic space, the metric usually has a specific form. Oh right, in 2D, the metric for hyperbolic space can be written in different coordinate systems. 

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. I think the pseudosphere is a model of hyperbolic geometry. The standard metric for hyperbolic space in the Poincaré disk model is something like ds² = [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. But our given metric is expressed in terms of x and y, so maybe it's in similar coordinates.

Wait, in the given metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Let me think, if I rewrite x² + y² as r², then the denominator becomes (4 - r²). So the metric becomes ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), since dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ² in polar coordinates. 

But wait, 32/(4 - r²) as the coefficient. Let me compare this to
