Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, a metric describes the geometry of spacetime, but I'm a bit rusty on the specifics. Let me think.

The question gives this metric: ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. That probably means it's a 2D surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, maybe like a sphere or some other manifold.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? It's like the hyperbolic equivalent of a sphere. The term 'pseudosphere' makes me think of the tractricoid, which is the surface of revolution of a tractrix.

But wait, what's the area of a pseudosphere? I remember that for a sphere, the surface area is 4πr². But pseudosphere is a bit different because of the negative curvature. Or does the area formula still apply somehow?

Wait, maybe I should look at the metric given. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let's see. Let me try to analyze the metric.

First, I can rewrite it as ds² = [32/(a² - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²), where a² is 4, so a=2. Hmm, that looks kind of like the metric for a sphere
