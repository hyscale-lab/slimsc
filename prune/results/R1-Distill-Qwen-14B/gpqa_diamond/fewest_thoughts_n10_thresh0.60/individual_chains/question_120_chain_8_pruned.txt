Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in all directions without any particular pattern. The main thing the question is asking is how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. 

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth, and it's inversely proportional to the distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away. The formula I recall is plx = 1/distance in parsecs, right? So if plx increases, distance decreases.

Now, the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let me think about how the number of stars depends on distance. If stars are uniformly distributed, their density in space is constant. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume. 

Let me imagine a spherical shell around the Earth. The thickness of this shell would be a small change in distance dr. The volume of this shell would be the surface area of the sphere (4πr²) multiplied by dr. Since the density of stars is uniform (n stars per unit volume), the number of stars in the shell would be n * 4πr² dr.

But wait, how does this relate to parallax? Since plx is 1/r, r is 1/plx. So if I let x be the parallax, then r = 1/x. Let me substitute that into the volume formula. The volume element becomes 4π (1/x)² * dr. Hmm, but I need to express dr in terms of dx, because we're considering a change in parallax.

Wait, parallax x = 1/r. So, if I take a small change in x, dx, then dr would be the derivative of r with respect to x. Since x = 1/r, dr = - (1/x²) dx. The negative sign just indicates that as x increases, r decreases. But since we're dealing with absolute changes, I can ignore the sign for now. So dr = (1/x²) dx.

Putting this back into the volume element. The number of stars in a shell with parallax between x and x+dx is n * 4π (1/x²)² * (1/x² dx). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The shell's volume is 4πr² dr. Substituting r = 1/x, so r² = 1/x². So the volume is 4π (1/x²) dr. But dr is (1/x²) dx, so volume becomes 4π (1/x²) * (1/x²) dx = 4π (1/x^4) dx.

Oh wait, but that's the volume. The number of stars would be density (n) multiplied by this volume. So number of stars per unit x (parallax) is n * 4π (1/x^4) dx. But the question is about the number per unit range of plx, which I think is the number per dx. So the number density of stars as a function of x is proportional to 1/x
