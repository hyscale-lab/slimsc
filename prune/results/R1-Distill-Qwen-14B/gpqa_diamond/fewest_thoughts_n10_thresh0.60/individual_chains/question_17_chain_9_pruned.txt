Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, which probably means that the solution is buffered or the pH doesn't affect the formation of the complex beyond what's given.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the formation constant, K, tells us about the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca²+]) in the solution. Since the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, I'm thinking about how the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions.

Wait, the formation constant (K) is given, and I think it's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The general reaction for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−

And the formation constant K is:

K = [CaEDTA²−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4−])

So the formula rearranges to [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA²−]/(K [EDTA^4−])

But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²−. So [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M.

But what about [EDTA^4−]? Because when the complex dissociates, the EDTA is released as EDTA^4−, but in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms due to its multiple dissociation steps.

Wait, wait, the problem states that the pH is ideal. Oh right, EDTA has multiple protons. At a certain pH, the predominant form is H4Y, but when the pH is high enough, it loses protons and becomes Y^4−. Since the question says pH is ideal, maybe it's considering
