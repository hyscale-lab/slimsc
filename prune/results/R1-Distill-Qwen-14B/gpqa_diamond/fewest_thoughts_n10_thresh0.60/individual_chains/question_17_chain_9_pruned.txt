Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. So the complex is [CaEDTA]^2- or something like that. The pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its correct form to bind Ca²+ effectively, so I don't have to worry about that. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so activity coefficients might be around 1, but maybe I don't need that here.

The key value given is the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Formation constant, right, that's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for the formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). So that's the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in solution. So if the solution has the complex, then the Ca²+ concentration would be very low because EDTA is a strong chelator.

So, the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M. The question is, what's [Ca²+]?

From the formation constant equation:

K = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, EDTA is a polydentate ligand, and in solution, it exists in various protonated forms. But the problem states that the pH is ideal, which I think means that the fraction of EDTA in the Y^4- form is 1. So, [EDTA^4-] is equal to the total EDTA concentration minus the complexed EDTA. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the initial EDTA concentration comes from two sources: the free EDTA and the EDTA bound to Ca²+. The total EDTA (free + bound) is the concentration of the complex (0.02 M) plus any free EDTA. Wait, no. Wait, the complex is made from Ca²+ and EDT
