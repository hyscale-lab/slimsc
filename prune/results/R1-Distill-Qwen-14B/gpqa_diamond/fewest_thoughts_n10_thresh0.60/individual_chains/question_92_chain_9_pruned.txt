Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. It's about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. The formula usually involves bond energies, right?

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down. Let me visualize the structure. It looks like a molecule with multiple double bonds. Wait, no, each double bond is part of a substituent. So, I'm seeing two double bonds maybe? Or perhaps more? No, wait, let me count. The formula is written as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So there are two double bonds: one between the second and third carbon (from the first CH3 group) and another at the end, like between the sixth and seventh carbon. So two double bonds in the molecule.

The data given includes enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an atom to form isolated atoms. But I'm not sure how that comes into play here. Oh, right, sometimes when you calculate bond energies, you might need to consider the atoms involved. But in this problem, since all the bonds are C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H, maybe the enthalpy of atomization is used for the carbon part.

The bond energies provided are:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

Wait, but what about other bonds like C=C in the molecule? Oh, yeah, the given bond energies include C=C, so that's covered.

The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

Î”Hf = (sum of bond energies of all bonds broken) - (sum of bond energies of all bonds formed)

But wait, no, I think the formula is the opposite. Oh right, when you form bonds, you release energy. So the ent
