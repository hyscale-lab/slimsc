Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

So the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, wait, the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it's P = P_x x-hat + P_y y-hat + P_z z-hat. But the direction n is in the x-z plane, so the vector along which we're taking the operator must be in that plane, which means the y-component of n is zero. So the direction is something like (a, 0, b) where a and b are real numbers, probably with a^2 + b^2 = 1.

But wait, the eigenvector is for the operator P along n. So the operator we're considering is P_n = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Because n is in the x-z plane, so n_y=0. So the operator is a combination of P_x and P_z.

Let me write down the given matrices. Each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P_n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Let's compute that.

But wait, n is a direction, so n_x and n_z are direction cosines. Wait, no, n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

So, P_n = (n_x * P_x) + (n_z * P_z)
= (n_x * ħ/2 [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * ħ/2 [[1,0],[0,-1]])
= ħ/2 [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x
