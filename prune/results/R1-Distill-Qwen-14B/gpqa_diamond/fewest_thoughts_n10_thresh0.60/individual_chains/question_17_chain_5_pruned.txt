Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The question says it's a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, which probably means a 1:1 ratio.

The given concentration is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, if it's a 1:1 complex, then the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M. But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Oh right, because EDTA is a chelating agent and binds to Ca²+ ions.

The equilibrium here is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, right? The formation constant, K, is given as 5x10^10. K is the formation constant, which is the product of the concentrations of the products over the reactants.

So the formula for K should be K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but since the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, that's the concentration of the complex. So in the solution, the complex concentration is 0.02 M.

Assuming that the dissociation is minimal, because K is so large (which means the complex is very stable), the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be very low.

Let me set up the equation. Let’s say the concentration of free Ca²+ is x. Then, the concentration
