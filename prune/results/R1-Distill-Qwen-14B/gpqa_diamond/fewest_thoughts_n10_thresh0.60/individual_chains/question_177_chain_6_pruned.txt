Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The question mentions that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! Which says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. Got it.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, how does radial velocity affect luminosity? Oh, luminosity in this context is intrinsic brightness, right? Because the question says they computed the luminosity assuming black bodies. So maybe the radial velocity affects the observed brightness through Doppler shift, but since the question is about the actual luminosity (not apparent brightness as seen from Earth), perhaps the Doppler effect isn't directly affecting the calculation. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about this more.

The main point is about luminosity. The formula for luminosity when a star is treated as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both are black bodies, this should apply.

So, Star_1's radius R1 is 1.5 R2. Temperature T1 is equal to T2 because the peak wavelengths are the same. So substituting into the luminosity formula, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T²⁴, and L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4. Since T1 = T2, let me write T for both.

So L1 = (1.5²) * L2. 1.5 squared is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, the question says they calculated the luminosity
