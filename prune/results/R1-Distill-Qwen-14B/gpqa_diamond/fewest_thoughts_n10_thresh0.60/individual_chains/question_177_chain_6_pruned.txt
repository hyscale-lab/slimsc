Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the mass is also 1.5 times larger. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here. I think luminosity is more about the star's radius and temperature, right?

They did spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same? Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same, since b is a constant.

Wait, so Star_1 and Star_2 have the same temperature? That's interesting because usually when stars are of different sizes, their temperatures can vary. But in this case, whatever is happening, their peak emission is at the same wavelength, so T is same for both.

Now, the radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Oh, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So the stars are moving, which shifts the observed wavelengths. But wait, the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So even after considering their velocities, the observed peak wavelengths are same. Maybe that's not directly affecting the calculation of their intrinsic luminosities, because the luminosity is an intrinsic property. So perhaps the 700 km/s is a red herring, or maybe it's relevant for something else, like their motion, but not the luminosity calculation here.

But wait, the question is about the luminosity computed by the astronomers. So wait, the luminosity formula for a star is L = 4πR²σT⁴, right? Where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same T, as their peak wavelengths are same, then the luminosity would depend on R squared.

So Star_1 has R = 1.5 R2. So L
