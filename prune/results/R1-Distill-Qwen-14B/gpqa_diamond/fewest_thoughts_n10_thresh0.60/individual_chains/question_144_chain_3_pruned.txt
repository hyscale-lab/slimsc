Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they decay, they have a certain mean distance before decaying. 

The given data is:
- Production energy, E_X = 8 GeV
- Mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV
- Width, Γ_X = 320 MeV

And the options are A to D with various distances in meters. 

Wait, I think the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, the mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula I remember is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), times the velocity (βc), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. 

So, the mean decay distance L is given by L = βcτ. But to find τ, I need the lifetime, which is related to the particle's width Γ. I think the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. In particle physics, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so Γ ≈ ħ/τ. Wait, but actually, I think the relation is Γ ≈ ħ/τ. Or is it Γ = ħ/τ? Hmm, I think Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy uncertainty in the particle's mass, so Γ = ħ/τ. So τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). 

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. Let me think again. The lifetime τ is the mean proper lifetime, so the observed lifetime depends on the particle's velocity. The mean lifetime is τ = ħ/Γ. So first, I need to calculate τ, then multiply by the velocity times the speed of light to get the decay length.

But wait, velocity β is v/c. How do I find β? I think relativistic energy considerations are needed here. The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the energy of the meson is not just its rest mass energy but higher, meaning it's moving at relativistic speeds. 

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor
