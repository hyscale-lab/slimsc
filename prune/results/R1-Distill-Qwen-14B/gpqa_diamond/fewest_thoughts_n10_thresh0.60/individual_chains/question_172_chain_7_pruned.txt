Okay, so I've got this question about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with things like excitation in stars, it's probably related to the Boltzmann distribution or something like that. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium, which is what LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) implies here.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is a familiar number—it's close to Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So the energy difference ΔE is equal to k*T, or is it? Wait, no, wait. The energy spacing between levels is given, so ΔE = E_upper - E_lower. The Boltzmann factor is the probability of being in a higher energy state compared to a lower one, which is (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

In this problem, the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So the ratio of excited atoms in star_1 to star_2 is 2:1. Let's denote the ratio as (n1/n2) = 2, where n is the number of atoms in the excited state.

Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of populations is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where E2 > E1. Since the question says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J, that's E2 - E1. So let me write this:

n1 / n2 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T1) ) / (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T2) ) )

Wait, no, maybe I should model it more carefully. Let me think again. The excitation ratio between the two stars is given for a specific transition. So for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the upper level (n_upper) to the lower level (n_lower)
