Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I guess that means the usual laws of thermodynamics apply here. 

Wait, I remember that the population of different energy levels in atoms is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like the ratio of populations between two energy levels. Oh right, the formula is (n_j / n_i) = exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference (E_j - E_i) is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's call this delta E. So for star_1 and star_2, the ratio of their populations is given. 

The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, n1_j / n1_i = 2 times (n2_j / n2_i). Or wait, maybe it's the number of atoms in the higher energy level compared to the lower. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio between the excited state and the ground state, or whatever the reference is.

Wait, the question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, let's assume that the excited state is a higher energy level. Then, the population ratio (excited to ground, perhaps) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So, for star_1, n1/excited is twice as much as in star_2, n2/excited.

Wait, no, more accurately, the ratio in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, (n_j / n_i)_1 = 2 * (n_j / n_i)_2.

Using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

For star 1: (n_j/n_i)_1 = exp( -deltaE/(k T1) )
For star 2: (n_j/n_i)_2 = exp( -deltaE
