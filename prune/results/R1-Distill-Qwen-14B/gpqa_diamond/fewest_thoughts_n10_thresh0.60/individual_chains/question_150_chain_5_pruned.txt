Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through the problem again and take it step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that formula. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be two rings and a double bond, or a ring, a double bond, and a triple bond, or other combinations. But considering the NMR data, maybe there are two aromatic rings and a double bond, maybe an aldehyde group.

The NMR data is given. Let's look at that. The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), which is a triplet. A triplet at around 9.7 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but they're typically singlets because they don't have neighboring Hs. Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like an enol.

Wait, another thought: 9.72 could be an aldehyde proton. But in that case, why is it a triplet? Maybe it's coupled with two protons. Hmm, but aldehydes have only one proton, so maybe it's an enol tautomer? Or perhaps an aldehyde that's part of a conjugated system.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) suggest two sets of doublets, each integrating for two protons. That's typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. So, two protons each as doublets. Maybe two phenyl groups attached in a para fashion?

Then there's 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet integrating for two protons. That could be an enol proton or some other vinylic protons. Alternatively, maybe some hydroxyl groups, but they are broad, but hydroxyls are usually broader
