Okay, so I have this question about symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what is SMEFT? Oh right, it's the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) and allows for higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the Standard Model physics. These operators are suppressed by some high energy scale, usually denoted as Lambda.

So the question is asking which symmetries these operators must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Let me start by recalling each symmetry.

Lorentz Symmetry: This symmetry includes all the transformations that relate different inertial frames of reference, like rotations and boosts. In the SM, the theory is Lorentz invariant. SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry because it's an effective theory built from the SM, which is Lorentz invariant. So any operator in SMEFT should transform appropriately under Lorentz transformations.

Poincare Symmetry: That's the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations. Wait, but actually, the Poincare group includes all the isometries of Minkowski spacetime, which means translations, rotations, boosts, and so on. But wait, does SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry? Because the effective theory is built on top of the SM, which is Poincare invariant. So the effective theory must also be Poincare invariant. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry. Oh wait, wait. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Hmm, Lorentz is a part of Poincare. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So the question is, are operators required to respect both Lorentz and Poincare, or is one a subset of the other?

Wait, SMEFT is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the SM, but it's still a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all the operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars. So they must transform in a way that makes the entire Lagrangian invariant under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

Poincare symmetry would imply that the theory is invariant under all Poincare transformations, including translations. But wait, the SM is translation
