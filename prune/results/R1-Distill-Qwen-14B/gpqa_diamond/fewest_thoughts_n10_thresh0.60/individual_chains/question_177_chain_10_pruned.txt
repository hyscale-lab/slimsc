Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm, let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength for a blackbody is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait a minute. Star_1 and Star_2 have the same peak wavelength, so their temperatures are equal. That's important because the luminosity formula for a star is L = 4πR²σT⁴, right? Where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So since both stars have the same temperature, T, I can ignore that in the ratio. The luminosity depends on R squared times T to the fourth. Since T is the same, L is proportional to R squared.

Wait, but wait again. The problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. Let's see what the given R is. Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So substituting into the luminosity formula, L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). But T1 = T2, so T terms cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²) = (1.5 R2)² / R2² = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25.

Wait, so the factor is 2.25. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25, option D is ~2.23. Hmm, but wait, that's if the only factor is R. But wait, the problem mentions that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km
