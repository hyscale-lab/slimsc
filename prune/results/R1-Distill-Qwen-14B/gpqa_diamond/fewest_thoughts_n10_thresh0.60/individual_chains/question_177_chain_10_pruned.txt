Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. But wait, how does radial velocity affect this? Hmm, maybe it's about Doppler shift? Because the velocity could cause a shift in the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. 

They're assuming the stars radiate as black bodies, so I remember that the luminosity of a black body depends on its radius, temperature, and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the constant. So, I think I need to find the ratio of L1 to L2, which would be (R1/R2)²*(T1/T2)^4.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their black body radiation. I remember Wien's Law, which says λ_max * T = constant (approximately 2.9×10^-3 m·K). So, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. If λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same? Because if λ_max is same, then T would be same since λ_max = constant / T. Oh wait, but wait! The observed wavelength might be different from the rest wavelength due to Doppler shift because of their velocities.

Oh, right! Star_2 is moving towards or away from us at 700 km/s. If their rest wavelengths are the same, but due to Doppler shift, the observed wavelengths would be different. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm. So I need to consider the Doppler effect on their emitted wavelengths.

Wait, let me think. The star's emitting a certain peak wavelength, but if the star is moving relative to us, that wavelength is shifted. So, for Star_
