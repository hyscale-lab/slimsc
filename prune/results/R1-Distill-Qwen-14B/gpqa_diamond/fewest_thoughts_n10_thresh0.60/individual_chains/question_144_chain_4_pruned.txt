Alright, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. So the question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given data are E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the mean lifetime (or proper lifetime) of a particle is related to its decay width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the total decay width. But wait, I also recall that the mean decay distance involves the particle's velocity. So the decay distance L would be the product of the velocity v, the mean lifetime τ, and the speed of light c. So L = v * c * τ.

Wait, but how do I get the velocity from the given energy? Oh right, the energy E of the particle is related to its rest mass and momentum. The total energy is E = γ m c², and the momentum p is γ m v. But maybe I can use the relativistic relation between energy, momentum, and mass. The energy squared is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Oh right, because E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So first, I need to calculate the momentum p of the meson. Let's plug in the numbers. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. Let me convert them into the same units. Oh wait, maybe I can work in units where c=1 and ħ=1, which is common in particle physics. So, in natural units, E in GeV, m in GeV/c², so E² = p² c² + m² c^4. Wait, if we take c=1, then E² = p² + m².

So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E² = 64, m² = (1.44), so p² = E² - m² = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

Now, the velocity v can be found from the relation v = (p c²) / E. Wait, another approach: in natural units, v is the ratio p c / E. No, wait. Let me think in terms of units. Because p c has units of energy. So v = (p c²) / E. Let me see: E has units of GeV, p has GeV/c, so p c is GeV. So (p c) = GeV, E is GeV. So v = (p c²)/(E c) )? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of beta (β = v/c). β = (p c) / E. So β = (p c) / E. 

Wait, let's compute p in GeV/c. p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

So β = (p c) / E. Wait, p c is (7.91 GeV/c) * c = 7.91 GeV. E is 8 GeV. So β = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ) = 7.91/8 ≈ 0.98875. So v = beta * c ≈ 0.98875 c.

Next, I need to find the mean lifetime τ. As I thought before, τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So let's compute τ.

But wait, ħ in units where c=1 and ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm. Hmm, but I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let
