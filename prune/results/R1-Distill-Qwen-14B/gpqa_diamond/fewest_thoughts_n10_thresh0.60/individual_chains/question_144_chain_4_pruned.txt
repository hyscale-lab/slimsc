Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's see. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy EX = 8 GeV, mass mX = 1.2 GeV, and width ΓX = 320 MeV.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula should be something like distance = c * τ * β, where β is the velocity over the speed of light, and τ is the mean lifetime.

But how do I find τ? Oh, right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ. The relation is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think I need to use natural units here. Oh, right, in particle physics, ħ is taken as 1 in units of GeV·s. So Γ is in GeV, and τ would be in seconds when Γ is in GeV.

Wait, let me get the units straight. The decay width Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh wait, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Since ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s, then τ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s. Let me calculate that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, let me do that more accurately. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, I need to find the velocity β. For that, I'll use the relativistic energy relation. The production energy EX is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is 8 GeV, and the rest mass is m = 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the rest mass, which makes sense for a high-energy particle.

The energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)^2. But since we're using natural units where c=1, this simplifies to E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV. Let's compute that. 8 squared is 64, 1.2 squared is 1.44. So 64 -1.44 = 62.56. Then p = sqrt(62.56) GeV. What's sqrt(62.56)? Hmm, 7.9 squared is 62.41 because 8^2 is 64, so 7.9^2 is 62.41. 62.56 is a little higher. Let's compute: 7.9^2=62.41, 7.91^2= (7.9)^2 + 2*7.9*0.0
