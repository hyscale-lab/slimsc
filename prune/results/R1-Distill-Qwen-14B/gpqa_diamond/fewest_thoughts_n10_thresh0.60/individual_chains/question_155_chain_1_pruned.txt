Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, let me start by going through the problem step by step.

The question says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z, which I remember is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, right. So first, I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in this state. But wait, what's the state vector? Let me write it down. The state is |ψ> = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].

Wait a second, I should check if this vector is normalized. Let's compute the sum of the squares of the elements. (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, (1/sqrt(2))^2 is 1/2, another 1/4. So 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 equals 1. Okay, so it's properly normalized. Good.

Now, the operator P_z has a matrix given in the problem. Let me write that down. The matrix for P_z is diagonal with entries [ħ, 0, -ħ]. So it's:

[ ħ     0        0     ]
[ 0     0        0     ]
[ 0     0      -ħ ]

Wait, no, wait. The given matrix for P_z is first row (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, no, the problem says the matrix for P_z has first row (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So that's correct, right. So the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ.

So for the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute the matrix product ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

Let me compute each component. The state is |ψ> = [a; b; c] where a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2.

So P_z |ψ> is [ ħ*a, 0*b, -ħ*c ].

Then ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ is a*ħ*a + b*0*b + c*(-ħ)*c.

So that's ( (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) ) + ( (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + ( (-1/2)* (-ħ) * (-1/2) )

Wait, let me calculate each term:

First term: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ.

Second term: (1/sqrt(2))*0*(1/sqrt(2)) = 0.

Third term: (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2) = (-1/2)*(ħ/2) )= - (1/4) ħ.

So summing all three: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0.

Wait, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero? That's interesting. So the average of P_z is zero.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared is P_z squared, which for a diagonal matrix would just be the squares of the diagonal elements. So P_z² is a diagonal matrix with entries (ħ^2, 0, ħ^2).

So P_z squared is:

[ ħ²     0        0     ]
[ 0      0        0     ]
[ 0      0      ħ² ]

So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is again a* ħ² a + b*0 * b + c * ħ² c.

Because when you multiply |ψ> by P_z squared, each component just gets multiplied by the diagonal element squared.

So let's compute:

a² * ħ² + b² * 0 + c² * ħ².

a is (-1/2), so a² = 1/4. Multiply by ħ²: (1/4) ħ².

b is 1/sqrt(2), b² = 1/2. Multiply by 0: 0
