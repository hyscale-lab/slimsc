Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about orbital periods and transits and occultations. Hmm.

So, the setup is that there's a star with a radius 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Around it, there's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. Now, there's a second planet with 2.5 Earth radii, also in a circular orbit in the same plane. We need to find the maximum orbital period of this second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur.

Wait, transit and occultation. I remember that transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so we don't see its light. So for both events to happen, the planets must be aligned in such a way that they pass in front and behind each other relative to the star.

But how does that affect their orbital periods? I think it has to do with their orbital speeds. Oh wait, maybe it's about their orbital periods so that they can align in those positions.

Wait, both planets are transiting, but the question is about the second planet exhibiting both transit and occultation. Hmm. So maybe the second planet must be in a position where, sometimes it's in front of the star (transit), and sometimes the star is in front of it (occultation). But for that to happen, their orbital periods must be such that their orbital positions are synchronized in a way that allows these events.

Alternatively, perhaps the two planets are in a resonant orbit, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the second planet is in a closer orbit, so it moves faster, but wait, in this case, the second planet has a larger radius, but wait, radius of the planet is given, not the orbital radius. Oh wait, no, the radius of the planet is its size, not the orbital radius. The orbital radius is the distance from the star.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the orbital distances. The transit impact parameter is given for the first planet as 0.2. The impact parameter is the distance of the planet's path from the center of the star, in units of the star's radius. So for the first planet, the path
