Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to be carboxylic acids with some branching. The goal is to determine which structure matches the given spectroscopic data.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak in that region typically indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since all the options end with COOH, they're all carboxylic acids, so that makes sense.

The other strong peak in FTIR is at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a strong absorption, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl, so that's consistent too. No other functional groups are indicated, so we can focus on the NMR data for differentiation.

Now onto the 1H NMR. The question states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds (like in alkenes) in the molecule. All the structures given don't have double bonds either, so that's fine.

Looking at the NMR signals:

1. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets.
2. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, okay, I need to figure out what these splitting patterns mean in terms of neighboring protons. Splitting in NMR happens due to coupling with neighboring H atoms. The number of splits is determined by the number of neighboring Hs plus one. But more complex splitting like doublets of triplets implies that a proton is coupling with multiple sets of neighboring Hs.

Let's think about the structures. All the options have a similar skeleton: a central part with two CH groups attached to a COOH group. But the substituents vary.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
So the structure is something like:
CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH
Wait, that's maybe 2,2,4,4-tetramethylpentanoic acid or something similar? Hmm, perhaps it's more accurate to think of it as a geminal di-substitution on the central carbons.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
So substituents are ethyl groups attached to the central CH groups.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
So on each CH, there's a methyl and perhaps another group?

Wait, maybe it's better to draw the structures mentally.

Wait, each option is of the form R-C(H)(R1)-C(H)(R2)-COOH. But perhaps the positions of the substituents differ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the symmetry. Let's consider each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Hmm, the structure would be:
CH2CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH? Or wait, I think it's more like:

Wait, no, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So each central CH has a C2H5 (ethyl) group. So this would result in two ethyl groups on each of the middle two carbons.

Option B
