Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I can remember. The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options are A through D, each with different expressions involving constants like c (speed of light), k, m, and A, which is the maximum amplitude.

Alright, first, I think I need to recall how the harmonic oscillator works in both classical and relativistic contexts. In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the total energy is (1/2)mv²_max for a non-relativistic oscillator. But wait, the question is relativistic, so we can't use the same formulas.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. Oh, but relativistic mechanics probably involves using the relativistic form of momentum or energy. So I should think about how energy works in relativity.

In special relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the kinetic energy is E - mc². But wait, the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². So perhaps the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of kinetic and potential energies, but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore.

Wait, no. In relativ
