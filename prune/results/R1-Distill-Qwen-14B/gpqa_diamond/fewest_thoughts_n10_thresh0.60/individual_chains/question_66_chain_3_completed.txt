Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Right, it's a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators beyond the Standard Model, respecting certain symmetries.

The question gives me four options: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. I need to pick which of these must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, let me think about each symmetry. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. I'm pretty sure SMEFT operators must respect this because they are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory. Without Lorentz symmetry, the theory wouldn't make sense in the relativistic context.

Then there's Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's the full symmetry of spacetime (rotations, boosts, translations). But wait, the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Effective theories usually don't include all symmetries because they're valid up to a certain scale. Wait, no, wait. No, the SMEFT operators are built to be Lorentz invariant. Poincare symmetry is more about the entire spacetime symmetry. But does SMEFT respect Poincare? I think so, because it's built from the Standard Model, which does respect Poincare. So all operators in SMEFT should respect Poincare symmetry as well. Or do they? Hmm, maybe not necessarily all, but wait, no. Wait, Poincare includes momentum conservation via translations, but in an effective theory, you can have operators that don't respect translation symmetry? Or do all operators in SMEFT have to be translation invariant? Because the operators are part of the standard model interactions, I think they should respect translation symmetry. So Poincare symmetry would be respected.

Wait, but the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So maybe Poincare includes Lorentz, so if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. But the question has options where 1 is Lorentz and 2 is Poincare. So if all operators must respect Lorentz, which is part of Poincare, but Poincare itself may not necessarily be required? Hmm, no, I think in SMEFT all operators are part of the Standard Model, which is Poincare symmetric, so the operators must respect Poincare as well. Wait, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory; perhaps it doesn't have to include all the symmetries, but I think it does.

Wait, no. Wait, SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. So the SM includes Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT must respect it as well. So operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. So 1 and 2 are both required.

Next, CP symmetry. CP is charge conjugation plus parity. The Standard Model is almost CP symmetric except for certain parts, like in the CKM matrix. But wait, the SMEFT includes all possible operators, including those that violate CP. For example, operators with higher-dimension terms that may break CP. Or do they have to respect CP? Hmm, I think that operators can violate CP if the Standard Model already does. Wait, no, SMEFT includes operators that are not necessarily CP-symmetric. So maybe CP is not a symmetry that all operators must respect. So 3 may not be correct.

Wait, but I might be getting this wrong. The SMEFT is built to respect the same gauge symmetries as the SM, but what about other symmetries? For example, the SM doesn't have a global symmetry like CP, so operators in SMEFT could violate CP. So the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. CPT is the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Because the theory is relativistic, and the Poincare algebra includes CPT as part of its structure. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

So putting it all together: which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect?

1. Lorentz Symmetry: yes.
2. Poincare symmetry: yes, because it includes Lorentz and translations, and the theory is built from SM which respects this.
Wait, but wait. Wait, Poincare includes translations. Are all SMEFT operators translation-invariant? Because, for example, operators with higher-dimensional terms like (partial)^n would still be translation-invariant, as they are local. So yes, they respect translation invariance, so Poincare must be respected.

Wait, but is Poincare symmetry a separate symmetry that must be respected by the operators, or is it automatically satisfied because they respect Lorentz and translation. So, the SMEFT operators must respect both (1) Lorentz and (2) Poincare symmetry, because they're part of the same framework. So both 1 and 2 must be respected.

So considering that, the answer should include 1,2, and 4, but wait, no. Wait, the options are given as 1,2, etc.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

Wait, so option C is 1,2,4. So if 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT) must all be respected, then option C is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 3 (CP) is not necessarily required. So the correct answer would include 1,2,4, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Poincare symmetry is the same as including Lorentz and translations. So do all SMEFT operators respect Poincare?

Yes, because the Standard Model itself respects Poincare, so all operators in SMEFT, which are built as extensions respecting SM symmetries, must also respect Poincare.

So, putting it all together: 1, 2, and 4 must be respected. So option C is the answer.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory, meaning all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for any theory based on relativistic principles.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is built from the Standard Model, which respects Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry. This includes translation invariance, which is automatically satisfied in SMEFT due to the local nature of its operators.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model is not CP-symmetric, and SMEFT includes operators that can explicitly violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement that all SMEFT operators must respect.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected by all operators.
