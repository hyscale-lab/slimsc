Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about a star with spots and how it relates to an exoplanet's signal. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar = R_sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor, I remember, is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So 20% means 0.2 of the star's surface is spots.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, probably, because spots are dark. The temperature difference is 1000K, so I think the spots are at 5000K. Wait, wait, but the question says the temperature difference is 1000K. Oh, but does it say whether the spots are hotter or cooler? Hmm, the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. Since spots are usually cooler, I think spots are at 5000K. So T_spot = 5000 K.

They mention that the photometric observations show periodic brightness variations because the star is rotating, modulating the spots in and out of view. But when only one hemisphere is spotty, so maybe the spots come into view as the star rotates. But the idea is that this situation can resemble an exoplanet transit.

The question is, to produce the same amplitude in the light curve, what radius would an exoplanet have relative to the star? So, we're to find R_planet / R_star.

Wait, the key point is that the brightness variation due to the spots should be the same as the variation caused by a planet transit. So, the amplitude of the dip in brightness (from the star's perspective) when the planet transits should match the amplitude caused by the spots.

I remember that the change in brightness (Î”F) when a planet transits is given by the area blocked relative to the star. The area is (R_planet / R_star)^2. But wait, no, because the star is a sphere, the area blocked is (R_planet / R_star)^2, and the flux change is proportional to that area.

But wait, the star's brightness variation due to spots is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they are in view, the overall brightness of the star is less than when they're not. So, the change in brightness would be proportional to the difference in flux from the spotted area versus the normal area.

Flux from a part of the star is F = sigma * T^4 * area. So, the flux from a spot is F_spot = sigma * (T_spot)^4 * A_spot, and the flux from the unspotted area is F_unspot = sigma * T_star^4 * A_unspot.

So the total flux from the star when the spot is facing us (assuming a single hemisphere is spotted) is F_total = F_spot + F_unspot.

The variation in flux occurs as the star rotates, and spots come into view. The maximum and minimum flux would depend on how much of the spotted area
