Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the brightness variations observed. They compare this to an exoplanet's effect, and I need to find the planet radius relative to the star.

Alright, so the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar is the same as the Sun's radius. The effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor, that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Oh wait, but wait, the star is a sphere, so when they say one hemisphere is covered, perhaps I should think about the total surface area affected.

The spots are cooler because they have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots' temperature is 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K, right? Or wait, does the problem say they are 1000K cooler? Because the star's Teff is 6000, so spots are 5000. Alternatively, maybe the spots are 1000 K cooler than the surrounding, so their Teff is 5000 K.

Now, the situation is that when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. So the brightness variation is due to this modulation. But the question is saying that this situation can be mistaken for an exoplanet causing similar brightness variations. So the task is to find what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star's variation.

Wait, but the problem says: To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star.

Wait, no, I think I misread. The star is covered by spots, and that's causing the brightness variation. But if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would cause the same amplitude in brightness variation.

Ah, so the observed brightness variation from the spots is being mistaken for a planet. So the amplitude of the brightness dip (for the spot scenario) is the same as that caused by a planet transit.

So I
