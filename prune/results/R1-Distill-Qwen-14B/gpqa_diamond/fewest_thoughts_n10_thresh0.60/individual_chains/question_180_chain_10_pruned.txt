Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is about 2*(1.6e-19 coulombs) = 3.2e-19 C. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that for energy calculations.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, energy in electrostatic systems... Right, I remember that the total electrostatic potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their respective positions. Since the system is isolated, we don't have to consider external fields, just the interactions between the charges themselves.

Wait, but how do we calculate the potential energy? Oh right, the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². But when dealing with multiple charges, you have to consider all pairs.

But wait, here we have 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at point P, and the other twelve are each 2 meters away from P. So, the 13th charge is fixed, so I guess the first thing is to calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P. Then, since the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but there's another thing: do these 12 charges interact with each other?

Ah, right! In a system of multiple charges, every pair contributes to the potential energy. So, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs. So, I need to calculate two parts: the energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge, and the energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at
