Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what I need to do. The question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges. 

So, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. I know that e is the elementary charge, about 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. But wait, each is 2e, so each charge is 2 times that. 

The system: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. Hmm, so point P is where one charge is fixed, and the other twelve are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. 

The question is about the minimum energy of this system. I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges depends on their configuration. Since it's asking for the minimum energy, I should think about the most stable arrangement, perhaps where the charges are placed in the way that minimizes repulsion, but wait, all the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P. Wait, the setup is the 12 are at 2 m from P, which is where the 13th is fixed. 

Wait, but each of the 12 is 2 m away from P. So, point P is the position of the 13th charge. So the 12 charges are all on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m, centered at P. But does their specific arrangement matter? Like, whether they're equally spaced or not? Since the problem says they're constrained, maybe their positions are fixed, so the only thing we can vary is the position of the 13th charge? No, wait, the 13th is fixed at P. So perhaps the potential energy comes from the interactions between the 12 charges and the 13th, as well as the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

Wait a second. No, the 13th is fixed at P, and the other twelve are all at 2 m from P. So the 12 charges are each 2 m away from the fixed charge. But what about the interactions between themselves? Since all the 12 are at the same distance from P, but what about their mutual distances? Are they all on a sphere
