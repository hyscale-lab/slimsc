Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

Alright, the question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots, and these spots have a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness observed changes periodically. The situation is similar to when a planet transits in front of a star, causing a dip in brightness. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a planet, Rpl, relative to the star's radius Rstar, so that the brightness variation is the same as what's caused by the spots?

Hmm, okay. So I think I need to calculate the change in brightness, or the light curve amplitude, caused by the spots and set that equal to the amplitude caused by a planet transit. Then, solve for Rpl/Rstar.

First, let me think about the brightness variation due to the spots. The star is emitting light, and when the spots rotate into view, they make it dimmer. The spots are cooler, so they emit less light. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K less, so 5000 K.

The filling factor is 20%, so the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere they're on. Wait, but the star has one hemisphere covered, right? So the spotted hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the total spotted area is 20% of half the surface. Let me check: the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area covered is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) because each hemisphere is half the surface area. But wait, the total surface area of a sphere is 4π R², so each hemisphere is 2π R², and the spotted area is 0.2 times that.

But when the star rotates, the spots come into view, so the observed brightness changes. The brightness variation is due to the spots: when the spots are facing us, their cooler temperature reduces the flux.

The flux from a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the star's total flux is Fstar = σ (Teff)^4 * (4π Rstar²) / (4π d²), but since we're considering relative changes, the distance d might cancel out.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star's total flux without spots and with spots. The observed flux when spots are on the visible hemisphere will be lower because the spots contribute less. So the change in flux is the difference between the normal flux and the flux with spots.

Wait, but the star's surface isn't entirely at the same temperature. The spots are cooler. So the total flux is the sum of the normal areas and the spotted areas. Let's see.

The star's surface is 4π R². The spotted hemisphere is 2π R², and 20% of that is covered by spots. So
