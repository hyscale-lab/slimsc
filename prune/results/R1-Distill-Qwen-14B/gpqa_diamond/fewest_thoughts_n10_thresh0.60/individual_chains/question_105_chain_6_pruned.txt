Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area, I think. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, as one hemisphere comes into view and the other goes away, the brightness we observe changes. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would cause a dip in brightness, but here it's because of the spots.

The question is asking, if instead of the spots, we had an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation, what would the planet's radius be relative to the star's radius? So we need to calculate Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet compared to the star. The formula is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because it's the area blocked. But wait, in this problem, the brightness variation is due to the spots on the star, not a planet blocking the light. So I need to find out what the amplitude of the brightness variation is due to the spots and then equate that to what a planet would cause.

So first, let's think about how the spots affect the star's brightness. The star normally emits light based on its temperature, but the spots are cooler. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the overall brightness we observe is lower than when the other hemisphere is facing us. The star's rotation causes the spots to come into and go out of view, leading to periodic brightness variations.

The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area, so filling factor f is 0.2. The spot temperature is 1000K less than the star's, so T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

Wait, but the star's total luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So the total luminosity of the star is L = 4πR²σ (6000)^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, part of the star's surface is at a lower temperature. So the change in brightness would be the difference between the normal star and the star with the spots.

I think the approach is to calculate the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) caused by the spots when the hemisphere is facing us. Then, that ΔF would be equivalent to the fractional change caused by a planet transiting the star.

So let's model the situation. The star's total flux is F = σTeff^4. The spots have a lower flux, F_spot = σ(Teff - 1000)^4.

But wait, not the entire hemisphere is spots. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the hemisphere's area is spots. So the average flux from the hemisphere
