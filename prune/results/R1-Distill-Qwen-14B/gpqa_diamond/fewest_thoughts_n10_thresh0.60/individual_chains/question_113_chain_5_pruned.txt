Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. The options for the chemical formula are given, and I have to choose the correct one based on the given spectral data.

Alright, let's break down the information provided.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A very broad peak suggests something like an alcohol (OH group) or maybe a carboxylic acid (COOH), but wait, a carboxylic acid also has a broad peak, but it's usually a bit lower, maybe around 2500-3300, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Let me think about what these could be. The 1700 region is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring, like C=C stretching, or maybe another carbonyl group but at a different position. Wait, but two strong peaks in that area? Hmm. Maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring's C=C. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or an amide or something else. But from the given options, I think it's more likely to be a carbonyl group.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, so like in an alkene. So the compound has some double bonds. That could also tie into the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak, which might be the C=C stretch in an aromatic ring or an alkene.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm. So, what fragments have a mass of 45? Well, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH3 (dimethyl ether is 45? Wait, no, let me think. Wait: C=12, H=1, O=1
