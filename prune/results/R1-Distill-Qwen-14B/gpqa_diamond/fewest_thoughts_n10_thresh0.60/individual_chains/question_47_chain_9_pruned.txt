Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. The question is to identify a compound based on its spectral data. Let me see... The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me think about the possible structures that match this formula.

So, the IR data has strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Wait, amide or amine? But wait, amides typically have N-H stretches around those regions. But wait, 3420 and 3325 are two peaks. Maybe it's an amine with two sets of N-H, like a secondary amine? Or perhaps an amide where the N-H is split into two due to hydrogen bonding or something?

Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group. 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester or maybe a ketone, but given the formula, probably an ester. Because amides have lower carbonyl peaks, around 1650, I think. So this is likely an ester group. Or maybe a formamide? But formamide's carbonyl is lower, isn't it? Hmm.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. Because a triplet in that region is typical for the ethyl group in esters. So like OCH2CH3, the CH3 would be a triplet at around 1.2 ppm.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Broad singlet with 2H. Could be an NH2 group, but the IR suggests N-H, but this is a singlet. Wait, in the IR, there were two N-H stretches, which might be from an amide, but if there's a broad singlet here, that's 2H. Maybe it's an NH2 group, but then in the IR, if it's a primary amine, but then why the two N-H stretches?

Wait, but let me think about the options. The options are A to D, let me see what each is.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.
