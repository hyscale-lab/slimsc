Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, so the key here is understanding how the temperature affects the ratio of atoms in different energy levels. I remember something about the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium (LTE, which the problem states).

The Boltzmann equation is usually written as (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights of the energy levels, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, so the ratio depends on the temperature. When the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff decreases. So the temperature in the photosphere goes from 6000 K to 5500 K. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, right? Oh, but the problem says the overall effective temperature decreases, so that's considering the entire star, including the spots.

Wait, but in the photosphere, the temperature structure might change. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So I think we can treat the entire photosphere as having a lower average temperature when spots are present.

But wait, the spots are cooler. So the star's surface isn't uniformly at the same temperature. Without spots, the entire surface is at 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature. But the problem says the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So maybe the calculation averages the flux, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things and just treating the entire photosphere as at 5500 K when the spots are present. I think for this problem, that's the approach we have to take, as the question is about the ratio in the photosphere as a whole.

So the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels depends on the temperature. Let me denote the ratio as R = (n1 / n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, actually, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the wavelength. Wavelength λ is related to energy E by E = hc
