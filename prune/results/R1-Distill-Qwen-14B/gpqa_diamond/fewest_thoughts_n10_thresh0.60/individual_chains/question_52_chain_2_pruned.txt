Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem talks about a star with certain characteristics. So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levelsâ€”level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, we need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two levels... Oh, right, in stellar atmospheres, this is probably related to the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of populations in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy) of the level, E is the energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, when the star has no spots, the Teff is 6000 K, and when it has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but does the presence of spots lower the effective temperature because the spots are cooler? So the star's overall brightness decreases because part of the surface is cooler.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels. So, when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower. So, the temperature affecting the Ti atoms is 5500 K instead of 6000 K. 

So, the ratio n1/n2 depends on the temperature. Let me think. In the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star
