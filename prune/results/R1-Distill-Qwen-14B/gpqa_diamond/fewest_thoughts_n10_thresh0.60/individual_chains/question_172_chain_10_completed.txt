Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. Let me think about that.

The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k*T) )

Wait, but in this case, they're talking about the same energy level in both stars? Or perhaps it's the ratio between two levels within each star. Wait, no, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So I think it's comparing the population of the same energy level in each star.

But wait, no, wait. The energy levels are the same because it's the same element. So the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, no: the energy difference is the same for both stars because the same element is considered, so the E_upper minus E_lower is the same for both.

Wait, but the problem says 'the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J.' So delta E is the same for both stars.

But the ratio of the populations (excitation) between star_1 and star_2 is given: n1/n2 = 2. Or wait, is it that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2? So the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So for the same energy level, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2.

Wait, but the Boltzmann equation for each star would be:

n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Assuming that the lower and upper levels are the same for each star, so the ratio between the two stars would involve their temperatures.

Wait, but in this problem, the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So for the same energy level, n1 = 2 n2. Or perhaps it's the other way around? Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. So n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2) ?

Wait no, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of the excitation in each star. Let me model it.

Let me assume that for each star, the ratio of the population in the excited energy level (n_e) to the ground level (n_g) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, n_e / n_g = (g_e / g_g) * exp( - delta E / (k T) )

Given that, for star_1, n_e1 / n_g1 = (g_e / g_g) exp( - delta E/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, n_e2 / n_g2 = same g factors, exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

But the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps n_e1 / n_g1 = 2 * (n_e2 / n_g2 )

Wait, that would mean (g_e/g_g) exp(-delta E/(kT1)) = 2 * (g_e/g_g exp(-delta E/(kT2)) )

Wait, because n_e1/n_g1 = 2 * (n_e2/n_g2). So simplifying, since g_e/g_g is the same for both stars, it cancels out.

So, we get exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Wait, maybe I should rearrange this equation. Let me write it as:

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) / exp( - delta E/(k T2) ) = 2

Which can be rewritten as exp( [delta E/(k T2) - delta E/(k T1)] ) = 2

Because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents.

So, exponent becomes delta E/k (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no: let me see. The exponents are -delta E/(k T1) and - delta E/(k T2), so when you divide, it's [ - delta E/(k T1) ] - [ - delta E/(k T2) ] = delta E/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ].

Wait, let me do that step again. So:

exp( delta E/(k) [ (1/(T2) ) - (1/(T1) ) ] ) = 2

Take natural log on both sides:

delta E/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

delta E/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1: that's (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), right? Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting, the equation becomes:

(delta E / k ) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, okay, so the question is asking for the equation that relates T1 and T2. Let me look at the options.

The options are all equations involving ln(2) equals some combination of T1 and T2.

Our equation here is:

ln(2) = (delta E / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but the given delta E is 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but in our equation, delta E is multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2), divided by k. Let me see.

But the problem gives us the energy difference, which is delta E. So perhaps k is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait a second, that's interesting. Because delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is the same value as k, Boltzmann's constant.

So delta E = k * something, perhaps.

Wait, let me compute delta E / k. Since delta E is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, delta E /k would be (1.38e-23) / (1.38e-23) ) = 1 per Kelvin.

So, delta E/(k) = 1 K.

Hmm, that's a big simplification.

So, substituting delta E = k * 1 into our equation:

ln(2) = (k * 1) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But since delta E = k * 1, delta E /k = 1.

So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Wait, but looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is exactly what we have.

Wait, but let me check again. Because in the equation from earlier, we had:

ln(2) = delta E/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But delta E/(k) is (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K) ) = (1 J)/(1 J/K) ) = K. So 1 K.

So yes, it's ln(2) = (1) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2)

Which simplifies to ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So the correct equation is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)


The problem involves comparing the excitation of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars (star_1 and star_2) under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation governs the population ratio of atoms in different energy levels, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The key steps to solve the problem are as follows:

1. **Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the populations of two energy levels in LTE is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
   \]
   where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the upper and lower energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

2. **Population Ratio Between Stars**: The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This implies:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}.
   \]
   Since the energy difference \( \Delta E \) and the statistical weights \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the same for both stars, the equation simplifies to:
   \[
   \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
   \]

3. **Simplifying the Equation**: Dividing the two exponential terms gives:
   \[
   \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
   \]

4. **Substituting \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \)**: Since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this into the equation:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
   \]

5. **Matching the Options**: The derived equation matches option D:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
   \]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is given by option D.
