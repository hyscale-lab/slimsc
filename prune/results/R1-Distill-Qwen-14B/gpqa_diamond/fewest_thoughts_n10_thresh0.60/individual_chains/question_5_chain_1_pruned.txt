Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a muon's momentum operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, let's break it down.

The operator is P, and it's given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I remember that the eigenvalue equation is P|ψ> = λ|ψ>, where λ is the eigenvalue. The problem states that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so I'm looking for the eigenvector corresponding to this value.

Wait, but the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Oh right, any direction can be described using angles. So the operator P here is along a direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. That probably means the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and since it's in the x-z plane, φ (the azimuthal angle) would be zero. So the operator P is P = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Oh wait, no, because the direction is arbitrary, but in the x-z plane, so the general form would be n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ). But here, since it's in x-z, φ is either 0 or 180, but more importantly, the direction vector would have y-component zero. So the operator P would combine P_x and P_z.

Wait, no. The operator is defined along a direction n, so the operator would be the dot product of the vector operator P with n. So P = n · P, where n is a unit vector. So n is (nx, 0, nz), because it's in the x-z plane, so ny=0.

So the operator P is P = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Each component P_x, P_y, P_z are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down the matrices.

P_x matrix: [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by ħ/2.
P_y matrix: [[0,-i],[i,0]] multiplied by ħ/2.
P_z matrix: [[1,0],[0,-1]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Since n is in x-z, the operator P is nx P_x + nz P_z.

So the operator matrix would be (ħ/2) [ nx [0 1; 1 0] + nz [1 0; 0 -1] ].

Let me compute the matrix elements. So:

The (1,1) element is (ħ/2)(nz * 1 + 0) = (ħ/2) nz.

The (1,2) element is (ħ/2)(nx *1) = (ħ/2) nx.

Similarly, (2,1) is (ħ/2) nx, and (2,2) is (ħ/2)( -nz *1 + 0) = - (ħ/2) nz.

Wait, no. Wait, the P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by nx, we have nx * [[0,1],[1,0]].

The P_z matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]], multiplied by nz.

So the total matrix is:

[[ (nz *1), (nx *1) ],
 [ (nx *1), (-nz *1) ] ]

All multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx],
           [nx, -nz] ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is (P - λ I)|v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue.

Here, λ is given as ħ/2.

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [nz, nx; nx, -nz] - (ħ/2) I = 0.

Which simplifies to (ħ/2)( [nz, nx; nx, -nz] - I ) |v> = 0.

So the matrix equation is ( (nz - 1) , nx; nx, (-nz -1) ) multiplied by ħ/2 times the vector [a, b]^T equals zero.

Wait, no, because we're subtracting the identity matrix multiplied by λ, which is ħ/2. So the equation is:

[ (ħ/2 nz) - (ħ/2 λ) ] a + (ħ/2 nx) b = 0

(ħ/2 nx) a + [ (ħ/2 (-nz) ) - (ħ/2 λ) ] b = 0

Since λ = ħ/2,

The first equation becomes:

(ħ/2 nz - ħ/2 * (ħ/2 )) a + (ħ/2 nx ) b = 0

Wait,
