Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical addition. Oh right, I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. 

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed. Oh, right, because both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds. I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So let me plug in the numbers. V1 is 0.6c, V2 is 0.5c. So (0.6c - 0.5c) is 0.1c. Then the denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Wait, 0.6*0.5 is 0.3. So 0.3 c² divided by c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7) which is approximately 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

Now the total energy. For each astronaut, I need to calculate their relativistic energy and then sum them up. Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75)=approx 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² = 3.464 mc².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = approx 5.964 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc². Option D says 5 mc², which is lower. Hmm, so option C's energy matches, and the relative speed is 0.14c. So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to find the relative speed between the two astronauts:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v
