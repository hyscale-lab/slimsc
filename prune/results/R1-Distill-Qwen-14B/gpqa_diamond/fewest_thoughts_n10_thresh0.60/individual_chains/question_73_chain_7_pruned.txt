Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are traveling at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, right. So I think I remember that when dealing with relativistic velocities, we can't just subtract the speeds like we do in classical mechanics. Oh right, because velocities don't add linearly in relativity. So to find the relative speed, I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, the formula for adding velocities in relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), I think. But wait, wait. Let me get that right. So if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v, then from A's frame, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Or is it (u - v) in another order? Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Suppose the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. Let's say astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from Earth's frame, astronaut
