Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. For a pseudosphere, which is a type of surface with negative curvature, the area calculation would probably involve some integration over the surface.

Wait, but wait. The pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature. The metric here seems to be in two dimensions because dx and dy are the differentials involved. So this is a 2D metric embedded in a higher-dimensional space, perhaps.

The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, pseudospheres in 2D... Oh right, in 2D, a pseudosphere is just a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. But wait, the options don't all say that. Option D is +infty, which would mean infinite area. But let me check more carefully.

The area of a surface in 2D can be found by integrating the area element over the region. The area element in a metric is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. So first, I need to find the determinant of the metric here.

The metric is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². Let me write the metric as ds² = [32/(
