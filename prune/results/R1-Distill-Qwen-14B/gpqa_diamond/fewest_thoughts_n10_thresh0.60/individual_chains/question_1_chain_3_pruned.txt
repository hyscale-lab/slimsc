Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A) 10^-9 eV, B) 10^-11 eV, C) 10^-4 eV, D) 10^-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

In this case, the lifetimes given are the uncertainty in time (Δt) for each state. Wait, but wait—each state has its own lifetime. Oh, but wait, when we're talking about the energy difference between the two states, perhaps we should consider the uncertainty in the energy of each state to determine if they can be distinguished.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference (E2 - E1) between the two states. To distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, I suppose. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty from the lifetimes might make it hard to tell them apart.

So, let me think. For each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1 with τ1=1e-9 sec, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and similarly for ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the energy difference should be significantly larger than the uncertainties in each state, perhaps? Or maybe larger than the sum or something else. Alternatively, the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in the measurement, which might be related to the shorter of the two lifetimes, or maybe the combined uncertainty?

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy resolution needed. To clearly distinguish two levels, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy of the measurement. The uncertainty in energy is determined by the time over which the energy is measured. But wait, in this scenario, each state has its own lifetime, but how would that translate into the uncertainty when measuring the energy difference between the two?

Alternatively, perhaps we should consider the energy resolution based on the shorter of the two lifetimes, because the shorter the lifetime, the larger the uncertainty. Let me think. The uncertainty ΔE is approximately ħ divided by τ. So for τ1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 is higher than for τ2 = 1e-8 s, since dividing by a smaller number gives a larger value.

So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 ≈ (h/(2π)) / τ1. Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

Let me plug in the numbers. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

Calculating ΔE1: ħ / τ1 = 1.055e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.055e-25 J. To convert that to eV, since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so divide by 1.602e-19.

So 1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (1.055 / 1.602) *
