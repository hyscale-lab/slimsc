Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and spring constant. But wait, this is relativistic, so I probably have to consider relativistic effects. Let me think.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional system, which probably simplifies things a bit. The mass is m, and the maximum amplitude is A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. But since it's relativistic, the equations of motion might change. Oh right, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, it uses the relativistic formula, which is something like γmc² - mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, so the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of its rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But in the case of a harmonic oscillator, energy is quantized, but I think this problem is treating it classically. So the total energy E is the maximum potential energy plus the maximum kinetic energy. But in a classical harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², right? Because at maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². And the kinetic energy would be maximum at the equilibrium position, so then the total energy is (1/2)kA². But wait, no, in the relativistic case, the potential energy part is still (1/2
