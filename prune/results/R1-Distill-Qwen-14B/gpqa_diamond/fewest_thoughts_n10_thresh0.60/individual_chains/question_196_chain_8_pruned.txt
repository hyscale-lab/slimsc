Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity, but let me think this through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. But wait, that's the classical harmonic oscillator. When we go relativistic, things change because of the relativistic effects on mass and energy.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving for v_max gives sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But this is non-relativistic, so the question is about the relativistic case.

In relativity, mass increases with velocity. The relativistic mass is gamma times the rest mass, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So as the speed approaches c, gamma becomes large, and the mass increases.

But wait, the harmonic oscillator equation in relativity is more complicated. I remember that in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx². Instead, there's a term that accounts for relativistic effects.

The potential energy for a relativistic oscillator is given by something like U = (k c²/m) * (
