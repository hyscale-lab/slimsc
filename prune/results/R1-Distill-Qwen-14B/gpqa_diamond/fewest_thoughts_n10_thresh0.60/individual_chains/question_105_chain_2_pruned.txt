Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars with spots and exoplanets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So the question says the star has a radius equal to the Sun, right? And one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Theyâ€™re saying that when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness variations that could look like an exoplanet transit. The question is asking what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness change.

Wait, I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the light. The amount depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the change in brightness (delta F) is (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius. But I think that's only if we're talking about a planet causing a dip in brightness. But here, the star has spots, which are cooler, so when they're visible, the star's overall brightness is less. So the observed dip would be similar to a planet blocking the star's light.

But wait, the star's spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star appears dimmer. So the effect on the light curve is a dip. But how much? And how does that compare to a planet transiting?

Hmm, the star's spots have a filling factor of 20%. So the area covered by spots is 0.2. But each spot is cooler by 1000K. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, so the spots are at 5000K, perhaps? But wait, the effective temperature is the overall temperature; the actual spots are cooler.

Wait, the brightness variation comes from the change in the observed flux. Let me think: the star's flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas. When the star rotates, the spots come into view and cause a dip.

But how to model the change in flux when a spot is present? The flux from a spot is lower because it's cooler. So the total flux without any spots is F0. When a spot is visible, the flux decreases
