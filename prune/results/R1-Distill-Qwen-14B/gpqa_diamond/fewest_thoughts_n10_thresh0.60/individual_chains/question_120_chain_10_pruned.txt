Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I'm supposed to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power dependencies on plx.

Wait, right, parallax is related to distance. Parallax in astronomy is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from different points in Earth's orbit. The formula I remember is plx (parallax) equals 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed, their number density is constant with distance. So, the number of stars in a volume should depend on that volume. But how does this relate to parallax?

Let me think about the volume in terms of parallax. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So a small change in plx would correspond to a change in distance. Let's say we have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. We need to find the number of stars in that range per unit plx.

Wait, but the number per unit plx... So, the number per unit plx, let's call it N, depends on the volume between two spheres with radii corresponding to plx and plx + dplx.

Wait, the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So the volume between two spheres with radii d and d + dd would be the difference in their volumes. Since d is the distance, and plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx.

So the volume element, dV, between plx and plx + dplx would involve the cube of the distance. Let me express this in terms of plx.

dV = (4/3)π (d+dd)^3 - (4/3)π d³.

Expanding (d+dd)^3: d^3 + 3d² dd + 3d (dd)^2 + (dd)^3. So, the difference is about 4π d² dd when dd is small (ignoring higher order terms). So dV ≈ 4π d² dd.

But d = 1/plx, so d² = (1/plx
