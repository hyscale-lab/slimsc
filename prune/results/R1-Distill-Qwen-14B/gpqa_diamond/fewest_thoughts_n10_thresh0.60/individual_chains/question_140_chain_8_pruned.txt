Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again and jot down the key points. 

The question involves a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0 degrees. So B is probably a solid at room temp but just melts a bit above that. 

Then there's something about a product of a reaction between a certain keto acid and X, which contains 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is very close. So, X must be something common in such reactions.

The question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. And if there are multiple isotopes, sum all their masses. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29. Hmm.

Let me think about each part step by step.

First, what's the violent reaction with liquid Y? Common violent reactions could involve metals reacting with acids. Oh wait, maybe Y is an acid. If X is a metal, and Y is an acid, the reaction could produce a gas. What gas has equal protons and neutrons? Let's think about possible gases.

Hydrogen gas (H2) has 1 proton each, but neutrons would be 0. So no, that doesn't fit. Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, but that's a noble gas, maybe not produced in such reactions. Wait, what about carbon dioxide? No, because CO2 has 12 + 16*2 = 44 g/mol. Wait, but the molecule part: the gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of possible diatomic gases.

Oxygen gas is O2. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since oxygen is usually O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in total. So yes, that fits. So W is O2? Or maybe another gas.

Wait, another possibility: what about nitrogen gas, N2? Each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (N-14). So N2 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That also fits. So W could be either O2 or N2, but which is more likely in a reaction with a metal?

Wait, but if X is a metal reacting with an acid, the gas might be hydrogen. But H2 doesn't fit the neutron and proton count. So perhaps another scenario. Maybe Y is not an acid but something else. Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate reacting with an acid, releasing CO2. Let's think about that.

If X is a carbonate (like Na2CO3), and Y is an acid (like H
