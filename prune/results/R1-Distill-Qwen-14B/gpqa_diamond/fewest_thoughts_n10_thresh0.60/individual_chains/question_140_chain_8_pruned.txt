Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts by talking about Substance X. It says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, so X must be a compound made up of at least two elements, one of which has a heavier isotope present in X. I'm thinking maybe something like Cl or another element with common isotopes.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and releases B when G is heated. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Let me think about melting points. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substances melt around that temperature? Wait, water freezes at 273 K (0°C), so maybe B is ice? No, but wait, melting point is the temperature where solid turns to liquid. So if B's melting point is near 277 K, that's about 4°C. Hmm, maybe something like paraffin wax? Or maybe another solid. Wait, maybe B is something like H2O (ice) because 277 is close to 273. But 277 is a bit higher than 273, maybe B is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid form of another compound.

Wait, the gas W has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about that. The number of neutrons equals the number of protons in a molecule. Wait, but a molecule is made of atoms. So each atom would have the same number of neutrons and protons. So each atom would be of an element where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. That would mean the element has an atomic number equal to its neutron number. So the element's atomic number is equal to its number of neutrons. Let's calculate possible elements.

Atomic number is the number of protons. Neutrons are N = mass number - protons. So if N = protons, then mass number = 2*protons. So possible elements where N = protons would have mass numbers 4 (He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons), 6 (C-6: 3 protons, 3 neutrons but wait, C usually has 6 protons. Wait no, C-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Wait
