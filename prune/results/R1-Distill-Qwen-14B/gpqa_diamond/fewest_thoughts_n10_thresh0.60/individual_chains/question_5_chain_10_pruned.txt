Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me see. The operator is denoted as P, and it's a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, P_z. The question is about finding the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, so the direction is given by a unit vector n, which lies in the x-z plane. So n would have components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in x-z. And since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1. Also, because it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

I remember that for a vector operator like P, the operator along an arbitrary direction n is given by the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But in this problem, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So it simplifies to (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Wait, but the problem gives me the components P_x, P_y, P_z as separate matrices. Let me read that again. P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0,1], second row [1,0]. Oh, right, that's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times a matrix with [0, -i] in the first row and [i,0] in the second; that's the Pauli Y matrix. P_z is (ħ/2) times diag(1, -1), which is the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P for direction n would be the sum of n_x P_x + n_z P_z, all multiplied by (ħ/2), I think. Because for a general direction, the operator is (∑n_i P_i) scaled by 1/2, I believe. Wait no, wait: the operator for spin in direction n is (ħ/2)(n
