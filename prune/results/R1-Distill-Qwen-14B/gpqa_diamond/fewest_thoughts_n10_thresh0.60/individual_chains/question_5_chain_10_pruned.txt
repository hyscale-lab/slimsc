Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvectors and operators. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, and we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, right? So, P has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin are represented by these Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

So let me write down each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix.
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Pauli Y matrix.
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Pauli Z matrix.

The operator we're considering is the vector operator along n, which lies in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because it's in the x-z plane, so y-component is zero. θ would be the angle from the z-axis, I think.

So the operator P along n is the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So P = n · P_vec = (sinθ) P_x + (0) P_y + (cosθ) P_z.

So putting it together, P = (sinθ) (ħ/2) σ_x + (cosθ) (ħ/2) σ_z.

Wait, I can factor out the (ħ/2) term. So P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ].

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector of this P with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's denote this eigenvector as |+⟩.

The eigenvalue equation is P |+⟩ = (+ħ/2) |+⟩.

So, substituting the matrix expression in:

(ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x +
