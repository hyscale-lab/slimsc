Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the electrostatics formulas perfectly, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to consider kinetic energy or anything like thatâ€”just potential energy, I think.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So I imagine point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all sitting on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. 

The question is about finding the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to bring them together from infinity, so maybe that's what I need to calculate here.

Wait, but the charges are identical and all the same sign, right? Because each is 2e, which is positive if e is positive. So all 13 are positive charges. If they're all positive, they repel each other. So the system's potential energy will be positive. But the question is about the minimum energy. Since the system is isolated, maybe the charges can't move beyond their current positions, but wait, the 12 are constrained at 2m. So maybe the potential energy is fixed? Or perhaps the minimal energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

Let me break it down. The system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. Since all charges are the same, I can compute the energy for each pair and multiply by the number of pairs.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th. Also, the 12 charges are all on a sphere of radius 2 m, so the distance between any two of them would be... hmm, not 2 meters, because they form a regular dodecahedron or something? Wait, but maybe we can approximate the distance between any two charges among the 12 as being 2 meters? No
