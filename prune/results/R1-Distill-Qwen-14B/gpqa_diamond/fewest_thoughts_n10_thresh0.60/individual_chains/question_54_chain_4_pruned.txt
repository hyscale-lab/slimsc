Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the starting material needed to make 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene using ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, ring-closing metathesisâ€”I remember that it's a reaction where two alkenes exchange partners, forming a ring. The catalyst, I think, is something like Grubbs catalyst. 

First, I need to visualize the target molecule. The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So the cyclohexene ring has substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. Let me draw the structure: the ring is six-membered with a double bond between C1 and C2 (since it's cyclohex-1-ene). Then, C3 has a methyl group, C4 has a methyl, and C5 has an isopropyl group.

Ring-closing metathesis typically involves an alkene that can form a ring when the catalyst facilitates the exchange. So the starting material must have two alkenes that, when undergo metathesis, form the ring.

Wait, but for ring-closing metathesis, the starting material is an olefin that can cyclize. So the initial structure must have two double bonds separated by a certain number of carbons. When the metathesis happens, those two double bonds become part of a ring.

Another approach: The target has a cyclohexene ring, which suggests that the starting material has a diene that, upon metathesis, forms a six-membered ring. So the starting molecule is an octadiene, maybe, which when metathesized, forms the cyclohexene.

Wait, wait, the target is a cyclohexene with substituents. So the starting material is a diene that's longer. Let's think about the positions. The substituents in the target are at positions 3,4,5. So in the starting material, these substituents would be on the chain.

Let me imagine that the starting material is an octadiene. The positions of the double bonds in the starting material will determine where the ring forms.

In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes in the starting material (the diene) will rearrange. The Grubbs catalyst
