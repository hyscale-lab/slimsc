Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. The problem describes several substances (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5) and their reactions, and I need to determine the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the degree of fluorination or maybe the composition percentage) for A2 is 31.96%. So A2 has 31.96% fluorine by mass.

Wait, oF might stand for omega F, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the percentage composition. Let me think—31.96% fluorine. Fluorine has an atomic weight of about 19. So if a compound has, say, F as 31.96%, perhaps the formula can be determined.

The problem says A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so perhaps A1 is a fluorine compound that's a strong oxidizer.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So A3 is likely a binary compound of Y and F. So Y is some element that can form multiple fluorides.

Then, adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. So when A5 is in water, it breaks down into two products.

I need to track each compound to figure out what they are.

Let me think about the decomposition of A1. When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So the reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Let me write that as a chemical equation.

Assuming A1 is a fluorine compound of Y, perhaps YF_x. Then, A2 would be another compound. Let's think about possible reactions.

Wait, A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon's oxidation reactions typically
