Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have a wave function given, and we need to find the normalization constant 'a'. I remember that wave functions must be normalized, which means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1.

The wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but the question says that when measuring the position, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function is zero outside this interval. Oh wait, no, actually, the wave function is given in a part where it can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So I think the wave function is zero elsewhere, but in the given part, it's ψ(x) as stated.

Wait, but the expression is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm. Wait, that seems a bit unclear. Let me think: the wave function is a function of x, so for x between 1 and 3, ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that would mean it's a complex function. Oh, right, because of the 'i' term. So the wave function has both real and imaginary parts.

But wait, when we normalize the wave function, we're looking for the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3, right? Because outside this region, the wave function is zero, so
