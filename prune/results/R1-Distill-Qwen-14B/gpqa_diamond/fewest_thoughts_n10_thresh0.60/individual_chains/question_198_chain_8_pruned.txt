Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. I remember that this involves stability constants and some kind of equilibrium calculations. 

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations given are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Stability constant, I think, is a measure of the stability of a complex; the higher the beta, the more stable the complex.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I'm assuming dithiocyanato means two SCN- ions attached. So, the complexes would be [Co(SCN)_n]^m+. Wait, let me think about the possible complexes. Cobalt can form different complexes with thiocyanate. For Co(II), the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(?), and so on. Wait, but the stability constants are given as β1 to β4, so probably for n=1 to 4. So the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+}, or maybe with different charges? I might be a bit fuzzy on that, but maybe the charge isn't critical for this calculation.

Wait, the problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, I think. So that's the n=2 complex, with β2=40. But wait, the beta values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each βn is the stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]
