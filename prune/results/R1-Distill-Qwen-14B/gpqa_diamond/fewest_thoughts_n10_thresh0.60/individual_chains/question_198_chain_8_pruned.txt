Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, which is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

We’re given the stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes. The β values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, blue dithiocyanato... I think that refers to the Co(SCN)_2^+ complex, which is the dithiocyanato complex. Or wait, maybe it's the tetrathiocyanato? No, wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ions attached. Let me think. The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^{2-n} where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. So the blue ones are specific, but the question says "dithiocyanato", which is two SCN groups. So that would be the n=2 complex, Co(SCN)₂²+ I think. So its stability constant is β2=40.

Wait, but the options have various percentages, so I think I need to calculate the fraction of all the Co species that are in the β2 complex.

So the approach is to consider all possible complexes and calculate their concentrations based on the given β values and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN^-.

The formation of complexes follows the stepwise addition of SCN- to Co²+. The complexes are:

Co²+ + SCN⁻ → CoSCN²+ (β1)
CoSCN²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₂²+ (β2)
Co(SCN)₂²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₃^+ (β3)
Co(SCN)₃^+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₄^0 (β4)

Each step has a stability constant β, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of each complex from the previous one and another SCN⁻.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species: [Co²+] + [CoSCN²+] + [Co(SCN)₂²+] + [Co(SCN)₃^+] + [Co(SCN)₄^0] = c(Co) = 0.01 M.

The total SCN⁻ concentration is given as 0.1 M, but since each complex consumes SCN⁻, we have to account for that. Wait, but the solution initially has 0.1 M SCN⁻, and some of it is tied up in the complexes. Hmm, but considering that, it's a bit tricky because each complex forms stepwise, so the free SCN⁻ is less
