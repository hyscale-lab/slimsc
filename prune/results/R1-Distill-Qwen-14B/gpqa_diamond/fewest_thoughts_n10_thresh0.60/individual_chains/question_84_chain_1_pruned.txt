Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically when using matrix exponential functions approximated by fractional methods. Hmm.

I remember that when dealing with heat equations, finite difference methods are common for discretizing the equations. Higher dimensions probably make things more complex because each dimension adds another variable to consider. The matrix exponential comes into play because the solution can often be expressed using exponentials of matrices, especially when dealing with systems of linear differential equations.

Parallel splitting is something I'm a bit fuzzy on. I think it's a technique to break down the problem into smaller parts that can be solved simultaneously, thus making the algorithm run faster on parallel computing architectures. So, the key factor here would relate to how we can split the problem in a way that allows parallel computation.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: I know stability is crucial in numerical methods. It ensures that the numerical solution doesn't blow up or become unstable. But is this the key factor in making the algorithm parallel? Maybe not directly. Stability is more about accuracy and preventing errors from accumulating, but it's a separate concern from parallelization.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions are those where the boundary depends on other parts of the domain, not just the immediate boundary values. I'm not sure how this directly ties into parallel splitting. Maybe if the boundary conditions are nonlocal, it complicates the way we handle the boundaries when splitting, but I'm not certain. I'll have to think more about this.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Fractional approximation methods are used to approximate matrix exponentials, which are used in solving these equations. The roots of the approximation might influence the stability or the convergence of the method. If the roots are complex, does that affect how we can split the problem into parallel tasks? Maybe, but I'm not exactly sure how that plays into parallelization.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Linear partial fractions are a way to decompose complex expressions into simpler parts. In the context of matrix exponentials, this could involve breaking down the matrix into parts that can be exponentiated separately. If we can split the matrix into submatrices or fractions, perhaps each part can be handled in parallel. That sounds plausible because parallel algorithms often benefit from decomposing operations into independent subtasks.

Wait, thinking again. For a parallel splitting method, each part of the computation should be independent so that they can run concurrently. If the fractional approximation allows the matrix to be expressed as a sum of matrices that can be exponentiated separately, then each exponentiation can be computed in parallel. This would make the algorithm parallel. So, the linear partial fraction decomposition would be the key factor because it's enabling this split into independent parts.

Stability analysis (A) is important but probably not the key for parallelism. Nonlocal boundary conditions (B) might complicate the setup but may not be the main factor. Complex roots (C) could affect the approximation's accuracy but perhaps not directly the parallelism aspect.

So, the key factor is D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation.
