Okay, so I have this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The scenario is that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for sunlight to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if something stopped happening in the core, the effects would only be felt here on Earth after that delay. But since we're talking about neutrinos, which can pass through the Sun easily, maybe their flux would change more quickly. Hmm, but the question says the pp-III branch stopped, so the neutrino production from that part would stop, and after 8.5 minutes, the Earth would detect the change because the neutrinos take that long to reach us. Wait, no, neutrinos move at nearly the speed of light, so the neutrinos produced right now would arrive almost instantly. But if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have stopped arriving, right? Or do they arrive continuously as they're produced?

So the question is about the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2) before and after the pp-III branch stopped. But wait, the question says what would be the ratio now, considering the pp-III stopped
