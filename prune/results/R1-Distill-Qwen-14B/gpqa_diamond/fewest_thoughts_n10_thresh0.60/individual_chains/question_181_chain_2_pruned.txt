Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, right? The main one is the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. Oh wait, I think the pp-I branch is the main one, leading to helium, and then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches which are less dominant but still contribute.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Oh wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. That makes sense because if the process stopped, we wouldn't notice the change immediately on Earth.

So, the neutrinos we detect come from various energy ranges. The question is about the flux ratio between two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find flux(band1)/flux(band2).

I remember that the solar neutrino spectrum peaks around a certain energy. Wait, isn't the peak for the pp reactions around 200 keV or so? But higher-energy neutrinos come from other processes like the CNO cycle or maybe the He triple-alpha? Or wait, actually, the dominant neutrinos are from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I branch. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, I think.

Wait, let me think. The pp-I branch produces neutrons
