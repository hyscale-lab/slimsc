Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it carefully and think through each step.

So, the setup is a spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity, which is also spherical. The cavity has a radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Also, r is less than R, which makes sense because the cavity is inside.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions involving these variables.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, but then a charge q is placed inside the cavity. Wait, but the conductor itself is neutral. So what happens when there's a charge inside a cavity of a conductor?

I think when a charge is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must induce an equal and opposite charge. Because the conductor is neutral, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it. Or wait, no, maybe I got that reversed. Let me think again.

No, wait. The conductor is initially neutral. When a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q. Because the cavity is inside, so the inner surface's charge is opposite to the charge inside the cavity. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the inner is -q, so outer must be +q to make the total zero.

But wait, that's for a conductor with the cavity, and the conductor as a whole is neutral. So outer surface has +q, inner has -q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So when considering the electric field at P, I should think about the charges outside influencing it. But in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. So the electric field outside would be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor, right?

Because for a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface can be treated as if they are at the center when calculating the electric field outside. That's the shell theorem or something like that.

So the electric field at P would be as if there's a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. So the distance from the center to P is L. Then E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). Because the formula for electric field due to a point charge is E = kQ/r².

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). So is that the correct answer?

But wait, I'm not so sure. Let me think again. The charge +q is inside the cavity, but the conductor's outer surface has +q. So
