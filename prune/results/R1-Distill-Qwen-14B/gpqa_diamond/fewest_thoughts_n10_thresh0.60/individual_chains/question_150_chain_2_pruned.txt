Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let me read through it carefully. The question is about identifying a final product after a series of reactions. The compound has a molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then it's reacted with three sets of reagents in sequence.

Wait, the reagents are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH with heat. Hmm, I remember those reactions. NaNO2 and HCl are usually involved in diazotization, right? That's when you treat an aromatic amine with nitrous acid to form a diazonium salt. Then, when you heat it with water, maybe it undergoes hydrolysis. Oh wait, but I think the third step is with KOH and heat, so maybe it's a different reaction, like a substitution or elimination.

Looking at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 + 2 - 9 - 0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees: probably a ring, a double bond, and maybe an aromatic group.

Looking at the NMR:

- 9.72 ppm triplet (1H). That's a pretty downfield shift. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10. Triplets suggest coupling with two adjacent protons. Wait, but wait, if it's an aldehyde, the proton is usually a singlet because it's only attached to one carbon. Unless it's something else. Hmm, maybe it's an aromatic proton in a ring with electron-withdrawing groups? Or perhaps an acidic proton like an aldehyde or something else.

Wait, other shifts: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). Those look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring. So like a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. The 6.98 is more upfield than 6
