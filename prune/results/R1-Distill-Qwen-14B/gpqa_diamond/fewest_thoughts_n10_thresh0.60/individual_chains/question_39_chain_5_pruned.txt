Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that behaves the same way under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis direction. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position of these particles, none are found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So they only exist in that interval.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that wave functions must satisfy certain conditions. One of the key things is that the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1, because that represents the total probability of finding the particle somewhere, which should be 100%.

Wait, but wait. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Since this is a wave function, it must satisfy normalization condition. So I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3, and set it equal to 1.

But wait, the wave function has an imaginary component here. Let me think. The wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function. To find the probability density, I need to compute ψ*(x) ψ(x), where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

The complex conjugate of ψ(x) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i, right? Because you flip the sign of the imaginary part.

Then ψ*ψ would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5i)(-0.5i) + cross terms.

Wait, let me calculate that. Let me write it out:

ψ(x) = A - Bi, where A = a/sqrt(1+x) and B = 0.5.

Then ψ* = A + Bi.

So ψ*ψ = (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B², because the cross terms (AB
