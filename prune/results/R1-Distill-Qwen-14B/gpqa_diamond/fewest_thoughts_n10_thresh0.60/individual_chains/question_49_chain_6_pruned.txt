Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the migration of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. The examples given are Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts. But the question includes three different reactions, so I'll need to tackle each one step by step.

Let me look at each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like ethanamine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. The structure would be (CH3O)2CHNH2. But but-3-en-2-ol is a secondary alcohol with a double bond between C2 and C3, I think. Its structure is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3 but wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2? Wait no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but that's not possible because but has four carbons. Oh, right, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, but that would be but-2-en-2-ol, not 3-en-2-ol. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it. But-3-en-2-ol would have four carbons, with the double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but but has four carbons, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH
