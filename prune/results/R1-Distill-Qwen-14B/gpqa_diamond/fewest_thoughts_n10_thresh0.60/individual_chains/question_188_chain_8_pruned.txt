Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal. So the lattice parameters a, b, c are the same, and alpha, beta, gamma are all the same too. In this case, the angles are 30 degrees each.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh wait, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for calculating that is from the Bragg's law or the interplanar spacing formula. 

Right, the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 cos^2 α + k^2 cos^2 β + l^2 cos^2 γ) + 2(hk cos αβ) + 2kl cos βγ + 2hl cos γα) ) Wait, no, that's more for orthorhombic or something else. Maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, another thought. I remember for a cubic crystal, the formula is simpler. But here it's rhombohedral, so not cubic. Oh right, the general formula for a rhombohedral system is a bit more involved. Because the lattice is rhombohedral, it's actually a special case of a hexagonal or something else? Or perhaps a general formula applies.

Wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all a, b, c are equal, and all angles are equal. So maybe there's a specific formula for d_hkl when a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma.

I think the formula for d_hkl in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk(1 + cos α) - hl(1 + cos α) - kl(1 + cos α) ) ). Wait, wait. Because in the case of a rhombohedral system, when all angles are equal, the formula simplifies. Alternatively, I think it's derived from the general interplanar distance formula, which for any crystal system is given by:

d^2 = (a^2
