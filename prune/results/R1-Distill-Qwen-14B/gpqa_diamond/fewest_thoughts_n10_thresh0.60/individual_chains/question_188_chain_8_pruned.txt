Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that in crystals, interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Let me think. Oh right, for a cubic crystal, the interplanar distance d for the (hkl) plane is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), where a is the lattice parameter. But wait, this is a rhombohedral crystal. Oh right, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system, or is it a separate category? No, wait, rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic, but with all edges equal and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in that case, the formula might be a bit different.

Oh right! The general formula for any crystal system is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ), but wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I remember something about the interplanar distance formula when the angles aren't 90 degrees. Oh wait, yes, for a crystal with a basis, it's more complicated, but in this case, I think the formula becomes d = [ (a² (h² +k² +l²) - 2a² (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos
