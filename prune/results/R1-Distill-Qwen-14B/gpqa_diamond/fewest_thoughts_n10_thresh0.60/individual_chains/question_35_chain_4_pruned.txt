Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, angular momentum... I remember that spin operators are involved here. The problem gives me some matrix forms and asks about eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

Let me read the question again. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay, which is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Oh right, I think I've seen similar matrices before in the context of spin-1/2 systems.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are A, B, C, D, and I have to pick which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, so first, let's think about the operator Ay. Since Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π), but for the eigenvalues, when you have an operator multiplied by a scalar, the eigenvalues also get multiplied by that scalar. So if S has eigenvalues, say, λ, then Ay will have eigenvalues c*λ.

What's the matrix S? Let me write it out:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

I think S is similar to the Pauli matrices. Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is usually written as [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is exactly what S is. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, σy. 

The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So for S, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by ±1. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues a would be (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π))*(-1), so a = ±h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues should be real, right? Because angular momentum operators are Hermitian. Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, Ay is c times S. c is a real constant. S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Because S† = S, so Ay is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues should be real. So any options mentioning complex eigenvalues are wrong.

Looking at the options: option A says the eigenvalue's imaginary parts are ±2πh. That would mean the eigenvalues are complex, which can't be right because Ay is Hermitian. So A is incorrect.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Again, eigenvalues should be real, so B is incorrect.

So the correct eigenvalues are real, which leaves options C and D.
