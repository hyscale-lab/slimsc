Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup says that Ay is equal to c times S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a given 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Wait, so S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

So, the first thing I need to do is figure out what Ay is. Since c is h/(4π), multiplying S by c gives Ay. Let me write that out.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = [ [0, -(h/(4π))i ],
                      [ (h/(4π))i, 0 ] ]

Wait, maybe it's better to note that S is a matrix related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, S looks like the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i or something. Let me recall: the Pauli Y matrix is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], which is exactly S. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y.

So, sigma matrices, like sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, are related to the spin operators. The spin operator S for spin-1/2 particles (like a muon) would be (ħ/2) sigma, where sigma is the Pauli matrix. But in this case, the operator Ay is c multiplied by S. Wait, let me see: c is h/(4π). Let me compute that. 

h is Planck's constant, so h/(4π) is the same as ħ/2, because ħ = h/(2π). So h/(4π) = (h/(2π)) / 2 = ħ/2. Therefore, Ay = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait the problem says Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π), which is (h/(4π)) = (ħ/2), right? Because ħ = h/(2π). So c = ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) sigma_y. So this is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y
