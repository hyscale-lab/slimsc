Okay, so I've got this physics problem about light passing through a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, there are some relativistic effects to consider, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, right? But in this case, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait a minute, in special relativity, the speed of light should always be c in any inertial frame, but wait, noâ€” that's for vacuum. In a medium, the speed is different. But when the medium itself is moving, does that change anything about the light's speed relative to the observer?

I'm a bit confused. Let me recall what happens when a medium is moving. In the case of a medium moving with velocity v, how does that affect the light's speed in that medium as observed from the lab frame?

Wait, I think that the speed of light in the medium is determined by the properties of the medium, regardless of its motion. So if the medium is moving, the speed of light within it is still c/n relative to the medium. But from the lab frame, we have to consider the velocity addition.

Ah, right! Velocity addition in special relativity. Because the observer is in a different inertial frame, moving relative to the glass. So
