Okay, so I just landed this job at Stanford, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. Hmm, I need to pick the right plasmid from the four options given. 

Wait, the question is about plasmid selection. I remember that for expressing proteins in E. coli, especially with BL21 strains, the plasmid should have a strong promoter and possibly a T7 promoter since BL21 strains are often used with T7 systems. Oh right, BL21 strains have the T7 RNA polymerase, which is induced by IPTG. So the plasmid must have a T7 promoter to initiate transcription of the gene.

Looking at the options, each starts with ATG, which is the start codon. But what about the promoters? The sequences before the ATG are probably the promoter regions. Let me think about this: the correct plasmid should have the T7 promoter sequence before the ATG.

Wait, the T7 promoter is recognized by T7 RNA polymerase. The promoter sequence is usually something like GGCC followed by other specific bases. The T7 promoter is a specific -35 and -10 region. The consensus for T7 promoters is something like GAGCTC (which is the -35 region) and the TATA box around -16. Alternatively, the T7 promoter is often represented as T7_promoter: 5' GAGCTCTAAT 3', but I might be mixing that up.

Wait, no. T7 promoters are actually quite specific. The T7 RNA polymerase binds to a promoter that is a DNA sequence rich in Gs. The core promoter for T7 is around the -10 region, which is TATA box. The consensus for T7 promoters is more like TATA box followed by some GC-rich regions. Alternatively, the T7 promoter is thought to have a specific sequence: the -35 region is GAGCTC and the -10 region is TATAAT. But I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Wait, another approach: the right plasmid should have a T7 promoter before the ATG. Looking at the sequences, I should look for the T7 promoter sequence upstream of the ATG. Let's check each option.

Each option starts with ATGGAGGAGCC... So the first part is ATG, which is the
