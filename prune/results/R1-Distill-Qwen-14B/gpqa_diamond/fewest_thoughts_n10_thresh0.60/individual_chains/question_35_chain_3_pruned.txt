Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A. The problem states that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay φ = a φ. The matrix Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. 

Wait, S's first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). Oh right, that looks familiar. I think that's the Pauli Y matrix, which is often denoted as σy. So, S is σy.

So, Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), then Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix.

Now, the task is to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options given are about the properties of these eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

First, let's find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. 

Wait, but since Ay is a scalar multiple of S, maybe I can find the eigenvalues of S and then scale them by c. Because if M is a matrix and you have a scalar k, then the eigenvalues of kM are k times the eigenvalues of M.

So, the Pauli matrices (including σy) have eigenvalues ±1. So S, which is σy, has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So multiplying each by c, which is h/(4π), the eigenvalues a of Ay would be (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but let me check the matrix S again. Oh no, wait. S is a 2x2 matrix. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Right. The eigenvalues of this matrix are indeed ±1, because the trace is zero, determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = i^2 = -1* (i^2) is 1? Wait, (i)(-i) is
