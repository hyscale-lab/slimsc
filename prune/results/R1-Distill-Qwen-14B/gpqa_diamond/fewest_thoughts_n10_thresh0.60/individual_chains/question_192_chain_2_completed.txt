Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields around a spherical conductor with a cavity. Hmm, I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges and electric fields. Let me try to break this down.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, but s must be such that the cavity is entirely inside the conductor, right? Because the problem says it's a cavity, so s plus r should be less than R, but maybe that's not too important right now.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l is greater than R, so P is outside the conductor. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Wait, s is the distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity, so it's a vector from conductor's center to the cavity's center.

I'm a bit confused about where the charge is located. Since it's inside the cavity, which is inside the conductor, but the conductor was initially uncharged. Oh wait, conductors with cavities... I think when a charge is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's interior (the cavity's interior) has induced charges on the inner surface. But because the conductor is uncharged, the outer surface must have charges induced as well. Wait, no, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. So the inner surface must have charge -q, because the charge +q induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q as well? Or wait, no. Wait, conductor is neutral, so inner surface has -q, and outer surface must have +q? No, wait, conductor is neutral, so the total charge on it is zero. So if the inner surface has -q, then the outer surface must have +q? No, wait, that would make the total charge +q, which contradicts the conductor being neutral. Oh wait, no. The conductor's own charge is zero. So if a charge +q is in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, leaving the outer surface with +q. But wait, no—because the conductor is neutral, the charges must balance. So inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q? Wait, that would make the conductor's total charge zero because the inner is -q and the outer is +q. No, wait, no: the conductor's own material has no net charge. So the inner surface has -q induced by +q in the cavity. Then, the outer surface must have zero charge? No, that can't be. Because the conductor is neutral, the sum of the inner and outer charges must be zero. So inner is -q, outer must be +q, so the conductor's total is zero. Wait, no, that would sum to zero if inner is -q and outer is +q. So conductor's own charge is zero, so the total must be (-q) + (+q) = 0. Okay, that makes sense.

But wait, when the conductor is neutral, and a charge is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor gets an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface gets a charge of +q? Or is it the other way? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The conductor was uncharged, so the total charge is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) must have a charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, since the conductor has to have a total charge of zero, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because -q (inner) + +q (outer) = 0. Oh wait, no, that would sum to zero. So conductor's net charge is zero, but the outer surface has +q. So what's the electric field outside the conductor?

Wait, outside the conductor, the field is as if the charge were concentrated at the center. So the electric field outside would be the same as if all the outer charge were at the center. But wait, the outer charge is +q, so the field at a point outside the conductor would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So the conductor's induced charges influence the field. But P is outside, so the induced charge on the outer surface is +q. So the field outside should be as if all the charge is at the center. So the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L². Which would make option B correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the charge is placed inside the cavity, not touching the conductor. The conductor's inner surface has -q, outer surface +q. But from the perspective of an external point, the field is due to the outer charge, which is +q, and located at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P's distance from the conductor's center is L, but the distance from the cavity's center is l. And the angle between l and s is theta. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The presence of the cavity's center offset by s from the conductor's center might affect the field inside the conductor, but outside, the field is just due to the outer charge.

Wait, another approach: using Gauss's Law. For a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius larger than R), the enclosed charge is the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So the electric field is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². So regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity, the field outside depends only on the outer charge, which is +q.

So the answer should be option B, which is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the correct answer is B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and its radius is $r$, where $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

To analyze the situation:

1. **Induced Charges**: Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the total charge on the conductor remains zero. The presence of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: Outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is $+q$. By Gauss's Law, the electric field at a point outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface, which in this case is $+q$. The field is radial and spherically symmetric, as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Field at Point $P$**: Since $P$ is outside the conductor and at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]
   The distances $l$, $s$, and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the field outside the conductor because the field is determined solely by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is uniformly distributed.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the denominator is $l^2$, this does not account for the fact that the field outside the conductor depends on $L^2$, not $l^2$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
