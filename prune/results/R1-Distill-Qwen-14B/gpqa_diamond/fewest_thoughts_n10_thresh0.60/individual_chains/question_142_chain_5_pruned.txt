Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think this represents a classical mixture of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. So it's a completely mixed state, right? Because each state is equally probable, each with probability 1/2.

I remember that density matrices are 2x2 for a single qubit. The general form is something like ρ = [[a, b], [c, d]], where a + d = 1 because the trace must be 1. In this case, let's compute what ρ looks like.

Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and 0s elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in the bottom-right. So adding them together gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. Then we multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal element becomes 1/2, and the off-diagonal are 0.

So ρ is:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

I think in terms of the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch vector r is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So let's expand that. The density matrix is (I + (xσx + yσy + zσz))/2. Comparing this to our given ρ:

Given ρ is (I)/2, because both |0⟩ and |1⟩ terms contribute 1/2 each. So that would mean the identity matrix plus zero in the numerator, divided by 2. So r·σ must be zero. Therefore, the vector r is (0,0,0). Because if all components are zero, the vector is the origin.

Wait, another way to look at it: the expectation values for σx, σy, and σz are all zero. Because when you compute ⟨σx⟩, it's Tr(ρ σx). Let's see: σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So Tr(ρ σx) is (1/2)(0 + 0) + (1/2)(0 +0) = 0. Same for σy and σz. So all components of r are zero. So r is (0,0,0), which is option C.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\)
