Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

So, the question is about two reactions involving different reducing agents and their respective starting materials. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Hmm, wait, no, actually, the products are one (R) and the other (S), right? Let me see. The first reaction gives (R) and the second gives (S). So, the two starting materials A and B must be different in a way that when treated with different reducing agents, they produce enantiomers.

The reactions are:
A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

Wait, so LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used in certain conditions, whereas BH3 is maybe used in another context. Oh, wait! BH3 is often used in the hydroboration reaction, but wait, in this case, since it's followed by H+, maybe it's about ketone reductions. Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Oh, wait, no—LiBH4 is a borohydride reducing agent that can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. But wait, wait— BH3 is actually a weaker reducing agent compared to LiBH4, but I might be getting this mixed up. Alternatively, maybe one of them is used for ketone reductions, and the other for something else. Wait, no, wait—LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols, but BH3 alone might not be enough, perhaps needing something else like THF or another Lewis acid to make it active. Oh, right! BH3 is often used as a borane, and when combined with a Lewis acid like THF, it can act as a reducing agent. So, both are reducing agents, but perhaps they're used under different conditions leading to different stereochemical outcomes.

Wait, but the products are ketones? No, wait, no. The product is
