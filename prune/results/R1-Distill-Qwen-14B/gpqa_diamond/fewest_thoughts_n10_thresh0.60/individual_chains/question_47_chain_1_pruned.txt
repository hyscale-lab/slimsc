Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given data. The compound is C9H11NO2, and there are IR and 1H NMR spectra provided. Let me start by breaking down the information.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me think about the possible functional groups. The O2 suggests two oxygen-containing groups, maybe ester, amide, or something else. The IR data might help here.

Looking at the IR peaks: there's a strong band around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. The broadness might suggest N-H because O-H can sometimes be broader, but it depends. Also, the strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is a key clue. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from an ester, amide, or maybe a ketone. But given the molecular formula and the options, it's likely an ester or amide.

Next, the 1H NMR data. Let's list them out:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That looks like a methyl group attached to an oxygen, maybe a CH2CH3 group, like in an ethyl ester. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, so the neighboring group is probably a CH2.
- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. A broad singlet could be an OCH2 group, perhaps in an ester or amide. Alternatively, it might be an NH group, but the integration is 2H, which is more than just an NH proton. Wait, but in an amide, the NH might be split into something else. Hmm, maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N.
- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. A quartet with 2H. Quartet usually means coupling with three neighbors. So, maybe this is a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in an ester's OCH2CH2 structure. But wait, the 1.20 ppm is a triplet, so maybe the ethyl group is OCH
