Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question again carefully.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in solution with thiocyanate. The concentrations given are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I think I remember that stability constants (β) relate to the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me see, the complexes would be Co(SCN)_n^2+ where n is the number of SCN^- ligands attached.

Wait, the problem specifies the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think that's the Co(SCN)_2 complex. So n=2, right? So the question is about the fraction of Co(SCN)_2 in the solution compared to all possible Co species.

First, I should figure out all the possible species of Co(II) in solution. The complexes can have 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 SCN^- ligands. So the species are:
- Co^2+ (n=0)
- Co(SCN)^+ (n=1)
- Co(SCN)_2 (n=2)
- Co(SCN)_3^- (n=3)
- Co(SCN)_4^2- (n=4)

Wait, but wait a second. The stability constants β are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β is the formation constant for each step. Or, wait, I think β for a complex with n ligands is the overall formation constant, which is the product of the stepwise constants. So β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc., but each step is a separate formation. Or perhaps the β values given are the overall constants for each complex. Hmm, that's a crucial point. Because the way the problem presents the stability
