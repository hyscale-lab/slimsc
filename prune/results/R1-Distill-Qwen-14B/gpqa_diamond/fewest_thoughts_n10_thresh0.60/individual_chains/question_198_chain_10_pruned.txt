Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

The problem says there's a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So I think this involves the formation of complexes between Co(II) and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The blue complex is probably the one with two thiocyanate ions, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the question mentions dithiocyanato, so that's Co(SCN)_2^2+ maybe. Or wait, dithiocyanato might be a complex with two SCN- ions attached. So the species would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), I guess, since Co is +2.

Stability constants (β) are given for β1 to β4. So β1 is for the first complex, probably [Co(SCN)]^+, since β1 is 9. Then β2=40 would be for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, because each step's β is the formation constant for adding another SCN-.

Wait, no. Let me think. The formation constant (β) for the nth complex is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:
Co^(2+) + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n+).

So β1 would be for n=1: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+ → β1=9.
β2 is for n=2: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2=40, so the overall β for the second complex [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be β1 * β2 = 9*40=360.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the overall formation constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is K2 = β1
