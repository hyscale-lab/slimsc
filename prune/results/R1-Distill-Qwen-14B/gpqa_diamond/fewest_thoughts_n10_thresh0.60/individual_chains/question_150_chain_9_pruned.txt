Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and the compound undergoes a series of reactions. I need to figure out the structure of the final product after these reactions.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). 

Hmm, NMR peaks can give clues about the functional groups and substituents. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet, which is quite upfield. That's a strong deshielded proton. Usually, aldehyde protons appear around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like an alcohol, but more likely aldehyde since that's around 9-10.

Wait, but waitâ€”some other functional groups can have protons in that region. For example, aromatic protons next to electrondonating groups? Or maybe a carbonyl group. But wait, I think the key here is the triplet. The aldehyde proton is usually a singlet because it's adjacent to a carbonyl group which doesn't have any protons. So if it's a triplet, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Or perhaps it's coupled with another proton. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinylic proton in some conjugated system.

Alternatively, maybe the 9.72 is an NH proton, but then why is it a triplet? Wait, no, NH protons usually are broad or singlets depending on exchange. Maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents causing a triplet. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Looking at the other peaks: the 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets with 2H each. Those could be part of an aromatic ring. Like, maybe a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but two doublets with 2H each could indicate two sets of substitu
