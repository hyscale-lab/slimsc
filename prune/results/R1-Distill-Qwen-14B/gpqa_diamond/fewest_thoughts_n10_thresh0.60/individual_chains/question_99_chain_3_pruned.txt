Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, and I need to choose the correct one based on the spectral information provided.

First, looking at the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The fact that it's very broad suggests it's a carboxylic acid because alcohols have a less broad peak, and the -OH in carboxylic acids tends to be broader due to hydrogen bonding. Also, I remember that carboxylic acids have a strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1, which matches the second peak mentioned in the FTIR. So that's a key point—the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data. It says that several peaks were observed, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the structure doesn't have any double bonds, which rules out any possibility of that. That makes sense because all the options provided are carboxylic acids and don't have double bonds.

Now, looking at the splitting patterns in the NMR. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, splitting patterns can be tricky, but let me think about how they arise. Each split is due to coupling with neighboring protons.

A doublet of triplets implies that the proton is next to two sets of neighboring protons. Let's break that down. A doublet comes from coupling with one neighboring group, and a triplet from another. So, maybe the proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons each with a different coupling constant.

Wait, the first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's three layers of splitting. Let me break it down:

- Quartet: each of the triplet splits into a quartet. Or wait, no—quartet is the outermost, then triplet, then doublet. Wait, no, the order might matter. The splitting is hierarchical. So a quartet is split into a triplet, which is then split into a doublet? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the number of neighboring protons. For example, a quartet (q) would come from coupling with three equivalent protons (n+1, where n=3). A triplet (t) would be two equivalent protons. A doublet (d) is one proton.

Alternatively, each split is due to neighboring groups. So a doublet of triplets: the proton is next to a group that gives a doublet (like one neighbor) and
