Okay, so I have this multiple-choice chemistry problem about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigma-tropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond to a sigma bond, like in Cope and Claisen rearrangements. These are usually thermally induced, so the presence of heat is a clue.

The problem has three separate reactions, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C. Then, match them with the options given. Let me tackle each part one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amineâ€”so that's N-methoxymethyl group attached to an amine. Structure-wise, it's like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. And but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Or wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2-OH with a double bond at position 3. Let me write their structures properly.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the butenol. The double bond is between C3 and C4, but wait, butenol has four carbons. So structure is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, wait no. But-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CH-CH2-OH? No, wait the numbering must be correct. Oh wait, I think it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The correct structure for but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Or is it CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, that can't be because but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol: positions are 2 and 3 for the hydroxyl and the double bond. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(OH
