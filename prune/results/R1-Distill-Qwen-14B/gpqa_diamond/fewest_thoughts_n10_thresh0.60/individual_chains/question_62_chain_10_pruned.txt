Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents needed to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. So, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's see: The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, at the 1 position (probably the position adjacent to the aldehyde), there's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the same carbon. Wait, no, maybe it's a substituent on the cyclohexane. Let me think again.

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde has a substituent at position 1. So, the cyclohexane ring has a CHO group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the same carbon, which is carbon 1.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡C- attached. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a triple bond to a CH2 group? Or maybe it's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group directly attached? Like, cyclohexane-C≡CH. Wait, ethynyl is the substituent, so the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡C-H group. So, like cyclohexyl-ethyne.

Our goal is to get from ethynylcyclohexane to this substituted cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me think about the possible
