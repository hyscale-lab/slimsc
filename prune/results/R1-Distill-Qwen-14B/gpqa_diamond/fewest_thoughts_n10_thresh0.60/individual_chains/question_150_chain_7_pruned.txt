Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

So, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and I need to figure out what the structure is before and after a series of reactions. The reagents are 1. NaNO2 + HCl, 2. H2O, 3. aq. KOH, Heat.

Wait, I think NaNO2 and HCl usually lead to diazotization, right? So that's for aromatic amines, like aniline derivatives. Then H2O... maybe hydrolysis? And then aqueous KOH with heat—maybe some kind of elimination or saponification? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Looking at the NMR first. The 1H-NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm triplet, 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the structure.

- 6.98 ppm doublet, 2H. That looks like aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted? Because in para substitution, the coupling is usually between two sets of two protons each.

- 6.51 ppm doublet, 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. Maybe ortho or meta, but given that the first set is a doublet, perhaps another para coupling. So maybe two aromatic rings, each with substituents.

- 6.27 ppm broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet—maybe some sort of exchange, like an -OH group? Or maybe coupling with an aldehyde or something else. Wait, but in aromatic regions, a broad peak could be something like an enol.

- 3.66 ppm doublet, 2H. That's probably a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, maybe oxygen. So maybe OCH2 or something similar.

Putting this together: the molecule has an aldehyde group (9.72 ppm), two aromatic rings (the two doublets around 6.98 and 6.51), a possibly enolic proton (6.27, broad), and a CH2 group
