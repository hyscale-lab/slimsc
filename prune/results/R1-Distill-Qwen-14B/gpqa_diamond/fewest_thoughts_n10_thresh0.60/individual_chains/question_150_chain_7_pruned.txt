Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what I can remember. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and then determining the product after a series of reactions.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is9, N is 1, O is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. So maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), a double bond (1), and a ring plus a double bond? Wait, 3 from benzene, then maybe a carbonyl group (which is a double bond, that's 1 more, total 4), and another double bond or ring? Or maybe another ring? I'm a bit confused, but perhaps the NMR will help more.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm triplet (1H). That's a pretty high shift, possibly an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Then, 6.98 ppm doublet (2H), 6.51 ppm doublet (2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because doublets for each pair of protons, which is typical for a para-disubstituted benzene. So maybe a phenyl group attached somewhere.

Next, 6.27 ppm broad singlet (2H). Broad suggests maybe some exchange or possibly an enol proton. Also, 3.66 ppm doublet (2H). That's probably a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, maybe oxygen. So like OCH2 or something similar.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. The aldehyde is at 9.72 as a triplet. The para-substituted benzene (the 6.98 and 6.51 peaks). Then, the 6.27 ppm could be another double bond in the structure, maybe an enol form. And the 3.66 ppm is probably a CH2 connected to something like an oxygen.

Wait, another possibility: the aldehyde is part of a larger chain. Maybe the molecule has a benzene ring connected to an aldehyde group, and another substituent. Let me think: if there's an aromatic ring (from the 6.98 and 6.51 peaks), perhaps the molecule is a diaryl compound, like two benzene rings attached to a chain.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the molecular weight. C8 is 12*8=96, H9 is 9, N is 14, O is 16. Total is 136 g/mol. Hmm, doesn't ring a bell
