Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated gives B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius. Then there's something about a product involving a keto acid reacting with X having two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog.

Hmm, first, I need to figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Let's break it down.

Starting with the gas W: the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So if protons are equal to neutrons, that means the molecule is probably a noble gas or something symmetrical. Let's think about possible gases. For example, O2 has 8 protons each, so each O has 8, but O2 would have 16 protons and neutrons? Wait, no, that's per molecule. Wait, no, the molecule would have atoms, each with p and n. So W's molecule: same number of protons and neutrons in each atom. So for example, if it's a molecule of Cl2, each Cl atom has 17 protons and 18 neutrons (for the common isotope). That's not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's CO2? No, that's a molecule, but I think the question says W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Oh wait, the molecule's total protons and total neutrons are the same? Like, maybe a molecule where each atom contributes to that.

Alternatively, the molecule itself is made of atoms where each has same number of protons and neutrons. So, for example, an isotope where p = n. So, like,  ^6Li has 3p and 3n. Or ^4He has 2p and 2n. Or ^12C which has 6p and 6n.

Wait, but the gas is probably a simple one. Let's think about possible gases that could be released when a metal reacts with a liquid. Metal reacting with acid, maybe? Or another reaction.

Wait, the reaction
