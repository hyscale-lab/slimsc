Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't think I have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm. So, since all the charges are the same, this is a problem about electrostatic potential energy. I remember that the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula, but wait, potential energy for a system of multiple charges. Oh right, the formula for the potential energy of a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Wait a minute, the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r. But when you have multiple charges, you have to calculate all possible pairs. So for n charges, the total potential energy is (1/2) * n * (n-1) * U for each pair? Or wait, maybe it's (1/2) times the sum of all pairs' energies.

Wait, no, the formula is actually that the total potential energy U_total is (1/2) * sum over all pairs. Because each pair is counted once. So for each pair, the potential energy is k*(q1*q2)/r, and since all pairs are unique, you sum all of them and then multiply by 1/2 to avoid double-counting. Right.

In this problem, we have 13 charges. One is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So the setup is like this: the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2 meters around it?

Wait no, the problem doesn't say they're equally spaced, just that each is 2 m from P. So all 12 are at the same distance from P, which is 2 m.

So the charges are all 2e. Let me note the charge: each has charge q = 2e, so q = 2 * 1.6e-19
