Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about charges and potential energy. Let's see what it's asking. Hmm, it says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, so each has a charge twice that of a proton, right? Because e is the elementary charge.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th is fixed at point P. Oh, so point P is where the 13th charge is, and the others are all 2 meters away from there. I'm trying to visualize this. Like, the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are arranged in a sphere around it, each at a radius of 2 meters.

The question is about finding the minimum energy of this system. Since it's an isolated system, I guess we're talking about the electrostatic potential energy. Energy is usually minimized in such configurations, so I don't think it's a trick question. Probably, I need to calculate the potential energy between all the charges.

Wait, but how? Let's think. The potential energy in a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So every pair of charges contributes some energy. Since all are identical, maybe there's a formula for that.

Each charge is 2e, so the elementary charge is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 * 1.6e-1
