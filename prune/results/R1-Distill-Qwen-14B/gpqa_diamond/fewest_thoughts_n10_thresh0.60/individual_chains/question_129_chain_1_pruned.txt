Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slowly.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps and some hints given, so I'll need to unpack each part carefully.

First, let me outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E's IR has a strong peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclo compounds with ketone groups.

Let me start by considering each step and what each reaction implies.

Step 1: A + HCN → B
HCN is a nucleophile. When ketones react with HCN, they typically form cyanohydrins. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. The mechanism is probably addition of HCN to the carbonyl group, forming a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

Step 2: B → C via H2 and Pd
Hydrogenation with Pd usually reduces functional groups. The cyanohydrin (B) has an alcohol (-OH) and a nitrile (-CN) group. Hydrogenation of nitriles typically converts them into amines. So, the -CN in B would reduce to -CH2NH2? Or wait, wait. No, under hydrogenation with Pd, nitriles (R-C≡N) generally reduce to amines (R-CH2-NH2). Alternatively, maybe they could reduce further, but I think typically they become primary amines. So in compound C, the nitrile becomes an amine. Also, the alcohol group might be affected. Wait, H2 with Pd is usually for hydrogenation, but what about the -OH group. Oh, hydrogenation with Pd is probably under conditions that also protonate. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Another possibility: perhaps the cyanohydrin is a secondary alcohol. When hydrogenated, the nitrile group (C≡N) would become CH2NH2, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think again. Oh wait, cyanohydrin is a compound where a carbonyl has been converted into a geminal diol with a nitrile group attached. So, for example, if A is cyclopentanone, then B would be cyclopentane cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group adjacent.

Hydrogenation of B would add H2 across the triple bond of
