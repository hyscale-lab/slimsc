Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from it. But wait, the question gives me a bunch of other details about the planets and the star. Let me try to break this down.

First, let me list out what I know. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which probably means the same reflectivity, so that might not matter in the calculation.

The question says that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 induces a 0.04 Å shift. Oh wait, I think this has to do with the radial velocity method. The Doppler shift tells us about the planet's mass and the velocity of the star. But how does that relate to the planet's equilibrium temperature?

I remember that the Doppler shift (or radial velocity) depends on the mass of the planet and the size of the orbit. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(something), but maybe I'm getting the exact formula wrong. But wait, for circular orbits, e is zero, so that term goes away. Also, since both planets are detected via RV, their masses are influencing the star's motion.

But wait, maybe I don't need the exact masses here. The question gives me the Doppler shifts caused by each planet on the same line. The shift is proportional to the star's velocity, which in turn depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period and distance. But I don't have the periods or distances. Hmm.

Alternatively, the Doppler shift can be related to the velocity of the star. The Doppler shift
