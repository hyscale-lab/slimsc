Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but let me think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, parallax is a measure of distance, right? Oh wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is high, the object is closer, and if plx is low, it's farther away.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). But since plx is inversely proportional to distance r (plx = 1/r, approximately for small angles), I can write plx as proportional to 1/r. So plx = k/r, where k is some constant. 

Wait, let me get that right. Parallax plx is in arcseconds, and is equal to 1 AU divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcsec) = 1 / (distance in parsecs). So yes, plx is inversely proportional to distance r. So plx = 1/(r), but wait, not exactly 1 over r, because r is in parsecs and plx is in arcsec. But for the sake of proportionality, it's enough to say plx is proportional to 1/(r).

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Substituting plx with 1/r, we get N proportional to 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait
