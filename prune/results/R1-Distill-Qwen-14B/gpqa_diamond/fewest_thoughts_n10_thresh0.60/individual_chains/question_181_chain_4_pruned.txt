Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain part of the fusion process stops. I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any changes in the Sun's core would take that time to reach us. But since it's been 8.5 minutes, any effects would have reached Earth, right?

The question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to find flux1/flux2.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I think the proton-proton chain in the Sun has two main branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, which produces helium-4, and the pp-II branch produces lithium-7? Or was that the CNO cycle? Hmm. Wait, no, the CNO cycle is a different fusion process. Let me get this straight.

The proton-proton chain has two branches. The pp-I branch is the dominant one where two protons fuse to deuterium, then another proton combines to form helium-3, and then two helium-3 combine to make helium-4. The pp-II branch is when a helium-3 combines with a helium-4 to make helium-7, which then captures a proton to become carbon-12. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, maybe I should look up what the pp-III branch is. Oh wait, this is a thought process, so I'll have to rely on what I remember.

Wait, I think the pp-III branch is another part of the proton-proton chain. Oh, maybe it's a higher energy path. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is not the main contributor but is involved in producing high-energy neutrinos. I've heard that about 99% of solar neutrinos come from the pp-I branch, and a small fraction from other sources like the CNO cycle. But I'm not sure about the pp-III branch.

Wait, the question specifies that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. So if that's the case,
