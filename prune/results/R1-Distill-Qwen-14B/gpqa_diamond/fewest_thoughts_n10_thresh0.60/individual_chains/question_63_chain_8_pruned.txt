Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon. The options are A to D.

Wait, diatomic molecules have both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The quantum rotation-vibration model probably combines both. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, right? So the first excited state would involve either a change in vibrational, rotational, or both.

But wait, the problem says "next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, I think that refers to the next higher energy state overall, which I think is when the vibrational state increases by one. Because in the rotation-vibration model, the vibrational energy is much larger than rotational in steps. Or maybe it's the next state in the same rotational level but higher vibrational? Wait, no, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

But the question is about the photon causing the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest possible energy transition. Since vibrational transitions require higher energy (because w is higher frequency), perhaps the next state is a rotational one.

Wait, no. The energy levels for rotation
