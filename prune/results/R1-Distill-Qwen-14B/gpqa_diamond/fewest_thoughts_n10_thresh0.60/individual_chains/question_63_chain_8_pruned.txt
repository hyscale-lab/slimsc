Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state, and it's supposed to absorb a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon. The options are A to D, each with different values.

First, I remember that in such models, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. Oh wait, the non-rigid rotor model is sometimes called the rotation-vibration model, so it includes both aspects.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state should be the lowest energy state, right? So I think the fundamental state is the ground state, which for rotation would be the J=0 state, and for vibration, it's the n=0 state (the lowest vibrational state).

But wait, the question is about switching to the next state. So the molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the next higher energy state. But what's the next state? Because in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the transition could involve a change in either rotation, vibration, or both.

Wait, the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So I think it refers to the next higher energy state, which is the smallest possible increase in energy. That would probably be the first excited state.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And in the harmonic oscillator model, vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h nu, where nu is the frequency.

But this is a non-rigid rotor, so perhaps the bond length isn't fixed, but I think for the purposes of calculation, maybe we approximate it as a rigid rotor? Or maybe not. Wait, the rotational part might still be handled similarly, but the vibrational part could have different parameters.

Wait, the problem gives the angular frequency w as 4e14 rad/s. Angular frequency is omega, which relates to the frequency nu as omega = 2 pi nu. So nu would be omega/(2 pi).

The molecular bond length is given as 2 angstroms. Hmm. I think the moment of inertia for the diatomic molecule is important here. The moment of inertia I is
