Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting from the given options. Let me try to think through this step by step.

So, the question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like and have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. They have the same mass. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is P2, and P1 = P2 / 3. Wait, no, actually, the question says the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter. So, if Planet_2's period is, say, 100 days, Planet_1's is about 33 days. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because it has a shorter orbital period.

Both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radius, but the star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star with Planet_2. So, Star_1 (Planet_1's star) has mass M1 = 2 * M2, where M2 is the mass of Star_2.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting. So, I need to find which planet has a higher transit probability.

Transit probability depends on several factors. I remember that the probability is roughly proportional to (R_p / a)^2, where R_p is
