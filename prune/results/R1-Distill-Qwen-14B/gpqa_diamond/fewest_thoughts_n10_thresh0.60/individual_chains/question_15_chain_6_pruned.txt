Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what do I remember about transiting planets? I think a transit happens when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the orientation of the orbit.

The question says both planets were detected via the RV method. So we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, both orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is more massive (twice as much as Planet_2's star).

The researchers want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. So I need to figure out which one has a higher transit probability.

Wait, transit probability factors. I recall that the transit probability (p) for a planet is given by p = R_p² / (R_s²) multiplied by (a / (R_s)) or something. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again. Oh right, the formula for the probability that a planet will transit is approximately R_p / R_s, but wait, no, that's maybe the depth. The probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital plane's area that is aligned with our line of sight. Hmm.

Wait, the probability is actually the ratio of the size of the star's disk as seen from Earth compared to the planet's orbital plane. I think the formula is roughly (R_s) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The transit probability is given by the area of the star divided by the area of the planet's orbit. But no, wait, more accurately, the probability is the fraction of the orbit where the planet's path intersects the star's disk. Since the orbits are circular and edge-on transits occur when the inclination is 90 degrees.

Wait, no, the probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, when viewed edge-on from Earth, causes a transit. I think the probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not sure
