Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question says that 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene is reacted with maleic anhydride, and we need to find the major product among the four options given.

Hmm, I remember that maleic anhydride is a dienophile. So this must be a Diels-Alder reaction. Right, the Diels-Alder reaction is between a diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered cyclic adduct, usually bicyclic if the diene is part of a ring.

Wait, the diene here is cyclopenta-1,3-diene with a fluorine substituent at position 5. So the structure of 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene... Let me visualize that. Cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, but wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene has two double bonds? Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclopentadiene is usually 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which has a conjugated diene. So 5-fluoro would be on the fifth carbon. Wait, cyclopentadiene has five carbons, so the positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So positions 1 and 3 are double bonds, which is a bit confusing. Wait, no, 1,3-diene in a five-membered ring would have double bonds between 1
