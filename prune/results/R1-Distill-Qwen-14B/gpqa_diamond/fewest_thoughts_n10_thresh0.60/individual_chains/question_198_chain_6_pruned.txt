Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. 

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, so these are for the complexes [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or maybe another order? Not sure, but I think each β corresponds to the next complex.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So we're looking for the concentration of this species relative to all possible cobalt species.

I think I need to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum them up, but since the question only asks for the blue ones (which are the dithiocyanato, the second complex), I need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 out of all the complexes.

The approach is probably using the formation of complexes step by step. Each step adds another SCN^- ion.

The general formula for each complex in terms of the previous one is:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(charge) = β_n * [Co(SCN)_{n-1}]^{charge-} * [SCN^-]

But wait, actually, the formation of each complex is a stepwise process. So the fraction of each complex depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The problem is about finding the distribution of each complex when multiple can form. I think the method involves using the formation constants and the concentrations to find the distribution of each species.

Alternatively, I've heard of the "log K method" and the "method of successive approximation," but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should recall the general approach.

The formation of the complexes can be thought of as a series of reactions:

1. Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [
