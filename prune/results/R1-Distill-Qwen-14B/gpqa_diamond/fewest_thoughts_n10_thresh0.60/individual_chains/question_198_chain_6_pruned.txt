Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with coordination chemistry, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, dithiocyanato... so that's the complex with two SCN- ligands. So the blue complex is the one with two SCN- attached. I think the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^m+. The stability constants βn are the formation constants for each step. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)2]^, and so on.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about how these stability constants are defined. Stability constant βn is usually the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n ligands. So for each step, it's adding a ligand. So to get [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)+, each β is the step-wise formation constant.

So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n)+ would be the product of β1 to βn. Or wait, maybe each βn is the cumulative constant for the nth complex. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I think the stability constants given are the stepwise ones. So β1 is K for [Co(SCN)]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-. β2 is the K for adding another SCN^- to form [Co(SCN)_2]^2-.

Wait, no, the way it's usually defined, βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So for n=1, β1 is K for [CoSCN]^+ formation. For n=2, β2 would be the K for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-} formation, but wait, that might not be the case. Alternatively, step-wise β is the constant for adding each SCN. So β1 is the K for the first ligand, β2 is the K for adding the second ligand given the first is already bound, etc. So the overall K for the second complex would be β1*β2.

But the question gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that's a bit odd because the values don't necessarily follow a particular trend. Let me think: if βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex, then [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} has a stability constant βn. But if they are step-wise, then each βn is the addition of the nth ligand.

Wait, maybe the problem says β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So [Co(SCN)]^
