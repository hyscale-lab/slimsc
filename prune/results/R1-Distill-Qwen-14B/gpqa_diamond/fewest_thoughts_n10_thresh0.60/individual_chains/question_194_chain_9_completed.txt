Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Let me try to think this through step by step. Hmm. Alright, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Or is it exp(-E/(kT))? Oh wait, since β is 1/(kT), it's exp(-β E).

So, each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I guess I need to calculate the energy for each state and then sum up the Boltzmann factors.

Let me list all possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all eight states. Because that could take some time, but perhaps I can find the possible values of the energy H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Wait, H is the sum of the products of each pair. So each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So for each pair, their product is +1 if they are the same, and -1 if different.

So H can range from some minimum to maximum. Let's see, how many terms are there? There are three terms: S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. Each can be +1 or -1, so the sum H can be:

Each term contributes either +1 or -1. So the maximum sum would be when all three terms are +1: H = 3. The minimum would be when all three are -1: H = -3. But wait, is that possible?

Wait, can all three terms be +1? Let's see: S1S2 = 1 implies S1 = S2. Similarly, S1S3=1 implies S3=S1, and S2S3=1 implies S3=S2. So if S1 = S2 = S3, then all three products are 1. So H =3 is possible.

What about when all three terms are -1? That would require S1S2 = -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.

If S1S2=-1, S1 and S2 are opposite. Similarly, S1S3=-1 implies S3 opposite to S1. So S3 would be same as S2. Then S2S3 = S2 * S3 = S2*(same as S2) = 1. Oh wait, that's a problem because we wanted S2S3 = -1. So that can't happen. So it's impossible for all three terms to be -1.

Hmm, so H can't be -3. So what are the possible values of H?

Let me think of how many terms can be +1 or -1.

Case 1: All three terms are +1: H=3 → possible.

Case 2: Two terms +1, one -1: H=2*(1) + (-1) = 1. How many ways can this happen?

Wait, let's think: For H=3, only one state: all spins same.

For H=1: let's see. Let me think of the possible configurations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate H for each possible state.

But wait, maybe I can model this using the number of pairs that are aligned. So each pair contributes +1 if aligned (same spin), -1 if anti-aligned.

Alternatively, let me think about the three spins. Let's represent each spin as up or down.

There are 8 possible states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → H= (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) → 1+1+1=3 → E = -J*3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 → H= (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) → 1 -1 -1 = -1 → E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, no, wait E is given as -J times H. So E = -J H. So E = -J * H.

So for H=3, E= -3J.

For H=-1, E= J.

Next state:

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1 → H = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) → -1 +1 -1 = -1 → E= J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1 → H = (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) → 1 -1 +1 = 1 → E = -J *1 = -J.

Wait, wait. Let me recount:

Wait S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (1)(-1) = -1.

S1S3 = (1)(-1) = -1.

S2S3 = (-1)(-1) = 1.

So H = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1. So E= -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, no, wait no: E = -J * H. So if H = -1, E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, did I get that right? Let me recheck:

E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ] → E = -J * H.

So H is the sum inside the brackets.

So for state 3: H= -1, so E= -J*(-1) = J.

Hmm, okay. Let's see the next state.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → H = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) → (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1 → E= J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1 → H = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) → (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1 → E= J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1 → H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) → 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1 → E= J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1 → H= 1 + 1 + 1 =3 → E= -3J.

Wait, let me make a table of all 8 states and their H and E.

State | S1,S2,S3 | H | E= -J H
1: 1,1,1 → 3 → E= -3J
2: 1,1,-1 → H= (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)=1-1-1=-1 → E= J
3: 1,-1,1 → H= (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1= -1 → E= J
4: 1,-1,-1 → H= (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1 → E= J
Wait no, wait in state 4, S3=-1, so S1S3= (1)(-1)= -1, S2S3= (-1)(-1)=1.

So H= (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1 → E= J.

Wait, but wait, state 4 has two -1's and a +1. Let me check.

Wait, state 4: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

So S1S2 = (1)(-1) = -1.

S1S3 = (1)(-1) = -1.

S2S3 = (-1)(-1) = 1.

So H= -1 -1 +1 = -1.

E= -J * (-1) = J.

Similarly for state 5: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1.

S1S2= (-1)(1) = -1.

S1S3= (-1)(1) = -1.

S2S3= (1)(1) =1.

H= -1 -1 +1= -1 → E= J.

State 6: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.

S1S2= (-1)(1)= -1.

S1S3= (-1)(-1)=1.

S2S3= (1)(-1)= -1.

H= -1 +1 -1 =-1 → E= J.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1.

S1S2= 1.

S1S3= (-1)(1)= -1.

S2S3= (-1)(1)= -1.

H=1 -1 -1 =-1 → E= J.

Wait, state 7 has S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1.

H= S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

= (1) + (-1) + (-1) → 1-1-1= -1.

E= J.

State 8: All -1. S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → H=3 → E= -3J.

So, now let's tally up how many states give each H.

H=3 → only one state (all +1 or all -1. Wait, wait in the list above, state1 is all +1 and state8 is all -1. Both would have H=3. So H=3 occurs in two states.

Wait, that's a mistake. Because in state1 and state8, H=3, so those are two states, not one.

Wait, wait, looking back:

State1: 1,1,1 → H=3.

State8: -1, -1, -1 → S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → H=1+1+1=3. So that's two states with H=3.

Then the other six states have H=-1. Because states 2-7 all have H=-1. So six states with H=-1.

Wait, so in the 8 possible states, 2 have H=3 and 6 have H=-1.

So the energies are E= -3J for H=3, and E= J for H=-1.

So the partition function Z is the sum over each state of exp( -β E ).

But since multiple states have the same E, we can group them.

Each state with H=3 contributes exp( -β*(-3J) )= exp(3Jβ).

Similarly, each state with H=-1 contributes exp( -β * (J) )= exp( -Jβ ), but wait, no: E= -J H, so if H=-1, E= -J*(-1)= J.

Wait, no: E= -J H → H is the sum inside. So for H=3, E= -3J.

For H=-1, E= J.

So the terms in the partition function are:

Each of the two states with E=-3J → each contributes exp(3Jβ) because E is negative.

Each of the six states with E=J → each contributes exp(-Jβ) because E=J.

So Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp( -Jβ ).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ) → No, because the first term is e^(-3Jβ), but our 2 states contribute e^(3Jβ).

Option B: Z=2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ) → Yes.

Option C: 2 e^(2Jβ)+6 e^(-2Jβ) → Not matching.

Option D: 6 e^(2Jβ) + 2 e^(-2Jβ) → No, doesn't match.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Energy Calculation**:  
   The energy depends on the value of \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \). Each term \( S_iS_j \) is \( +1 \) if the spins are aligned and \( -1 \) if anti-aligned.  
   - For \( H = 3 \): All three spins are aligned (\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 \)), giving \( E = -3J \).  
   - For \( H = -1 \): Two spins are aligned and one is anti-aligned, giving \( E = J \).  

   There are 8 possible states for the three spins. Among these:  
   - 2 states have \( H = 3 \) (all spins \( +1 \) or all spins \( -1 \)).  
   - 6 states have \( H = -1 \) (two spins aligned, one anti-aligned).  

2. **Partition Function**:  
   The partition function is given by \( Z = \sum \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \).  
   - For \( H = 3 \): Each of the 2 states contributes \( \exp(-\beta E) = \exp(3J\beta) \).  
   - For \( H = -1 \): Each of the 6 states contributes \( \exp(-\beta E) = \exp(-J\beta) \).  

   Thus,  
   \[
   Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing with the given options:  
   - **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) → Incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed.  
   - **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) → Correct, matches the derived expression.  
   - **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) → Incorrect, as the exponents are doubled.  
   - **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) → Incorrect, as the coefficients and exponents are mismatched.  

Therefore, the correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
