Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but let me try to think through each part step by step.

The question has three reactions, and each produces a product A, B, or C. The options are given, and I need to match each product to the correct structure.

First, let me understand what's going on in each part.

Starting with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol with H+ and heat. Hmm. Wait, that's an interesting combination. Oh wait, I think this might be a Claisen rearrangement. Claisen rearrangement is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of an allyl vinyl ether to a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. But wait, the starting material here is different. Let me think: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amineâ€”so that's (CH3O)2CHNH2. But wait, when it reacts with but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CH2C(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait no, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH2OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2(OH)CH2? Wait, I might be confusing the structure. Let me draw it. But-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Or wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between C2 and C3, because but-3-en-2-ol is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, butenol nomenclature can be tricky. Maybe it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, butenes are four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2
