Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity technique detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we measure that shift in wavelength.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So the planets are probably in the same mass category, but their orbital periods are what we're comparing.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does the shift relate to the orbital period? I think the shift is related to the star's velocity. The formula I remember is that the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by some equation involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance between them.

Oh right, the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_*))^(2/3) ) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh, wait, perhaps the simplified version is better since the planet mass is much smaller than the star.

Actually, the formula is K = ( (27 * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun's mass, M_* >> M_p, so maybe we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and sin i is close to 1 (assuming the orbits are edge-on, which they usually assume in such cases). Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so that part is 1.

So the formula simplifies to K ≈ ( (27 G )^(1/3) ) * M_p / ( M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )
