Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star move. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a Neptune-like planet. Both are in circular orbits. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find the ratio of their orbital periods, specifically how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, right. The RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for K is related to the planet's mass and the orbit. The formula I remember is K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) something like that. But since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and the stars are similar to the Sun, M_p is negligible compared to M_star. So K simplifies a bit.

Oh right, the formula for K when M_p << M_star is K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p / M_star) )^(1/3)
