Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when we observe the star, its brightness will vary as it rotates—this is similar to how an exoplanet might cause a dip in brightness when it transits in front of the star.

The main point is: to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve, what would be the radius of an exoplanet compared to the star's radius?

Hmm, I remember that the brightness variation due to a planet transit is calculated using the formula for the area blocked. The dip in brightness (the amplitude) is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius. So, when the planet transits, it blocks a fraction of the star's light corresponding to the area of the planet relative to the star.

But in this case, the star isn't just being blocked by a planet; it's the star's own spots that are causing the variation. The spots are cooler, so when they face us (as the star rotates), the star appears slightly dimmer than when the spots are on the far side.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude of the variation. So, the amplitude caused by the spots should be compared to the amplitude that would be caused by a planet transit. So, we need to find Rp such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 equals the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots.

Let me think about the star's brightness variation due to spots. The star's total brightness when spots are visible depends on the area of the spots and their temperature.

The star's surface without spots has a certain flux. Each spot is cooler, so emits less flux. The total flux from the star when spots are visible is (1 - filling factor) * flux of the star's surface plus filling factor * flux of the spots.

Wait, the filling factor is given as 20% for one hemisphere. So, the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere.

Wait, the star's surface is a sphere. One hemisphere is covered, so the area is (1/2) * 4πR² = 2πR². So, the spot area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

The flux from each spot is σT_spot^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The star's flux per unit area is σTeff^4.

So, when spots are on the visible side, the total flux is:

Flux_total = (Area_unspotted * σTeff^4) + (Area_spotted * σT_spot^4).

But wait, Area_unspotted is (Area of hemisphere - Area_spotted) = 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6πR².

So, Flux_total = (1.6πR
