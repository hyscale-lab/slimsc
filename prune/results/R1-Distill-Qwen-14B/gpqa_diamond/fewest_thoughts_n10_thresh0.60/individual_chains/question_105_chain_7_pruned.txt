Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a star similar to the Sun, but with some spots on one hemisphere. These spots cause the star's brightness to vary as it rotates, and this variation can be mistaken for an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The task is to find out what radius an exoplanet would need to have to produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness is called the transit method, and it's used to detect exoplanets. The bigger the planet relative to the star, the more light is blocked, so the bigger the dip in brightness.

In this problem, the star has dark spots covering 20% of one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. But wait, how does that affect the brightness variation?

Wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. But since they are dark, when they're facing us, the star appears slightly dimmer. So the brightness variation is due to the spots changing the observed flux.

If the star didn't have spots, an exoplanet transiting would block some light. The amount of light blocked is (Rp / Rstar)^2, I think. So the relative brightness change (the dip) would be proportional to this.

But in this case, the star's brightness variation isn't from a planet, but from spots. So I need to compute the equivalent dip from the spots and then find what planet size would cause the same dip.

First, let me figure out what the brightness variation caused by the spots is.

The star is a hemisphere covered with spots. So the area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, wait. A hemisphere is half the star's surface, so 20% of a hemisphere would be 0.2 * (4π R² / 2) ), but maybe I should think in terms of the entire star's surface.

Wait, the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the
