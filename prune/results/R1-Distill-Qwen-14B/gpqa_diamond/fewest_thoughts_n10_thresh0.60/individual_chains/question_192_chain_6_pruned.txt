Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields. Let me think through this step by step.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, I remember that when a charge is placed inside a conductor's cavity, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, right? So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor must somehow respond. Oh right, the charges in the conductor will rearrange. The inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q because the conductor is neutral overall. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance.

But wait, no, no, wait. No, the conductor is initially neutral. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the free electrons in the conductor will be attracted to the inner surface, creating an induced charge of -q on the inner surface. Since the conductor's total charge must remain zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral, the outer surface has +q, but wait, the conductor was uncharged before. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, making the total conductor's charge zero? Wait, no, that would make the conductor have a net charge of +q, but the problem says it's uncharged. Hmm, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait no, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have -q because the charge inside the cavity induces opposite charges on the inner surface. Since the conductor's total charge must remain zero (uncharged), the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q to balance, giving a net charge of zero for the conductor. Oh, right, that makes sense.

So from the outside, the conductor behaves as if all the charge is on the outer surface. But wait, the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field there would be the same as if all the charge of the conductor were at the center. Because for a spherical conductor, the electric field outside is like a point charge at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the field outside the conductor should be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / (L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. Because for a spherical shell, the field outside depends only on the total enclosed charge, which in this case is +q.

Wait, but the charge +q is not on the conductor. The conductor's charge is +q on the outer surface. Because the conductor itself was neutral, but the +q in the cavity induced a -q on the inner surface and a +q on the outer surface. So the total
