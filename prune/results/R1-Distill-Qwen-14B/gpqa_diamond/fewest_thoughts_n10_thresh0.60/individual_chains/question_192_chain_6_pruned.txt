Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. 

Wait, I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. So, when a conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges reside on the surface. But in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged. Then, we place a charge inside the cavity. Oh right, when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will induce an opposite charge, and the outer surface will have the same charge as the placed one because the conductor was initially neutral. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the conductor is uncharged. So when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) will have an induced -q charge. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it. So the total charge on the conductor would be +q. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the conductor was initially neutral. So the inner surface gets induced -q, then the outer surface must have +q to make the conductor's total charge zero? No, no, wait. The original charge of the conductor is zero. So the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer. Wait, no. Wait, no. The conductor's total charge is zero. So inner surface is -q, outer must be +q. Because the total is -q + +q = 0. That makes sense.

Now, what about the electric field outside the
