Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. But wait, the question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must obey.

The options given are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The question asks which of the four must be respected by all operators. The possible answers are combinations of these.

Let me think about each symmetry. So, Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. The Standard Model (SM) certainly respects this, so SMEFT, being an effective theory based on SM, must include operators that respect Lorentz symmetry. So all SMEFT operators must preserve Lorentz symmetry, right? So option 1 is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's the full set of symmetries in Minkowski spacetime. But wait, when you have effective theories, especially with higher-dimensional operators, do they necessarily respect Poincare? Or are they only required to respect the symmetries up to the same dimension as the theory? Because the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, I think that all its operators must still respect Poincare symmetry. Because if the underlying theory (SM) respects Poincare, then the effective theory must as well. So option 2 (Poincare) must also be respected. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Now, CP symmetry. CP is Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM isn't CP symmetric because of certain processes like kaon oscillations. Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory built from SM, which already includes terms that violate CP. So the SMEFT operators can have CP violation. So not all operators in SMEFT respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The SM respects CPT symmetry, I believe. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT. Because if the underlying theory respects CPT, then the effective theory must as well. So option 4 must be respected.

So putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected by all
