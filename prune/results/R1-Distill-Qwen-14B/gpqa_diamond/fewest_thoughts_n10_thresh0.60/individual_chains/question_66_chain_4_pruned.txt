Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this SMEFT question. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? So the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Let me think about each symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. So if Poincare is a symmetry, does that mean Lorentz is automatically included? Because the Poincare group is all about spacetime symmetries—rotations, boosts, translations, etc. So if all operators must respect Poincare, then Lorentz is already covered. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So the answer includes whichever symmetries are required for all operators.

Wait, but in SMEFT, the theory is built as an effective theory. Effective theories generally still respect the symmetries of the underlying theory. The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry because it's a relativistic theory. So the SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. But what about Poincare? Well, Poincare includes translations in spacetime, which is more about global symmetries. Wait, but SMEFT is built with operators that are Lorentz scalars—so Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. So operators in SMEFT must have Lorentz symmetry.

Now, what about Poincare? Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. But in an effective theory, you
