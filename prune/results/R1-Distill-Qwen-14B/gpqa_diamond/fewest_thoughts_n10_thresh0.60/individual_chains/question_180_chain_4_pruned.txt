Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. 

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Alright, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but I remember that the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law. The formula is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Wait, but here we have multiple charges. So each of the 12 charges at 2 meters away will interact with the fixed charge at P. Since the system is isolated, I think the energy we're considering is the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 others. Oh, but wait—what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Since they are all at the same point (same distance from P), they are equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2m around P. But wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their mutual distances are variable because they can be anywhere on the surface of that sphere, but each is 2m from P.

Wait, but the minimum energy would be the scenario where the potential energy is the least. Since the charges are all the same sign (they're identical and each 2e), they repel each other. So arranging them in a way that minimizes the potential energy between them would require them to be as far apart as possible. Oh wait, no—wait. Wait, the potential energy between two like charges is positive because you have to do work to bring them together. So if you want to minimize the total potential energy, you'd arrange the charges as far apart as possible, so that the potential energy is as low as possible in positive terms. Hmm, but wait, maybe in this problem, the only interactions are between each of the 12 and the 13th charge. Because the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P
