Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, let me make sure I understand what I'm being asked to do. The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That seems like a pretty complex structure. Enthalpy of formation usually refers to the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, the problem gives me bond energies instead of enthalpies of formation. Oh right, sometimes you can calculate the enthalpy of formation using bond energies.

Let me recall the formula for using bond energies to find enthalpy of formation. I think it's something like the sum of all bond energies in the reactants minus the sum in the products. But wait, no, I think it's the other way around because when bonds form, they release energy (exothermic), and when they break, they absorb (endothermic). So the enthalpy change (ΔH) would be the sum of bond energies broken minus the sum of bonds formed. Or wait, is it the other way? Let me think: when you form a bond, energy is released, so the products have lower energy. So if the reaction is formation, you break bonds in the elements and form bonds in the compound. So the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of bond energies broken (in the reactants) minus the sum of bond energies formed (in the product). Wait, perhaps the formula is: 

ΔHf = [Sum of bond energies of reactants] - [Sum of bond energies of products]

But wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated as the sum of the enthalpies of all bonds in the molecule minus the sum of the enthalpies of the bonds in the elements. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the formation from elements, so the elements are in their standard states, which for carbon is graphite, and hydrogen is H2 gas. So I need to calculate the energy required to break all the bonds in the compound into individual atoms, then form them into the bonds of the product.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the enthalpy change when the molecule is formed from its constituent atoms. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the bonds that are broken in the reactants (like the elements) and the bonds that are formed in the product. But I might be getting this a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, the general approach is:

Enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) = [Sum of bond energies of all bonds in the molecule] - [Sum of bond energies of all bonds in the elements (i.e., C-C, C-H, H-H bonds in the reactants)]

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about it as the energy required to decompose the compound into its constituent atoms, which would be the sum of the bond energies of the compound's bonds. Then, the energy released when those atoms form the molecule. So ΔHf would be the energy released when the molecule forms. But wait, no, enthalpy of formation is the energy change when the compound is formed from elements in their standard states. So the formula is:

ΔHf = [Sum of bond energies in elements (reactants)] - [Sum of bond energies in compound (products)]

Wait, maybe not. Let me get this straight.

The standard enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. The calculation using bond energies typically involves the concept that the energy required to form the compound is the energy needed to break the bonds in the elements minus the energy released when the bonds in the compound are formed.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in reactants) - (sum of bond energies in products)

Wait, wait, maybe it's the other way around. Because when you form the compound, you're creating new bonds, which releases energy. So the total energy is the energy you put in (breaking bonds) minus the energy you get out (forming bonds). So the enthalpy change is the bonds broken (which requires energy) minus the bonds formed (which release energy). So,

ΔHf = (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed)

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think of an example. Suppose I have a molecule like CH4. The formation would involve breaking the C-C bonds (but wait, C is in graphite, which is a network structure, so bond energy for C in graphite is 1000 kJ/mol as given. Wait no, the given data says enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization energy is the energy required to break all bonds in an atom to make it into separate atoms. So for carbon in graphite, each C is bonded to three others, so the bond energy per bond would be 1000 kJ/mol divided by the number of bonds per atom. Hmm, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the enthalpy based on the bonds in the molecule.

Wait, maybe the standard way is to calculate the enthalpy of the molecule as the sum of all bond energies in the molecule minus the sum of bond energies from the elements. Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies in the molecule] - [sum of bond energies from elements]

But wait, the elements are in their standard states. For carbon, it's graphite, and for hydrogen, it's H2 gas. So, to form the molecule, we start with graphite and H2, and form the molecule. So the bonds that are broken are the bonds in the elements, and the bonds formed are the ones in the compound.

Wait, but enthalpy of formation is the energy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements. So the calculation would involve the bonds that are broken in the elements and the bonds that are formed in the compound.

The formula is:

ΔHf (reaction) = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Oh wait, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of all bonds in the molecule) - (sum of bond energies of all bonds in the elements)

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is:

ΔHf = [Σ (bonds broken in reactants) ] – [Σ (bonds formed in products) ]

So for the formation reaction, the reactants are the elements (C and H2), and the product is the molecule. So the bonds broken would be the C-C bonds in graphite and the H-H bonds in H2. The bonds formed would be all the C-C and C-H bonds in the molecule.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to outline the steps properly.

1. Write the formation reaction: The compound is formed from its elements. For example, the given compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's count the number of carbons and hydrogens.

Looking at the formula: each CH3 group contributes 3 Hs. Let me count:

Each (CH3)2C=CH group: 
- two CH3 groups: each has 3 Hs, so 2 *3 =6 Hs.
- Then CH2 has 2 Hs.
- Then CH2 has 2 Hs.
- Then CH(CH3) has 1 H and 3 from CH3.
Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the total number of C and H atoms.

The formula is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH: so that's two CH3 groups attached to a C, which is double-bonded to CH.
So that's 2*(CH3) + C=CH. The CH3 groups contribute 3 H each, so 2*3=6 H. The C=CH has one H (since CH is CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, maybe I'll count the carbons first. Let me parse the formula:

Each (CH3)2C=CH-... So each (CH3)2C= is a group with 3 carbons (the central C connected to two CH3 and one CH).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the entire molecule:

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's count the number of C and H.

Each (CH3) group has 1 C and 3 H. The molecule is:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C (2 CH3 + 1 C) and 6 H (from CH3) + 1 H (from CH). Wait, no, the CH has only one H, right? So 3 C and 7 H?

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me count each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: this is 3 C (the central C, two CH3, and one CH). Each CH3 has 3 H, so two of them give 6 H. The CH has one H. So total H here is 7.

2. Then a single bond to CH2: that's one C, two H. So now H is 7 +2 =9.

3. Then another single bond to CH(CH3): that's one C, and three H (since CH(CH3) has one H on the C and three from CH3. So that's 4 H. Now total H is 9 +4 =13.

4. Then another single bond to CH2: two H. Total H=15.

5. Then another single bond to CH: one C, one H. H=16.

6. Then a double bond to C(CH3)2: that's one C (but it's double bonded), and each (CH3)2 contributes 3 H each, so 6 H. So H=16 +6=22.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing some. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count all the C and H.

Each (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's count the number of C atoms:

Each (CH3)2C=CH is 3 C (2 CH3 and 1 C). Then each -CH2- is 1 C each. Then CH(CH3) is 1 C, CH2 is 1 C, CH is 1 C, and C(CH3)2 is 1 C. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me count each part:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C (two from CH3 and one central).
- Then -CH2-: that's 1 C.
- Then CH(CH3): 1 C.
- Then -CH2-: 1 C.
- Then CH: 1 C.
- Then C(CH3)2: 1 C.

Wait, but that gives 3 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1= 8 C's? No, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each 'C' in this structure:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C (the central C, each CH3 has one C, and the CH has one C. So that's 3 C's.

2. Then -CH2-: another C.

3. Then CH(CH3): another C.

4. Then -CH2-: another C.

5. Then CH: another C.

6. Then =C(CH3)2: another C.

So total C's: 3 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 =8? Wait, that gives 8 C's. But each (CH3)2C=CH has 3 C's, and each C in the chain adds up.

Wait, perhaps the correct count is 10 C's. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps each group: 

The initial group is (CH3)2C=CH. That's:

(CH3)2-C=CH.

So, the central C (attached to two CH3) is connected via a double bond to a CH group.

Then, the chain continues: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So:

- (CH3)2C=CH (3 C's)
- CH2 (1 C)
- CH(CH3) (1 C)
- CH2 (1 C)
- CH (1 C)
- C(CH3)2 (1 C)

So that's 3 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1=8 C's. Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should just consider each carbon in the formula as a separate count.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should instead approach the problem by considering the number of H and C atoms in the molecule, and then calculate the enthalpy based on the bonds broken and formed.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of each type of bond in the molecule and then compute the total bond energies for the molecule and compare it to the bond energies of the elements (C and H2).

So, the steps are:

1. Determine the number of each type of bond in the molecule (C-C, C=C, C-H, H-H).

But wait, H-H bonds are only in H2, so in the molecule, there are no H-H bonds. The molecule may have C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

2. Calculate the total bond energy for all bonds in the molecule.

3. Calculate the bond energies that would be broken to form the molecule from its elements. For carbon, the element is graphite (so C-C bonds), and for hydrogen, it's H2 (so H-H bonds).

4. The enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies broken (in the elements) minus the sum of the bond energies formed (in the molecule).

Wait, but in the molecule, there are no H-H bonds, so the only H-H bonds we need to consider are those that are broken from H2 into individual H atoms. Then, those H atoms form C-H bonds in the molecule.

So the process would be:

a. Break all C-C bonds in the graphite (the elemental form of C) to get individual C atoms. The enthalpy for this is the bond energy of C-C multiplied by the number of C-C bonds broken.

b. Break all H-H bonds in H2 to get H atoms. Each H-H bond broken requires 100 kJ/mol.

c. Form all the bonds in the molecule. These include C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

d. The enthalpy of formation is (a + b) - (sum of bond energies in the molecule).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Because the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when one mole of the compound is formed from the elements. So, the formula is:

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies of reactants (elements)] - [sum of bond energies of products (molecule)]

But the molecule's bonds are the products, so their bond energies would be subtracted, not added.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I can think of it as:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in elements) - (sum of bond energies in molecule)

But wait, when you form the molecule, you're releasing energy (exothermic), so the sum of bond energies in the molecule should be higher than the sum in the elements if the reaction is exothermic.

Wait, no. Because bond energies are the energy required to break the bonds. So, if you have a molecule where a lot of strong bonds are formed, the sum of those bond energies would be higher than the sum of the bonds broken in the elements. So, the enthalpy of formation would be (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed).

Wait, let me think of an example. Suppose we have methane, CH4. To form CH4 from C (graphite) and H2 gas.

The steps:

1. Break C-C bonds in graphite to get individual C atoms. Each C in graphite is bonded to three others, so the bond energy per C-C bond is 1000 kJ/mol (atomization energy) divided by 3, since each C has three bonds. Wait, but bond energy is per mole of bonds. So for one mole of C atoms, you break three moles of C-C bonds (since each C has three bonds in graphite). So the bond energy for breaking C in graphite would be (1000 kJ/mol) * (number of bonds per mole of C). Hmm, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of the element to produce a mole of isolated atoms. For graphite, it's 1000 kJ/mol for C. So, to produce one mole of C atoms, you need to break all the C-C bonds in a mole of graphite. The number of C-C bonds in a mole of graphite is 3/2 moles, because each C has three bonds, and each bond is shared between two C atoms. So the number of bonds per mole is 3/2.

So the bond energy per mole of C-C bonds is 1000 kJ/mol. So for each mole of C atoms, you have to break 3/2 moles of C-C bonds. So the energy for breaking C bonds is (3/2) * 1000 kJ/mol = 1500 kJ per mole of C atoms.

Similarly, for hydrogen, the bond energy is 100 kJ/mol for H-H. To break one mole of H2 into 2 moles of H atoms, you need 100 kJ per mole of H2.

So, for each mole of CH4, which has 4 H atoms, we need 2 moles of H2 (since each H2 gives 2 H atoms). So the H-H bonds broken would be 2 * 100 kJ = 200 kJ.

And for the C, we need 1 mole of C atoms, which comes from breaking 1.5 moles of C-C bonds (since each mole of C has 3/2 C-C bonds). So that's 1.5 * 1000 kJ = 1500 kJ.

So total energy to break bonds in the elements: 1500 (C) + 200 (H) = 1700 kJ.

Now, when forming CH4, we form 4 C-H bonds. Each C-H bond's energy is 400 kJ/mol. Wait, but in the problem statement, the bond energies are given as:

C-C: 200 kJ/mol

C=C: 300 kJ/mol

C-H: 400 kJ/mol

H-H: 100 kJ/mol

So for CH4, each C-H bond contributes 400 kJ when formed. So four C-H bonds would be 4 * 400 = 1600 kJ.

But wait, when bonds form, energy is released. So the total energy change would be (energy required to break bonds) minus (energy released when forming bonds). So:

ΔHf = (1700) - (1600) = 100 kJ/mol.

But wait, the actual enthalpy of formation of methane is known to be about -74.8 kJ/mol, which is exothermic. Hmm, so maybe my approach is incorrect because I'm not accounting for something. Alternatively, perhaps I should have subtracted the other way around.

Wait, maybe I should have done (sum of bonds formed) minus (sum of bonds broken). Because when bonds form, energy is released. So if the bonds formed are stronger (have higher bond energies) than the bonds broken, the reaction is exothermic.

Wait, in the case of CH4, the sum of bonds broken is 1700 kJ, sum of bonds formed is 1600. So 1600 -1700 = -100 kJ, which would be exothermic, but the actual value is -74.8. So perhaps the approach is correct, but the given bond energies in the problem might not be accurate. But in this problem, we're to use the given bond energies regardless of real-world values.

So, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = [sum of bonds broken (in elements)] - [sum of bonds formed (in molecule)]

But wait, in the CH4 example, that would give 1700 - 1600 = 100 kJ/mol. But since CH4 formation is exothermic, the ΔHf should be negative. So perhaps I have the formula reversed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = [sum of bonds formed] - [sum of bonds broken]

In the CH4 case, 1600 - 1700 = -100 kJ/mol, which would be correct in terms of exothermic.

Wait, but in the scenario of forming the molecule, the bonds broken are in the elements, and the bonds formed are in the molecule. So the energy change is:

Energy to break elements' bonds (endothermic) minus energy released when forming molecule's bonds (exothermic). So the net is:

ΔHf = (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed)

Which for CH4 would be 1700 - 1600 = +100 kJ/mol, which contradicts the known ΔHf of CH4, but given the problem's bond energies, it's the correct approach.

Hmm, perhaps that's the way to go.

So, back to the problem. The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

I need to count the number of each type of bond in this molecule.

Let me try to parse the structure and count the bonds.

Each (CH3)2C=CH-... part:

In (CH3)2C=CH, the central C is connected to two CH3 groups and a CH via a double bond. So:

- Each CH3 contributes 3 C-H bonds. There are two, so 2*3=6 C-H bonds.
- The central C is connected to two CH3 groups, so two C-C bonds (but wait, the central C is bonded to each CH3. So each CH3 has a C-C bond with the central C. So two C-C bonds here.
- The central C is double-bonded to the adjacent CH. So that's one C=C bond.

Wait, no, the central C is connected via a double bond to the CH group. So that's a C=C double bond. So that's one C=C bond.

Then, the structure after that is a single bond to CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking this down:

- CH2: single bond to the next group. So, each CH2 contributes two C-H bonds. There are four CH2 groups in the molecule? Wait, perhaps not. Let me count each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C's, with two C-C bonds (to CH3 groups) and one C=C bond (to the CH group).

2. Then a -CH2- group: this is a CH2 group attached to the previous CH. So one C here, with two C-H bonds, and a single bond to the next group.

3. Then -CH(CH3)-: this is a CH group attached to a CH3. So one C here, bonded to the previous CH2 and to the CH3 group. So, this C has three bonds: one to the previous CH2, one to the CH3, and one to the next group (which is CH2). So this would have one C-C bond (to CH2) and a C-C bond to the CH3. Wait, no, the CH3 is connected via a single bond. So in -CH(CH3)-, the central C is bonded to the CH2, the CH3, and another CH2. So two C-C bonds here (to CH2 and CH3).

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each type of bond as I go through the molecule.

Let me try to list each bond and count:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 

   a. Each CH3 has three C-H bonds. Two CH3 groups: 2 *3 =6 C-H bonds.

   b. The central C is connected to each CH3 via single bonds: two C-C bonds.

   c. The central C is double-bonded to the CH group: one C=C bond.

- Then, the CH is connected via a single bond to a CH2 group.

   a. The CH2 has two C-H bonds.

- The CH2 is connected to a CH(CH3) group.

   a. The CH(CH3) has one C-H bond (on the CH) and three C-H bonds from the CH3? Wait no, the CH3 group is attached to the C, so that's three C-H bonds. But the CH itself has one H. So in total, the CH(CH3) has 1 (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) =4 C-H bonds. Wait, but each CH3 has three C-H, yes.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's count all the bonds in the molecule.

Each single bond, double bond, etc.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group:

- The central C is bonded to two CH3 groups and a CH via a double bond.

   So, two single C-C bonds (to CH3 groups), and one double bond (C=C) to the CH.

Each CH3 has three C-H bonds, so two CH3 groups contribute 6 C-H.

The CH group (from the C=C) has one C-H bond.

Then, the chain continues as CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH2 group contributes two C-H bonds.

The CH(CH3) group contributes one C-H (the CH part) and three C-H from the CH3.

The next CH2 group contributes two C-H.

The next CH group contributes one C-H.

The final C=C is a double bond, and each (CH3)2 contributes three C-H each.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

But perhaps I should methodically go through each part of the molecule and count each type of bond.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the number of each bond type by considering the structure.

Let me attempt to visualize the molecule.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me break it down into parts:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : Let's call this part A.

2. CH2- : part B.

3. CH(CH3)- : part C.

4. CH2- : part D.

5. CH- : part E.

6. C(CH3)2 : part F.

Each part is connected by single bonds except for the C=C in part A and E-F.

So, for part A: (CH3)2C=CH-

- The central C (C1) is connected via double bond to the CH group (C2).

- C1 is connected to two CH3 groups (C3 and C4).

So, bonds in part A:

- C1=C2: 1 double bond (counts as 2 bonds).

- C1-C3: single bond.

- C1-C4: single bond.

- Each CH3 (C3 and C4) has 3 C-H bonds each.

- The CH (C2) has one C-H bond.

So for part A:

- C-C bonds: 2 (C1-C3 and C1-C4).

- C=C bonds: 1 (C1=C2).

- C-H bonds: 2 *3 (from CH3) + 1 (from CH) =7.

Now, part B: CH2-

- C5 is connected to C2 (from part A) and C6 (from part C).

- C5 has two H attached.

So bonds in part B:

- C2-C5: single bond.

- C5 has two C-H bonds.

Part C: CH(CH3)-

- C6 is connected to C5 and C7 (from part D).

- C6 is connected to a CH3 group (C8).

So bonds in part C:

- C5-C6: single bond.

- C6-C8: single bond (since CH3 is a single bond).

- C6 has one C-H (the CH part).

- C8 has three C-H bonds.

So, for part C:

- C-C bonds: 2 (C5-C6 and C6-C8).

- C-H bonds:1 (from C6) +3 (from C8) =4.

Part D: CH2-

- C7 is connected to C6 and C9 (from part E).

- C7 has two H attached.

Bonds in part D:

- C6-C7: single bond.

- C7 has two C-H bonds.

Part E: CH-

- C9 is connected to C7 and C10 (from part F).

- C9 has one H attached.

Bonds in part E:

- C7-C9: single bond.

- C9 has one C-H bond.

Part F: C(CH3)2

- C10 is connected to C9 and two CH3 groups (C11 and C12).

- Each CH3 contributes three C-H bonds.

Bonds in part F:

- C9-C10: single bond.

- C10-C11: single bond.

- C10-C12: single bond.

- Each CH3 (C11 and C12) has three C-H bonds. So 2 *3 =6 C-H bonds.

So, summarizing all bonds:

C-C bonds:

- Part A: 2 (C1-C3, C1-C4)

- Part B: 1 (C2-C5)

- Part C: 2 (C5-C6, C6-C8)

- Part D: 1 (C6-C7)

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me recount the C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count all the single and double C-C bonds in the molecule.

Each C-C single bond is a single bond, and each C=C is a double bond.

In the molecule, the double bonds are in part A (C1=C2) and part E-F (C9=C10).

So, for C-C bonds:

- Between C1 and C3: single bond (part A).

- Between C1 and C4: single bond (part A).

- Between C2 and C5: single bond (part B).

- Between C5 and C6: single bond (part C).

- Between C6 and C8: single bond (part C).

- Between C6 and C7: single bond (part D).

- Between C7 and C9: single bond (part E).

- Between C9 and C10: double bond (part F).

- Between C10 and C11: single bond (part F).

- Between C10 and C12: single bond (part F).

Wait, but wait. Let's make a list of all the C-C bonds:

1. C1-C3: single.

2. C1-C4: single.

3. C2-C5: single.

4. C5-C6: single.

5. C6-C8: single.

6. C6-C7: single.

7. C7-C9: single.

8. C9-C10: double.

9. C10-C11: single.

10. C10-C12: single.

Wait, but this can't be correct because each C can have only four bonds. Let me recount.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by numbering all the carbons and their connections.

Let me assign numbers:

C1: central in (CH3)2C=CH-

C2: double bonded to C1.

C3: CH3 attached to C1.

C4: another CH3 attached to C1.

Then, C5 is connected to C2 and part B.

C5 is connected to C2 and C6.

C6 is connected to C5, C7, and a CH3 (C8).

C7 is connected to C6 and C9.

C9 is connected to C7 and C10 (double bond).

C10 is connected to C9, C11, and C12 (each CH3).

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the structure. Let me try to draw the structure step by step.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it into parts:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : C1 is connected to two CH3 groups (C3 and C4) and a CH group (C2) via double bond.

2. -CH2- : C5 connected to C2 and C6.

3. -CH(CH3)- : C6 connected to C5, C7, and a CH3 (C8).

4. -CH2- : C7 connected to C6, C9.

5. -CH- : C9 connected to C7 and C10 (double bond).

6. -C(CH3)2 : C10 connected to C9, C11, and C12 (each CH3).

So now, the C-C bonds:

- C1-C3: single.

- C1-C4: single.

- C1=C2: double.

- C2-C5: single.

- C5-C6: single.

- C6-C7: single.

- C6-C8: single.

- C7-C9: single.

- C9-C10: double.

- C10-C11: single.

- C10-C12: single.

So, total C-C bonds:

- Single bonds:

   C1-C3, C1-C4, C2-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7, C6-C8, C7-C9, C10-C11, C10-C12.

That's 9 single C-C bonds.

- Double bonds:

   C1=C2 and C9=C10. So two double bonds.

Wait, but each double bond is a single bond in count? No, each double bond is one bond but with two bond orders. Wait, no, each double bond is counted as two bonds. But for the purpose of bond energy, a double bond would contribute twice as much as a single bond.

So, for C-C bonds:

Each single C-C contributes 200 kJ/mol.

Each double C=C contributes 300 kJ/mol.

So, the total C-C bond energy is:

9 single C-C bonds: 9 * 200 = 1800 kJ/mol.

2 double C=C bonds: 2 * 300 = 600 kJ/mol.

Wait, wait: no, each double bond is a single instance but has two bonds. So for bond energy calculations, each double bond contributes twice the single bond's energy. So, the total C-C bonds in the molecule are:

Number of single C-C bonds: 9.

Number of double C=C bonds: 2.

Each single C-C contributes 200, each double contributes 200*2 =400. Wait, no, the given bond energy for C=C is 300 kJ/mol. So each C=C bond contributes 300 kJ/mol.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each bond as contributing its respective value. So, each single C-C bond contributes 200, each double C=C contributes 300.

So, the total C-C bond energy is 9 *200 + 2 *300 = 1800 + 600 = 2400 kJ/mol.

Now, the C-H bonds.

Each C-H bond contributes 400 kJ/mol.

We need to count all C-H bonds in the molecule.

Let me go through each part:

Part A: (CH3)2C=CH-

- Each CH3: 3 C-H each. 2 CH3 → 6.

- CH group: 1 C-H.

Total in part A: 7.

Part B: CH2-

- 2 C-H.

Part C: CH(CH3)-

- CH part: 1 C-H.

- CH3: 3 C-H.

Total: 4.

Part D: CH2-

- 2 C-H.

Part E: CH-

- 1 C-H.

Part F: C(CH3)2.

- Each CH3:3 C-H.

2 CH3 →6.

So, adding all C-H bonds:

Part A:7.

Part B:2.

Part C:4.

Part D:2.

Part E:1.

Part F:6.

Total C-H bonds:7+2=9; 9+4=13; 13+2=15; 15+1=16; 16+6=22.

So 22 C-H bonds. Each contributes 400 kJ, so 22 *400 = 8800 kJ/mol.

H-H bonds in the molecule: none, as the molecule is all single bonds and no H-H present.

Now, the bonds in the elements (reactants) that are broken are:

Carbon in graphite: each C is bonded to three others. To get one mole of C atoms, you need to break 1.5 moles of C-C bonds (since each bond is shared between two C atoms). The bond energy per mole of C-C is 200 kJ/mol. So, 1.5 * 200 = 300 kJ per mole of C atoms.

Hydrogen in H2: each mole of H2 has one mole of H-H bonds. To get 2 moles of H atoms, you need to break 1 mole of H-H bonds. Each H-H is 100 kJ/mol. So, 1 *100 =100 kJ.

So, total bond energy broken in reactants (elements):

For carbon: 300 kJ.

For hydrogen: 100 kJ.

Total: 400 kJ.

Now, the bonds formed in the molecule are C-C, C=C, and C-H.

Total bond energy in the molecule:

C-C: 9 *200 =1800.

C=C: 2*300=600.

C-H:22*400=8800.

Total: 1800 +600 +8800 = 11200 kJ/mol.

So, the ΔHf is (sum of bonds broken in elements) - (sum of bonds formed in molecule).

Wait, but according to the formula: ΔHf = (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed).

So, 400 (bonds broken) - 11200 (bonds formed) = -10800 kJ/mol.

But wait, that would make the enthalpy of formation very negative, which is unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula reversed.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bonds formed) - (sum of bonds broken).

In this case:

11200 - 400 = 10800 kJ/mol.

But wait, that would imply a very endothermic reaction, which again seems unlikely for a hydrocarbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm accounting for the bonds. Let me think again.

The process is:

1. Break bonds in elements: C-C in graphite and H-H in H2. This requires energy, which is endothermic.

2. Form bonds in the molecule: C-C, C=C, and C-H. This releases energy, which is exothermic.

So, the net enthalpy change is the energy required to break bonds minus the energy released when forming bonds.

So, ΔHf = (energy to break bonds) - (energy released by forming bonds) = (400) - (11200) = -10800 kJ/mol.

But wait, that would be a very large negative value, which seems unrealistic. The options provided don't include such a number. The options are A) 11200, B)67.4, C)11.44 (per gram), D)1900 (per gram).

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the number of bonds.

Wait, let me recount the C-C bonds. Earlier, I counted 9 single C-C bonds and 2 double C=C bonds.

But wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the structure should have more carbons. Let me recount the C-C bonds.

Alternative approach: Each single bond contributes one C-C, each double as one C=C.

Let me list each C-C single bond:

- C1-C3: yes.

- C1-C4: yes.

- C2-C5: yes.

- C5-C6: yes.

- C6-C8: yes.

- C6-C7: yes.

- C7-C9: yes.

- C10-C11: yes.

- C10-C12: yes.

That's 9 single C-C bonds.

Double bonds:

- C1=C2.

- C9=C10.

That's 2 double C=C bonds.

So, total C-C bonds: 9 single and 2 double.

So, bond energy for C-C:

9 *200 + 2 *300 = 1800 +600=2400.

C-H bonds: 22, each 400: 22*400=8800.

So, total bond energy in molecule:2400 +8800=11200.

So, the sum of bonds formed is 11200.

Bonds broken in elements: 400.

So ΔHf = (400) - (11200) = -10800 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have a negative value. So perhaps I have the sign wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should have calculated the other way around.

Wait, the formula might be ΔHf = (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed).

But that would give 400 -11200= -10800, which would be a large exothermic, which doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the sum of bond energies in the molecule is the sum of all bonds (C-C, C=C, C-H) in the molecule. So, that's 11200.

The sum of bond energies in the elements (reactants) is:

For carbon: 300 kJ (as calculated earlier: 1.5 C-C bonds *200 kJ/mol =300).

For hydrogen: 100 kJ (1 H-H bond).

Total:400.

So, ΔHf = (sum bonds broken) - (sum bonds formed) =400 -11200 =-10800.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of bonds.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-C and C=C bonds is different. Let me recount.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of C-C bonds.

Let me try to count each carbon's bonds:

Each C can have up to four bonds.

C1: bonded to C3, C4, C2 (double), and maybe others? Wait, no, we have (CH3)2C=CH.

So, C1 has two CH3 groups and a double bond to C2. So, three bonds, but wait, each CH3 is a single bond. So C1 is bonded to C3, C4, and C2 (double bond). So three bonds in total for C1? No, because each CH3 is a single bond. So, C1 is bonded to C3 (single), C4 (single), and C2 (double). So that's three bonds. Wait, but that's only three bonds. Carbon usually has four bonds. Hmm, perhaps C1 is connected to another group.

Wait, perhaps C1 is connected to another group beyond the (CH3)2C=CH part. Let me look again at the structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, after the (CH3)2C=CH group, there's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the C2 (from the =CH-) is connected to a CH2 group (C5), which is connected to C6, and so on.

Wait, perhaps I should count all the C-C bonds across the entire molecule.

Wait, C1 is connected to C3 (single), C4 (single), and C2 (double).

C2 is connected to C1 (double), C5 (single).

C5 is connected to C2 (single), C6 (single).

C6 is connected to C5 (single), C7 (single), and C8 (single).

C7 is connected to C6 (single), C9 (single).

C9 is connected to C7 (single), C10 (double).

C10 is connected to C9 (double), C11 (single), C12 (single).

So, the C-C bonds are:

C1-C3 (single).

C1-C4 (single).

C1-C2 (double).

C2-C5 (single).

C5-C6 (single).

C6-C8 (single).

C6-C7 (single).

C7-C9 (single).

C9-C10 (double).

C10-C11 (single).

C10-C12 (single).

Wait, that's 11 C-C bonds:

- 9 single bonds and 2 double bonds.

Wait, but earlier I thought there were 9 single bonds and 2 double bonds, giving 11 in total. So, 9 *200 =1800, 2 *300=600. So, 2400.

C-H bonds:22.

So, 22*400=8800.

Total bonds in the molecule:2400 + 8800=11200.

Bonds broken in elements:400.

So, ΔHf =400 -11200= -10800 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match. The options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B)67.4 kJ/mol

C)11.44 kJ/g

D)1900 kJ/g

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about enthalpy of formation per gram, not per mole. Because 11200 kJ/mol is option A, which is a very large value.

Wait, but the options have A as 11200 kJ/mol, which matches the total bond energy of the molecule, not the ΔHf.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation is the energy change when one mole of the compound is formed from elements in their standard states.

The formula using bond energies is:

ΔHf = [Σ (bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (bond energies of products)].

Reactants are the elements: C (graphite) and H2.

Products is the given molecule.

So, the bonds in the reactants are C-C in graphite and H-H in H2.

The bonds in the products are the bonds in the molecule: C-C, C=C, C-H.

So, the calculation would be:

ΔHf = (sum of bonds in reactants) - (sum of bonds in products).

But what are the bonds in the reactants?

Each mole of C (graphite) has 3/2 moles of C-C bonds (because each C has three bonds, and each bond is shared between two C atoms).

To get 1 mole of C atoms, we need to break 1.5 moles of C-C bonds. Each bond is 200 kJ/mol. So, 1.5 *200 =300 kJ.

Each mole of H2 has 1 mole of H-H bonds. To get 2 moles of H atoms, we need to break 1 mole of H-H bonds: 1 *100=100 kJ.

So, total bonds broken in reactants: 300 +100 =400 kJ.

Bonds formed in products: sum of all bonds in the molecule, which is 11200 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bonds broken in reactants) - (sum of bonds formed in products).

So, 400 - 11200= -10800 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the bonds in the products as the sum of all bonds, but I think the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bonds in reactants) - (sum of bonds in products).

Which is 400 -11200= -10800.

But this isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of bonds.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C and C=C bonds.

Wait, let me recount the molecule:

Each (CH3)2C=CH group has:

- Two single C-C bonds (to the two CH3 groups).

- One double C=C bond.

Then, the rest of the molecule:

- CH2: single C-C.

- CH(CH3): two single C-C bonds (to CH2 and CH3).

- CH2: single C-C.

- CH: single C-C.

- C=C: double bond.

- C(CH3)2: two single C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the total C-C bonds are:

Two in the first part, then:

CH2: one.

CH(CH3): two.

CH2: one.

CH: one.

C=C: one (but it's a double bond).

C(CH3)2: two.

Wait, that's 2+1+2+1+1+2=9 single C-C bonds, plus 2 double C=C bonds.

So, same as before, 9 single and 2 double, totaling 2400 kJ.

So, the calculation seems correct.

But the options don't include -10800, so perhaps the question is asking for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the enthalpy of the molecule relative to its elements, but in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of formation in terms of the atomization energies, not using bond energies. Because the given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol.

Wait, the problem states:

Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.

Bond energy of H-H =100 kJ/mol.

Bond energy of C-C=200 kJ/mol.

Bond energy of C=C=300 kJ/mol.

Bond energy of C-H=400 kJ/mol.

So, perhaps the approach should involve using the atomization energy to calculate the total energy for the molecule.

Wait, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of the element to produce a mole of isolated atoms. For carbon, that's 1000 kJ/mol.

So, the steps would be:

1. Calculate the energy required to decompose the molecule into its constituent C and H atoms. This is the sum of all bond energies in the molecule.

2. Then, calculate the energy required to decompose the elements (C and H2) into their atoms.

3. The difference between these two energies gives the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, the formula would be:

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies in the molecule] - [sum of atomization energies of C and H2].

Wait, but H2's atomization is the energy to break H-H bonds into H atoms. So for H, the atomization energy per mole is 100 kJ/mol (since each H-H bond is 100 kJ/mol, and each H2 has one bond).

So, the total atomization energy for the molecule would be:

(sum of C's atomization) + (sum of H's atomization).

But the molecule has 'n' C atoms and 'm' H atoms.

The sum for C: n * (1000 kJ/mol) [since each C atom requires 1000 kJ to atomize].

Sum for H: m * (50 kJ/mol) [since each H atom requires half of 100 kJ/mol to atomize, because each H-H bond is 100, and each H atom is half a bond].

Wait, that makes sense because each H2 molecule has one H-H bond, so breaking it requires 100 kJ/mol to produce 2 moles of H atoms. So each H atom requires 50 kJ/mol.

So, for the molecule, the total atomization energy would be:

n *1000 + m *50.

This would be the energy required to decompose the molecule into C and H atoms.

The energy required to decompose the elements into atoms is:

For C: 1 mole of C atoms requires 1000 kJ.

For H: the molecule has m H atoms, which would come from m/2 moles of H2. Each mole of H2 requires 100 kJ to break into 2 moles of H atoms. So, the energy is (m/2)*100.

So, the total atomization energy for the elements is:

1000 (for C) + (m/2)*100 (for H).

The enthalpy of formation ΔHf is then calculated as:

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies in molecule] - [sum of atomization energies of elements].

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the correct formula. Let me think.

Wait, the correct formula using atomization energies is:

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies in molecule] - [sum of atomization energies of elements].

Because the bond energies in the molecule are the energy released when the molecule is formed from atoms, and the atomization energies are the energy required to break the elements into atoms.

So, the calculation would be:

ΔHf = (sum of all bond energies in molecule) - (sum of atomization energies of C and H2).

Sum of bond energies in molecule: 11200 kJ/mol.

Sum of atomization energies:

For C: 1 mole *1000 kJ/mol =1000.

For H: number of H atoms in the molecule is m. Each H atom comes from H2, and each H2 requires 100 kJ to break into 2 H atoms. So for m H atoms, the number of H2 molecules needed is m/2. So, energy for H is (m/2)*100.

So, for the molecule, which has 22 H atoms:

H atomization energy: (22/2)*100 =11 *100 =1100 kJ.

So, total atomization energy:1000 (C) +1100 (H) =2100 kJ.

So, ΔHf =11200 -2100 =9100 kJ/mol.

But this isn't matching any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the approach using bond energies is better. But the options don't have 9100 or -10800. So perhaps I made a mistake in the counting of bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial molecule's structure to ensure the correct count of bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond energies. For example, perhaps I should have considered that the molecule's bonds are being formed, so their energy is subtracted. Let me try another approach.

The formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf = [Σ (bonds broken in reactants)] - [Σ (bonds formed in products)].

Reactants are the elements: C (graphite) and H2 (gas).

Bonds broken in reactants:

C: 1.5 *200 =300 kJ (since each mole of C has 1.5 moles of C-C bonds).

H2: 1 *100 =100 kJ (each mole of H2 has one H-H bond).

Total bonds broken:300 +100=400 kJ.

Bonds formed in products (the molecule):

C-C:9 *200=1800.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-H:22 *400=8800.

Total bonds formed:1800+600 +8800= 11200.

So, ΔHf =400 -11200= -10800 kJ/mol.

But this isn't an option. The options are A)11200, B)67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Wait, but option B is 67.4 kJ/mol, which is close to the difference between the sum of bonds formed and bonds broken: 11200 -400=10800, but perhaps I inverted the formula.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

ΔHf = [Σ (bonds formed)] - [Σ (bonds broken)].

Which would be 11200 -400=10800.

But that's a very large positive number, which would imply a highly endothermic reaction, which is unlikely for a hydrocarbon.

Wait, but the given bond energies might not be realistic. For example, in reality, C-H bonds are weaker than C-C. But perhaps in this problem, the C-H is 400 kJ/mol.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of the molecule, not the formation. Because 11200 is option A.

Wait, looking back, the question says: "Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2."

So, the correct approach must lead to one of the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of C-C and C=C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has fewer C-C bonds. Let me recount.

Let me imagine the molecule again:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

- The first part has 3 C's: C1 (central), two CH3 groups (C3 and C4), and the CH (C2).

- Then, CH2 (C5), connected to C2.

- Then, CH(CH3) (C6), connected to C5 and a CH3 (C7).

- Then, CH2 (C8), connected to C6.

- Then, CH (C9), connected to C8.

- Finally, C10, connected to C9 via double bond, and two CH3 groups (C11 and C12).

So, the C-C bonds are:

C1-C3 (single).

C1-C4 (single).

C1=C2 (double).

C2-C5 (single).

C5-C6 (single).

C6-C7 (single).

C6-C8 (single).

C8-C9 (single).

C9-C10 (double).

C10-C11 (single).

C10-C12 (single).

Wait, that's 11 C-C bonds. 9 single and 2 double.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcounting. Let me take another approach. Each single bond is one C-C, each double is one C=C.

So total C-C single bonds: 9.

Double bonds: 2.

So, 9*200 +2*300=2400.

C-H bonds: 22 *400=8800.

Total: 2400 +8800=11200.

So the sum of bond energies in the molecule is 11200.

Now, the sum of bonds broken in reactants is 400.

So, ΔHf =400 -11200= -10800.

But this isn't any of the options. So perhaps the question is worded differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy of the molecule, not the formation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the molecule is structured. Maybe I'm miscounting the bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is actually a different structure. For example, perhaps it's a cyclic compound, which would have fewer bonds. But the formula given doesn't suggest that.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, which is a straight-chain molecule with two double bonds.

Wait, another possibility is that I've miscounted the number of C-H bonds. Let me recount:

Part A: (CH3)2C=CH-

- 2 CH3 →6 C-H.

- CH →1 C-H.

Total:7.

Part B: CH2- →2.

Part C: CH(CH3)- →1 +3=4.

Part D: CH2- →2.

Part E: CH- →1.

Part F: C(CH3)2 →3*2=6.

Wait, that gives 7+2=9; +4=13; +2=15; +1=16; +6=22. So 22 C-H bonds.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is being asked in terms of the bond energies given, regardless of the actual feasibility.

But given that the options don't match, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the sum of all bonds in the molecule and that's the answer. Because option A is 11200 kJ/mol, which is exactly what I calculated for the sum of all bond energies in the molecule.

Wait, but the question is about the enthalpy of formation. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is that the sum of bond energies is 11200 kJ/mol, which is option A.

But I'm not entirely confident because I thought the formula involved the difference between bonds broken and formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of the molecule, not its formation. But the question clearly states "enthalpy of formation".

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the concept that the enthalpy of formation is equal to the sum of all bond energies in the molecule. Which would make option A correct.

But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Typically, the enthalpy of formation isn't the sum of bond energies; it's the difference between bonds broken and bonds formed.

But given that the options don't include -10800, and option A is 11200, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, where the enthalpy of formation is the sum of all bond energies.

In that case, the answer would be 11200, option A.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy content of the molecule, not its formation.

Given the options, and the fact that the sum of bond energies is 11200, which is option A, I think the intended answer is A) 11200 kJ/mol.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2**, the problem provides bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta H_f = \text{[Sum of bond energies in reactants]} - \text{[Sum of bond energies in products]}
\]

### Reactants (Elements):
1. **Carbon (C)**: The enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol. To produce 1 mole of carbon atoms, 1.5 moles of C-C bonds (since each carbon in graphite is bonded to three others) must be broken. Thus, the energy required is:
   \[
   1.5 \times 200 = 300 \, \text{kJ/mol}
   \]

2. **Hydrogen (H2)**: Each mole of H2 has 1 mole of H-H bonds. To produce 2 moles of H atoms, 1 mole of H-H bonds must be broken:
   \[
   1 \times 100 = 100 \, \text{kJ/mol}
   \]

Total energy required to break bonds in the reactants:
\[
300 + 100 = 400 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Products (Molecule):
The molecule contains the following bonds:
1. **C-C bonds**: There are 9 single C-C bonds, each contributing 200 kJ/mol:
   \[
   9 \times 200 = 1800 \, \text{kJ/mol}
   \]

2. **C=C bonds**: There are 2 double C=C bonds, each contributing 300 kJ/mol:
   \[
   2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ/mol}
   \]

3. **C-H bonds**: There are 22 C-H bonds, each contributing 400 kJ/mol:
   \[
   22 \times 400 = 8800 \, \text{kJ/mol}
   \]

Total bond energy in the molecule:
\[
1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Enthalpy of Formation:
The enthalpy of formation is calculated as:
\[
\Delta H_f = \text{[Sum of bond energies in reactants]} - \text{[Sum of bond energies in products]}
\]
\[
\Delta H_f = 400 - 11200 = -10800 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

This value is not among the provided options. However, the total bond energy of the molecule (11200 kJ/mol) matches **Option A**. It is possible that the question is asking for the total bond energy of the molecule rather than the enthalpy of formation. Based on the given options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: A**
