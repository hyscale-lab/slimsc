Okay, so I've got this question here about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A to D. Let's see what each of these theories is about.

Regularization, if I remember correctly, is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results. These infinities aren't physical, so regularization helps make the math manageable by introducing a temporary cutoff, like a maximum energy scale, and then you remove it later with renormalization. So, the idea is that some theories might require this more than others, especially at high energies where quantum effects become significant.

Option A: Superstring Theory. String theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. It suggests that particles are not point-like but rather tiny strings. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity. Because it incorporates gravity and is a background-independent theory (I think it's a theory that doesn't require a fixed spacetime background), maybe it doesn't have the same types of divergences as other quantum field theories. Wait, but do string theories require regularization? I'm not exactly sure. I remember that in string theory, the concept of "taming infinities" is different. Instead of dealing with divergences in perturbation theory, string theory calculations might not have the same issues because the underlying structure is different. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't require regularization as much as others. 

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). That's the theory of the strong interaction. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. I know that QCD has issues with things like confinement and asymptotic freedom. But in terms of regularization, I think QCD calculations often require it. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, especially at high energies, you get divergences. So you need to regularize them, perhaps using methods like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization. So B probably requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism and it's a well-established quantum field theory. QED does have issues with divergences, like the electron mass and charge getting renormalized. So when you calculate loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy, you get infinities. So regularization is definitely needed here. So C requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics. So classical electrodynamics is Maxwell's theory, which doesn't deal with quantum effects or renormalization. Since regularization is a quantum field theory concept, classical theories wouldn't require it. So D's theory never needs regularization because it doesn't have the same divergences due to being a classical theory.

Wait, but wait. The question is about high energies. For high energies, quantum effects become significant. But classical electrodynamics is a classical theory. It's only valid at lower energies where quantum effects are negligible. So when you go to high energies, you need to use quantum electrodynamics, which does require regularization. But the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So classical ED is not a high-energy theory; it's
