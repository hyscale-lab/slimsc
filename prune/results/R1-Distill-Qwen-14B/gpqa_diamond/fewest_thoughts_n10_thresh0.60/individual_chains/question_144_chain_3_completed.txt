Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's see. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. 

Wait, so what do I remember about decay lengths? I think the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma times beta. Wait, decay length L is c * gamma * beta * tau, where tau is the mean lifetime. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v over c.

But wait, how do I find tau? Oh, right, the mean lifetime tau is related to the decay width Γ. The uncertainty principle tells us that the lifetime tau is approximately hbar divided by Γ. So tau = ħ / Γ. 

But wait, wait. Γ is given in MeV. Energy units. So I need to convert that into seconds to use in the formula. Oh yeah, because ħ has units of GeV·s or something like that. Let me think about units here.

Wait, ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, if Γ is in GeV, then tau is ħ/(Γ). But Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh, right, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. Then tau is (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but that's just tau. Then I need to find gamma and beta. Because L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Gamma is E / (m c²), but wait, E is given as production energy. So E_X is 8 GeV. But the mass is 1.2 GeV, so the kinetic energy must be E - m c². Wait, but for a relativistic particle, gamma is (total energy)/(rest energy). So E_total is 8 GeV. m c² is 1.2 GeV, so gamma = E_total / (m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.

Beta is v/c. And for a relativistic particle, beta gamma is roughly equal to p c / (m c²) ), but wait, beta is v/c, and gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Alternatively, beta can be found from gamma. Let me think. Since gamma is known, beta can be found using beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). 

So gamma is 6.6667, so 1/gamma^2 is 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887.

Alternatively, another way to find beta is from the relation gamma = (E) / (m c² ), and beta = (p c) / E. Because E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) = sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2) GeV. Let's compute that. 8 squared is 64, 1.2 squared is 1.44. So 64 -1.44 = 62.56. sqrt(62.56) is about 7.91 GeV. So p c is 7.91 GeV. Then, beta = (p c) / E = 7.91 /8 = approximately 0.98875. So same as before, beta is about 0.98875.

So gamma is about 6.6667, beta is about 0.98875. Now, putting it all together.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

We have c as the speed of light, which is approximately 3e8 meters per second. Tau was approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. 

So let's compute L step by step. 

First, compute gamma * beta. That's 6.6667 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.6113.

Then multiply by c: 6.6113 * 3e8 m/s = 1.9834e9 m/s.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Because L is gamma * beta * c * tau. So let me compute each part again.

Wait, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

So tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So c * tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Then multiply that by gamma * beta, which is about 6.6113.

So 6.6113 * 6.170625e-16 m = Let's calculate that.

6 * 6.17e-16 is about 3.7e-15 m. 0.6113 * 6.17e-16 is approx 3.77e-16. So total would be about 3.7e-15 +3.77e-16 = 4.077e-15 m. Hmm. So around 4.077e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15. So my calculation is close to option B.

Wait, but wait—did I make any mistakes in the calculations? Let me double-check.

Let me recompute gamma and beta more accurately.

Gamma: 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) → wait, because beta = sqrt(1 - (m c² / E)^2 )

Wait, yeah, beta = sqrt(1 - (m c² / E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) accurately.

0.9775^0.5: Let me think. 0.988 squared is 0.976144. 0.988^2 = (approx) 0.976144. 0.989^2 is 0.978121. So sqrt(0.9775) is between 0.988 and 0.989. Let's compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.9885^2: (0.988 +0.0005)^2. Let's compute it:

(0.988)^2 = 0.976144.

2*(0.988)*0.0005 = 0.000988.

(0.0005)^2 = 0.00000025.

So total is 0.976144 + 0.000988 + 0.00000025 ≈ 0.97713225.

But we need 0.9775. So let's find x such that (0.9885 + x)^2 = 0.9775.

Approximate x: (0.9885)^2 = 0.97713225. The difference is 0.9775 - 0.97713225 = 0.00036775.

We can write (0.9885 + x)^2 ≈ 0.9885^2 + 2*(0.9885)*x.

Set that equal to 0.9775: 

0.97713225 + 2*0.9885 * x = 0.9775 → 1.977 * x = 0.00036775 → x ≈ 0.00036775 /1.977 ≈ 0.0001863.

So beta ≈ 0.9885 + 0.0001863 ≈ 0.9886863. So approximately 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887, so gamma beta is 6.666667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's compute that.

6.666667 * 0.9887:

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.666667 * 0.9887 ≈ approximately 0.666667 * ~0.9887 ≈ 0.6592.

So together, 5.9322 + 0.6592 ≈ 6.5914.

So gamma * beta ≈ 6.5914.

Now, let's compute c * tau. 

Tau is ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV (since 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV). So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3 * 2.056875e-16 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Then, L = gamma beta * c tau = 6.5914 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Let me compute 6.5914 * 6.170625e-16.

6 * 6.1706e-16 = 3.70236e-15.

0.5914 * 6.1706e-16 = Let's compute 0.5 * 6.1706e-16=3.0853e-16.

0.0914 * 6.1706e-16 = 0.0914 *6.17e-16 ≈ 0.562e-16 =5.62e-17.

So adding, 3.0853e-16 +5.62e-17 = 3.6473e-16.

So total is 3.70236e-15 + 3.6473e-16 = 4.06709e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that's very close.

Wait, but all these are approximations. Let me think if there are any other factors I might have missed. Oh, wait, the exact calculation would be better. Let me do it more precisely.

Tau calculation: ħ =6.582e-25 GeV s, Γ=0.32 GeV.

Tau=6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So c * tau = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Gamma is 8 /1.2 = 6.666666666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 )= sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.988686.

So gamma*beta = 6.666666666666667 * 0.988686 ≈ let's compute that.

Let me compute 6.6666667 * 0.988686.

6 * 0.988686 = 5.932116.

0.6666667 * 0.988686 ≈ 0.6666667 *0.988686 = approximately 0.659124.

So total gamma*beta ≈ 5.932116 + 0.659124 = 6.59124.

So L = 6.59124 *6.170625e-16 m.

Compute 6.59124 *6.170625e-16.

Let me compute 6 *6.170625e-16 =3.702375e-15.

0.59124 *6.170625e-16: let's compute 0.5 *6.170625e-16=3.0853125e-16.

0.09124 *6.170625e-16: 0.09 *6.170625e-16=5.55356e-17, and 0.00124 *6.170625e-16=7.6613e-19.

Adding those: 3.0853125e-16 +5.55356e-17 =3.6406685e-16, plus 7.6613e-19 is negligible (approx 3.64066e-16).

So total L ≈ 3.702375e-15 +3.64066e-16 = 4.066441e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.066e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So option B is the correct answer.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the mean lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Compute the mean lifetime \( \tau \)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) (since \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)) and \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) is the rest mass. Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is calculated using:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2 c^4}{E^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1.2}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \gamma \beta \)
Using \( \gamma = 6.6667 \) and \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5914.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( c \tau \)
The product \( c \tau \) is:

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( L \)
Finally, the mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau = (6.5914) \times (6.170625 \times 10^{-16}) \approx 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with the closest option
The closest option to \( 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

Answer: B
