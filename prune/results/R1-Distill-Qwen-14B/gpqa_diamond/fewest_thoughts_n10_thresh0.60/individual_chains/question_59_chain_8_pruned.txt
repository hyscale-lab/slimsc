Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably calculate the moles of each acid and base involved. Moles are calculated by multiplying molarity (M) by volume in liters. 

The first solution is 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so I'll need to consider that. Let me convert 500 mL to liters: that's 0.5 L. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

Next is 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. 400 mL is 0.4 L. Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol.

Then, 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, meaning it will dissociate completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- ions. So first, moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Since each gives 2 OH-, moles OH- from Ba(OH)2 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, but OH- is a base, and H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) is an acid. So they will neutralize each other. Let me calculate the total H+ and OH-.

H+ comes from both HCl and CH3COOH. HCl is strong, so it provides 0.08 mol H+. CH3COOH is weak; in solution, it only partially dissociates. But wait, when you mix it with a strong acid and a strong base, maybe the strong acid and base will react first, changing the situation.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute total H+ and OH- contributions and see if there's an excess.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol. Acetic acid's H+ is a bit tricky because it's weak. But wait, when you mix all these together, the strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)2) will react first, right? Because they're strong, they'll dissociate completely, neutralizing each other before the weak acid (CH3COOH) does much.

So, let's think: H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol, OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

So, the H+ and OH- will react. Which is in excess? Let's see: 0.08 mol H+ and 0.
