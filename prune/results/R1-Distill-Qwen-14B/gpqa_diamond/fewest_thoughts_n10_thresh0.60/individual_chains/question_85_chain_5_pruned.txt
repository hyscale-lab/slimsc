Okay, so I've got this science question here about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are two planets orbiting a star. They've used transit and radial velocity methods to detect them. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

They also mention something about the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 a shift of 0.04 Å. But wait, I'm not sure how that affects the temperature ratio. Oh, maybe it's about the Doppler shift from the radial velocity method? So the shift relates to the planet's velocity causing the star to move, which we can measure through the Doppler effect.

But the question is about equilibrium temperatures. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh, right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is T_p = T_s * ( (L_s/(16πσ a²) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - a_p) / (1 - a_s) )^(1/4) ), but maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), assuming the planet doesn't have an atmosphere that traps heat or anything like that.

But in this problem, both planets have the same albedo, so that term would cancel out when taking the ratio. So I can ignore albedo for this calculation.

The key factors are the distance from the star (semi-major axis) and the star's properties. But wait, how do I find the semi-major axis for each planet?

Ah, because
