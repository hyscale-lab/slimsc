Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

So the question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right! The formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), right? Because distance is speed multiplied by time, and if the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we can approximate it as c*τ.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ? Oh yeah, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is approximately ħ (Planck's constant over 2π). So τ is roughly ħ divided by Γ. But wait, Γ is the decay width, which is the uncertainty in energy. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but another thing I remember is that the mean lifetime is actually τ = ħ / Γ. So putting it all together, the decay length L is c * τ, which is c * ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait a second. The production
