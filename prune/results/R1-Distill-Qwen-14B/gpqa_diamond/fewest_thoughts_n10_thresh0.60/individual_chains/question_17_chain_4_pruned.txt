Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the problem states it's a stoichiometric complex, so the ratio is 1:1, I think. That means each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA molecule.

The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The K value is given as 5x10^10, which is a large number, so the complex is very stable.

Now, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. But wait, in solution, some of this complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA. The question is, what's the concentration of free Ca²+ ions?

Let me think about the equilibrium. The formation constant expression is K = [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). Since the complex is formed from 1 Ca and 1 EDTA, the stoichiometry is 1:1.

Assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, but some dissociation occurs. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the solution is "containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex." So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. But because the complex can dissociate, the actual [Ca²+] and [EDTA] will be determined by the K value.

But wait, let's model this. Let me write the equilibrium.

Let’s denote [CaEDTA²−] as 0.02 M minus the amount that dissociates. Hmm, but perhaps a better approach is to think about the dissociation. Let x be the concentration of Ca
