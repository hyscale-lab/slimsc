Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when things are moving relative to each other, especially at significant speeds, we have to consider how their velocities add up. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact principles here.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, right? Because in vacuum it's c, and when it's in a medium with refractive index n, it's c divided by n. So normally, without any movement, the speed would be c/n. But since the glass is moving, I think this affects the observed speed.

But wait, do I just add the velocities? Like, if the glass is moving at v in the same direction as the light, then the light's speed relative to the lab would be (c/n + v)? No, that can't be right because velocities don't just add like that, especially when dealing with light. Oh wait, because light is moving relative to the glass, which itself is moving. So it's probably a case of velocity addition.

Wait, I remember something about the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh right, when you have two objects moving relative to each other, their velocities don't simply add in a classical way. The formula involves gamma factors and such. But wait, is that necessary here? Because the glass is moving at velocity v, which is presumably much less than the speed of light, so maybe we can use a non-relativistic approach. Or is that a wrong assumption?

Wait, but the problem says to take c=1, so units might be a bit simplified. Let's think. The speed of light in the glass is u = c/n = 1/n. Because in the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n. But the glass is moving at v in the same direction as the light, so from the lab frame, the speed would be the sum of these velocities?

Wait, no, because velocities don't just add like that. Oh right, from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light's speed in the glass's frame is u = 1/n, in the same direction as v. So the lab frame would see the light's speed as u' = u + v? But wait, that can't be correct because of relativity. Oh wait, but maybe for small velocities, this approximation is valid. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u * v)/cÂ² ). Since c=1, it simplifies to (u + v)/(1 + u v). But u here is the speed of light in the glass, which is 1/n. So substituting, u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v ) = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n ). Let me see if that can be simplified.

Multiply numerator and denominator by n: (n v +1 ) / (n + v ). So the expression becomes (1 + n v)/(n + v). Wait, that's
