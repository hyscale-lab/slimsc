Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I remember that in a medium, the speed of light is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I think this has to do with the frame of reference. The glass is moving relative to the lab frame. So we might need to apply some relativistic addition here because velocities don't just add linearly when you're dealing with high speeds.

Wait, but v is the velocity of the glass, and it's moving in the same direction as the light. So the light is moving through the glass, which itself is moving. How does that combine?

In special relativity, the velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity of the object in one frame, and v is the relative speed between frames. But wait, in this case, the light is moving through the glass. So the speed in the glass's frame is c/n. So from the lab frame, how does that add?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The speed of light in the glass is v = c/n. But wait, the glass is moving. So the observer in the lab would see a different speed.

Wait, no. According to the principle of relativity, the speed of light should always be c in any inertial frame. But wait, that's in a vacuum. What about in a medium? Hmm. Oh, wait, the medium itself is moving. So perhaps the speed of the light as observed in the lab isn't just v_medium = c/n.

Wait, maybe I should think about it using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's model this:

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. Now, the glass is moving at speed V = v (same direction as light) relative to the lab. So, the lab would observe the light's speed as u'.

Using the velocity addition formula: u' = (u + V)/(1
