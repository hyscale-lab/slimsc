Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think through each option step by step.

The question gives four options, A to D, each describing a different exoplanet. I'll try to break down each one.

So, the question is about density. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, density = mass/volume. Since all the options have different masses and some have different radii, I might need to calculate the densities for each.

Let me look at each option:

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
So, this planet has the same mass and radius as Earth. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm続, right? So this planet's density would be the same as Earth's. So, option a has a density of 5.5 g/cm続.

b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm続.
Wait, this planet's density is given as 5.5 g/cm続. So that's the same as Earth's. But wait, the question is asking which has the highest density. So this one is 5.5, which is the same as option a. Hmm, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The description also says "2 Earth masses." But wait, the density is already given, so maybe I don't have to compute it. So its density is 5.5. So same as a.
