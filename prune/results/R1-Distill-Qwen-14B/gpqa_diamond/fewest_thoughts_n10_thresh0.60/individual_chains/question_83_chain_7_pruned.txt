Okay, so I just came across this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit nervous because titration calculations can get a bit tricky. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which we dilute with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, first, I should figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 (the concentration after dilution) would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but when we titrate with NaOH, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH. The reaction equation is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na^+ + H2O. So, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

Now, let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid present. So I need to calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

The diluted volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. 

The NaOH solution is 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would be 0.001 moles. The volume of NaOH needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. 

Wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So for 25% titration, we're adding 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Let's tackle the 25% titration first. At this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, we can think in terms of moles. 

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 moles. Moles of NaOH added: 0.001 * 0.25 = 0.00025 moles. So, the reaction will convert 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

So, the moles remaining of CH3COOH will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of CH3COO^- formed will be 0.00025.

But wait, the total solution volume now is the initial 40 cm³ plus the 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So, total volume = 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 liters.

So, the concentrations will be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since it's a weak acid and its conjugate base, this is a buffer solution. So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. Let's compute pKa: 

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me think. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So, plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Wait, let's compute that ratio. 0.005882 / 0.017647 is approximately 0.333. Because 0.005882 ×3 is 0.017646, which is very close to 0.017647. So the ratio is about 1/3.

The log of 1/3 is log(0.333) which is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. Rounded to two decimal places, that's about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and option D is pH 4.57 at 25%. So 4.26 is likely the pH at 25% titration. 

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. The moles after 25% titration: 0.00075 moles of acid and 0.00025 moles of conjugate base. The total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL, which is 0.0425 L.

So, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.
