Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. 

Alright, let's start by understanding what's given. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and the pH at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, with different pairs of values.

First, I think I should find out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. When we mix equal volumes of acid and water, the total volume doubles. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, adding another 20 cm³ makes 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid can be calculated using Molarity = moles/volume (in liters). So moles = M * V. 

Let me calculate that. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, volume is 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters). Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. So the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (which gives OH-) is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of CH3COOH. But the question asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me first tackle the 25% titration point. 

25% titration means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, I need to find the concentration of the solution at that point.

Wait, but how much NaOH is added at 25%? Let me think. The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are 0.001 mol, as calculated earlier. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. 

Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume of NaOH needed to reach 25% titration is moles / concentration. So volume NaOH = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³.

But wait, the total volume of solution at this point will be the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³. Hmm, but maybe I can model the concentrations considering the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here because it's a buffer solution at the 25% point.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized, so the ratio of acetate ions (A-) to acetic acid (HA) is 0.25:0.75, because for every mole of HA neutralized, one mole of A- is formed. So the ratio is [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5
