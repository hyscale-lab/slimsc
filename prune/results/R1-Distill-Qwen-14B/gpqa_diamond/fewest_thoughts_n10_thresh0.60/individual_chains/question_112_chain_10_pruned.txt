Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll do my best.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question mentions it's proportional, implying it's not yet normalized. Then, we're asked to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of an operator with a specific matrix representation. Oh, and also calculate the average value of that operator.

Wait, the operator's matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. So what's that operator look like? Let's see, for a two-level system (since we're dealing with up and down), the matrix would be 2x2. The diagonal elements are zero because when i = j, A_ij is zero. The off-diagonal elements (i != j) are hbar/2. So the matrix would be:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Hmm. That looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by hbar/2, it's exactly the A_ij given. So the operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Now, the eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |−x>, which are the eigenstates of the given operator. So the problem reduces to finding the probabilities of measuring the state |alpha> in either |+x> or |−x>, and then finding the expectation value of the operator.

First, I need to normalize |alpha>. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So let's compute the inner product:

|alpha> = a |up> + b |down>
a = 1+i, b = 2 - i.

The inner product <alpha|alpha> is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 +1 = 2? Wait, wait. (1+i) * (1-i) is 1 -i + i -i². The i terms cancel, and i² is -1, so 1 +1 = 2. So |a|^2 is 2.

Compute |b|^2: (2-i)(2+i) = 4 + 2i - 2i -i² → 4 + 0i +1 =5. So |b|^2 is 5.

So the total is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the eigenstates of the operator (which is (hbar/2) sigma_x) are the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenstates |+x> and |−x> can be written in terms of |up> and |down>.

I remember that |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Alternatively, another way to write them is:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The eigenstates for sigma_x are such that sigma_x |+x> = |+x> and sigma_x |−x> = -|−x>.

Alternatively, when I expand |+x> in the computational basis (|up> and |down>), it's (|
