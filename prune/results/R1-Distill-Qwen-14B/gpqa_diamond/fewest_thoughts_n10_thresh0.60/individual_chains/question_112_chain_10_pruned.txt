Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

Alright, the state of the electron is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually written as a combination of basis states. Here, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So, the first thing I should probably do is normalize this state because probabilities are easier to calculate with normalized states.

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional, meaning it's not necessarily normalized yet. So I'll need to compute the normalization factor. The normalization condition is that the inner product of |alpha> with itself equals 1. So let me write that down.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's denote this as a linear combination: c1|up> + c2|down>, where c1 = 1+i and c2 = 2 - i. The inner product <alpha|alpha> is |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Calculating |c1|^2: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i + i - i^2 = 1 +1 = 2. No, wait, that's not right. Wait, |c1|² is (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Oh wait no, no, because (1+i)(1-i) is 1*(1) + 1*(-i) + i*(1) + i*(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². The i terms cancel out, and -i² is +1, so it's 1 +1 = 2. Same for |c2|²: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i² = 4 +1=5, because i^2 is -1. So the normalization factor squared is |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 = 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next part: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the given operator. The operator's matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, 0 otherwise. So this is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out. Since for a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j go from 1 to 2 (assuming |up> is first basis and |down> is second). So A_12 = hbar/2, A_21 = hbar/2, and the diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are zero. So the matrix looks like:

[[0, hbar
