Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read it carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over the parallax to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r: r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2.

Hmm, I need to figure out the relationship between the number of stars and distance. Parallax is related to distance, so I should probably start there. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I think is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs), right? So, if the distance increases, parallax decreases.

The problem states that the number of stars (let's call it N) varies as 1/plx^5. So I can write that as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is proportional to 1/distance (d), let me substitute that in.

Plx = 1/d → plx^5 = (1/d)^5 → 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, that would mean as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. But wait, that doesn't sound right because as you go further away, you should see fewer stars, not more. Or wait, maybe the question is about how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The number of stars varies with 1/plx^5, so N ∝ (1/plx)^5. Since plx is small when distance is large, 1/plx is large, so N would be large when plx is small, which is when d is large. But that seems counterintuitive because at larger distances, there are fewer stars in a given volume. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the number density and the total number.

Wait, maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit volume. Because when you look further away, the volume increases with distance, but star density might change. Oh wait, the problem says that the number varies as 1/plx^5. Let me think of plx in terms of d.

Parallax plx is 1/d (in parsecs) so plx = 1/d. So 1
