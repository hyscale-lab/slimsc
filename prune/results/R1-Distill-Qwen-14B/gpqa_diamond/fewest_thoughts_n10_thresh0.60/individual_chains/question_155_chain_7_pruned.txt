Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me see what it's about. So, the question is about finding the uncertainty of P_z, which is the uncertainty ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Right, so I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Oh, and the state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think are the standard basis vectors, like |z=+ħ>, |z=0>, |z=-ħ> or something like that. So the state is a superposition in the z-basis.

Wait, the operator P_z has a matrix given. Let me check. The matrix for P_z is diagonal, right? The first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

So the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. I think I need to compute the expectation values.

First, compute ⟨P_z⟩. That's the expectation value of P_z, which is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Since P_z is diagonal, this should be easy. The expectation value is the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

So each component is the square of the amplitude times the eigenvalue. Let's see. The state components are a, b, c: a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = a² * ħ + b² * 0 + c² * (-ħ) ?

Wait, no, wait. Because in a diagonal matrix, the expectation value is sum over i |ψ_i|^2 * P_z(i,i). So for the first component, |a|^2 * P_z(1,1), which is |(-1/2)|^2 * ħ = (1/4) * ħ. Similarly, the second component: |b|^2 * 0 = 0. Third component: |c|^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)*(-ħ). So total ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4) ħ - (1/4) ħ = 0. Oh, interesting.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because a is -1/2, but when you square it, it's positive. So a² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Same for c². So (1/4)*ħ + 0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Next, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Well, P_z squared is
