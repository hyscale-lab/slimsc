Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and boson decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through. 

The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is provided, which is L(y) = -λ fψ̄ f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. So the interaction term involves the boson X and some fermions. 

I remember that in particle physics, a boson's decay into fermions depends on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions involved. The rule is that the total energy of the decay products must be less than the mass of the boson. Also, fermions have to be created in pairs because you can't have a single fermion due to conservation laws—like charge, lepton number, etc.

Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term is something like λ times the fermion fields ψ_f and anti-ψ_f, multiplied by (v + X). So, this looks like a Yukawa coupling. In Yukawa interactions, the coupling is between a scalar (here, X is a boson, so perhaps a scalar? Or maybe a vector?) and a fermion pair. The Yukawa term usually allows the scalar to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

So, the decay of X would be into a fermion and its antiparticle. The possible fermions depend on whether their combined mass is less than or equal to the mass of X (since energy and momentum have to allow for the decay). 

X has a mass of 6 GeV. So, any fermion pair that sums up (each fermion has a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each, since 2m ≤ M_X). Wait, because the total mass of the two fermions must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Or is it that each fermion's mass must be less than half of X's mass? Hmm.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. Because in the rest frame of X, the invariant mass of the decay products can't exceed the mass of X. So if each fermion has a mass m, then 2m ≤ M_X.

So, for example, if the mass of the top quark is about 173 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks. Similarly, the bottom quark has a mass of around 4.5 GeV. So 2m would be about 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks because 4.5*2=9 >6. So that's out. 

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again. The mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to M_X/2. So for a fermion with mass m, m ≤ M_X/2.

So, X is 6 GeV. So m ≤ 3 GeV.

What fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV? Let me recall the masses:

- Up quark: about 2 MeV (so way below 3 GeV)
- Down quark: about 4-5 MeV
- Strange quark: around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm quark: around 1.5 GeV (so 1.5 ≤3, so yes)
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV (so 4.5 >3 → no)
- Top quark: way too heavy, 173 GeV → no.

Leptons:
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV → yes
- Muon: ~0.1 GeV → yes
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV → 1.78 ≤3 → yes
- Neutrinos: nearly 0, so yes.

Wait, but wait—there are also the masses of other particles. But in this problem, the Lagrangian mentions f and ψ_f. Maybe the fermions are quarks and leptons.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm. So the interaction is for some fermion f. So the boson X can decay into ff̄ pairs, where f is a fermion that has a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So which fermions meet this?

Let me list all possible fermions (particles) and their masses:

Quarks:
- u: ~2 MeV → yes
- d: ~3-5 MeV → yes
- s: ~95-100 MeV → yes
- c: ~1.2-1.5 GeV → yes
- b: ~4.5 GeV → no
- t: 173 GeV → no

Leptons:
- e: ~0.0005 GeV → yes
- μ: ~0.105 GeV → yes
- τ: ~1.78 GeV → yes
- ν_e, ν_μ, ν_τ: nearly 0 → yes

So possible decay products are any fermion-antifermion pair where each fermion has mass ≤3 GeV.

So possible pairs are:
- uū
- dd̄
- s s̄
- c c̄
- e+ e-
- μ+ μ-
- τ+ τ-
- νν̄ (but neutrinos are neutral and hard to detect, but they are possible)

Wait, but in the decay products, the fermions must be charged particles, or else the decay would be hard to observe. But the problem is about kinematical possibility, not about detection.

Wait, but the options given don't include neutrinos. Let me look at the options.

Options:

A) X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−

But wait, X mass is 6 GeV. The bottom quark mass is ~4.5 GeV, so 2m = 9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So b quarks can't be decay products. So option A includes b b̄, which is impossible. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−

Wait, c quark mass is about 1.5 GeV. So 2m = 3 GeV, which is equal to X's mass of 6 GeV. So yes, c c̄ is allowed. So this option includes c c̄, which is possible. So B is a candidate.

Option C: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−

Wait, t quark is about 173 GeV. 2m is 346 GeV, way more than 6 GeV. So t t̄ is impossible. So option C is wrong.

Option D: X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−

Again, b b̄ is not allowed. So D is wrong.

Wait, but looking back at the options.

Wait, option B: includes c c̄, which is allowed. Let me check the other particles.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

So in this case, all the fermion pairs' masses are ≤3 GeV (for c, it's exactly 1.5 GeV—so 3 GeV total for 2m), which is allowed.

So the correct decay channels are c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−, and any neutrino pairs. But none of the options include neutrinos, so I think the options are considering charged particles only.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says "kinematically allowed decays." So if the Lagrangian only allows for certain types of fermions, then that would limit the decay channels.

Wait, the interaction term in the Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, for each fermion f, X can decay into f and f̄.

But which fermions f are present in the theory? The problem statement doesn't specify, but in the Standard Model, the fermions are quarks and leptons. So all the above possibilities are allowed, except for those where the mass is too high.

So for X with mass 6 GeV, possible decay products are:

- c c̄ (allowed as 2m = 3 GeV)
- s s̄ (allowed)
- u ū (allowed)
- d d̄ (allowed)
- e+ e− (allowed)
- μ+ μ− (allowed)
- τ+ τ− (allowed)
- νν̄ (but not listed in the options)

Wait but in the options, option B and D have some of these.

Wait, option B is: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Which is all the allowed charged fermions except for b. But option B is the only one that includes c c̄, which is allowed. So why is option B correct?

Wait, the interaction is given. So maybe the fermions the boson interacts with are only those that are present in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has fermion f. So perhaps f can be any fermion, but perhaps the problem is considering only certain. Wait, the question says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by...", which implies that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that the Lagrangian allows. So all fermions f present in the theory (i.e., in the Lagrangian) are allowed, provided their mass is less than M_X/2.

But in the Standard Model, all fermions except the top quark and bottom are below 3 GeV (since 6 GeV is 3 GeV for each). So for X with mass 6 GeV, the possible decay products are any fermion pairs with m <3 GeV.

So the correct decay channels would include c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, and all leptons (e, mu, tau) pairs.

Looking at the options, option B has c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Option D includes b b̄, which is impossible. So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option B is: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Yes, so that's all the possible ones except for neutrinos, which aren't in any options. So option B must be correct.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The decays depend on the masses of the fermions involved, as the total mass of the decay products must not exceed the mass of \( X \). Specifically, for a fermion \( f \) with mass \( m_f \), the condition \( 2m_f \leq M_X \) must hold, where \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This means \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Possible Fermion Pairs:
1. **Quarks**:
   - \( u \bar{u} \): \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - \( d \bar{d} \): \( m_d \approx 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - \( s \bar{s} \): \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - \( c \bar{c} \): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( b \bar{b} \): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed.
   - \( t \bar{t} \): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed.

2. **Leptons**:
   - \( e^+ e^- \): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Neutrinos (\( \nu \bar{\nu} \)): Masses are effectively zero, but they are not included in the options.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.
