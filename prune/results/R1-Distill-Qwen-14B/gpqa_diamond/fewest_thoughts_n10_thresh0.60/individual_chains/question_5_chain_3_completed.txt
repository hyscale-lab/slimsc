Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P is a vector operator, so it has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, let me parse that. So, the operator P is a vector, which means it's a sum of its components multiplied by the corresponding unit vectors. But since the direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane, I probably need to express the operator in terms of its components along this direction.

But wait, the question is asking for the eigenvector of the operator P along direction n. Hmm. Oh wait, no, the operator is given for each component, and n is the direction along which we are considering the operator. So perhaps the operator we're interested in is the component of P along n, which is P·n.

But wait, the question says "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n..." Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's read the question again.

Wait, no. The operator in question is P along some arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator is P_n = (P · n) unit vector. So P_n is an operator which is the component of P along n. Then, we need to find its eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is given in terms of its components (Px, Py, Pz), and the direction is n. So maybe P acting along n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the direction is in the x-z plane, so n is a vector in x-z plane. So n has components (nx, 0, nz), since the y-component is zero.

So the operator P along n would be P_n = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Because Py component won't be present since n is in x-z plane, so ny=0.

So, the first step is to express P_n as a matrix.

Each of the components Px, Py, Pz are 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So, let me write down each component.

Given:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P_n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) * (ħ/2), because each component is multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, no. Wait, each component P_x, P_y, P_z already includes the factor of ħ/2. So for example, P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, the operator P_n is n_x P_x + n_z P_z, which is (n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]).

Let me compute P_n:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ n_x [ [0,1], [1,0] ] + n_z [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ] ]

So, combining the matrices:

The matrix becomes:

n_x*(0) + n_z*(1) for the (1,1) element: n_z
n_x*(1) for (1,2)
n_x*(1) for (2,1)
n_z*(-1) for (2,2)

So the matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Multiply by ħ/2.

Wait, but since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Because in the x-z plane, the direction vector (nx, nz) must satisfy nx² + nz² = 1.

So, the operator P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

Wait, no: Wait, n_x and n_z are components of the unit vector n. So n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So, the matrix of P_n is:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

Each element multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, no, the operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So each element is (ħ/2) times the matrix elements.

But since the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]], then P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

So P_n = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector of P_n corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So,

P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Let me write out the matrix equation. Let me denote |v> as a column vector [a, b]^T.

So,

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

n_z a + n_x b = a

n_x a - n_z b = b

So, we have two equations:

1) n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

2) n_x a + (-n_z - 1) b = 0 → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Wait, let me recheck equation 2.

Wait, second equation is:

n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a = (n_z +1) b → n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

So equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

Equation 2: n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

We can write this as a system:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

We can solve this system for a and b.

Let me write it in matrix form:

[ (n_z -1)   n_x        ] [a]   = [0]

[ n_x       -(n_z +1) ] [b]     [0]

So, for non-trivial solutions (a, b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

The determinant D:

= (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2

= [ -(n_z -1)(n_z +1) ) ] - n_x^2

= [ -(n_z² -1) ] - n_x²

= -n_z² +1 -n_x²

But since n_x² + n_z² =1 (because it's a unit vector), substitute:

= -(n_z²) +1 - (1 -n_z²)

= -n_z² +1 -1 +n_z²

= 0

So the determinant is zero, which is consistent since we have eigenvalue problem.

So, the system has non-trivial solutions, which is expected.

Now, to find the eigenvector, we can solve either equation. Let's take equation 1:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Wait, but what if (n_z -1) is zero? That is, if n_z =1. Then equation 1 would be 0*a + n_x b=0 → n_x b=0. Since n_x can't be zero if n_z=1 (if n_z=1, then n_x=0 because n_x² + n_z² =1). So in that case, the equation would be 0*a +0*b=0, which is always true. So, in this case, when n_z=1, any vector is an eigenvector? Hmm, but let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parameterize the eigenvector in terms of angles.

Since n is in the x-z plane, we can express it in spherical coordinates. Let me say that n makes an angle θ with the z-axis, and φ=0 because it's in the x-z plane (so φ is the azimuthal angle, which is zero in the x-z plane). So, n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. Wait, wait: No, wait. The unit vector along a direction in x-z plane can be written as n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ. Because in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So if the direction is in x-z plane, the angle φ is zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, wait, that's not correct. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the unit vector components are:

n_x = sinθ cosφ

n_y = sinθ sinφ

n_z = cosθ

But since our case is in x-z plane, φ=0, so n_x = sinθ * cos0 = sinθ, n_y=0, n_z=cosθ.

So, n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ.

So, we can express n_z and n_x in terms of theta.

So, let's substitute n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ.

So, equation (1): (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But wait, cosθ -1 is in denominator. Let's manipulate this expression.

- sinθ / (cosθ -1) = [ sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ )

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cosθ):

= [ sinθ (1 + cosθ) ] / [ (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) ) ]

Denominator becomes 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ.

So,

= [ sinθ (1 + cosθ) ] / sin²θ = (1 + cosθ) / sinθ

So, a = (1 + cosθ) / sinθ * b

Alternatively, a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] * b

Hmm, but perhaps there's a better way to express this.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratios a/b is (1 + cosθ)/sinθ. Let me write that as:

a / b = (1 + cosθ)/sinθ

Which can be rewritten as a = [ (1 + cosθ)/sinθ ] b.

But (1 + cosθ)/sinθ is equal to cot(θ/2). Because:

Using the trigonometric identity:

(1 + cosθ) = 2 cos²(θ/2)

sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So (1 + cosθ)/sinθ = [2 cos²(θ/2)]/[2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = cot(θ/2)

Thus, a = cot(θ/2) * b

So, a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] * b → a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] b

So, let me set b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2)

Wait, let's see:

If a = cos(θ/2) and b = sin(θ/2), then a/b = cot(θ/2), which fits.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T, ignoring normalization for now.

Wait, but wait. Let's check this. Let me substitute a and b into equation 1:

Equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

Substituting n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ, a = cos(θ/2), b = sin(θ/2):

(cosθ -1) * cos(θ/2) + sinθ * sin(θ/2) = ?

Let me compute each term:

cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2) → using the identity cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(θ/2)

So,

= (-2 sin²(θ/2)) * cos(θ/2) ) + [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] * sin(θ/2)

= -2 sin²(θ/2) cos(θ/2) + 2 sin²(θ/2) cos(θ/2 )

The two terms cancel each other, so sum is zero. So that's correct.

Now, equation 2:

n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

Substituting:

sinθ * cos(θ/2) - (cosθ +1) * sin(θ/2) = ?

Again, using identities:

sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

cosθ +1 = 2 cos²(θ/2)

So,

= [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) * cos(θ/2) ] - [ 2 cos²(θ/2) ) * sin(θ/2) ]

= 2 sin(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) ) - 2 sin(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) ) = 0

So both equations are satisfied. So the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.

But wait, we have to normalize it. The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Given that:

a = cos(θ/2)

b = sin(θ/2)

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) = 1, so it's already normalized.

Wait, but in the options, some options have factors of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but maybe I made a miscalculation because the operator is a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenvector is in a two-dimensional space. So perhaps the eigenvector is correct, but the options are in terms of a different parameterization.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I have. But wait, in the problem, the operator isn't in the z-direction but along an arbitrary direction in x-z plane. So perhaps the theta here is a different theta.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused because the direction n is given in terms of theta in the x-z plane. So in our previous substitution, we set n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ. So θ is the angle between n and the z-axis.

But in the eigenvector, we have cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2). So the theta in the eigenvector is the same as the theta for the direction vector?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, when I substituted n_x = sinθ and n_z=cosθ, I used θ as the polar angle. So maybe theta in the eigenvector is related to that theta.

Wait, but in the eigenvector, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), so perhaps the angle is being halved.

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's exactly what I got. So perhaps option C is the right one.

But wait, let's look at the options again:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) )

Wait, no, the options are:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ )

B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

So, in our solution, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but perhaps I forgot to consider the normalization factor from the operator. Because the operator P_n is (ħ/2) times a matrix. So the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, and the eigenvector is as found.

Wait, but when I solved for the eigenvector, I found the components to be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], but perhaps the operator's matrix includes the ħ/2 factor, which I accounted for. So the eigenvector is correct as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But looking at the options, option C is exactly that. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss any normalization factors or any other factors.

Wait, another approach: The operator P along direction n is the sum of P_x, P_z multiplied by their respective components, because n is in x-z plane.

But since each component P_x, P_y, P_z is (ħ/2) times their respective Pauli matrices, the operator P_n is (ħ/2) times (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

So, P_n = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z )

The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix combination are ± (ħ/2) because the eigenvalues of σ·n are ±1, so when multiplied by (ħ/2), they become ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvectors for P_n are the same as for the Pauli matrix combination (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ), scaled by (ħ/2). The eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 of σ·n is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, where theta is the angle between n and z-axis.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue equation for σ·n is (σ·n)|v> = ±|v>.

Wait, the eigenvectors for σ·n are the same as the spin-up and spin-down states along n.

The eigenvectors can be written as |+n> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T and |−n> = [ -sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T, where theta is the angle from the z-axis.

But wait, I think I might have mixed up the angle definitions earlier. Let me clarify.

Wait, when the direction n is in the x-z plane, the angle theta is measured from the z-axis. So the state |+n> is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2))^T. But since phi=0 in our case, it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))^T.

So, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, which is option C.

But looking again, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result. So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $\vec{P} = P_x \hat{x} + P_y \hat{y} + P_z \hat{z}$, where $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are given as matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be expressed as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}_n$
The operator $\vec{P}_n$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P}_n = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and using the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]
we find:
\[
\vec{P}_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P}_n |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]
where $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting $\vec{P}_n$ into the equation:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$ and simplifying, we obtain the system:
\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the eigenvector
From the first equation, we find:
\[
a = \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} b.
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, we get:
\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
\]
Using the trigonometric identities $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]
Letting $b = \sin(\theta/2)$, we find $a = \cos(\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector is:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector is already normalized, as:
\[
|\cos(\theta/2)|^2 + |\sin(\theta/2)|^2 = 1.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$ matches **Option C**.

ANSWER: C
