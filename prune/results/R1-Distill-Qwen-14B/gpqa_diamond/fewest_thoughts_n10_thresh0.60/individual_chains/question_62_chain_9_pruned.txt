Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me read it carefully.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize its structure. So, it has a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a methyl group which is further attached to a hydroxy (OH) group and a cyclohexyl group. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group, which is a CHO group attached to the cyclohexane.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane would have a triple bond between two carbons, one of which is attached to the cyclohexane ring. So, the structure is cyclohexane connected to a carbon with a triple bond to another carbon. Maybe it's something like cyclohexane-CH-C triple bond CH.

Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a C≡C- group. So, the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. Right, that makes sense.

Now, the question is about the sequence of reagents that would take ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let's look at the options A to D and see what each step does.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group, which is itself attached to an OH and another cyclohexyl. Wait, no—wait, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group. That methyl has a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached to it. Plus, the same ring has a carbaldehyde group.

Wait, maybe I should draw this. The main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1 (let's say the top position), there's a CH₂ group. That CH₂ is connected to a hydroxyl (OH) and another cyclohexyl group. So, the structure is like cyclohexane-CH(OH)-cyc
