Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

First, I need to understand the structure of both the starting material and the target. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. The ethynyl group is like a triple bond to a CH2 group, so it's C≡C-CH2-cyclohexane. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane would have a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡CH group attached.

The target compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me parse that. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. The substituent is at the 1-position, which is the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So the substituent is a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane ring, which also has a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexyl? Or maybe it's a branching point with a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups on the same carbon.

Wait, maybe the structure is: the cyclohexane ring has a methyl group attached, and that methyl is substituted with both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is a methylene group (CH2-) that has a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the CH2. So the structure would be cyclohexane-CHO attached to a CH2, which is connected to a cyclohexyl group and an OH. So the substituent is CH2-OH and CH2-Cyclohexane? Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group attached to the main cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is then attached to the main cyclohexane ring. Let me try to draw it mentally.

So the target has two cyclohexane rings. One ring is the main cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. At position 1 (probably adjacent), there's a substituent which is a methyl group that has a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group attached. So it's like a branching point: the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and at position 1, there's a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So the substituent is a cyclic group (cyclohexyl) attached to a CH2OH group, which in turn is attached to the main ring.

Wait, perhaps I should think about
