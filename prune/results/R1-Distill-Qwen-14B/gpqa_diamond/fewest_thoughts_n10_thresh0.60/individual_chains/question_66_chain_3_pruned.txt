Okay, I'm trying to figure out this SMEFT question. Let's start by recalling what I know about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). SMEFT is an effective theory that encapsulates all possible higher-dimensional operators that can appear in the Standard Model. These operators are organized by their dimension, with the leading terms being dimension six.

Now, the question is about symmetries that all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I remember that all terms in the SMEFT action should respect Lorentz symmetry. Because the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, any effective operator derived from it should also preserve this symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The Standard Model respects Poincare, so SMEFT should too. But wait, in effective theories, sometimes you can have operators that break some of these symmetries, depending on how you derive them. Or maybe not? I'm a bit fuzzy here. Wait, no, SMEFT is built by integrating out the heavy fields, so the resulting operators should still respect the same symmetries as the original model. Since the Standard Model has Poincare symmetry, SMEFT operators must preserve it. So option 2, Poincare, would be correct as well.

Wait, but I've heard that sometimes in effective theories,
