Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with varying numbers of carbons, hydrogens, oxygens.

Alright, let me start by breaking down each piece of data given.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak could also suggest an -OH group, maybe from an alcohol or a phenol. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine, but I don't think that's the case here because the formulas don't include nitrogen. So, probably an -OH.

Then, there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, those are both in the range of carbonyl groups. The 1700 is a typical carbonyl, maybe like a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. The 1650 is a bit lower, so maybe an aromatic carbonyl, or perhaps an amide, but again, no nitrogen. Alternatively, conjugated carbonyls or something like that.

Wait, 1700 is around where esters and ketones are, while 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bondsâ€”like a C=C in a ring. Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, such as an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. Another possibility is that 1650 is a carbonyl but maybe part of an ester group if there's conjugation. Or perhaps it's a C=C stretch. For example, in alkenes, the C=C stretch is usually around 1600-1680 cm-1. So the 1650 could be a C=C in a conjugated system, like in an aromatic ring or perhaps an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but the FTIR also says there are peaks at 1700 and 1
