Okay, so I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins. Each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). But wait, actually, I think the formula is Z = sum_{states} exp(-E/(kT)), but since β is 1/(kT), it's exp( -β E ). Or wait, no, wait: sometimes the Hamiltonian is written as H = ..., and the energy is E, so the Boltzmann factor is exp( -β E ). So yes, each term in Z is exp(-β E) for each state.

Now, each spin S can be +1 or -1. So each has two states. For three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. So I need to calculate E for each of the 8 possible combinations and then sum exp(-β E) for all of them.

But calculating each of the 8 terms might be a bit tedious, but maybe manageable. Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way by considering the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Wait, each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. Because S_i is ±1, so S_i S_j = 1 if they are the same, -1 if opposite. So each term S_i S_j in the sum can be ±1.

Let me think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term is either +1 or -1. So the sum can range from 3 (all +1) to -3 (all -1), but let's see all possible sums.

Wait, let's list all possible states and compute the sum.

But that's 8 states. Let me list them:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
   S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum = 3 → E = -J(3) = -3J

2. S1=+1, S2=+1,
