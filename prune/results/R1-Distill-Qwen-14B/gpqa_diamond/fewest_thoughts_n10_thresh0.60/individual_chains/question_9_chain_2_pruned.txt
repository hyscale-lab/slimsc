Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, C3h symmetry... I remember that C3h is a type of molecular symmetry, right? Let me think about what C3h symmetry entails. 

C3h is one of the symmetry classes in the point group classification. Point groups describe the symmetry of a molecule. C3h has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane (Ïƒ) that includes this axis. Alternatively, I think it can also have a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, point groups with a Cn axis include C3, and if there's a horizontal mirror plane, that would make it C3h. Right, so the molecule should have a threefold rotation symmetry and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis. So, looking for a structure that's symmetric in three parts around an axis and has a mirror plane.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. The name suggests three substituents attached to a central structure. Maybe a corannulene or something similar. I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Another complex name. Benzo suggests a benzene ring fused with some furan rings. The numbering is a bit tricky, but maybe it's a structure with multiple rings.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Hmm, triisopropyl borate would have a boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl has a CH(CH3)2 structure, so the molecule would be something like (i-Pr)3BO. So the boron is attached to three identical isopropyl groups. So the molecule is symmetric because all three substituents are the same. Now, does this symmetry reach C3h?

Wait, triisopropyl borate. So the structure is a central boron atom with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is a symmetrical substituent. So, the molecule
