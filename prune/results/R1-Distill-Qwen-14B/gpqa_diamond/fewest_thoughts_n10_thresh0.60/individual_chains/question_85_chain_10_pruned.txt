Okay, so I've got this problem about planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. But wait, the question gives me some data about the RV method and transit method findings. Let me parse this.

First, the star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. The planets have masses of 7 and 5 Earth masses, and radii 1.7 and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which probably means the same reflectivity, so that won't affect the calculation.

The RV method gives the Doppler shift, which is used to find the mass of the planet and the distance from the star. The transit method gives the radius of the planet because it blocks some light. But for equilibrium temperature, the main factors are the star's luminosity and the planet's distance.

Wait, the question gives some Doppler shifts in the [OI] line. Oh, right, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us due to the planet's gravity. The amount of shift tells us about the planet's mass and the distance (since a planet closer in would cause a bigger shift for the same mass, perhaps? Or maybe it's the other way around. Hmm.)

Wait, the problem says that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 a shift of 0.04 Å. So the shift is related to the mass and the orbital period and the inclination. Oh wait, but both are detected via RV, so they must be in the same system. So the RV shift depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. But since the RV shift is periodic, perhaps the semi-amplitude K is given by some formula.

I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_star) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(c)) * (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet)) )^(1/3) * (1 / P
