Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on amplitude and the spring constant. But wait, this one is relativistic, so I can't ignore relativistic effects. 

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional system with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The total energy is (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Since this is relativistic, that answer might not be correct.

In relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the kinetic energy (K) would be (gamma - 1)mc². So energy conservation in the relativistic case would relate the potential energy and the kinetic energy.

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². At maximum amplitude, x = A, so the potential energy is (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is at its maximum.

So the total energy E is equal to the potential energy at x = A, which is (1/2)kA². So E = (gamma_max - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Let me write that equation down: (gamma_max - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Gamma_max is 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²). So substituting that in:

[ (1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)) - 1 ] * mc² = (1/2)kA².

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for v_max. Let's denote v = v_max for simplicity.

So, (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²
