Okay, so I've got this question about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, so F equals negative kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max. Oh, and it's relativistic, so I guess we can't use the classical formulas directly. The options have some sqrt terms and involve c, the speed of light.

Wait, in the classical case, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is v_max = sqrt(kA/m). But that's non-relativistic. Since this is relativistic, I think we have to consider the relativistic effects on the energy.

In relativity, the total energy isn't just kinetic plus potential in the same way. Let me think. Oh right, the total energy E is gamma times m c squared, where gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma is the Lorentz factor.

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)k x². But wait, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and the potential is (1/2)kx². So the total mechanical energy is conserved, E = (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kA². Wait, no, wait. At maximum amplitude, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. So the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA^2. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, so (1/2)mv_max^2 = (1/2)kA^2. So v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) as I thought earlier.

But wait, that's non-relativistic. In reality, when speeds get close to c, we can't use that. So the relativistic approach would involve the total energy.

So in the relativistic case, the total energy E is gamma m c². At maximum amplitude, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and kinetic energy is zero. So E = (1/2)k A².

Wait, is that correct? Oh wait, no. Because in the relativistic scenario, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic
