Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the spectroscopy stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons but varying hydrogens and oxygen counts. The choices are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. So, I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

Let me break down the data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but the peak is very broad. Oh right, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch because they're strong acids and the protons are easily donated. Alcohols have a broad peak too but maybe less so? Or maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. Another possibility is that it's an ether, but I don't think so because ethers don't have O-H bonds. Hmm. So the broad peak suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Then there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So what functional groups have that? Like ketones, aldehydes, esters, carboxylic acids, maybe amides. But the 1650 peak is a bit lower. Wait, carboxylic acids typically have a strong C=O around 1700, and maybe an absorption around 1680 or so for conjugated carbonyls or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Ester carbonyls are around 1740 usually, but sometimes lower, maybe if it's an aromatic ester or something. Wait, no, if it's conjugated, maybe the carbonyl is lower. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a conjugated ester or a ketone with conjugation.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone that's next to a double bond. So for example, a ketone adjacent to a double bond would have a lower wavenumber. Or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group attached. Like acetophenone or something similar. But then why another peak at 1650? What's that?

Wait, 1650 is around where conjugated carbonyls might be. Or maybe an aromatic ring with some substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but I don't think that's the case here because I don't see any data indicating N in the structure. So perhaps the 1650 is another carbonyl group, but that doesn't make much sense. Or maybe it
