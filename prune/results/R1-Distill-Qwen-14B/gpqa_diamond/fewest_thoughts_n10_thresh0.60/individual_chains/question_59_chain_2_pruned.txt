Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pH calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So the key here is probably to figure out if there's excess acid or base after they react.

Let me think about each component. There's acetic acid (CH3COOH), which is a weak acid. Then there's HCl, a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2, a strong base. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate, and Ba(OH)2 will completely dissociate into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions.

Wait, but wait. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so when it's in solution, it'll release two OH- ions per formula unit. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

So I think the first step is to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each.

First, for CH3COOH. It's 500 mL of 0.1 M. Moles = Molarity Ã— Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't completely dissociate, but maybe that's not the first thing to worry about because we might have a neutralization reaction.

Then, HCl is 400 mL of 0.2 M. So moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll contribute 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is 300 mL of 0.3 M. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles
