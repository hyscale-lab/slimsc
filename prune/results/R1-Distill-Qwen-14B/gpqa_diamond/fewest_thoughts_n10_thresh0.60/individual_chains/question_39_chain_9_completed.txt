Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it. The question is about wave functions and normalization, right? 

Alright, the setup: there are ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but when you measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region for the probability to be zero there. Oh, but wait, the given wave function is non-zero beyond x=1? Hmm, maybe I need to check that.

Wait no, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But for the system, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps this wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Because if the wave function were non-zero outside, there would be a probability of finding the particle there. So maybe the given expression is the part that's non-zero between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

But wait, the expression has x in the denominator, so when x is between 1 and 3, 1+x is 2 to 4, so sqrt(1+x) is about 1.414 to 2. So a over that would be a term, minus 0.5i. But wait, the wave function being complex... but I think the key here is that the probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function. So to find the normalization constant 'a', I need to compute the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a function that can be complex, but the probability is |ψ|^2. So I can compute this.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when I square the modulus, it'll be [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) ) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ* would be a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when I multiply ψ* by ψ, I get [a^2/(1+x)] + (i a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) + (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i). Wait, maybe I should just compute ψ*(x) times ψ(x).

Wait, ψ* is the complex conjugate. So ψ* = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + 0.5i. So ψ* times ψ is (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) + (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i). Simplifying, the terms are a²/(1+x) + (0.5i * a)/(sqrt(1+x)) * 2 (since cross terms are same) plus (0.25 i^2). Wait, but i^2 is -1, so the last term is 0.25*(-1) = -0.25.

Wait, but in the end, the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (a * 0.5 * 2i)/(sqrt(1+x)) ) + [ (0.5i)(-0.5i) ). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: modulus squared is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

So in this case, the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ|^2 = [a²/(1+x)] + [ (0.5)^2 ].

So |ψ(x)|² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Thus, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of (a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1.

Wait, but that seems a bit odd because the term a²/(1+x) would integrate to a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3, and the 0.25 term would integrate to 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

Wait, but let's compute each integral separately.

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is a² * ln( (1+3)/(1+1) ) = a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2).

Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the answer.


To determine the value of "a" in the wave function, we start with the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function, which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The wave function is valid only between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), and the total probability must integrate to 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **Integral of \(\frac{a^2}{1+x}\):**
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Integral of \(0.25\):**
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
