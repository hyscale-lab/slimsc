Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, right? But the elements here are -1, 2, 1. Wait, but I'm a bit hazy on normalization. Oh wait, states must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1. Let me check that.

So sum = (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, that's 6. So the state isn't normalized. Oh, wait, but wait, the state vector given is probably not normalized, so maybe I need to normalize it before proceeding. That's an important step because all the probabilities depend on it.

So the state vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me compute its norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So to normalize, I should divide each component by sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T. Let me note that down
