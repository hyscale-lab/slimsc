Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about a diatomic molecule switching states upon absorbing a photon. Hmm, diatomic molecules like O2 or H2, right?

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon that allows it to switch to the next lowest energy state. Wait, what's the fundamental state in this context? Oh, right, the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So the molecule is initially in the ground state, and it absorbs a photon to move to the next state. But which state is that?

I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized considering both rotation and vibration. Oh wait, the question specifies the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe that's a clue. Wait, no, the non-rigid rotor is more about rotation, but the question also mentions vibration, so perhaps a combined model.

Wait, but the model is the rotation-vibration model. So the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (rotational quantum number R=0 or 1? I'm a bit confused. Wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational state is given by R, and the vibrational state by v. The ground state would be the lowest energy, which is v=0 and R=0 maybe? Or R=1
