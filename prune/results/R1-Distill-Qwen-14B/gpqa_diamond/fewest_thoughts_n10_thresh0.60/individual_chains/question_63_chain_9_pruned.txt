Okay, so I've got this physics problem about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is probably the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration, right?

So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state. But wait, the next state with the lowest possible energyâ€”does that mean the next vibrational state or the next rotational state? Or a combination of both? Oh, right, in such models, the vibrational transitions are usually more energetic than rotational ones. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the minimal energy increase. I think that would be a transition from the ground state to the next state, which could involve either a vibrational or rotational change. But which has lower energy?

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy levels. In the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized. But I'm not exactly clear on how the energy levels are structured. Oh, right, the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The vibrational energy has
