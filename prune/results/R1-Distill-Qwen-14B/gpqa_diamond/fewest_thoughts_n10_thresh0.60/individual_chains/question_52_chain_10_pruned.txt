Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The question is about a star with certain parameters. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, I remember something about the Boltzmann equation from my studies, which relates the populations of different energy levels in a gas. The equation is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy) and E is the energy difference. Since the question is about the ratio of two levels, I think this equation is going to be key here.

Wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall temperature is lower, 5500 K, compared to 6000 K without spots. And the ratio of level 1 to level 2 (or vice versa) is decreasing. So perhaps the denominator is getting larger or the numerator is getting smaller.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2. They observed that when spots are present, this ratio is lower. So when the star has spots (5500 K), the ratio is lower than when it doesn't (6000 K). So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So the factor by which it changes is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = something greater than 1.

But wait, in the problem statement, the ratio when the star has spots is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000K divided by (
