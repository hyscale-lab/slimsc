Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all angles equal too. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombohedral structure, the three edges are equal, but the angles can be different. Or wait, no, wait. Oh right, in a rhombohedral structure, it's a special case of the hexagonal crystal system? Or wait, maybe I'm confusing with something else. No, rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic structures, right? Or wait, maybe not. Oh, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Angstrom and all angles alpha, beta, gamma equal to 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, first, what's interplanar distance? Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ), where a is the lattice parameter, and l, m, n are the Miller indices of the plane. Or wait, is that correct?

Wait, another formula I remember is if the crystal is cubic, then the formula simplifies because the angles are 90 degrees. But in this case, the angles are 30 degrees each, so it's definitely not cubic. So
