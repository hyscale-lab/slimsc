Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through. So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The cavity isn't at the center; it's shifted by some distance s from the center of the conductor. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, with r less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Alright, point P is outside the conductor, so its distance from the conductor's center is L, and from the cavity's center, it's l. The angle between l and s is theta. So, l, L are both bigger than R, meaning P is definitely outside the conductor.

Wait, what do I remember about conductors and charges inside cavities? Oh right, when you have a conductor with a cavity and you place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor itself remains neutral overall, but charges redistribute. But wait, in this case, the conductor was initially uncharged, and we've added a charge +q inside. So the conductor would have induced charges. 

But since the conductor was uncharged, the total charge on it must be zero. So the induced charges would be: the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it out. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Because the conductor was initially uncharged, adding +q inside the cavity would cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an induced charge of -q. Then, since the conductor's total charge was zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. So inner is -q, outer is +q, net zero. Wait, no, wait, the conductor was uncharged before, and the +q is added inside. So the conductor's inner surface would have -q, and since the conductor's own charge was zero, the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor as a whole would have a net charge of +q? Wait, no, because the conductor's initial charge was zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q so that the total (conductor) charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0.
