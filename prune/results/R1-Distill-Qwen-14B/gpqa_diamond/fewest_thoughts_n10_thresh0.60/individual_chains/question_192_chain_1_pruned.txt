Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me start by reading it again carefully.

The setup is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R, which makes sense because it's inside. Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. 

Hmm, so I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but I remember something about conductors and charge distribution. Let me think. Since the conductor is uncharged, initially, the charge inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, but the conductor is uncharged, so the total induced charge should balance that. 

Wait, no. Let's think again. If you have a conductor with a cavity and there's a charge inside the cavity, the charges in the conductor will redistribute. The inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) will have an induced charge equal and opposite to the charge inside the cavity. So if it's +q inside, the inner surface will have -q. Then, since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, because the total conductor charge was zero. 

But wait, the conductor was uncharged. So the inner cavity's charge is +q, which induces -q on the inner surface. The conductor itself had no net charge, so the outer surface must have +q to balance. So the outer surface has +q. 

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So when considering the electric field outside a charged conductor, I think we treat it as if all the charge is concentrated at the center. Because of the spherical symmetry, the electric field outside depends only on the total enclosed charge. So for a point outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if the charge were a point charge at the center of the conductor. 

Wait, but in this case, the conductor
