Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally like in classical mechanics. Oh right, special relativity comes into play here.

Let me see, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but waitâ€”the question is about their relative speed. Oh, wait no, the first part is about the relative speed between them. Or wait, maybe it's about the speed of one relative to the other? Because if they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed would be the difference, but relativistically it's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the speed of the center of momentum frame or something else. Or perhaps the relative speed from one astronaut's perspective. Hmm. I think the relative speed here refers to the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame of reference. So for example, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from B's frame, what is A's speed?

Wait, but wait, no, because if they're both moving in the same direction, then in the frame of the one with the lower speed, the other would be moving at a higher speed. But relativistic addition is more involved. The
