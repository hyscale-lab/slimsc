Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities at significant fractions of the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics. I need to use Einstein's velocity addition formula because classical addition would give speeds greater than c, which isn't possible according to relativity.

Wait, wait. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. I think it's something like (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²), but I'm not sure. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Oh right, if one object is moving at u and the other at v, then from the perspective of the second, the first is moving at (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, in this problem, both are moving in the same direction, so I need to find the relative speed of one with respect to the other.

Wait, the problem says both are moving in the positive x-direction. So astronaut 1 has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, astronaut 2 is 3m and 0.5c. So, let's say astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c, and astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c. So from astronaut 2's frame, how fast is astronaut 1 moving?

Wait, no. The relative speed would be the speed of astronaut 1 as seen from astronaut 2's frame, right? So I should use u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Because u is the velocity of the first object (0.6c), and v is the velocity of the second (0.5c). So plugging in, u' = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So around 0.1
