Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

The problem involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. After both reactions are completed, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Alright, let's tackle Reaction I first. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The reaction uses LAH, which I remember is Lithium Aluminum Hydride—a strong reducing agent. LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, when (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH, the ketone group at position 3 should be reduced to a secondary alcohol. The structure would become (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw that.

The starting molecule is a ketone: position 3 is the carbonyl group. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3, but wait, the hexan-3-one means it's six carbons with the ketone on C3. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Hmm, wait, no. Let me count. Hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think. The structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3, but with the chain being longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Wait, the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is: 

Positions 1 2 3 4 5 6.

So, position 3 is a ketone (O). Position 5 has a methoxy group. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH3? No, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2- something? Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Oh, but in this case, it's 5-methoxy, so the methoxy is on carbon 5. So:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C(O)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: OCH3 attached to it?
Wait, wait. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Because the 5th carbon (carbon 5) has the OCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

But wait, that seems a bit off. Let me try to write it as:

The molecule is hexan-3-one, which is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3. So, carbon 3 is the ketone. Then, 5-methoxy means on carbon 5, which is the third carbon from the ketone. Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3

But wait, 5-methoxy would mean there's a methoxy group on carbon 5. So, carbon 5 would have OCH3. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2?

Wait, no, perhaps another way. Let me imagine the structure as:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. So, at carbon 5, OCH3 is attached.

When this is treated with LAH, the ketone (C=O) at position 3 is reduced to an alcohol. So, the product becomes (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait, the configuration—since it's (S) configuration, after reduction, does the configuration change? Let me think. The starting material is a ketone, which is a planar sp² hybridized carbon. When reduced to an alcohol (sp³), the configuration is created. Since the starting material is (S), when the ketone is reduced, the alcohol will have an R or S configuration? Wait, no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product will also be a single enantiomer because the reduction creates the stereocenter.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The ketone is at C3. So, the structure is:

At C3: O=C-O.

Wait, no, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should not get bogged down in the exact structure but just focus on the fact that the ketone is being reduced to an alcohol.

So, after Reaction I, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's a secondary alcohol with a stereocenter at C3. So, it's a chiral molecule, and thus will have enantiomers unless it's a meso compound. Wait, but in this case, the molecule is (S) configuration, so the product is a single enantiomer—so when you run it on a chiral HPLC column, it would show as one peak. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you have a chiral compound, a chiral HPLC column can separate enantiomers. But if you have a single enantiomer, it will only show one peak. So, Reaction I's product is a single enantiomer, so combining products from both reactions...

Wait, hold on. Let me think about Reaction II.

Reaction II starts with pentane-2,4-dione. The structure is (CH3)COCH2COCH3. So, it's a diketone. When treated with excess NaBH4, which is a reducing agent, but I think it's a stronger reducing agent than something like NaOH. Wait, NaBH4 is a mild reducing agent. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, but when there are multiple ketones, like in a diketone, what happens?

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH3. So, two ketone groups. When treated with excess NaBH4, each ketone will be reduced. So, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So, the product will be (CH3)CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3.

Wait, but wait. NaBH4 can sometimes have issues with diketones because the two ketones are in close proximity. But I think in this case, it should reduce both ketones. The product would be 2,4-pentanediol, I think. But wait, pentane-2,4-dione would become 2,4-pentanediol. So, the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

Wait, but wait, that's a diol with two adjacent OH groups? No, it's on C2 and C4. So, the structure is CH3CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3.

But wait, each of those OH groups would be on a secondary carbon. So each OH is on a CH2 group. Wait, no: the structure is:

Positions 1 2 3 4 5.

Structure: 1 is CH3, 2 is CH(OH), 3 is CH2, 4 is CH(OH), 5 is CH3.

So, the molecule is symmetric? Because the OH groups are on C2 and C4, and the molecule is symmetrical around the center (C3). So, the molecule is a meso compound. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two stereocenters mirror images of each other. So, the molecule would be a meso form, meaning it's achiral, even though it has stereocenters.

Wait, let me think about the configuration. Each OH can be either R or S. On C2, if the OH is on the left, then the configuration would be S or R depending on the substituents. Similarly for C4. But because the molecule is symmetrical, the configurations on C2 and C4 would be opposite, leading to the meso form. So, the product of Reaction II is a meso compound, which is achiral.

So, Reaction II's product is a single compound, but achiral.

Putting it together, the products from both reactions are:

From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. A single enantiomer, chiral.

From Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol (meso form), which is achiral.

So, when the two products are combined, the mixture contains:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral, one enantiomer)
2. 2,4-pentanediol (meso, one compound, achiral)

Wait, but wait. Each product is from a separate reaction, and they are combined. So, the combined products are:

Product I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (1 compound, chiral)
Product II: 2,4-pentanediol (1 compound, achiral)

So, total of two compounds in the mixture.

But wait, another point: in Reaction I, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, does it produce any diastereomers? Let me think about the starting material. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The reduction of the ketone would create a new stereocenter. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the reduction would give a single enantiomer of the alcohol. Because the ketone was in (S) configuration, the resulting alcohol would have a specific configuration, perhaps R or S. Wait, but the exact configuration might not matter; the point is, it's a single enantiomer.

Wait, but wait: when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the starting material. Oh, wait, the ketone is planar, so the reduction would create a new stereocenter with a specific configuration. Since the starting material is (S), the product would retain that configuration? Or does the configuration change? Hmm, perhaps not. The starting molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The configuration is around the chiral center at C5. The C3 is the carbonyl, which is not a stereocenter. So, when the ketone is reduced to alcohol, a new stereocenter is formed at C3. The starting material's configuration was at C5. So, the product from Reaction I would have a new stereocenter at C3, which would be R or S depending on how the reduction proceeded.

Wait, but wait. The (S) designation in the starting material is at C5. So, the C3 was not a stereocenter before; it's a carbonyl. So, when reduced, it becomes a stereocenter. The starting material is S at C5, but the new stereocenter at C3 is in the product.

But regardless, the point is, the product is a single enantiomer with a specific configuration at C3. So, it's chiral.

Then, the second reaction produces a meso compound, which is achiral. So, in the mixture after combining both products, we have two compounds: one chiral and one achiral.

Wait, but wait. Could the first reaction's product be a pair of enantiomers? No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and LAH would reduce the ketone to the corresponding alcohol with a specific configuration. So, the product is a single enantiomer, not a racemic mixture.

So, the combined products are:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral, single enantiomer)
2. 2,4-pentanediol (meso, achiral)

So, two compounds in total.

Now, when these are run on an HPLC column.

First, the normal-phase HPLC. Normal-phase separates based on polarity, with the stationary phase being polar (like silica) and the mobile phase non-polar. The number of peaks depends on the number of different compounds. Since we have two compounds, each should elute as a separate peak. So, two peaks in normal-phase.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think about the normal-phase HPLC. How does normal-phase chromatography work? It separates based on the polarity of the compounds; more polar compounds elute later. But if two compounds are present, each will have a different retention time, so each will produce a separate peak. So, in the normal-phase HPLC, we should see two peaks.

Now, the chiral HPLC column. This is used to separate enantiomers. So, if a compound is chiral, it will have two peaks (enantiomers) on a chiral column. If it's achiral, it will elute as a single peak.

So, looking at our two compounds:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: chiral. On a chiral column, since it's a single enantiomer, it would have one peak.

Wait, no—wait. Wait, a chiral column can separate enantiomers. If you have a single enantiomer, it will not split into two peaks; it would just elute as one peak. Because the column is chiral, but the sample is a single enantiomer, there's nothing to separate. So, on the chiral column, this compound would be a single peak.

2. 2,4-pentanediol (meso form): achiral. On a chiral column, it would also elute as a single peak, because achiral compounds don't interact with a chiral stationary phase in a way that would cause them to split into enantiomers. Alternatively, they might not interact much, but they would still come out as a single peak.

Wait, but wait. Wait, wait. Chiral columns are designed to separate enantiomers. If you have an achiral compound, does it interact with the stationary phase in a way that causes it to have a single peak? Yes. Because it doesn't have chirality, so it doesn't have two mirror-image forms that would be separated. So, the meso compound would just come out as one peak.

So, on the chiral HPLC, we have two compounds: one chiral (single peak) and one achiral (single peak). So, total of two peaks.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Reaction I's product is a single enantiomer. So, when run on a chiral column, which is designed to separate enantiomers, would it show as one peak? Because it's just one enantiomer, not a racemic mixture. So, yes, it would be a single peak. The meso compound is achiral, so another single peak.

So, on the chiral HPLC, two peaks.

On the normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

But wait, let me think again about the products. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: when the products are combined, perhaps there is more than one compound. For example, maybe Reaction I produces more than one product, or Reaction II does?

Wait, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one + LAH → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's one product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione + excess NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol (meso). That's another product.

So, combining them, you have two different compounds, each present as a single entity. So, when run on HPLC, each would elute as a peak.

Now, the normal-phase HPLC would not separate enantiomers. So, for (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is chiral, on normal-phase, it would just have a single peak because the column doesn't distinguish between enantiomers. The meso compound is achiral, so it would also have a single peak.

Wait, no. Wait, no, because the normal-phase isn't a chiral column, so enantiomers would not be separated—they would co-elute. But in our case, only the first compound is chiral, and it's a single enantiomer. So, in the normal-phase, you would see two peaks: one for each compound.

Wait, but for the first compound, it's a single enantiomer. So, normal-phase would see it as a single compound, so one peak. The second is a single compound (meso), so another peak. So, two peaks in normal-phase.

Chiral HPLC: two peaks (each compound as a single peak on the chiral column). So, two peaks.

Wait, but the options don't have two and two. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 5 and 4
B) 3 and 2
C) 4 and 2
D) 3 and 3

Wait, none of the options say two and two. Hmm. Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction I, the product is a secondary alcohol, but maybe it has more than one stereocenter.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, C5 has a methoxy group and is a stereocenter (S configuration). When we reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, a new stereocenter is formed at C3. So, the product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Wait, hold on! That's a key point. The product from Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two stereocenters: the original at C5 and the new one at C3.

Wait, but wait. Is the original C5 a stereocenter in the starting material? The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, does the C5 have four different substituents?

Let me imagine the structure:

The structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps:

The starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, it's CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is six carbons with ketone on C3. So, positions 1-6:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's seven carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong again. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

(CH2)2-C(O)-(CH2)2-OCH3.

Wait, maybe it's:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, that's five carbons? No, because hexan-3-one is six carbons. So:

Positions 1 to 6:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH2
6: OCH3.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the substituents on C5 would be two CH2 groups, so maybe it's not a stereocenter.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me take another approach. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the C5 has a methoxy group and is a chiral center. Upon reduction, C3 becomes a new chiral center. So the product is a diastereomer with two chiral centers.

So, the product from Reaction I is a molecule with two stereocenters. Is it possible that this product is a pair of enantiomers, or just a single compound?

Wait, no. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the reaction would produce a single product with two stereocenters. But wait, the starting material's configuration is at C5. The reduction at C3 would create a new stereocenter, but since the reaction is stereospecific, the configuration would be determined based on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, perhaps the reduction of a ketone with LAH produces a specific configuration. LAH is a strong reducing agent, and typically, ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols with the hydride attacking from the less hindered side. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the configuration at C3 would be set accordingly.

But regardless, the product would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5. So, is this product a pair of enantiomers, or is it a single diastereomer?

Wait, but the original starting material is (S) configuration at C5. When you reduce C3, you create another stereocenter. So, the product is a diastereomer with two stereocenters. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would be a single diastereomer, not a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but wait. If the product has two stereocenters, but is a single diastereomer, then when run on a chiral HPLC column, would it elute as one peak?

Chiral HPLC columns are designed to separate enantiomers. A diastereomer is not the same as an enantiomer; diastereomers have different physical properties. So, diastereomers would elute at different times on a normal-phase column, but on a chiral column, maybe they would behave differently.

Wait, but a diastereomer is not necessarily chiral. Wait, no, a diastereomer can be chiral or not. For example, if a molecule has two stereocenters and is not a meso compound, the two diastereomers would each be chiral, and each would have their own enantiomers. But in this case, the product has two stereocenters, but perhaps the molecule is chiral. So, on a chiral HPLC column, would it show as one peak or two?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the product from Reaction I has two stereocenters. Suppose the molecule is chiral. Then, on a chiral column, it would have a single peak because it's a single enantiomer. But wait, no. If the molecule has two stereocenters and is chiral, then the chiral column would separate enantiomers. But if the sample is a single enantiomer, it would come out as one peak.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me think again about the product from Reaction I.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at C3 and a methoxy at C5, and the configuration at C5 is S.

Upon reduction, the ketone at C3 becomes an alcohol, introducing a new stereocenter at C3. So, the product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5. But what is the configuration at C3?

Well, the starting material is (S) at C5. The ketone is at C3, so when reduced, the new stereocenter at C3 will have a specific configuration based on the reduction. But the exact configuration might not matter for our purposes.

But the key point is, the product has two stereocenters. Does this make the molecule chiral or not?

If the molecule has two stereocenters and is not a meso compound, then it's chiral. If it's a meso compound, it's achiral.

So, is the product a meso compound? Let's see.

In the product, after reduction, the substituents around each stereocenter would determine if the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. At C3, the substituents are: two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), an OH group, and a CH2-OCH3 group (from C5?).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the two stereocenters are mirror images, then it's a meso compound; otherwise, it's chiral.

Let me suppose that the product has two stereocenters and is a meso compound. Then, it would be achiral. But how?

Wait, let's think about the positions. The two stereocenters are at C3 and C5. If the groups around C3 are mirrored by the groups around C5, then the molecule could be a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps not. Let me consider a specific example. Take tartaric acid, which is a meso compound. It has two stereocenters, and the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

If the product from Reaction I has a similar arrangement, then it would be a meso compound and hence achiral. But I'm not entirely sure without knowing the exact structure.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. After reduction, the C3 becomes a stereocenter. So, the molecule has two stereocenters. Let me imagine the structure:

At C3: substituents are CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), OH, and CH2-OCH3 (from C5?).

Wait, perhaps the substituents are not symmetrical. So, maybe the molecule is chiral, not meso.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if C3 and C5 are mirror images, leading to a meso compound.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to tell. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the product from Reaction I is a single chiral compound, which would result in one peak on the chiral column and one on the normal-phase.

But then, the product from Reaction II is a meso compound, which is achiral, giving another peak on both columns.

Wait, but this brings us back to two peaks in each column, which isn't one of the options. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction II, the product is not a meso compound. Let me reconsider.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4. The product is 2,4-pentanediol.

So, the structure is (CH3)CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

Wait, is that a meso compound?

Yes. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry. The two OH groups are on C2 and C4, which are symmetric around C3. So, the configurations on C2 and C4 are mirror images. So, the molecule is a meso compound, meaning it's achiral.

So, Reaction II's product is a single, achiral compound.

Reaction I's product: Assuming it's a single enantiomer (chiral), then the combined products are two compounds: one chiral, one achiral.

So, when run on normal-phase HPLC, which doesn't distinguish between enantiomers, each compound would be a separate peak. So, two peaks.

When run on chiral HPLC, the chiral compound would elute as one peak (since it's a single enantiomer), and the achiral would elute as another peak. So, two peaks.

But none of the options match this. Wait, looking at the options:

Option B says 3 and 2.

Option C says 4 and 2.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products from each reaction.

Wait, maybe Reaction I produces more than one product? Let me think. LAH is a strong reducing agent. Could it reduce other functional groups besides the ketone? The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Methoxy is an ether group. LAH typically doesn't reduce ethers. So, only the ketone is reduced, giving a single product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione reduces to 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. So, one product.

So, total two products.

Hmm. So, the chromatograms should each show two peaks. But the options don't have that. Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps the products from each reaction are more than one. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe in Reaction II, NaBH4 can reduce the ketones, but since there are two, could they form different diastereomers? But no, because the product is a meso compound, so it's a single compound.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction I, the reduction leads to more than one product. For example, is there a possibility of forming diastereomers?

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When reduced, the product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5. So, the product could be a diastereomer, but that would require that the reaction creates different configurations.

But no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have specific configurations at both stereocenters. So, it's a single diastereomer, hence a single compound.

Wait, but if the product has two stereocenters and is chiral, then on the chiral HPLC, it would have one peak. The meso product would have another.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction is stereospecific. So, the reduction would produce a single product.

Hmm. I'm going in circles. Let me think about the options.

Option B says 3 and 2. That would suggest that in the chiral HPLC, three peaks, and in normal-phase, two.

How could that happen?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the number of stereocenters in Reaction I's product.

Wait, if the product from Reaction I is a meso compound, then it's achiral. So, the products would be:

1. Meso compound (achiral) from Reaction I.

2. Meso compound (achiral) from Reaction II.

So, in that case, when combined, the mixture has two achiral compounds. So, normal-phase would see two peaks, and chiral would see two peaks (but each would be a single peak because they're achiral).

Wait, but that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a meso compound. Let me check.

The product from Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Is it a meso compound? Let's imagine.

If the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C3 and C5, making the configurations mirror images, then it's meso.

But considering the substituents:

At C3: substituents are CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), OH, and CH2-OCH3 (from C5).

At C5: substituents are CH2-OCH3, CH2 (from C4), and two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps not symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't meso, so it's chiral.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that I'm getting stuck and think about possible alternative approaches.

Wait, perhaps the products are more than I thought. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's one product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → 2,4-pentanediol. That's one product.

Combined, two products. So, in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. In chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have two and two. So, perhaps I'm missing something about the reactions.

Wait, another possibility: maybe Reaction I produces more than one product. For example, maybe the reduction leads to different products based on the approach of the hydride. But with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent, I don't think that's the case. It should reduce the ketone to a single alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. But no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about Reaction II's product. Is 2,4-pentanediol a meso compound?

Yes, as I thought before. So, it's achiral. So, it would have one peak in both HPLC columns.

If Reaction I's product is chiral, it would have one peak in normal-phase and one in chiral HPLC. So, the combined products would give two peaks in each.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake and Reaction I's product is a meso compound, thus achiral.

If that's the case, then Reaction I's product is achiral, and Reaction II's product is also achiral. So, in the mixture, two achiral compounds.

Then, on normal-phase, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, each achiral compound would come out as a single peak, because they don't have enantiomers. So, two peaks in each column.

Again, this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that Reaction I's product is a pair of enantiomers, but I don't see how that would happen with a single starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of stereocenters. Let me think about the product from Reaction I.

The product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let me imagine the structure.

At C3: new stereocenter. At C5: original stereocenter.

So, the two stereocenters are not adjacent. So, the molecule would have two stereocenters and could be chiral.

Wait, for example, if the molecule has two stereocenters and no plane of symmetry, it's chiral.

So, if it's chiral, then on the chiral column, it would produce one peak. On the normal-phase, one peak.

Reaction II: product is meso, so one peak on each.

So, in the mixture: two compounds, each with one peak on both HPLC columns.

But again, this doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps there's another possibility. What if Reaction I produces more than one diastereomer? No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction is stereospecific, so it should produce a single product.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 5 and 4

B) 3 and 2

C) 4 and 2

D) 3 and 3

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the products from Reaction I and Reaction II are more than one.

Wait, Reaction I: LAH is a strong reducing agent. Could it reduce other functional groups? The starting material has an ether group (OCH3), which LAH doesn't typically reduce. So, only the ketone is reduced.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione reduces to 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound.

Wait, but wait. Could pentane-2,4-dione reduce to more than one product? For example, perhaps if the two ketones are in positions that could be reduced in different ways. But I don't think so; NaBH4 typically reduces all ketones to alcohols.

Alternatively, perhaps during the reaction, if the diketone is treated with excess NaBH4, it might form a geminal diol. Wait, no, that's not possible because the two ketones are on different carbons.

No, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think: what if Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture? No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer. The reduction would produce a single product with a specific configuration.

Wait, maybe Reaction I's product is a diastereomer, not a single enantiomer. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. But that would require the reaction to produce racemic, which isn't the case here because the starting material is single enantiomer.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of peaks in each chromatogram.

Normal-phase HPLC: two compounds (each with different polarity) → two peaks.

Chiral HPLC: two compounds, one chiral and one achiral.

The chiral HPLC would separate the chiral compound into two peaks (if it were a racemic mixture). But in our case, the chiral compound is a single enantiomer, so it would elute as one peak. The achiral compound would elute as another peak.

So, chiral HPLC: two peaks.

But the options don't have two and two. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a meso compound, making both compounds achiral. So, two achiral compounds.

In that case, normal-phase would show two peaks, and chiral would show two peaks (each as a single peak).

So, that's two peaks in each, but no option matches that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm not considering the possibility that the product from Reaction I is a pair of diastereomers, leading to more peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the chemist combines the products, and they have more than two components.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two products. For example, if it reduces the ketone to an alcohol and also does something else, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction conditions. For Reaction I, after reduction with LAH, there's an acidic workup. Could that cause any rearrangements? I don't think so. LAH typically protonates the alcohol in the workup.

Wait, another possibility: when the products are combined, any of them could be present as diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the HPLC results based on the products.

Scenario:

- Reaction I produces a chiral compound (one peak on chiral, one on normal-phase).
- Reaction II produces an achiral compound (one peak on each column).

So, combined, two peaks in each HPLC.

But none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces two enantiomers. But that would require the product to be a racemic mixture, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, but that would mean the starting material was racemic. But the starting material is single enantiomer.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I has more than one stereocenter, and is a meso compound, thus achiral. Then, both products are achiral, giving two peaks in each column.

But how would that look on a chiral column? Each would elute as one peak. So, two peaks in each column.

But again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should look for another angle.

Another approach: the question says that after both reactions are 100% completed, the products are combined. Then, they're run on both HPLC columns.

How many peaks in each chromatogram?

Let me think in terms of number of compounds:

- Reaction I: 1 product.
- Reaction II: 1 product.
- Combined: 2 products.

So, on normal-phase HPLC: 2 peaks.

On chiral HPLC: how many peaks?

If Reaction I's product is chiral, then on chiral HPLC, it would elute as one peak (since it's a single enantiomer), and Reaction II's product would elute as another peak. So, two peaks.

But the options don't have "two and two".

Hmm. The only way to get a higher number of peaks is if there are more compounds.

Wait, perhaps the products are more than two? Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, and the product from Reaction II has more than one form.

Wait, but Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is a single compound.

So, I'm stuck. Let me try to look for another angle.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture. But that would require the reaction to proceed without stereocontrol, which it doesn't because the starting material is a single enantiomer. So, no.

Wait, perhaps I should think that Reaction I produces a diastereomer and a meso compound. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has more than one stereocenter, and the molecule is not meso, so it's chiral. Then, on the chiral column, it would produce one peak, and the meso compound would produce another.

So, two peaks on both columns.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem lies in the way the products are separated on the columns.

Wait, on a normal-phase HPLC, the separation is based on the polarity of the compounds. So, each distinct compound will give a peak.

On a chiral HPLC, the separation is based on the chirality. So, if a compound is chiral and has enantiomers, they will separate into two peaks. If the compound is achiral, it will just give one peak.

But in our case, the compounds are:

1. Chiral compound (from Reaction I) → one peak on chiral column.
2. Achiral compound (from Reaction II) → one peak on chiral column.

So, two peaks in each column.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a meso compound. So, both products are achiral.

Then, on both HPLC columns, two peaks.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is B) 3 and 2, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the number of stereocenters in Reaction I's product.

Wait, maybe the product from Reaction I has three stereocenters? No, because it started with one (C5) and added another (C3). So, two.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers but is a meso compound. So, it's achiral. Then, the two products (meso from I and meso from II) would both be achiral. So, two peaks on each HPLC.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to think about the possibility that Reaction I's product is a pair of enantiomers. But I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B) 3 and 2. Let me think why that might be.

If Reaction I's product is a pair of enantiomers (racemic), which I don't think is the case, but if so, then on the chiral HPLC, it would split into two peaks, and the meso from Reaction II would be another. So, total three on chiral. On normal-phase, the two enantiomers would co-elute as one, and the meso as another. So, two peaks. That would match option B, which says 3 and 2.

But why would Reaction I's product be a racemic mixture? Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product should be a single enantiomer.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, which would not be separated on the normal-phase column but would have different retention times on the chiral column.

Wait, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the chemist runs the combined products on each column. So, let's think about each column.

Normal-phase HPLC: separates based on polarity. So, each distinct compound will give a peak. So, two compounds → two peaks.

Chiral HPLC: separates enantiomers. So, for each chiral compound, each enantiomer will give a peak. For achiral, one peak.

In our case:

- Reaction I's product: chiral, single enantiomer → one peak.
- Reaction II's product: achiral → one peak.

So, two peaks on chiral.

But the question says, after combining the products, how many peaks in each column?

So, if each product is two, but the options don't have that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two stereocenters and is chiral. So, on the chiral column, it would have one peak. The meso product would have another. So, two peaks.

But that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the possibility of by-products or side reactions.

Hmm.

Another approach: maybe the reaction conditions cause some rearrangement.

In Reaction I: LAH is used, which is a strong reducing agent. Could it cause any elimination? Unlikely, as it's a nucleophilic reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a secondary alcohol, which could form an enol ether under acidic workup. But I think the product would just be the alcohol.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of Reaction I's product again. Suppose the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Is this structure chiral?

Yes, because it has two stereocenters (C3 and C5), and the molecule isn't a meso compound. So, it's chiral.

So, on the chiral column, it would be one peak. On the normal-phase, another.

The meso product from Reaction II would be another peak on both columns.

So, total two peaks in each column.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the workup steps.

After the reactions, the products are subjected to workup. For Reaction I, after LAH, which is acidic workup. Could that lead to any dimerization or other products? I don't think so; the product would be the alcohol.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the products are actually more than two. Let me think. Oh! Wait, perhaps in Reaction II, the product is pentane-2,4-diol, which is a meso compound. But if the reaction isn't 100% complete, perhaps some starting material remains. But the question says both reactions are 100% complete.

So, no.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, which would lead to two peaks on the chiral column. But how?

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, which is chiral. Then, on the chiral column, it's one peak. The meso product would be another. So, two peaks.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of peaks each column would show, not the sum.

Wait, the question says: the products from both reactions are combined and run on both columns. So, how many peaks in each.

So, Reaction I: one compound (chiral)
Reaction II: one compound (achiral)
Combined: two compounds.

On normal-phase: two peaks.

On chiral: two peaks.

Thus, the answer would be two and two. But the options don't have that. Hence, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a meso compound, making both products achiral.

In that case:

On normal-phase: two peaks.

On chiral: two peaks (each of the two achiral compounds would be one peak each).

But again, options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the product from Reaction I is a pair of diastereomers, leading to more peaks.

But no, Reaction I's product is a single diastereomer, so one compound.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B) 3 and 2.

How?

If Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture, which would give two peaks on the chiral column. But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so I don't think that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, which would show as one peak on chiral column and another on normal-phase.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has more than one stereocenter and forms more than one diastereomer. But I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks on the chiral column, and another peak for Reaction II's product, totaling three peaks on the chiral column.

On the normal-phase, the two enantiomers would co-elute as one, plus the meso product as another, totaling two peaks.

So, this would correspond to option B: 3 and 2.

But why would Reaction I's product be a racemic mixture? Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product should be a single enantiomer. So, I don't think this is the case.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option B.

Given the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is B) 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D) 3 and 3, but I don't see how.

Wait, another angle: the product from Reaction I might have more than one stereocenter, leading to multiple diastereomers, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, which would give two peaks on the chiral column.

Wait, if Reaction I's product is a diastereomer with two stereocenters, then on the chiral column, it would be one peak. The meso product from Reaction II would be another.

So, two peaks on chiral.

But again, no option.

Hmm. At this point, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 3 and 2. So, I'll go with that.


The problem involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist, followed by analyzing the combined products using normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction I:
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reaction**: Treated with LAH (a strong reducing agent), which reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. The product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
- **Key Points**:
  - The starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product is a single enantiomer.
  - The product has two stereocenters (C3 and C5) and is chiral.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione.
- **Reaction**: Treated with excess NaBH4, which reduces both ketones to secondary alcohols. The product is 2,4-pentanediol.
- **Key Points**:
  - The product is a meso compound due to the plane of symmetry between C2 and C4.
  - Meso compounds are achiral.

### Combined Products:
- **From Reaction I**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral, single enantiomer).
- **From Reaction II**: 2,4-pentanediol (achiral, meso compound).
- **Total Products**: Two distinct compounds, one chiral and one achiral.

### Analysis on HPLC Columns:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - Separates based on polarity.
   - Each distinct compound will elute as a separate peak.
   - **Expected Peaks**: Two peaks (one for each compound).

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Separates enantiomers. If a compound is achiral, it will elute as a single peak.
   - (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral) will elute as one peak (single enantiomer).
   - 2,4-pentanediol (achiral) will elute as another peak.
   - **Expected Peaks**: Two peaks.

### Conclusion:
- The combined products result in **two peaks** on both normal-phase and chiral HPLC columns. However, none of the provided options match this result. Based on the reasoning provided, the closest match is **Option B (3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC)**, potentially due to an alternative interpretation of the products or their separation.

ANSWER: B
