Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, pseudosphere... I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface with constant negative curvature. In two dimensions, it's like a hyperbolic space. But here, the metric is in terms of x and y, so maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space?

Wait, the metric seems to be written in two dimensions, because it's dx² + dy². Oh, right, so this is a 2D Lorentzian metric, perhaps? Or wait, no, in this case, maybe it's Riemannian because the coefficients are positive. Let me see.

The coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²). So the radius squared is 4, so radius is 2? Oh, the question mentions radius r=2. So maybe this is a metric for a hyperbolic space of radius 2.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere. Oh wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid. But in 2D, when we talk about the area of a pseudosphere, perhaps we're considering the total area, maybe up to some limit.

Wait, but in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle with radius r is πr² (1 - cosh(r/R)), where R is the curvature radius. Or is that another formula? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, for a pseudosphere in 3D, its surface area is 4πr², but that's for a regular sphere. But a pseudosphere is not a sphere, it's a surface of infinite extent. Wait, but maybe in this metric, the space is compact? Or perhaps it's a model of hyperbolic space.

Wait, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me think about the denominator, 4 - (x² + y²). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, so the metric blows up. That suggests that the space is only defined where x² + y²
