Okay, so I've been given this metric and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to break this down.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. But the question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry. Or wait, maybe it's a sphere in some space with an imaginary radius? Because pseudosphere often refers to a sphere in Minkowski space, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the metric is in terms of x and y, so maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space. Or perhaps it's a metric on a 2D manifold. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. So I need to figure out what this metric represents.

Looking at the metric, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Hmm, that reminds me of the standard metric for a sphere. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in 2D might have a denominator like (a² - x² - y²) or something similar, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, the given denominator is 4 - x² - y², so maybe that's a² where a is 2, since 4 is a squared 2. So maybe this is the metric for a sphere of radius 2. But wait, why is the numerator
