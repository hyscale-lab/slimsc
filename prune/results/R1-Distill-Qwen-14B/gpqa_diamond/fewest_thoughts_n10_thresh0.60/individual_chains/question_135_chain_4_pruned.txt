Okay, I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's read the question again.

The problem is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of X is 6 GeV. They're asking which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm. So, first things first, I need to understand what the Lagrangian is telling me about the interaction. The term involving X is Xψ̄ ψ, which suggests that the boson X couples to fermions. The fermions involved are ψ_f, which I think must be some type of fermion field. The λ is a coupling constant, and v is probably the vacuum expectation value, but maybe that's not too important right now.

Wait, the term in the Lagrangian is -λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f. Since the interaction is ψ̄ X ψ, that's a Yukawa coupling. So the boson X is coupling to fermions, and the coupling is proportional to the mass, right? Because in Yukawa interactions, that's how it works: the interaction term is g ψ̄ ψ X, and the mass term comes from the same coupling when X is replaced by its vacuum value.

But for decay processes, the key thing is the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions it can decay into. Because for a decay to be allowed, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion it's decaying into. Because each fermion will have some energy, but the minimum would be when they're produced at rest, so each needs to have mass less than half the boson's mass.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion that has mass less than 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Now, looking at the fermion masses. Let me think about the known fermion masses. Remember that particles like electrons, muons, taus are leptons, and have their masses. The quarks have masses too, but they vary. Let me list the approximate masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2 MeV (super light)
- Down quark (d): about 4-5 MeV
- Strange (s): around 95-100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: negligible (but they're leptons too, but in decay products, probably negligible masses, but the problem doesn't show neutrinos in the options, so maybe we don't consider them here)

So, considering the X boson mass is 6 GeV. Let's see
