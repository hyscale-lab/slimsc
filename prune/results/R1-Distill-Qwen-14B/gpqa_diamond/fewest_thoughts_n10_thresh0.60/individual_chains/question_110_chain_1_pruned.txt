Alright, I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, okay, I need to figure this out step by step.

So, the question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various properties. Each star has RA, DEC, magnitude, distance, and some have extinction (E(B-V)) which affects their apparent brightness. The key point is that each spectrograph can only observe stars brighter than a certain apparent V magnitude. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES up to 16 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the information says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed? Or is it stars fainter than 17? Because usually, lower magnitude means brighter. Oh wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag", which is confusing. Or wait, actually, that's probably a typo. Because if a star is brighter than 17, that would mean it's magnitude less than 17, right? Because the magnitude scale is inverted. So, for example, a star with V=10 is brighter than V=17. So the condition is that the apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 for ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, it's less than 16 mag. Because the question says, "stars brighter than 17 V mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, that would mean apparent V <= 17? Wait, no, because "brighter than" implies that the star's V magnitude is less than 17. Because, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So the limit is V < 17 for ESPRESSO, and V < 16 for HIRES.

Wait, no, the way it's phrased, maybe I got it backward. Because the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". So brightness is inversely related. So if a star has V=15, it's brighter than V=17. So, the spectrograph can observe anything brighter than 17, meaning V < 17. So for ESPRESSO, stars must have V < 17. And for HIRES, V < 16.

But wait, wait. Let me recheck the question. It says, "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So that's V < 17? Because brighter than 17 would be smaller magnitudes. So yes, it's V < 17 for ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, V < 16.

So each star must have apparent V magnitude less than 17 for ESPRESSO, and less than 16 for HIRES. But wait, the question asks which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So a star must be observable by both, meaning its apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and also less than 16 (so HIRES can see it). Wait, no, that's not
