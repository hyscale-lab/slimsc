Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to break it down.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Oh wait, wait. Wait, noâ€”wait, it says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, wait, V magnitude: the lower the number, the brighter the star. So, brighter than 17 means magnitude less than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, stars with V <17 can be observed. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V <16.

Wait, but the question is asking which stars can be detected by both. So, the star has to have V magnitude less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and also less than 16 (so HIRES can see it). So the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if it's less than 16, it's automatically less than 17. So the star must have apparent V <16 to be observable by both.

But wait, looking at the options, the stars have various properties. Let me look at each star's apparent V magnitude.

Wait, the question gives some
