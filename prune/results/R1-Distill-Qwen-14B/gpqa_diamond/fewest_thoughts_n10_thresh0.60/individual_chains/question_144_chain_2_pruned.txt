Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, the question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given parameters are E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length (or mean decay distance) depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like L = γ * cτ * β, where γ is the Lorentz factor, τ is the proper lifetime, β is the velocity relative to the speed of light, and c is the speed of light.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think again. Oh right, the mean path is c multiplied by the lifetime of the particle, multiplied by the velocity of the particle. So L = βγ c τ. But τ itself is the proper lifetime, which is calculated using the particle's width.

I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Wait, but Γ has units of energy, so how does that connect to time? Oh right, the natural units where ħ = c = 1 are often used in particle physics, but when converting to SI units, you have to include them.

Wait a second, let me clarify. The proper lifetime τ
