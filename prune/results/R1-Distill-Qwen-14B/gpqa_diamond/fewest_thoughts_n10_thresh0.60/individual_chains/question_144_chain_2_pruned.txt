Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that particles like mesons are bosons, composed of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are particles that don't exist long enough to be observed directly; they decay very quickly. The decay distance would tell us how far they travel before decaying.

The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Wait, I think the width relates to the particle's lifetime. The larger the width, the shorter the lifetime because Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime (Γ = ħ/τ, where τ is the mean lifetime). But how does this connect to the decay distance?

I remember something about the decay length formula. Decay length L is given by c multiplied by the lifetime τ. So L = c * τ. But to find τ, I need to relate it to the width Γ. Oh right, the relation is τ = ħ / Γ. So putting it together, L = (c * ħ) / Γ.

Wait, but I also need to consider the particle's speed. Because if the particle is moving at a high speed (relativistic), the lifetime observed in the lab frame would be longer due to time dilation. Oh right, the lifetime τ is the proper lifetime, and the lab frame would see it as γτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So the total decay length would be L = c * γ * τ = (c * ħ * γ) / Γ.

But how do I find γ? Since the particle's energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV, I can find its velocity. The relativistic energy is E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). But wait, the units here are in GeV, and I need to make sure the units are consistent when calculating.

Wait, let me think about the units. Energy E is in GeV, mass m is in GeV/c² (since E=mc², so m=E/(c²)). So when I compute γ = E / (m c²), the c² cancels out because m is already in GeV/c². So γ = E_X /
