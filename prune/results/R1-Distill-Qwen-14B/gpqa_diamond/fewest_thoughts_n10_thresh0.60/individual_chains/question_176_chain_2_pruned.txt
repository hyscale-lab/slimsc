Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a 3-element column vector, so the system is a 3-level quantum system, maybe something like a qutrit or just a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.

We have two observables, P and Q. Their operators are given as matrices. The first task is to compute the probability of getting a specific outcome when measuring P first and then Q, specifically P=0 and Q=-1.

So, I remember that when measuring an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

Let me break this down. First, I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of both operators P and Q. Because when you measure an observable, the possible results are the eigenvalues, and the state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector.

Wait, but wait. The initial state is given, and the measurements are done in sequence—P first, then Q. So the first measurement affects the state for the second measurement.

Hmm, so the process is:

1. Measure P, get outcome 0. Compute the probability of this outcome.
2. Then, knowing that outcome, find the new state (the eigenvector corresponding to P=0), and then compute the probability of Q=-1 in that new state.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is a superposition, so the probabilities might involve some conditional aspects.

Let me start by looking at operator P. Its matrix is given as:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Wait, perhaps I can see if P is a diagonal matrix or has some symmetry. Alternatively, maybe I can find its eigenvalues by other means.

Alternatively, maybe I can figure out the eigenvectors without explicitly finding the eigenvalues, but that might be complicated.
