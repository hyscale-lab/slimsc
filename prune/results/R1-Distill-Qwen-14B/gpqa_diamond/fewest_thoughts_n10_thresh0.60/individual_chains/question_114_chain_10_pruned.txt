Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll think it through.

The first part of the question is about a reaction involving butan-2-one. The starting material is butan-2-one, which I know is (CH3)2CO. Then it's reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, so I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. So maybe this is a nucleophilic addition.

But wait, when a ketone reacts with CN- (like in the presence of a strong acid?), the product would be an addition product. But in this case, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction? Or perhaps it's a case of adding CN- to the carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin. Oh right, cyanohydrin formation! So the reaction is adding CN- to the carbonyl group, which would form an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent to each other.

But wait, how does that reaction proceed? I think that adding a cyanide to a ketone typically gives a cyanohydrin. The mechanism involves the attack of CN- on the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, which then gets protonated. But wait, for that to happen, do I
