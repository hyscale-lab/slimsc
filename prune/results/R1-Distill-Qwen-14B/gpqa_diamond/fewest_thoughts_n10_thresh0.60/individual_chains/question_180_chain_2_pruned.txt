Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. But let's take it step by step. 

The question says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each particle has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. That's 3.2e-19 C each.

Twelve of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. Hmm, so point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are arranged around it, each 2 meters away. I think they're all at the same distance from P, so maybe they're on a sphere of radius 2 meters, but the problem doesn't specify their exact arrangement beyond that. 

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy of the system. I remember that the electrostatic potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Oh right, and since all the charges are identical, the potential energies will involve pairwise interactions.

But wait, because the system is isolated, I should calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges. Oh, but wait, the charges are all 2e. So each pair contributes some energy.

Wait, but let me think about the setup again. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m from P. So the 13th charge (charge q) is at P, and each of the other 12 charges (each also q) is located 2 meters away from P. So the distance between the 13th charge and each of the others is 2 meters. Also, the distance between any two of the 12 charges would be... Hmm, wait, but the problem doesn't specify their arrangement beyond being 2m from P. Oh, but maybe for the minimum energy, the charges would arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the potential energy, which is when they are as spread out as possible. Oh wait, but the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P, so perhaps they form a regular icosahedron or something around P. But wait, the exact arrangement might not matter for the
