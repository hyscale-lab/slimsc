Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. Their masses are negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about any kinetic energy or anything like that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. Hmm, I think this has to do with electric potential energy because we're dealing with charges in a system.

Wait, electric potential energy is the energy due to the configuration of charges. For point charges, the potential energy between two charges is given by U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

But wait, in a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for N charges, you have to calculate all possible pairs.

Let me think about the setup. There's one charge at point P (let's call it charge Q), and 12 charges arranged around it at a distance of 2 meters. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from P, which is where the 13
