Okay, so I've got this question about a pseudosphere and its area. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, kind of like a sphere but with negative curvature. But wait, wait, no—actually, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? But in this case, maybe it's a 2-dimensional space embedded in 3D or something else.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hold on, no, the metric given here isn't in terms of r. Let me look closer. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Oh, 4 is 2 squared. So 4 = (2)^2. So perhaps the radius is 2, as given.

But more importantly, the area of a pseudosphere. Wait, in regular geometry, the area of a sphere is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, which has hyperbolic geometry, I'm not exactly sure. Wait, or is this a different kind of surface?

Wait, the metric here seems to be a 2-dimensional metric. So it's a 2D surface. The area element would come from integrating over this metric.

Wait, the standard area for a sphere in 2D is 4πr² when it's a positive curvature sphere. But a pseudosphere is a surface with negative curvature. So maybe its area is different. But wait, another thought—could this be a metric of a hyperboloid? Or maybe a sphere in some coordinates.

Wait, looking at the metric, it's given as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). That looks like a conformal metric, where the coefficients for dx² and dy² are the same. So it's conformally flat. So the area element would be the determinant of the metric times dx dy. The determinant of a 2D metric for ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy² is g_{xx} g_{yy} - (g_{xy})². In this case, since it's diagonal (g_{xy}=0), the determinant is g_{xx} * g_{yy} = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a 2D metric, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Because the metric tensor's determinant is g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2. Since here, it's diagonal, and g_{xy}=0, so the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the metric is written as ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor components are g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_{xy}=0.

So the determinant of the metric is g_{xx} * g_{yy} = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So the square root of the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)].

Therefore, the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Now, to find the total area, we need to integrate dA over the entire surface. But wait, what is the domain of x and y here? The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), so that term can't be zero, so 4 - x² - y² ≠ 0. So the region of integration is where x² + y² < 4. Because when x² + y² approaches 4 from below, the metric blows up—so perhaps the surface is only defined for x² + y² < 4.

So, integrating over x and y where x² + y² < 4. Since the problem is symmetric in x and y, it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. And the integrand becomes [32/(4 - r²)].

So the area A is the integral from r=0 to r=2, and θ from 0 to 2π, of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let's compute this integral.

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

First, the θ integral is straightforward. The integrand doesn't depend on θ, so ∫ dθ from 0 to 2π is just 2π.

So A = 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the radial integral I = ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then, du/dr = -2r. So, - (du/2) = r dr. So, 32 r dr = 32 ( - du/2 )

So, I = ∫ [32 r dr / (4 - r²)] = ∫ [32 * (-du/2) ] / u = -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

Which is -16 ln |u| + C. But we can evaluate the definite integral from r=0 to r=2.

So, I = [ -16 ln |4 - r²| ] evaluated from 0 to 2.

At r=2: 4 - (2)^2 = 0. So ln(0) is negative infinity. Hmm, but wait, that's a problem. So the integral I is from 0 to 2. Let's compute it step by step.

Let me write I = ∫ (from 0 to 2) (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Substitute u = 4 - r², du = -2r dr → - (du)/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (32 r dr)/u → but r dr = -du/2.

So,

I = ∫ (4 to 0) [32 * (-du/2)] / u.

Wait, that's 32 * (-du/2) / u = -16 du/u.

So the integral becomes ∫ from 4 to 0 of (-16/u) du.

Which is the same as 16 ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du.

Wait, because when you reverse the limits, the integral becomes negative. So:

I = 16 ∫ (0 to 4) (1/u) du.

But ∫ (1/u) du is ln |u|.

So I = 16 [ ln(4) - ln(0) ].

But wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So this integral becomes 16 [ ln(4) - (-infty) ] = 16 [ ln(4) + infty ] → which is infinity.

Wait, so the integral I is divergent. So the area A is 2π * I, which is positive infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but this can't be right. I mean, the options don't have 4πr². But wait, the options are A) 0, B) 4π(x² + y²), C) 4π(x² - y²), D) +infty.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So the calculation suggests that the area is infinite, which would match option D.

But why is the area infinite? Let me think about the metric again. The denominator 4 - x² - y² approaches zero as x² + y² approaches 4. So near the edge (r=2), the metric blows up, which implies that the surface is infinitely curved there. But does that mean that the surface isn't actually a sphere but something else? Or perhaps that the area is indeed infinite.

Wait, another approach: what is the Gaussian curvature of this metric?

In conformally flat metrics, the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula for the curvature in isothermal coordinates. The formula is K = - (1/(2g)) * ∇² ln g, where g is the conformal factor.

Wait, the metric is conformally flat: ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), where g(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So, the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - (1/(2g)) * (∂² ln g / ∂x² + ∂² ln g / ∂y² )

Compute ln g = ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y²).

Compute the Laplacian of ln g: ∇² ln g = ∂² ln g / ∂x² + ∂² ln g / ∂y².

Compute each derivative:

First, d(ln g)/dx = d/dx [ - ln(4 - x² - y²) ] = (2x)/(4 - x² - y²).

Second derivative d²(ln g)/dx² = [2 (4 - x² - y²) - 2x*( -2x ) ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Simplify numerator: 2(4 - x² - y²) + 4x² = 8 - 2x² - 2y² +4x² = 8 + 2x² - 2 y².

Wait, no. Wait, let me compute it correctly.

d²(ln g)/dx² = [ (2) (4 - x² - y²) ) + (2x)(2x) ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Wait, no. Let me recompute. Let me denote f = 4 - x² - y².

Then, ∂ ln g / ∂x = (2x)/f.

∂² ln g / ∂x² = (2 f - 2x ( ∂f/∂x )) / f².

Because derivative of (2x/f) is (2 f - 2x (df/dx)) / f².

df/dx = -2x.

So, ∂² ln g / ∂x² = [2 f - 2x (-2x)] / f² → [2f +4x² ] / f².

Similarly, ∂² ln g / ∂y² = [2 f +4y² ] / f².

So, the Laplacian ∇² ln g = [2f +4x² + 2f +4y² ] / f² → [4f +4x² +4y² ] / f².

But f =4 -x² -y² → so 4f = 16 -4x² -4y². 

So, ∇² ln g = [ (16 -4x² -4y²) +4x² +4y² ] / f² → [16]/f².

So, K = -(1/(2g)) * (16/f²).

But g =32/(f), so 1/(2g) = f/(64).

So,

K = -(f/(64)) * (16/f²) )= - (16 f) / (64 f²) )= - (16)/(64 f )= -1/(4 f).

Since f=4 -x² -y², K = -1/(4(4 -x² -y²)).

So, the curvature is negative everywhere except at the origin. Hmm, but wait, when f approaches zero (r approaches 2), the curvature becomes more negative. So this is a hyperbolic metric, which makes sense for a pseudosphere.

Now, the area of a surface with constant curvature in hyperbolic geometry can be tricky. But in this case, our metric isn't exactly a hyperboloid; the metric depends on x and y, so the curvature isn't uniform in the same way as a standard hyperboloid.

But more importantly, from the area calculation earlier, the area integral diverges. So the total area is infinite. Therefore, the correct answer is option D) +infty.


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

This is a conformal metric, where the conformal factor is \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The domain of integration is restricted to \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) cannot be zero. To compute the total area, the area element \( dA \) is derived from the metric:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( \text{det}(g) = \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \right)^2 \). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the area integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \) evaluates to \( 2\pi \), leaving:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

Reversing the limits of integration gives:

\[
-16 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_{u=0}^{u=4} \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \) evaluates to \( \ln|u| \), so:

\[
16 \int_{u=0}^{u=4} \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[ \ln(4) - \ln(0) \right].
\]

Since \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Therefore, the total area is infinite.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as the area is not a function of \( x \) and \( y \).
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as the area is not a function of \( x \) and \( y \).
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as shown by the divergence of the area integral.

The area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite due to the divergent nature of the metric near \( r = 2 \).
