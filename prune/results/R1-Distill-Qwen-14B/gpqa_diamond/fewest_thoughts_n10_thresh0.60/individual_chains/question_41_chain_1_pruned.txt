Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, alright. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But wait, in this case, the medium itself (the glass) is moving. So I think I need to consider the effects of relative motion between the light and the glass, or maybe between the observer and the glass.

Wait, but light is electromagnetic waves, and I think their speed in the medium is c/n regardless of the medium's motion. Or does the speed change when the medium is moving? Hmm, no, wait. In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But when the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed of light?

I'm a bit confused here. Oh right, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Oh, but wait—is the light's speed in the glass being considered here? So when the glass is moving, how does that affect the speed of the light as measured by the lab frame?

Wait, no. Wait, in the glass's rest frame, light's speed is c/n. But when the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, what would the lab measure as the speed of the light?

Wait, velocity addition in relativity might come into play here. The formula for velocity addition is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But in this case, the light's speed in the glass's frame (u) is c/n. But since c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and in the medium it's c/n, so u would be c/n. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, when the medium is moving, does the speed of light change as observed from the lab?

Wait a second, this seems tricky. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the light's speed in the
