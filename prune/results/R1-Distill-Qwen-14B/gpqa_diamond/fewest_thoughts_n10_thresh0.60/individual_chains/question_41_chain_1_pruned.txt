Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, right, it's a relativity problem, I think. So the setup is a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

The options are A, B, C, D, and I need to choose the correct one. Let me think about the principles involved here.

Wait, I remember that in physics, when you have moving media, you have to consider how the speed of light within that medium transforms between different reference frames. Oh right, this is probably a scenario where you need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, but velocity addition is usually when you have velocities in different frames. Oh, but the glass is moving with velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is moving through the glass. So the glass is a medium moving at velocity v towards the observer (since it's moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observerâ€”wait, no, the beam is going through the glass and the glass is moving toward the observer, so maybe the beam is moving toward the observer as well, but that might complicate things).

Wait, no, the beam is propagating through the glass and the glass is moving toward the observer. So the beam's direction is toward the observer, but the glass
