Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I should normalize this state because probabilities depend on normalization. Oh wait, the problem says it's proportional, so I'll have to calculate the normalization constant.

Wait, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin, which I know are the standard spin-up and spin-down states. The operator given has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Oh right, that's probably the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

Wait, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So the operator A is the Pauli X operator scaled by hbar/2. But wait, the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are the eigenvectors of sigma_x. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So the first part of the question is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of A when the state is |alpha>. Then, the average value of A.

Wait, but the state |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of sigma_z, not sigma_x. So to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of A, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Alternatively, since the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x, perhaps I can rewrite |alpha> in the sigma_x eigenbasis.

Let me think. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |âˆ’x>, which can be written as (
