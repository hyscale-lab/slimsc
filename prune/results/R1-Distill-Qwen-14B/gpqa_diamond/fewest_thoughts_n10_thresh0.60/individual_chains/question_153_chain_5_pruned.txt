Okay, so I've got this Michael addition problem here. Hmm. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a β position in an α-β unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let's see what each part of the question is asking.

First, the question gives three different reactions (A, B, C) and asks what their products are. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for each. I'll need to figure out each reaction step by step.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. Wait, NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. So, I think that's the base used to deprotonate the malonate. Malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a strong base. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor here.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (malonate) attacks the β carbon of the acrylate. So, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but wait, maybe it's actually CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Or perhaps it's CH2-CH2 with the substituents? No, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Or maybe I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me think again. The structure of acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the p-tolyl group is on the third carbon, but wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so the carbonyl is on the third carbon. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the α carbon, which is the same as the CH2 in CH2=CHCOO-. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. No, that doesn't seem right because the acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OCH3. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl), that would be on the CH2 group. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Because acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-position would be the end of the chain. Hmm, perhaps that's the case.

So when the malonate attacks, the α carbon of the acrylate (the CH2 next to the double bond) would be the site where the nucleophile comes in. Wait, no. In the Michael reaction, the nucleophile attacks the β carbon, which is the carbon next to the carbonyl. So for CH2=CHCOO
