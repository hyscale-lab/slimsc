Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, and I need to find the normalized eigenvector's elements from the options provided.

Hmm, first, let me recall what I know about spin operators and eigenvectors. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin operator for a particle like a muon (which is similar to an electron in this context) can be represented as a vector of Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P is probably the spin operator here.

Wait, the problem says the operator is P, and it's a vector operator with components Px, Py, Pz. Each component is given as ħ/2 times a 2x2 matrix. Let me write them down:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Right, those are the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So P is the vector operator whose components are these matrices scaled by ħ/2.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means it's in a plane where y=0. So the direction can be parameterized by an angle θ from the z-axis, maybe. Since any direction in the x-z plane can be described using spherical coordinates where φ=0 or φ=π, perhaps, but since it's arbitrary, maybe I can consider n as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no, in x-z plane, any point can be represented as (x, 0, z). So perhaps n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's parameterized with θ being the angle from the z-axis and φ=0 since it's in the x-z plane. So I'll proceed with that.

The operator P has a direction n, so the component along n would be P_n = n · P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P_n becomes n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Given that, the eigenvector |ψ> will satisfy P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2, so the equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So the eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P_n.

To find the eigenvector, I can write P_n as a matrix and then solve (P_n - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

But let me first express P_n in terms of θ. Since n is
