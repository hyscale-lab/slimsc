Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 equals T2.

Now, the question is about their luminosities. I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same temperature, the ratio of their luminosities will be based on the ratio of their radii squared.

Wait, let me make sure. So, L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is the same for both, L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)². Oh wait, but wait—the problem says the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R₁ = 1.5 R₂. Therefore, R₁/R₂ is 1.5, so (1.5)² is 2.25. So L₁ would be 2.25 times L₂. But wait, the options have answer D as ~2.23, which is close. But wait, maybe I'm missing something else here.

Wait, the problem also mentions the radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right! Because of the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength shifts based on the velocity. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; away, redshifted. But wait, in this problem, the observed peak wavelengths are
