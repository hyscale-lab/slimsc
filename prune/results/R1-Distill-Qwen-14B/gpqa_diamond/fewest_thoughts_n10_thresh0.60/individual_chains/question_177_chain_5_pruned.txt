Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. They're assuming the stars emit as black bodies, and we need to find by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Wait, so the key points are:

- Radius ratio: R1 = 1.5 R2
- Mass ratio: M1 = 1.5 M2
- Both stars' maximum emission (from their spectra) are at the same wavelength.
- Radial velocities: Star_1 is stationary (0), Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, Doppler shift. So Star_2's light would be shifted.

So, I think the first thing is to relate the luminosity to other properties. Luminosity for a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, right? L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where T is the effective temperature. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

But wait, the problem says they radiate as black bodies. So yes, that formula applies.

But to find the luminosity ratio, L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Since R1 is 1.5 R2, R1/R2 = 1.5. So (R1/R2)^2 is (2.25). So that part is 2.25. But then, what about the temperature ratio?

Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Black bodies emit maximum intensity at wavelength λ_max, which is related to temperature by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K).

So, if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max for both is the same, then T1 = T2. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait! Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, right? Because its radial velocity is 700 km/s. So, does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm. So, perhaps the observed wavelength is the same, but the intrinsic (rest frame) wavelength depends on their velocities.

Wait, but how to approach this. Let me think. The maximum emission wavelength for each star is λ_max = b / T, but if the star is moving, the observed wavelength λ_obs would be Doppler-shifted.

So, the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be different from its intrinsic λ_max. But the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. Because the question says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest
