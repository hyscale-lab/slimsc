Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transits of two Earth-like planets. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Hmm, I remember that the transit method depends on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view. The probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance.

Wait, I think the formula for the probability of transit is something like (R_p / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since both have circular orbits, e is zero, so the probability simplifies a bit. Oh right, for circular orbits, the probability is (R_p / a), but actually, I think it's more precise to say that the probability is proportional to (R_p / a) multiplied by (1 / (R_star)), but wait, no, maybe it's (R_p * R_star) / (a²). Or wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. The transit probability for a planet around a star is given by the formula P = (R_p) / (a) * (something). Wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_star) / (a / R_star). Hmm, perhaps I should recall the exact formula. Oh right! The transit probability (assuming circular orbits) is approximately (R_p / R_star)^2 * ( (a / R_star) )^{-1/2} )? No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, I think the geometric probability of a transit is
