Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, each with a different value in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. So, the formula should be something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau, right? Where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity over c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I find tau? Oh right, for unstable particles, the lifetime is related to the width through the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Since the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, ΔE ≈ Γ, and Δt is the lifetime τ. So τ ≈ ħ / (Γ * c^2?), wait no, units... Let me think again.

Actually, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, no, Γ is the energy width, and the lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. Yes, that makes sense.

So,
