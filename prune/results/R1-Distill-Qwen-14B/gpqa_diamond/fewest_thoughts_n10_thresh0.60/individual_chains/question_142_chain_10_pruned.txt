Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometric position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this ρ is a mixed state, right?

Each term in the density matrix corresponds to a projector onto the basis states. So |0><0| is the projector for state |0>, and |1><1| for |1>. Adding them together and multiplying by 1/2 makes it a valid density matrix because the trace should be 1. Let me check: the trace of each projector is 1 (since <0|0> = 1 and same for |1>). So adding them gives 2, multiplied by 1/2 gives trace 1. Good.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I think qubit space is represented as a Bloch sphere in 3D space. The Bloch vector gives the coordinates on the sphere. For a pure state |ψ>, the Bloch vector r is such that ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

But wait, the given ρ is a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. Wait, no, actually, wait. Let me compute ρ again. ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So each basis state is equally likely, which is a mixed state. Because for a pure state, the density matrix would be a projector. Like |0><0| is a pure state, but ρ is (|0> + |1>)(<0| + <1|)/2, but wait no, that's not correct. Wait, no, |0> and |1> are orthogonal, so |0><0| + |1><1| is actually the identity matrix for a qubit. Because for a qubit, |0><0| + |1><1| = I. So ρ is (I)/2. Oh, right! So ρ is the completely mixed state, which is like a classical state with no coherence.

The completely mixed state in the Bloch sphere is represented by the origin, right? Because all the Bloch vectors point to the origin when the state is completely mixed. Because r would be zero. So the coordinates would be (0,0,0). Let me think about the formula again. For a state ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, when r is zero, it's I/2, which is the completely mixed state. So in this case, since our ρ is (I)/2, the vector r is (0,0,0). So the geometrical position is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which would be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\
