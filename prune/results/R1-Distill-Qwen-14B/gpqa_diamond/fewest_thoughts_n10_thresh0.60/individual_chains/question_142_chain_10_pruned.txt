Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used in quantum mechanics to describe the state of a system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). 

Wait, density matrices are 2x2 matrices for qubits. Each state |0> and |1> are the basis states, right? So |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere, and similarly for |1><1|. Adding them together, each diagonal element becomes 1, and then we multiply by 1/2. So the ρ matrix should be diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2.

Now, I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit rusty on the exact mapping, but I think for qubits, the state can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector represents the qubit state, where the vector components correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. 

Wait, but wait. The density matrix ρ is a statistical mixture here. Oh right, for a pure state |ψ><ψ|, the Bloch vector is 2ρ - I. But when ρ is a mixed state, like this case, it's a completely mixed state. Because ρ here is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That's like ½ I, where I is the identity matrix. So ρ is the maximally mixed state.

In terms of the Bloch sphere, the density matrix ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. If ρ is (I)/2, then substituting that in: (I)/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. So, I/2 = I/2 + (r·σ)/2. Subtracting I/2 from both sides gives 0 = (r·σ)/2. That implies r·σ is zero. So the Bloch vector r must be zero. 

So the geometrical position is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. But wait, the options given don't have (0,0,0) in all components
