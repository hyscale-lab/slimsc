Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to break this down.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like spheres, hyperboloids, or other manifolds. The pseudosphere is a type of hyperboloid, right? Oh wait, pseudosphere typically refers to a 2-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature, which is a hyperbolic space.

Wait, the question is asking about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So, I think the area formula for a pseudosphere (which is a 2-sphere in hyperbolic space) might be different from the usual sphere in Euclidean space. Oh right, the area of a pseudosphere with radius a is 4πa², but wait, no—in hyperbolic geometry, the area for a circle of radius a is 2π(a sinh a - a). Wait, I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe this metric isn't a standard pseudosphere metric.

Let me think about the given metric. The coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me rewrite that. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). This looks a bit like the metric for a hyperbolic space. The standard hyperbolic metric in Poincaré coordinates is
