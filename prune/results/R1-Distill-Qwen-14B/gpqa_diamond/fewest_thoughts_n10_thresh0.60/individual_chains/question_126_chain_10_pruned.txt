Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Each reaction produces a product, and then these products are combined and analyzed using HPLC. The question is about the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms, both on a normal-phase column and a chiral stationary phase column.

Alright, so first, I need to understand each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters, amides, ketones, and more. Oh wait, wait, LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride. For ketones, LAH would reduce them to secondary alcohols. So in this case, the starting material is a ketone, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure would be:

CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, let me think. Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3. So numbering from the left, it's:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe better to draw it out mentally. 

Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that's pentan-3-one. Hexan-3-one would have six carbons, with the ketone on C3. So structure would be CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, more accurately, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But wait, in the compound given, it's 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so the methoxy is on carbon 5.

So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's seven carbons. Wait, wait, hexan would be six carbons. Let's count. Carbon 1: CH3-, carbon 2: CH2-, carbon 3: C(=O)-, carbon 4: CH2-, carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-, carbon 6: CH3. So the structure is CH3CH2C(=O)CH2CH(OCH3)CH3. Hmm, but wait, that would make the substituents on the ketone, perhaps. Or maybe the structure is (S)-configured, which indicates a chiral center.

So, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So when you reduce this with LAH, the ketone (at C3) will be reduced to an alcohol. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about LAH's reaction. LAH is a strong reducing agent that
