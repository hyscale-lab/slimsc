Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about exoplanets and their densities. Let me think through it step by step.

The question asks which of the given exoplanets has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the answer choices are A to D, each corresponding to one of these.

First, I need to recall how density works. Density is mass divided by volume, so higher mass and smaller volume would lead to a higher density. But wait, the planets here are Earth-like in some aspects, so I should think about how mass and radius relate for Earth-like planets.

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. That's the baseline here.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's given directly. So the density here is 5.5. But wait, how? Because if mass increases but density doesn't change, the volume must scale with mass. Or wait, no, density is mass over volume. So if the mass is 2 Earth masses, and the density is the same as Earth, then the volume would be (2 * Earth's mass) / (5.5) = same as Earth's volume? No, wait, Earth's volume is (Earth's mass)/(5.5). So if another planet has 2 Earth masses and density 5.5, then its volume is (2M)/(5.5) = 2*(M/5.5)= 2 times Earth's volume. So the radius would be larger. But the important thing is, the density is 5.5, which is the same as Earth. So this planet's density is same as a), but wait, a) is Earth's, which is 5.5. So in that case, both a and b have 5.5 density. Wait, but no, let me check: option b says it has a density of 5.5, so that's the same as Earth. So a and b have same density.

But wait, the question is about which has the highest density. So, unless some other options have higher.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. So same composition implies same density. Because composition affects the average density. So if it's same composition, density is same as Earth. So same as a and
