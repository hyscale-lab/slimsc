Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So it's a pretty rigid molecule. The molecule has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking about elimination or maybe substitution reactions. Since it's dibromide, and KOH is a good nucleophile, maybe it's an E2 elimination. But wait, heating with KOH usually leads to elimination, especially if it's a vicinal dihalide. Vicinal dihalides under E2 conditions form alkenes. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane might eliminate two equivalents of HBr to form an alkene.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on adjacent carbons? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure of adamantane is a bit tricky. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are actually on adjacent carbons if we're talking about the same face. So heating with KOH would likely cause an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid, so the structure is rigid, so the two bromines are on adjacent carbons. So when KOH abstracts a beta hydrogen, the bromide leaves, and the double bond forms.

So the product would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane, but maybe more accurately, it would lose two HBr molecules to form an alkene. Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. So when two E2 reactions happen, removing two HBr molecules, we would form a diene? Or perhaps a single double bond.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is (1,3-dibromo)adamantane. When treated with base, each Br could potentially eliminate as Br⁻, taking a hydrogen from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond. So each Br is on a different carbon. So each elimination would form a double bond between each pair.

Wait, but that would require two
