Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they're harder to simulate with classical systems and have unique properties useful for certain quantum computations.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. I think |alpha> is a coherent state, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states, so combining them in a superposition might create a non-Gaussian state, especially if the coefficients aren't the same. Also, the phase phi here probably affects the interference when you compute the density matrix.

The normalization constant N is given by sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2alpha^2)). Wait, that makes sense because when you expand the state, the inner products of |alpha> and |-alpha> would contribute terms involving their overlaps. The normalization ensures that the state is properly normalized.

The relative entropy measure del_b is given as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho (the density matrix of the state) and that of tau (the reference Gaussian state's density matrix). So non-Gaussianity here is measured by how different the entropy of the state is from that of a Gaussian state.

Wait, but how do I compute this? Because calculating the entropy requires knowing the eigenvalues of the density matrix. For the state |psi>, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|, and tau is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state. But what's considered a Gaussian state here? Well, coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states are all Gaussian. The superpositions of coherent states, like Schrödinger cat states, are non-Gaussian.

But wait, the question is about the relative entropy between the non-Gaussian state and a Gaussian reference state. So I need to figure out what the reference Gaussian state is. I'm a bit confused here because the definition isn't clear. Typically, for non-Gaussianity measures, the reference might be the closest Gaussian state to the given non-Gaussian state, perhaps the one that minimizes the relative entropy. Alternatively, sometimes people take the maximally mixed Gaussian state. Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure.
