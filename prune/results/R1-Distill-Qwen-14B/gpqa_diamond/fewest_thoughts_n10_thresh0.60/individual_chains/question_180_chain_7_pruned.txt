Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm... the question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, 2e as in twice the elementary charge? So each charge is 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. Right.

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question asks for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, energy in an electrostatic system... I remember that the potential energy between point charges is calculated using Coulomb's law. The formula is U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988e9 N·m²/C². But since there are multiple charges, I think I need to calculate the total potential energy between each pair.

But wait, in this setup, there are 13 charges. One is fixed at P, and 12 are at 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge is at the center, and the others are arranged around it, each 2 meters away. Or wait, are the 12 charges all at the same distance from P? The problem says 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So from point
