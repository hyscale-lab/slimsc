Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem states: There's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, so I think I can plug in the numbers once I understand the setup.

Wait, wait. So point P has a charge, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from it. But wait, the 13th is fixed at P. So point P must be the location of the 13th charge. So the setup is: one charge at point P, and 12 charges each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the 12 are arranged in a way that each is 2 m from P, but what's their configuration? Are they all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m around P? Maybe, but since the problem doesn't specify, I think we can assume that each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P, but the exact positions relative to each other might not matter because the problem is about the potential energy of the entire system.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The problem says it's an isolated system, so all the charges are in a system where their mutual interactions contribute to the potential energy. So I need to calculate the total electric potential energy of the system.

Electric potential energy for a system of point charges is given by the formula U = (1/(4πε₀)) * Σ (q_i q_j / r_ij), where i < j. But since all the charges are the same, I can simplify this calculation.

Wait, but let me think about how the charges are arranged. The 12 charges are each 2 m from P. So the distance between the 13th charge (at P) and each of the 12 is 2 m. So each of those 12 charges contributes a potential energy term with the fixed charge.

Additionally, the 12 charges are each at 2 m from P, but what's the distance between each other? Hmm, the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps they're arranged in a way that each is 2 m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So maybe we can arrange the 12 charges in such a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy of a system of charges depends on their configuration. For the minimum energy, I think the charges would arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the total potential energy. Since like charges repel, if they can spread out as much as possible, that would minimize the repulsion, hence the potential energy. But I need to think about
