Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what's being asked. 

The question involves a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. I remember that stability constants indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So the formation of each complex depends on these β values.

Wait, the problem mentions the "blue dithiocyanato" complex. I think Co(SCN)_n^m+ complexes are colored, and the blue one is probably the one with two SCN- ions. So the dithiocyanato would be the [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)₂²+ ion. So that's the third species, right? The β values are given for each n, where n is the number of SCN- attached. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]²+, β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]^3−, and β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]^4−? Or maybe I'm getting the order wrong.

Wait, the β values here are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, so β3 is the highest, which suggests that the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- ions. But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato, which is the two SCN- case.

So, the problem is about finding the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]²+ among all possible Co species.

I think I need to calculate the distribution of the different Co species based on their stability constants. The approach is to calculate the mole fractions of each complex, considering the stability constants and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN-.

The total cobalt can be considered as the sum of all possible complexes, each multiplied by their respective concentrations.

Wait, but how do we model this? I remember that when dealing with multiple stability constants, the fraction of each complex depends on the β values and the concentrations of the ligand and metal ion.

Let me recall the formula. For each complex [Co(L)n]^m+, the fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [Co] * [L]^n ) / (sum over all k of β_k * [Co] * [L]^k )

Wait, but wait, the denominator would actually include all possible complexes, including the uncomplexed Co²+ and all the various complexes. So I think the general approach is to calculate the fraction of each species, including the free ion.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model this using the formation of each complex step by step, considering that each step depends on the previous.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of
