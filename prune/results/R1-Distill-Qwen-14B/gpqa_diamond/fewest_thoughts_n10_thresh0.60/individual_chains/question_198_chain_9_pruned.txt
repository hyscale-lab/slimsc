Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants (beta) are related to the formation of complexes. The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species in the solution.

Let me try to break this down. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, I should make sure I understand the order here. Stability constants usually increase as more ligands bind, right? So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- or something like that. Wait, I think the general formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) because Co^2+ plus n SCN^- would have a charge of 2−n. So β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2, β3 for n=3, β4 for n=4. Wait, but the values don't seem to increase consistently. Let me check: β1=9, β2=40 (increase), β3=63 (increase), β4=16 (drop). Hmm, maybe the ordering is different or perhaps a typo, but I should proceed with what's given.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue ones are the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, which is the dithiocyanato complex. So that's n=2, so β2=40. Wait, but I thought the blue color is for the [Co(NH3)_6]^2+ complex, but in this case, it's thiocyanate. Oh well, the question says it's the dithiocyanato, so that's n=2.

So to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, I need to consider all possible cobalt species and their concentrations. The species are Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0,
