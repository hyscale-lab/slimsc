Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two reactions and selecting the correct reagents from the options given.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that ketones reacting with cyanide usually undergo nucleophilic addition. So the mechanism would be the cyanide ion attacking the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin.

So for the first step, the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin. But what about the conditions? I think sometimes acid is used as a catalyst. Oh wait, because the cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile, but the carbonyl needs to be activated. Sometimes, a protic acid like H3O+ (which is option A and B) is used to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. Alternatively, maybe a sulfonic acid like NaHSO3 (option C and D) is used as a catalyst. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. I think in the formation of cyanohydrin, a mild acid catalyst is often used. H3O+ is a common acid, so reagent A might be H3O+.

Wait, but another possibility: sometimes, when the carb
