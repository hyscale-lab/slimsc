Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 maybe, because lithium typically has 3 protons and 6 neutrons? Or wait, no, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium-3? Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think. Wait, no, natural lithium usually has isotopes. Like Li-6 and Li-7. So if X has 3 neutrons, since Li has 3 protons (atomic number 3), then the mass number is 3 + 3 =6. So X is Li-6.

Right, so the problem is to find the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c. So the energy we're looking for is the relativistic energy of the ion.

So, I remember that the total relativistic energy is given by gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First, I need to calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.

Let me compute beta first, beta is v/c, which is 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²).

What's 0.96 squared? 0.96 * 0.96. Let's calculate that. 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that square root. Yes, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 correct. So that's correct.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. Li-6 has
