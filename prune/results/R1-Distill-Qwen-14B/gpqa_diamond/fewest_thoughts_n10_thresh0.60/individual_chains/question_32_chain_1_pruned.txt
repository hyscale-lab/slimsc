Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think this through.

The question says the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, what's Li's atomic number? I remember Lithium has an atomic number of 3. So Li with 3 neutrons would make it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Wait, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times mc squared. So the energy E is gamma * m0c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So first, let's compute gamma for v=0.96c. Let me calculate that.

Calculate v²/c²: (0.96c)^2 / c² is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Hmm, wait,
