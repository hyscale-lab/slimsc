Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem again and see what it's asking.

The problem says: Select the suitable reagents for the following reactions.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options given are A to D, each providing possible reagents A and B.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out what each reaction is doing. Let's start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN and reagent A, it forms 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, the product's structure is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group and a methyl group on the same carbon. So, what's the reaction here?

Oh, right! I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic substitution, but wait, ketones are typically not good at that because the carbonyl is a poor leaving group. Wait, but maybe it's a case of a ketone reacting with a cyanide nucleophile. Oh! Maybe it's a substitution where the carbonyl is replaced by CN. But ketones don't usually do that directly. Oh, wait, maybe it's an example of the Stephen reduction or something else? Or perhaps this is a condensation reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition, like in the case of Grignard reagents or organometallics. But NaCN is a source of cyanide ions. So, maybe the carbonyl group is attacked by CN-.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add NaCN, would that form (CH3)2C(O-)CN? Or perhaps it's a substitution where the oxygen is replaced. Wait, no, substitution would require a good leaving group, but ketones don't usually do that.

Wait, maybe it's a case where the ketone is first converted into an enolate, which then attacks the cyanide. Or perhaps it's an example of the cyanide acting as a nucleophile in a ketone, leading to some kind of addition product.

Wait, perhaps it's a hydrocyanation reaction? Oh wait, that's usually for alkenes. Maybe not.

Alternatively, I'm thinking about the possibility of the cyanide acting as a nucleophile in a substitution. But butan-2-one doesn't have a good leaving group. Unless the reaction is done under specific conditions.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the first reaction is a substitution where the ketone is converted into a nitrile via a two-step process. So, butan-2-one (a ketone) is treated with NaCN and possibly an acid catalyst. Oh wait, if you have a ketone reacting with HCN, that's a nucleophilic addition leading to a cyanohydrin. Right! Because HCN adds to the carbonyl, giving a cyanohydrin. But wait, NaCN in the presence of acid would generate HCN and CN-.

So, the first reaction might be a cyanohydrin formation. The cyanohydrin would have the structure where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a hydroxyl and a cyanide group on adjacent carbons. Wait, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Let me think about the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no—wait, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile on the end. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, but that's five carbons. No, butanenitrile is four carbons, so butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so that's three carbons in the chain (CH3-C(O)-CH3). When it reacts with HCN, it forms (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is longer. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a three-carbon compound. When it reacts with HCN, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the problem states the product is butanenitrile, which is four carbons. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a simple cyanohydrin formation. Alternatively, maybe the starting ketone is undergoing some other reaction. Oh wait, another possibility: maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the ketone is converted into a nitrile. But that would require the carbonyl to become a good leaving group, which usually isn't the case. Unless it's under acidic conditions.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about reagent A. The options for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Hmm. H3O+ is acidic. NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- which is a weaker acid.

In the first reaction, if A is H3O+, perhaps it's acting as an acid catalyst. So the reaction between butan-2-one and NaCN under acidic conditions. Wait, under acidic conditions, is the cyanide a good nucleophile? Or would it protonate?

Wait, HCN is a weak acid, and under acidic conditions, the CN- would be protonated to HCN. But if we have excess NaCN and perhaps a way to generate HCN, perhaps the reaction proceeds via HCN addition.

Wait, but if it's a cyanohydrin formation, the conditions are usually with HCN. So maybe in this case, NaCN is providing the CN- which, under acidic conditions, can form HCN. So reagent A is H3O+ (acid), which would protonate the CN- to form HCN, which can then add to the ketone.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (so option A or B). Then, the product is a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so the starting ketone must have four carbons? Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons. So adding a nitrile group would make it four. Let me see. (CH3)2CO + HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product is butanenitrile, which is four carbons, so maybe I'm missing the structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the product wrong. Let me count the carbons. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The formula would be HOCH2C(CH3)(CN)CH2? No, wait. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, nitriles are named with the nitrile group at the end. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2CN, which is propenenitrile, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. But that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Oh wait, the starting material is butan-2-one, which is four carbons in the chain? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is propan-2-one. Wait, no, butan-2-one would be (CH2)2CO, but that's not correct. Wait, butan-2-one is actually CH3-CO-CH2-CH3. Oh, right, I must have been thinking of propan-2-one as butan-2-one earlier. So butan-2-one is four carbons in total, with the carbonyl on carbon 2.

So butan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH3. When it reacts with HCN, the H adds to the carbonyl carbon, and CN- adds to the oxygen. Wait, no, the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon. So the product would be CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3. So that's 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile? Or wait, perhaps 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, the structure would be CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3. So the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the nitrile group, which is the second carbon. So the product's IUPAC name would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's correct. So the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, where HCN adds to the ketone.

So to form the cyanohydrin, the conditions are typically acid-catalyzed. So the reagent A is H3O+ (acid), which would protonate the ketone's carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group, or help in the addition of HCN.

Wait, but NaCN in acidic conditions would react to form HCN. So perhaps the reaction is: butan-2-one + HCN → cyanohydrin. So the reagent A is H3O+ (acid), which provides the H+ to form HCN from NaCN.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+.

Now, moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. It reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. The product is a carboxylic acid with the same substituents. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

So, what conditions would convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I remember that hydrolysis of nitriles can yield carboxylic acids. The typical reagents for this are strong acids or strong bases. For example, under acidic conditions, H3O+ and heat, or under basic conditions with something like aqueous NaOH and heat.

Wait, but the reagent B is H2O, so the reaction is hydrolysis. But what catalyst is needed? If it's acid-catalyzed, then perhaps HCl or H3O+ is used. If it's base-catalyzed, then something like NaOH would be used. Wait, but the reagent is B, which is listed as H2O. So the hydrolysis is in aqueous solution, but with what acid or base?

Looking at the options, option C and D have B as HCl and CH3COOH, respectively. Wait, no, looking back: the options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

Wait, the second reaction has B as H2O. So the reagent B is aqueous solution, and perhaps the catalyst is HCl or another acid.

Wait, but for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, if it's under acidic conditions, you typically use concentrated H2SO4 or HCl, and heat. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you use aqueous NaOH and heat, followed by acid workup.

Hmm, the product is a carboxylic acid. So in the second reaction, the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. So the hydrolysis conditions would determine reagent B. If it's done in aqueous acid, then B would be HCl, for example. Alternatively, if it's done in aqueous base, perhaps, but then after that, you'd add acid to protonate.

But looking at the options, the possible B reagents are HCl or CH3COOH. Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid.

So which is more likely in this case? Well, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acid or strong base. So HCl (a strong acid) would be a suitable reagent. So reagent B is HCl.

Wait, let me think again. The product is a carboxylic acid, which is more likely under acidic hydrolysis. So if the nitrile undergoes hydrolysis in HCl (acidic conditions), it would form the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait, another point: the starting material has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So the structure is (something)-C(OH)-CN. So when the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, the structure becomes (something)-C(OH)-COOH. Wait, but that would lead to adjacent -OH and -COOH groups. Or perhaps the hydroxyl group is on the same carbon as the carboxylic acid.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which is:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH3? Wait, no. Alternatively, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. But with substituents.

Wait, no, butanenitrile is four carbons: CH2CH2CH2CN. But wait, perhaps the structure is:

The central carbon (carbon 2) has a hydroxyl group, a nitrile group, and two other substituents. So when the nitrile is hydrolyzed, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So the carbon that was attached to the nitrile will now have a carboxylic acid group.

But in the product, the hydroxyl group is still present. So the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the reaction is hydrolyzing the nitrile to a carboxylic acid in the presence of H2O and a catalyst.

So the reagent B must be an acid. So which option has B as HCl? Looking at the options:

Option A: B is HCl.

Option C: B is HCl.

So reagent A in the first reaction is H3O+ (from options A or B), and reagent B is HCl (from options A or C).

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O but with some acid or base. If the reaction is in aqueous HCl, that would be acidic conditions.

So, for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.

Wait, but looking at the options, the second reagent in option A is HCl and the first reagent is H3O+. So option A is (A=H3O+, B=HCl). So that would fit.

Wait, but let me make sure.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A (H3O+) → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction: nitrile + H2O + B (HCl) → carboxylic acid.

So the overall reagents are A=H3O+ (acid) for the first step, and B=HCl (acid) for the second step.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl, which matches.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait, could the second reaction be under basic conditions? Let me think. If the nitrile is hydrolyzed under basic conditions, you'd get a carboxylate, which then needs to be acidified to get the carboxylic acid. So the reagent B in that case would be something like aqueous NaOH, but none of the options have that. The options given for B are HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

So only HCl and CH3COOH are options for B. Since HCl is a strong acid, it would provide the acidic conditions needed for the hydrolysis to form the carboxylic acid.

So, the correct answer should be option A, where A is H3O+ and B is HCl.


The problem involves determining the suitable reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - Butan-2-one is a ketone, and the product is a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation typically occurs under acidic conditions, where HCN is generated from NaCN and H3O+ acts as an acid catalyst. This facilitates the nucleophilic addition of CN⁻ to the carbonyl group, forming the cyanohydrin.  
   - Therefore, reagent A is H3O+.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, acidic conditions are preferred, and HCl is a suitable reagent for this reaction.  
   - Therefore, reagent B is HCl.

From the options provided:  
- **Option A**: A = H3O+, B = HCl  
- **Option B**: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH  

Option A is the only one where A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which matches the requirements for both reactions.

**Answer: A**
