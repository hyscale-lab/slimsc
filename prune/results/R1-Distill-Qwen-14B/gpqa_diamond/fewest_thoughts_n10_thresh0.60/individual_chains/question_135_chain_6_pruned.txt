Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty, but let's give it a shot. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X, given a certain interaction Lagrangian. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to figure out which decay options are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

First, I'll read the problem statement again carefully. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this is a Yukawa-type interaction since it involves a boson (X) interacting with fermions (ψ). The Yukawa interaction typically couples a scalar boson to fermion-antifermion pairs. So the term suggests that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if kinematics allow.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, I need to find all possible fermion pairs that the X boson can decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

Let me think about the possible fermions. The fermions that exist in the Standard Model are quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), leptons (electron, muon, tau), and their corresponding antiquarks or antiparticles.

Each decay channel would require that the sum of the fermion masses is less than the mass of the X boson because energy and momentum must be conserved. So for X → f f̄, the combined mass of f and f̄ must be less than 6 GeV.

Wait, actually, the mass of each individual fermion must be less than or equal to half the mass of X, because each would get some energy in the center-of-mass frame. Wait, no, that's not entirely accurate. Because in the rest frame of X, the maximum mass each fermion can have is when they are produced at rest, so each would have mass m_f such that 2m_f ≤ m_X. Because the total rest mass would be 2m_f, and the X's mass is 6 GeV. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's list the masses of all possible fermions:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, but negligible.

Wait, but in reality, the masses are a bit different. Let me get more precise.

Standard Model fermion masses (approximate):

- u: 2.2 MeV
- d: 4.7 MeV
- s: 95 MeV
- c:
