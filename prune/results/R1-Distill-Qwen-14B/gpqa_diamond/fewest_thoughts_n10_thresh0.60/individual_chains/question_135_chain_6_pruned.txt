Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I think I got that right. So, λ is a coupling constant, and the fermion fields ψf are interacting with the boson X. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I'm supposed to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

Let me recall some basics. In particle physics, a boson like X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the mass of X is greater than twice the mass of the fermion. Because, remember, for a particle to decay into two particles, the mass of the original must be at least twice the mass of each of the decay products. So, m_X >= 2 m_fermion.

Wait, but wait. The Lagrangian here suggests that X interacts with various fermions. So I need to look at the possible fermions that X can couple to. The problem says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. Let me parse that.

The Lagrangian term is -λ f ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So, X is coupling to each fermion species f. So X can decay into any fermion pair that it can interact with, provided the mass allows it.

But wait, what are the possible fermions f here? The interaction term implies that X can decay into any fermion species that has this interaction. So if the coupling is for all fermions, then X could potentially decay into any possible fermion pair, but only if the mass allows.

Wait, but in the options, they list specific possibilities. So I need to figure out which fermions are light enough so that 2m
