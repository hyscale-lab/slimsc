Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Michael reaction, which I remember is a type of conjugate addition. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to find the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. So, NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. In the context of the Michael reaction, the base would deprotonate a suitable alpha position to form an enolate, which then attacks the beta carbon of another molecule.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it has two alpha protons. When deprotonated, it forms an enolate. The other reactant, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is the Michael acceptor because it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, which is electron-deficient at the beta position.

In the Michael reaction, the enolate from the donor attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. Let me draw this out mentally. The acceptor has a structure where the double bond is between C2 and C3, with a p-tolyl group on C3 (since it's 3-(p-tolyl)). The enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the C3 (beta) position of the acrylate. 

So, the product would be a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the acceptor's beta carbon. The structure would have the dimethyl malonate part connected to the p-tolyl group. But wait, since it's an addition, both the donor and acceptor contribute parts to the product.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. The enolate would form at the central CH2. When it attacks the acrylate at the beta position, the product would have the malonate's CH connected to the acrylate. So, the product would be a trimethyl something, because each COOEt is from the donor. The structure would be something like the p-tolyl group attached to a carbon next to the malonate.

So, the product A would be trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Because the addition would create a new carbon chain where the malonate's CH is attached to the acceptor's beta position.

Next, part B: The reactants are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile, with conditions MeOH and H3O+. Hmm, MeOH and H3O+ are acidic conditions. So, maybe we're looking at a Michael addition under these conditions.

Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is a cyclic enamine. Piperidine has a six-membered ring with one NH. The cyclohexene ring is attached to the piperidine. Enamines are good nucleophiles because the lone pair on the nitrogen can attack electrophilic centers.

The other reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile. It's an electron-deficient double bond, so the Michael acceptor here. The enamine would act as the nucleophile in the Michael reaction.

The Michael addition would involve the enamine attacking the beta carbon of the nitrile. So, the nitrogen's lone pair would attack the beta position, leading to a new carbon-nitrogen bond.

Wait, but in the product, the enamine would add to the nitrile. Let me visualize it. The (E) configuration of but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-CN, but in E configuration, the substituents on either end are opposite. However,
