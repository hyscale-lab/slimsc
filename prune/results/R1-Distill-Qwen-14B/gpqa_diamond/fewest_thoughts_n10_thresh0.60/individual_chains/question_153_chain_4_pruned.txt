Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition is a type of conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The reaction is important because it forms new carbon-carbon bonds, which is useful in organic synthesis.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the products for each and then match them with the given options.

Let me start with part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH → A.

First, dimethyl malonate is the nucleophile here. Malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate; it has two negative charges which makes it very reactive. The electrophile is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be an acrylate ester where the substituents on the double bond are methyl and the p-tolyl group in a trans configuration because it's E.

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile (malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate). So the malonate would add to the beta position, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond. The product would have the malonate group attached to the acrylate.

Wait, but wait. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. So when it acts as a nucleophile, the enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. The acrylate is CH2=CH–COOMe, but wait, no. The structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2CH2–COOMe, but wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is the acrylate: the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with substituents on carbons 2 and 3. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=CH–COOEt? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-COOR. So the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH–COOEt, but wait, the substituent is on the third carbon? No, perhaps I got the numbering wrong. Acrylate is CH2=CH-COOR, so positions 1 (CH2), 2 (CH), 3 (COOR). But the molecule is 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, meaning the p-tolyl group is attached to the third carbon, which is the same as the carbonyl carbon. That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's the double bond between C1 and C2, and then the substituent is on C3, which is the carbonyl. Oh, maybe it's more like CH2=CH–COOEt, but the substituent is on the acrylate's position 3. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like p-tolyl group is attached to the double bond. Wait, the correct structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: that would be CH2=CH–C(p-tolyl)–COOEt? No, that can't be right. Maybe it's (E)-CH2–C(p-tolyl)=CH–COOEt? Hmm, perhaps I need to sketch this.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH–COOEt, but the p-tolyl is on the CH2 group. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2–C(p-tolyl)=CH2, but that's not an acrylate. Wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-t
