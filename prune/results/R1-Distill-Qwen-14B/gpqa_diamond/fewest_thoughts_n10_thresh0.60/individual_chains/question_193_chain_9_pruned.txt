Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/parallax^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each being a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is 1 / parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So d = 1 / plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes, so their distance is smaller.

The problem states that the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1 / plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Wait, but we need to express this in terms of distance, not parallax. Since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that into the equation. Let me see: plx = 1/d → 1/plx = d. So N is proportional to (1/plx)^5, which is (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but hold on. Because the problem is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Oh, so it's about the number of stars per unit distance, not the total number. That's an important distinction.

So if the total number of stars within a distance D is proportional to D^5, then the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) would be the derivative of that with respect to D. Because per unit distance is like the density along the line of sight.

Let me think. If N(D) = k * D^5, where k is a proportionality constant, then the number of stars per unit distance (r) is dN/dr = 5k D^4. But wait, no, because when you take the derivative of D^5 with respect to D, you get 5 D^4. So the number of stars in a thin shell (between D and D+dD) would be approximately 5 D^4 dD.

But wait, the question is about per unit range of distance r. So for a small change in r (distance), how does the number of stars change? That's exactly what the derivative
