Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance d is 1/plx.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. But I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, like per unit distance. So maybe I should express N in terms of distance and then see how it scales with r.

Let me write that down. N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, that means plx = 1/d. So substituting that in, 1/( (1/d) )^5 ) equals d^5. Wait, because (1/d)^5 is d^-5, and the reciprocal is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, so the question is about the density of stars as a function of distance. So as you move from a point at distance r to r+dr, how does the number of stars in that shell change with r?

Wait no, the number of stars in a region
