Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, which is kind of a topic I'm still getting the hang of. Let's see what the question is asking. Hmm, it's about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral structures have all their edges equal, but the angles can be different, but wait, in this case, alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a special case where all angles are the same and the lattice is rhombohedral.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by something like d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + (h k (cos α + cos β + cos γ) - ... ) ) Wait, no, perhaps I should recall the exact formula. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance in a cubic system is simpler, but for a general crystal system, it's a bit more involved.

I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ) ), but wait, maybe I mixed up the angles. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, the formula might be d = a² / ( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ) )^½. Or maybe it's a different arrangement of the angles. Wait, perhaps I should double-check the exact formula.

Alternatively, I've heard that in a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies because all the angles are equal and a = b = c. Wait, in rhombohedral, a, b, c are equal, but the angles can be different, but in this case, they are all 30 degrees. So maybe there's a specific formula for rhombohedral systems.

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, since a = b = c = a (let's say), and all angles are same, let's call them theta. So, when all angles are equal, the interplanar distance formula might have some simplifications.

I remember that for a general hexagonal close-packed structure, the formula is different, but rhombohedral is more like a cube but with possibly different angles. So, for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be found by a formula that's a bit more manageable.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), since all angles are the same. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the angles between axes are same, so cos α = cos β = cos gamma = cos θ, where theta is 30 degrees in this case.

So let me write down the formula: d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Here, a is the lattice parameter. Wait, but wait, in rhombohedral, a, b, c are all equal, right? So yeah, a = b = c.

Given that, for
