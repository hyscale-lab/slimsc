Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods and host star properties. Hmm.

Wait, transiting probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight, right? The probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But how do the other factors play in?

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, R_planet is usually much smaller than R_star, so maybe it's approximated as R_star / a. Or is it 2R_star / a? Wait, no, I think the formula is (R_star / a) multiplied by something else, maybe the eccentricity factor, but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so maybe it's just (R_star / a) times some constant.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability for a circular orbit is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet << R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. So the probability is proportional to R_star divided by the semi-major axis.

But wait, the semi-major axis is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. Oh right, Kepler's law is P² = (4π²/G(M_star)) * a³. So a³ = (G M
