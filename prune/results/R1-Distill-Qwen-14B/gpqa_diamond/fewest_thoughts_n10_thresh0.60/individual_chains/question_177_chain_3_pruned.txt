Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars based on some given parameters. I think I remember that luminosity relates to the star's radius and temperature somehow. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. Let me see.

So the problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. R1 = 1.5 R2. Both stars have masses that are 1.5 times larger for Star_1 as well. But wait, the question is about luminosity, so mass might not be directly relevant unless it affects temperature somehow. Maybe through other properties, but I'll keep that in mind.

The next point is about the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest being the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda_max is the same, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point.

Wait, but wait. The problem says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak emission wavelength. So that's Wien's displacement law. So T1 = T2 because lambda_max is the same. But that's only if each star's spectrum is approximated by a blackbody, which the problem says they assume. So yes, same temperature.

So now, the luminosity formula is L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Since T1 = T2, because their lambda_max is the same, then L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴) = (R1/R2)² * (1)^4 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor would be 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me read the problem again. Did I miss something? Oh, the radial velocities are given. Star
