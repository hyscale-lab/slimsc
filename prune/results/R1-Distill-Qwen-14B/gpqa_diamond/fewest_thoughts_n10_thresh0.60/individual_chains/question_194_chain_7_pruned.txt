Okay, I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me think through it step by step. 

The problem is about finding the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], where J is a constant. I need to compute Z, which is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). 

So, the first thing I should do is figure out all the possible states of the system. Since each spin has two possible values, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. Let me list them all out. 

The spins are S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. So the possible combinations are:
1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the energy expression. The energy is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair. So for each state, the energy E can be calculated as E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). 

But wait, if I can group the states based on their energy, I can compute the partition function more efficiently. Let me figure out the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state.

Let's compute this sum for each state:

State 1: All +1. So S1S2 = 1*1=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3.
E = -J*(3) = -3J.

State 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.
E = -J*(-1) = J.

State 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.
E = J.

State 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.
E = J.

State 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.
E = J.

State 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.
E = J.

State 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.
E = J.

State 8: All -1. S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3.
E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait, so looking at this, the states where all three spins are the same (states 1 and 8) have sum 3, so E = -3J. The other six states have sum -1, so E = J.

So, the energies are either -3J (for two states) or J (for six states).

Wait wait, no. Wait, no, in state 2, the sum was -1, so E is J. Similarly, states 3,4,5,6,7, all have sum -1, so their E is J. So, state 1 and 8 have E=-3J, others E=J.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me recheck.

Wait: For state 2: S3 is -1, so S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So
