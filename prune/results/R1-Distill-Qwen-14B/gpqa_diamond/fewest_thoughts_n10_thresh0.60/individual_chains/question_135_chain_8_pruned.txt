Okay, so I have this physics problem about the decay of a boson, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ_f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction terms, so this must be the Yukawa coupling kind of interaction. Yukawa interactions are like the force that mediates the interaction between a boson (like a scalar) and fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the question is about the allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order. The options are different combinations of fermion-antifermion pairs.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the energy (or mass) of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in the center-of-mass frame, the fermions would need enough energy to be created. So the mass of X has to be greater than or equal to 2*m_fermion.

So first, I need to figure out the masses of the various fermions mentioned in the options. Let me recall the approximate masses:

- electron (e): negligible, about 0.0005 GeV
- muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV
- tau (τ): about 1.77 GeV
- up quark (u): around 2 MeV, so 0.002 GeV
- down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV, so 0.0047 GeV
- strange (s): around 95 MeV, 0.095 GeV
- charm (c): approximately 1.27 GeV
- bottom (b): about 4.7 GeV
- top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV

Wait, so the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for each fermion pair, I need to check if 2*m_fermion is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me list the fermions in each option and see their 2m:

Option A: b, s, u, d, tau, e.

b: 4.7 GeV each, so 2*4.7 = 9.4 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so 6 <9.4 → not allowed. So X can't decay into b bbar because 6 GeV isn't enough. Similarly, s is 0.095 GeV, 2*0.095=0.19 GeV, which is way below 6 GeV. So s is allowed. u is 0.002 GeV, 0.004. Also allowed. d is 0.0047, 0.0094 GeV, allowed. Tau is about 1.77, 2*1.77=3.54 GeV, which is less than 6. So tau pair is allowed. e is negligible, so allowed.

But wait, option A includes b, which would require 9.4 GeV, which X doesn't have. So option A can't be correct because X can't decay into b bbar.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

c has a mass of about 1.27 GeV. 2*1.27=2.54 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed.

s: allowed as before.

u, d: allowed.

Tau: 3.54 GeV, allowed.

mu: 0.1 GeV each, so 0.2, allowed.

e: allowed.

So all these would be allowed except perhaps anything else.

Wait, but where did the c quark come from? The Lagrangian must couple X to the fermions f present in the Lagrangian. So the interaction term is proportional to ψ_f̄ (v + X) ψ_f, which implies that f is the type of fermion that X can interact with.

So in the problem statement, the interaction is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The index f here refers to the fermion types that X can interact with. So the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pairs if the fermion mass is less than X/2.

But what fermions are included in the interaction? The problem doesn't specify, but the given options include various quarks and leptons.

Wait, perhaps the coupling is to all the fermions, or is it specific? The problem doesn't say, so perhaps we can assume that X can interact with all the fermions for which 2m_f ≤ m_X.

But also, the problem says "the lowest order", which usually refers to tree-level decays, which are allowed if kinematically possible.

Now, looking back at the options, which ones have all fermion pairs with 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

Let me make a table:

Fermion type | Mass (GeV) | 2m (GeV) | Allowed?
--- | --- | --- | ---
e | 0.0005
