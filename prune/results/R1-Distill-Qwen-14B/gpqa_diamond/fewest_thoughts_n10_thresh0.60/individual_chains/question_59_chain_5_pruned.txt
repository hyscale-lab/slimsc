Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky because I have to consider the neutralization reactions between these acids and base.

First, let me jot down the details. The volumes and concentrations are given as:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Since we have two acids (CH3COOH and HCl) and a base (Ba(OH)2), I need to figure out how they react together.

Wait, but wait: HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base because it's a group 2 hydroxide; so it should dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions.

So the plan is: calculate the moles of each acid and base, then see how they react.

Let me compute the moles for each substance.

First, moles of CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume 0.5 L. Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it'll donate 0.08 moles of H+.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- per formula unit. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-. So total OH^- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the next step is to consider the neutralization reactions. Strong acids and bases will neutralize each other, and any excess will determine the pH.

First, let's combine the strong acid (HCl) and the strong base (Ba(OH)2). Then, the weak acid (CH3COOH) can be handled separately.

Wait, but wait—Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so its OH^- ions will react with strong acids first, right? Because strong acids and bases react completely.

So, the H+ from HCl will react with the OH^- from Ba(OH)2.

I need to see which is in excess: H+ or OH^-.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So, there's more OH- than H+. So the OH- will neutralize all the H+ and have some left over.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, moles after reaction:

H+ left: 0.08 - 0.18 = negative, so H+ is all consumed. Then, OH- remaining is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Wait, no, because OH- is 0.18 and H+ is 0.08. So OH- will have 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles left. So the solution will be basic because OH- is in excess.

But wait, also, there's the acetic acid, which is a weak acid. How does that factor in? Hmm. Because
