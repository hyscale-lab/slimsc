Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The options are all different chemical formulas, so I'll need to figure out which one fits the given data.

First, let's go through each of the characterization techniques mentioned: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ probably indicates an -OH group because O-H stretches typically show up around there, and they're broad. The other peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ are important too. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is often a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't think that's one of the options here. Let me think: esters or ketones have carbonyls around 1700. If there's another carbonyl, maybe a conjugated one, that would lower the wavenumber a bit, so maybe 1650 is an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group, like an enone or something similar. Or maybe it's a conjugated ester.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are those on a double bond, like in CH₂=CH groups. So the compound has a double bond, possibly conjugated with something else. Maybe an aromatic ring or another double bond.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass for certain functional groups. Let me think about possible fragments. For instance, a methyl group attached to something might lose some parts. Alternatively, a common fragment is the CH₂=O group, which is 30 (CH₂O), but wait, 45 is higher. Or maybe a ketone group. Alternatively, the fragment could be something like a CH₂CH₂O group, but I'm not sure. Wait, 45 could correspond to (CH₂)₂O, which is 45 (since 12*2 + 1*4 + 16 = 24 +4 +16 =44. Hmm, no, wait: 12*2 (for two CH2) would be 24, plus 16 for O: 24 +16=40. Plus the two hydrogens, but that's 40 + 2 =42? Not 45. Alternatively, maybe an acylium ion or something else. Wait, 45 could be a fragment like (CH3)2CO, but wait, that's more like 58. Alternatively, maybe a propyl group with an oxygen? Alternatively, perhaps
