Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the spectral data provided.

Let me start by breaking down the information given step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups. But wait, where exactly? The broad peak is between 3000-3500 typically for O-H stretches in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But a very broad peak might suggest a strong hydrogen bonding, maybe a carbonyl like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Then, there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm. The 1700 region is usually a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or an ester. The peak at 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ketone or an amide. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl, such as an ester or a ketone in an aromatic compound. Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl in a conjugated system or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, 1650 could be a C=C stretch, but that's usually around 1600-1680 for C=C. Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like a ketone in an aromatic ring, such as acetophenone, which has a carbonyl around 1680-1720 cm⁻¹. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl group, so like in an ester with conjugation, which might lower the carbonyl frequency.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has at least one double bond, maybe an alkene group. The presence of vinyl pro
