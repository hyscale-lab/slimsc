Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH to form product 1. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromo) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably E2. The product should be an alkene since removing two adjacent halides would form a double bond. So product 1 is likely adamantene with a double bond, maybe 1,3-adamantadiene? Wait, no, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a structure where the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH would lead to dehydrohalogenation. Oh wait, no, wait. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is quite rigid. The 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent positions, so elimination would form a double bond between those positions. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe a cyclohexene-like structure within the adamantane framework. Hmm, not exactly sure about the structure, but I think the main point is that product 1 is an alkene.

Then, the 1H NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably
