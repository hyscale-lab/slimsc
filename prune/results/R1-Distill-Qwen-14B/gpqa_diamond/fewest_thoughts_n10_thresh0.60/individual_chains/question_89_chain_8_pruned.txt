Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromo means there are bromines on two non-adjacent carbon atoms in the adamantane structure. 

Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction. Since there are two bromines, perhaps a dehydrohalogenation occurs. Wait, but with two leaving groups, maybe it's a double elimination. So, when two adjacent (or perhaps vicinal) bromides undergo elimination, they form a double bond. Oh wait, but in adamantane, the structure is rigid, so the positions might not be adjacent. Hmm, but maybe the reaction leads to a diene? Or perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Let me think about the reaction conditions. KOH and heat usually cause elimination, forming alkenes via an E2 mechanism. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming an alkene. But wait, where? Let's see, the structure of adamantane is such that 1 and 3 are across from each other, not adjacent. So perhaps the elimination forms a brid
