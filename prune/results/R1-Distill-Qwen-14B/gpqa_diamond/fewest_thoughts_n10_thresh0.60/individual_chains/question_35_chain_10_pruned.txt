Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as c times S. 

Wait, the operator Ay is defined as c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So the matrix S looks like this:

[ 0  -i ]
[i   0 ]

I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices like this often represent spin operators. Since S is a 2x2 matrix, it's probably related to the Pauli matrices. Let me think, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let's see what S looks like compared to them.

The Pauli y matrix, σy, is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh wait, that's exactly what S is! So S must be the Pauli y matrix. So S = σy. 

Now, the operator Ay is c multiplied by σy. So Ay = c σy. And since c is h/(4π), that's (h/(4π)) * σy.

The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So we need to find the eigenvalues a and eigenvectors φ.

I remember that for a Pauli matrix, like σy, the eigenvalues are ±1. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So let me compute the eigenvalues of σy first.

The eigenvalues of σy can be found by solving det(σy - λ I) = 0. Let's set that up:

σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix σy - λ I is:

[ -λ     -i     ]
[ i      -λ    ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(i) = λ² - (i²). Since i² is -1, this becomes λ² - (-1) = λ² +1. Setting this equal to zero: λ² +1 = 0
