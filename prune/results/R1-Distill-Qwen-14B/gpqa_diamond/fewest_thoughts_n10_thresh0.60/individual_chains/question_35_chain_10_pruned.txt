Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators, specifically the Y-component, which is denoted as A_y. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices, and in this case, the operator A_y is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h over 4π, and S is a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, the matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So let me write that down. Matrix S looks like:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So the operator A_y is c times this matrix S. So let me compute A_y:

A_y = c * S = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So the matrix elements would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by each element of S. So the first element is 0, second is -i * c, and so on.

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. I remember that eigenvalues for a 2x2 matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(A_y - λI) = 0.

Wait, no. Actually, S is a Pauli matrix multiplied by something? Because the S matrix seems familiar. Oh yeah, the Pauli y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So S is actually the Pauli y matrix. So I think the eigen
