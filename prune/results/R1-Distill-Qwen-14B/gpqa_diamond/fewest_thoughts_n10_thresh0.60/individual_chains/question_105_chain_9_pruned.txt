Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects its brightness. Then, they're comparing it to the signal we'd get from an exoplanet. Interesting.

So the star's radius is the same as the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. They say this could look like an exoplanet's effect on the light curve. The question is, what radius would a planet need to have to produce the same brightness variation as these spots?

Wait, but the planet would cause a dip in brightness when it transits the star. The spots might cause a similar dip? Or maybe it's the other way around—the spots cause a dip when they're facing us, but when the star rotates, the brightness changes. Hmm, I'm not sure, but the key is to find the planet radius Rpl relative to Rstar that would give the same amplitude in the light curve.

So first, I think I need to find the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, figure out what planet size would cause the same dip.

The star's Teff is 6000K. The spots are 1000K cooler, so their temperature is 5000K. The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Wait, filling factor is the area covered by spots. So each hemisphere is half the star, but spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. Wait, no, the star is one hemisphere spotty. So the entire surface is split into two hemispheres. Each hemisphere has 20% of its area covered in spots.

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So in that hemisphere (which is half the star's surface), 20% of its area is spots. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) )? Because a hemisphere is half the surface area of a sphere. So area of hemisphere
