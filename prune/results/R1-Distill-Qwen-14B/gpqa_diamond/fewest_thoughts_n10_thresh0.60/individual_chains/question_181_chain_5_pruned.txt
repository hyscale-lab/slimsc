Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain reaction stops. Hmm. Let me think about what I know.

Alright, the Sun's energy production involves several processes, right? I remember the proton-proton chain (pp chain) is the main one, especially in the core. I think the pp chain has a few branches. Oh wait, there's the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh right, pp-III is one of them. So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. That's about the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) from the Sun's core to reach Earth. So any effect would be noticeable now.

The question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 KeV, and Band 2 is 800-900 keV. We need the ratio of their fluxes.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in different parts of the Sun, depending on the reaction. I think the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. Oh right, because the pp-III branch involves heavier elements like carbon. Like, I remember that the pp-III branch produces CNO (Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen) cycle neutrinos, but wait, no, wait. Or is it the other way around?

Wait no, the CNO cycle is a different part. The pp chain has branches. Let me think. The pp-I branch leads to He-4 via two protons fusing
