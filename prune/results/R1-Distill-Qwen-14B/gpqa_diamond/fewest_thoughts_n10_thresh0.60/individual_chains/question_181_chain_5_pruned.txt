Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So, if the pp-III reactions stopped, the change in neutrino flux would take about that same time to reach us. But since the question is about the current flux, the effects would be noticeable now.

So, I need to find the ratio of the flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D.

First, I should remember what the pp-III reactions are. The proton-proton chain is the main source of solar energy. The pp-I branch produces some deuterium, and the pp-II and pp-III branches are variations that contribute to the overall energy production. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor compared to pp-I but plays a role in producing higher-energy neutrinos.

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun via the beta decay steps in the proton-proton chain. The most common are the electron neutrinos (ν_e) from the decay of boron-8. The energy of these neutrinos depends on the reaction that produces them.

Wait, the pp-III branch—I think it involves higher energy reactions. Let me recall: the pp-III branch is when a proton captures a helium-3 ion (He-3) to form a He-4 ion and emits a positron and a neutrino. So, the neutrinos from the pp-III process are higher energy than those from the pp-I process. Oh wait, or does it? Or maybe the pp-III produces more high-energy neutrinos.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. The dominant neutrino production in the Sun is from the decay of boron-8, which comes from the main pp-I branch. The pp-III branch produces some neutrinos as well, but maybe at higher energies than the pp-I but lower than other processes. Or perhaps I should think in terms of the neutrino energy spectrum.

Wait, another approach: neutrinos from the pp-I
