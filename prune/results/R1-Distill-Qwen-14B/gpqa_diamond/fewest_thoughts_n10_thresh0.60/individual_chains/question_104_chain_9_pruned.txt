Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines indicates the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have each planet (Neptune-like mass) detected via RV. The shifts are 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. They're asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, the RV method's signal depends on the mass of the planet and its orbital period, I think. Or more specifically, the velocity amplitude of the star. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) / (c * (P)^(1/3)) )^(1/3)? Wait, no, maybe I should recall the formula correctly.

Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / P )^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) )^(1/3) * c ?

Wait, maybe I should write it in a more standard form. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the relation between the velocity shift (K) and the orbital period (P). Since the stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so M_p is same for both planets? Wait, the question says both have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses are the same, approximately.

So for two planets around the same type of star, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula I think I need is K = (v) = ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) )

But since both stars have the same mass (solar masses), and the planets have similar masses
