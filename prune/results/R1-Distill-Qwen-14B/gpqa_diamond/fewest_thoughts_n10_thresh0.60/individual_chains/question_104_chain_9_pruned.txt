Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

So the question says that two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun, have planets with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets, and each showed periodic shifts in their spectral lines. The shift for planet #1 is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1's.

I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves in a small orbit around the barycenter, and we detect the shift in the spectral lines. The velocity of the star is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, there's a formula that relates the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period. Let me recall that. Oh right, the formula is something like K = ( (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * (1 AU)^3 ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) ) * (something with period). Hmm, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I think the semi-amplitude formula is K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period. Because the question is about the periods, not the velocities per se.

Another approach: The RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and orbital parameters. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) )

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), that term doesn
