Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. 

The main thing they're asking is by what factor is the luminosity of Star_1 greater than Star_2. The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 or so.

Hmm, okay. So, how do I approach this?

First, I remember that the luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh wait, but in terms of black body radiation, the peak wavelength (λ_max) is given by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. 

Wait, the question says they have the same wavelengths at which they appear brightest. So λ_max is the same for both stars. If that's the case, then their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

But wait, if T1 = T2, that's interesting because Star_1 is bigger in radius. So the luminosity of Star_1 would be higher because luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. Since T is same, the ratio would be (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But since T is the same, T1/T2 is 1, so luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 is 1.5. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So why is the option not exactly 2.25? The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, etc.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something else here. The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed wavelength?

Ah, right! Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, its light is Doppler shifted. But wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max is the same. So the actual λ_max emitted by each star might differ because one is moving towards us, causing blueshift, and the other's λ_max is observed as redshifted or something?

Wait, no. Let's clarify. The question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, as determined through spectroscopy, are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both. But the emitted λ_max is determined by their temperatures. So let me think: each star emits a certain λ_max based on their temperature, but because of their motion, this λ_max is observed at a different wavelength. 

For example, if a star is moving towards us, its emitted light is blueshifted, so the observed λ_max would be shorter than the emitted. Conversely, if moving away, it's redshifted, longer λ_max. 

Wait, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So the emission from each star, when adjusted for their velocities, gives the same observed λ_max. 

So let's model this. Let me denote:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) ) ? Wait, no, I think the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ' = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ) )

Wait, actually, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ' = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ). But I'm not sure if that's the right way around. Alternatively, the non-relativistic approximation for small velocities is λ' ≈ λ0 (1 + v/c), but I think for this problem, given that velocities are 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (since c is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.23c), so we need to use the relativistic formula.

Wait, but let's get back to the problem. The observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So, for each star, the observed λ_max equals λ_obs = λ_emitted * Doppler shift factor.

So for Star_1, v_r is 0, so no shift. So λ_obs1 = λ1.

For Star_2, v_r is 700 km/s. Let's say Star_2 is moving away, so the observed λ_obs2 would be longer than the emitted λ2.

Wait, but the problem states that λ_obs1 and λ_obs2 are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So λ1 = λ_obs2 = λ2 * Doppler shift factor.

So, λ1 = λ2 * ( sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c ) / (1 - v_r2/c ) ) )

But wait, if Star_2 is moving away, then v_r2 is positive, so the observed λ is longer than the emitted. So to have λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, since Star_1 has no velocity, λ1 must be equal to λ_obs2.

So, λ1 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

Because when a star moves away, the observed wavelength is longer. So if λ_obs2 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) ), then λ1 must equal this.

But wait, λ_max is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T. So λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2.

So from the above equation:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

Wait, let me rearrange this.

Divide both sides by b: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me compute this.

We can write sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ), where x = v_r2/c.

So, v_r2 is 700 km/s, and c is about 3e5 km/s. So x = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/300 ≈ 0.023333.

So, x ≈ 0.02333.

So, (1 + x) = 1.02333, (1 - x) = 0.97667.

Compute (1.02333)/(0.97667) ≈ (1.02333)/(0.97667) ≈ let's compute that.

1.02333 / 0.97667 ≈ approximately 1.0478 (because 0.97667 * 1.0478 ≈ 1.02333).

So the square root of 1.0478 is sqrt(1.0478) ≈ 1.0235.

So, sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) ≈ 1.0235.

So, T1 = T2 / 1.0235 ≈ T2 * (1 / 1.0235) ≈ T2 * 0.9768.

So, T1 ≈ 0.9768 * T2.

Wait, so the temperature of Star_1 is lower than that of Star_2? But wait, earlier I thought T1 and T2 were same. Oh no, I think I messed up.

Wait, because Star_1 is not moving, so its observed λ is the same as its emitted λ. Star_2 is moving, so its observed λ is longer than its emitted λ. But because the observed λ's are same, the emitted λ of Star_2 must be shorter than that of Star_1, meaning its temperature is higher.

Wait, because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if Star_2's observed λ is same as Star_1's emitted λ, but Star_2's observed λ is longer than its emitted λ, that implies that Star_2's emitted λ is shorter than Star_1's emitted λ.

But that would mean Star_2's temperature is higher, because λ is shorter.

Wait, let me re-examine.

Star_1: v_r = 0. So λ_obs1 = λ_emitted1.

Star_2: v_r =700 km/s. So λ_obs2 = λ_emitted2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

But the problem states λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_emitted1 = λ_emitted2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

But λ_emitted is given by Wien's law: λ = b / T.

So,

( b / T1 ) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

So,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * D, where D is this Doppler factor.

So,

T1 = T2 / D.

Since D is sqrt( (1+x)/(1-x) ), which is greater than 1, T1 is less than T2.

So, T1 is less than T2, meaning Star_1 is cooler than Star_2.

Wait, so that's an important point. Initially, I thought T1 and T2 were the same, but they're not. Because the Doppler shift changes the observed λ_max, so to have same observed λ_max, their emitted λ_max must differ based on their velocities.

So, now, the luminosity of each star is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴.

So, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 )

Simplify:

( (2.25 R2²) * T1^4 ) / ( R2² * T2^4 ) ) = 2.25 * (T1^4)/(T2^4)

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4.

But from earlier, T1 = T2 / D, where D is approximately 1.0235.

So,

(T1/T2) = 1/D ≈ 1/1.0235 ≈ 0.9768.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.9768)^4.

Let me calculate that.

0.9768^2 is approximately (0.9768 * 0.9768).

Let me compute 0.9768 * 0.9768.

0.9768 * 0.9768: Approximately 0.9542.

Wait, 0.977^2 is roughly 0.954. So squared again, 0.954^2 is about 0.910.

So (0.9768)^4 ≈ 0.91.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.91 ≈ 2.0475.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are all about 2.2 something. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me double-check. I think I messed up the Doppler shift formula. Let me re-calculate the Doppler factor.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But wait, that's for a source moving away. Because when a star moves away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the Doppler factor is greater than 1.

But in our case, Star_2 is moving away, so the observed λ2 is longer than the emitted λ2. But the observed λ1 (which is equal to λ1) is the same as the observed λ2.

So,

λ1 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ1 = b / T1 and λ2 = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which can be rewritten as:

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) )

Which is the same as sqrt( (1 - x)/(1 + x) ), where x = v/c.

Ah, okay, that's an important correction. Earlier, I had the reciprocal, which was wrong.

So, in our case, v is 700 km/s, c is 3e5 km/s, so x = 700/(3e5) ≈ 0.002333 (since 3e5 is 300,000, 700/300,000 is 7/(3000) = 0.002333...).

So, x ≈ 0.002333.

So, (1 - x) ≈ 0.997667, (1 + x) ≈ 1.002333.

Compute (1 - x)/(1 + x) = (0.997667)/(1.002333) ≈ let's compute that.

0.997667 / 1.002333 ≈ approximately 0.99536.

So, sqrt(0.99536) ≈ approximately 0.99768.

So, T1/T2 ≈ 0.99768.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute that.

0.99768 squared is approx (1 - 0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00232 + (0.00232)^2 ≈ 0.99537.

Then, square that again: 0.99537^2 ≈ approx (1 - 0.00463)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00926 + (0.00463)^2 ≈ approx 0.99074.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ ~0.99074.

So, L1/L2 is 2.25 * 0.99074 ≈ approximately 2.25 * 0.99074 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, 2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So, 2.227 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier when I used x=0.02333, which was incorrect, I got a different result. But now, using x=0.002333, the correct approach, I get L1/L2 ≈2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that Star_1's radial velocity is 0, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving away from us.

So, in the Doppler formula, for a receding source, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. So, when calculating λ_obs2 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), and since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, which is equal to λ1.

So, λ1 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which gives us λ1 > λ2, so T1 < T2, which aligns with our earlier finding.

So, with the corrected calculation, the ratio is about 2.23, which is option D.

So, the correct answer should be D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Given Information
- Radius ratio: \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \)
- Radial velocity of Star_1: \( v_{r1} = 0 \, \text{km/s} \)
- Radial velocity of Star_2: \( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
- Observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same: \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)

### Step 2: Relating Emitted and Observed Wavelengths
Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

For Star_1 (\( v_{r1} = 0 \)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted,1}}
\]

For Star_2 (\( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emitted,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

### Step 3: Relating Temperatures
Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{emitted}} \propto 1/T \), we find:

\[
\frac{\lambda_{\text{emitted,1}}}{\lambda_{\text{emitted,2}}} = \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substituting into the Doppler shift equation:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \)
The velocity \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), and the speed of light \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \). Thus:

\[
x = \frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
\frac{1 - x}{1 + x} = \frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333} \approx \frac{0.997667}{1.002333} \approx 0.99536
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{0.99536} \approx 0.99768
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} \)
Substitute \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \) and \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.99768 \) into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.99768)^4
\]

First, calculate \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \). Next, calculate \( (0.99768)^4 \):

\[
(0.99768)^2 \approx 0.99537, \quad (0.99537)^2 \approx 0.99074
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.99074 \approx 2.227
\]

### Step 6: Match to Closest Option
The calculated ratio \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.227 \) is closest to option **D) ~2.23**.

**Answer: D**
