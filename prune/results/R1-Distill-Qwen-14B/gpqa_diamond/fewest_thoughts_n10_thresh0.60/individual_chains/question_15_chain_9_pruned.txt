Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let's think through it step by step.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected using the RV method. So they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so if Planet_1's period is shorter, that means it's orbiting closer to its star, right? Because the closer you are to a star, the shorter the orbital period.

Both have circular orbits, which is good because eccentric orbits can complicate things, but since they're circular, I don't have to worry about varying distances affecting the transit probability.

The host stars have different masses but the same radii. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting. Wait, so more massive stars usually are larger, but in this case, they've evolved—Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so maybe it's a subgiant or something, which might have expanded a bit but not as much as a giant star. Since both have same radii, that's a key point.

The question is about the probability of transiting. So transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. But I think the main factors here are the orbital distance and the star's size. Because the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight, which depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit.

Wait, the transit probability formula I remember is something like (R_planet / R_star)² times (something about the orbital distance). Or wait, perhaps it's the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Because the probability is the area of the planet's orbit relative to the star's disk. Hmm, wait, no. The probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, multiplied by something else.

Wait, I think the probability P is approximately (R_star / a)² * (something else), but maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the
