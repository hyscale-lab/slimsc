Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and transit detection. Hmm, I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star since the orbital period is shorter. Oh right, Kepler's third law, shorter period means closer orbit.

The host stars have the same radius, but the star of Planet_1 is twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Wait, but same radius. So Planet_1's star is more massive but same size. I think a more massive star would typically be larger, but maybe in this case, it's evolved or something. Oh, the question says the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. So Planet_1's star has same radius as Planet_2's, which is slightly less evolved, perhaps.

The main thing is transit probability. I recall that the probability depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The formula, I think, is R_star divided by the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So the probability P is roughly (R_star)/(a), where a is the semi-major axis.

Wait, but a is related to the orbital period. Using Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a^3. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate a^3 proportional to P^2 * M_star. So a = [ (G M_star P^2) / (4π²) ]^(1/3). But since M_star for Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2's star, let's see.

Let me assign variables. Let’s let M2 be the mass of Planet_2's star. So M1 = 2*M2.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is P1 = P2 / 3, since Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So P1 = P2/3.

Now, the semi-major axis for each planet: a1 and a2. Using Kepler's third law:

a^3 = (G M_star P^2) / (4π²). Since G and 4π² are constants, a^3 is proportional to M_star * P^2.

So for Planet_1:

a1^3 ∝ M1 * P1^2 = (2 M2) * ( (P2/3) )^2 = 2 M2 * P2² /9.

For Planet_2:

a2^3 ∝ M2 * P2^2.

So a1^3 = (2/9) * a2^3. Therefore, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). Let's approximate (2/9) is about 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is roughly 0.6 (since 0.6^3 is 0.216). So a1 is about 0.6 * a2. So the semi-major axis of Planet_1 is smaller than Planet_2.

Wait, but the transit probability formula is P = (R_star / a) * (something), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. I remember that the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is closer to edge-on, but the statistical probability is proportional to (R_star)/(a). Because the star's disk is R_star in radius, and the planet's orbital plane has to be within an angle such that the planet crosses our line of sight. So the probability is roughly (R_star)/(a) multiplied by something else, but perhaps the exact factor isn't necessary for this comparison.

Since both stars have the same radius, R. So for each planet, P1 = R / a1 and P2 = R / a2.

Wait, no, that would be P =
