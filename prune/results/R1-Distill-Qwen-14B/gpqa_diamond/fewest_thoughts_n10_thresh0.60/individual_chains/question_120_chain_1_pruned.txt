Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, actually, I remember that parallax (denoted as 'plx') is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So, if I consider a range of parallax values, say from plx to plx + d_plx, how does the number of stars in that range relate to plx?

Assuming uniform distribution means that stars are evenly spread out in space. So their number density is the same everywhere. Wait, no, because if the distribution is uniform, then the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume. But parallax relates to distance, so how does that play in?

I remember that parallax plx (in arcseconds) is related to distance d in parsecs by the formula plx = 1/d. So, d = 1/plx.

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. The number of stars in a certain volume should be n multiplied by that volume. So, we need to find the volume corresponding to a range in plx.

Wait, but plx is a function of distance. Let's imagine that for a thin shell at distance d, the volume element is a sphere of radius d. But wait, when considering a small change in parallax (d_plx), that corresponds to a small change in distance. Let me think about the relationship between plx and d. Since plx = 1/d, then d_plx = -1/d² * dd, where dd is the small change in distance. So, dd = -d² * d_plx. But since d_plx is positive (as plx increases, distance decreases), perhaps I should think in terms of the absolute value.

The volume in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. So, the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But the question is about the number per unit plx. So, for a given plx, how many stars are there in a small change in plx (d_plx). Let's express everything in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, and dd is the change in d. Let's find the change in plx, d_plx, in terms of dd.

From plx = 1/d, taking derivative both sides: d_plx = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = -d² d_plx. But since d is positive and d_plx is an increase (say, from plx to plx + d_plx), perhaps d_plx is positive when d decreases, so maybe better to take absolute values.

So, the volume element is 4π d² dd. Substituting dd = -d² d_plx, but since d_plx is positive when plx increases (which implies d decreases), perhaps we can write it as 4π d² (d² d_plx) )? Wait, no, because dd is negative when d_plx is positive. Hmm, maybe I should think of the volume element in terms of plx.

Alternatively, let's express everything in plx. The volume element in terms of plx would be the surface area at distance d multiplied by the thickness in distance, and then express the thickness in terms of plx.

The surface area at distance d is 4πd². The thickness in distance is dd. So the volume element is 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, and dd = d^2 d_plx (Wait, let me get the derivative correctly.)

Wait, from plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me take derivatives:

d (plx) = - (1/d²) dd.

Wait, so rearranging, dd = -d² d(plx). So for
