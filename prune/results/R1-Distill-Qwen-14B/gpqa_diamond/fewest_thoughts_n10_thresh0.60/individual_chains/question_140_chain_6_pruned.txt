Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then, there's another part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. The substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm. Let me think about each part.

First, the reaction of X with Y. I know that some reactions between metals and liquids (like acids) can produce gases. For example, metals reacting with acids produce hydrogen gas. But gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about what that could be.

Hydrogen gas is H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So in H2, each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. No, that doesn't fit because the number of neutrons and protons would be 0 and 2. Wait, maybe another gas.

Wait, what about NH3? No, that's a liquid at room temp. Wait, wait, gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible diatomic or triatomic gases.

Wait, maybe CO2? No, but CO2 is linear and a gas. Alternatively, maybe H2O? But under standard conditions, it's a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about the number. Let's say the molecule has two atoms. Then each atom would have protons and neutrons such that in the molecule, the total protons equal total neutrons.

Wait, for example, if the molecule is O2. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since oxygen is O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, same number. So that's possible. But O2 is a
