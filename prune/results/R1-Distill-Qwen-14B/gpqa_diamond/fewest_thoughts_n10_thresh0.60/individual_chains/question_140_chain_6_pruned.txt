Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again and try to parse all the clues.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces a gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius since 0 K is absolute zero and 273 K is 0°C. Wait, 277 is 4°C? Wait, no, let me calculate: 273.15 K is 0°C, so 277 K is 4.85°C, approximately 5°C. So B has a melting point near 5°C. Hmm, what's a solid with a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or maybe something else. Wait, another thought: Maybe it's something like ice, but that's 273 K. So no, maybe a different substance.

Let me go back. The gas W has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule's composition must have equal protons and neutrons. Common gases... perhaps something like CO2, but wait, that's a molecule. Alternatively, maybe H2O, but wait, H2O's molecule has 10 protons in total (each H has 1, O has 8). But neutrons? H is H-1, so no neutrons. O has 8 protons, so usually 8 neutrons (O-16). So H2O's molecule has 10 protons and (2*(0) + 8) = 8 neutrons. That's not equal. So that's not W.

Alternatively, maybe CH4? No, that's a hydrocarbon. What about NH3? NH3 has 14 protons (N has 7, each H has 1). Neutrons: N is usually N-14 (7 neutrons), H has no neutrons. So total neutrons would be 7. Protons are 14. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, if the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in the whole molecule, perhaps it's something like H2O2? Let's see: H2O2 has 2 H and 2 O. Protons: 2*(1) + 2*(8) = 2 + 16 = 18. Neutrons: H has 0, O is O-16 (8 neutrons each). So 2*(8) = 16. So 18 vs 16. Not equal. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's something like CO, which is a gas. CO has 7 (C) + 8 (O) = 15 protons. Neutrons: C is C-12 (6), O is O-16 (8). So 6+8=14. Not equal. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a molecule with a single atom, like noble gases. But a noble gas as a product might not make sense in this context. Alternatively, perhaps a diatomic molecule. Let me think... maybe something like O2? O2 has 16 protons each, so 32 total. Neutrons: each O is 8, so 16 total. So 32 protons, 16 neutrons. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the molecule is heavier. Let's think about heavier elements. Chlorine gas is Cl2. Cl has 17 protons each, so 34 in the molecule. Neutrons: Cl can be Cl-35 or Cl-37. So each atom has 18 or 20 neutrons. For Cl2,
