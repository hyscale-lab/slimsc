Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I think I need to figure out how much acid and base are present after mixing, and see if one is in excess. Then, depending on which is in excess, I can calculate the pH accordingly.

Let me jot down the given data:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base, since Ba is a group 2 metal and OH- is hydroxide)

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Moles are calculated using Molarity (M) multiplied by Volume (L). So I'll convert mL to liters first.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity = 0.1 M, Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M, Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L.
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2:
Molarity = 0.3 M, Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions per formula unit. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the acids are HCl and CH3COOH. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, meaning all 0.08 moles produce H+ ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But I'm not sure if I can treat it as just contributing some H+ or if I'll need to account for its dissociation later.

Wait, but before that, maybe I should consider the neutralization between the acids and the base.

The H+ ions from both HCl and CH3COOH will react with the OH- ions from Ba(OH)2.

So the total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles (since HCl is strong and fully ionizes). The acetic acid, being weak, doesn't contribute a lot of H+ at this point, but I think I can model the neutralization as H+ (from HCl) reacting with OH-.

Wait, but the
