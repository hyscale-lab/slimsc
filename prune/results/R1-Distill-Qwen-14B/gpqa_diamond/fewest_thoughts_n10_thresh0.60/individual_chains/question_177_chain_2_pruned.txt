Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, we've got two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The question mentions that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! That's lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, they must be at the same temperature. So T1 equals T2. Got it.

The problem also says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight, right? But how does that affect luminosity? Oh wait, wait. Maybe I should focus on the luminosity calculation first. Since both stars are black bodies, their luminosity should depend on their radius and temperature, but wait, I also remember that luminosity relates to mass for stars, but in this problem, they’re telling us to compute the luminosity based on black body radiation, so I think the mass might not directly come into play here unless perhaps it's about the radius and temperature. Wait, but the radius and temperature are given, so maybe the mass is a red herring or not needed for this particular calculation. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the question states that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So I need to calculate L1/L2.

What's the formula for luminosity of a star as a blackbody? Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is effective temperature, σ is the Stefan constant.

Since both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures are equal. So T1 = T2 = T.

So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4). But since T1 equals T2, the ratio
