Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where each star appears brightest are the same. Oh wait, waitâ€”when stars emit light and have a peak wavelength, that's related to their temperature, right? Like, using Wien's Law, which says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same because b is a constant. So T1 = T2. Interesting.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, so it's not moving much relative to us. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, how does radial velocity affect luminosity? Oh, wait, luminosity is intrinsic brightness, which depends on the star's properties, not how fast it's moving. But wait, actually, the measured brightness (like apparent brightness) depends on distance and luminosity, but the problem is talking about computed luminosity, so maybe it's considering only the star's properties and not any Doppler shifting affecting the observed brightness. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

The question says the astronomers computed the luminosity
