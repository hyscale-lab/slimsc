Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about non-Gaussian states and the measures used to quantify them.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, which are Gaussian states. But when you superpose them with different phases, you can get a non-Gaussian state, especially something like a Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states.

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). Oh wait, sin(2phi) would be 2 sin(phi) cos(phi), but maybe I don't need to simplify that right now.

The non-Gaussianity measure here is the relative entropy, del_b, which is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state and that of a reference Gaussian state. The formula is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). So, this is the relative entropy between the non-Gaussian state rho and a Gaussian state tau.

Wait, but wait. Von Neumann entropy S(rho) is trace(rho ln rho), right. So del_b is S(rho) - S(tau), because the reference tau is a Gaussian state. So if the non-Gaussian state has higher entropy, the relative entropy would be positive, indicating more non-Gaussianity.

But wait, actually, I'm not so sure. Because if the reference state is a Gaussian state, maybe the relative entropy is comparing to the closest Gaussian state. But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is how much the state differs from a Gaussian in terms of entropy.

So, the problem is to calculate nG (non-Gaussianity) for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

Let me plug in the values first. Phi is -pi/4, so 2*phi is -pi/2. Sin(2phi) would be sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N is sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).
