Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, I think this is describing some kind of interaction term where the boson X couples to fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are different decay channels, each listing possible fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, I need to figure out which fermions X can decay into. Since X is a boson, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The allowed decays depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions. For a decay to be possible, the mass of X should be at least twice the mass of the fermion (since energy and momentum must be conserved, the rest mass energy of the fermions can't exceed that of X).

So first, I should list all possible fermions and their masses. Let's think about the known fermions:

- Up quark (u): mass is about 2 MeV/c²
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95-105 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: even lighter, but they're leptons too. But in the options, I don't see them, so maybe they aren't considered here, or the problem doesn't allow neutrino decays.

Wait, looking at the options, the possible decay products are quark-antiquark pairs and lepton pairs. So I'll focus on those.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So to produce a fermion pair, each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV because 2m < M_X.

Let's list the fermion masses in GeV:

- e: ~0.0005 GeV → 2m is negligible, so allowed.
- μ: ~0.105 GeV → 0.21 < 6 → allowed.
- τ: ~1.78 GeV → 3.56 <6? No, wait, 2*1.78 is 3.56, which is less than 6 GeV. So τ pairs are allowed.
- u: ~0.002 GeV → allowed.
- d: ~0.004 GeV → allowed.
- s: ~0.1
