Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me take it slow.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The NMR question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

First, I'll break down each reaction step.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

I remember that when a dibromide reacts with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, it typically forms an alkene via an E2 mechanism. Since KOH is a strong base, it should promote elimination. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the Br atoms are on adjacent carbons (or maybe not? Let me think: adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would probably be on adjacent positions in the adamantane structure. So elimination would lead to the formation of an alkene between those positions. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, no, more accurately, the product would be an alkene.

Wait, another possibility: in the presence of KOH, dibromides can undergo elimination to form alkenes. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Brs on adjacent carbons, right? So elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons, resulting in 1,3-adamantadiene? Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination to form a diene, but I think it's more likely that it's a single elimination forming a single double bond.

Wait, another thought: the product is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of an epoxide. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Let me think about the NMR of product
