Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when haloalkanes react with a strong base like KOH, it's usually an elimination reaction, forming alkenes. So maybe this is a dehydrohalogenation. Since it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating would likely lead to the formation of a diene, but wait, let me think. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so when two adjacent carbons each lose a bromide, they form a double bond. So the product here would probably be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, wait, no, the product of eliminating two equivalents of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form 1,3-adamantadiene (maybe called diamondene?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclic structure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, KOH is a strong base. So maybe it's an E2 elimination. Each Br is on carbons 1 and 3. If they lose HBr, each elimination would form a double bond. So eliminating from 1 and 3, perhaps leading to a conjugated diene? But the structure of adamantane... Hmm. Alternatively, when two vicinal bromides (like 1,2-dibromide) undergo elimination with strong base, they form alkenes. But in this case, 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Wait, adamantane's structure is a diamondoid, so maybe the 1 and 3 positions are adjacent in a way that allows for a conjugated diene upon elimination.

Wait, maybe the product after KOH is 1,3-diene, so an allene? Or perhaps two separate alkenes. Let me think about the product structure.

The NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), a triplet maybe? Then 2.41-2.23 (10H) which sounds like a lot of equivalent protons, possibly in a ring structure. Then 1.94 (2H), maybe some methylene groups. The IR shows a peak at
