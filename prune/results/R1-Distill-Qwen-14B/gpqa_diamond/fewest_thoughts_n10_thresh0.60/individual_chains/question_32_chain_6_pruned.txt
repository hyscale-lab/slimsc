Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me make sure: The standard Lithium isotope is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. So Li with 3 neutrons would be Li-6, I think. So the nucleus in question is Li-6.

The problem is to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed v is 0.96c. I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a moving particle is given by the relativistic energy formula. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, right? So E = gamma * m0 * c². But wait, since we often work in units where c is 1, like in particle physics, but I should be careful here.

Wait, but in this problem, we're dealing with the kinetic energy or the total energy? The question says "the energy of the collider," which I think refers to the total energy each ion has. Because colliders usually accelerate particles to high energies, and the energy given is the total energy, not just the kinetic part. But sometimes, people refer to kinetic energy as the energy imparted. Hmm, I need to clarify that.

Wait, no, in the context of colliders, when they say the energy of the collider, they usually mean the kinetic energy each beam has. Or maybe the total energy? Hmm. Let me think again. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E = K + m0c². But wait, in high-energy physics, sometimes the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass, but for heavy ions like Li, maybe it's not negligible compared to the kinetic energy.

So I need to calculate the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0 c². Alternatively, if the question is asking for the kinetic energy, it would be
