Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. There's a small spherical cavity inside, so it's a hollow sphere but with a cavity. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor, right?

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, the options are A through D. So I need to find which option correctly gives the electric field E at point P.

First, I remember that when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor itself is initially uncharged. So the presence of the charge will induce charges on the conductor. But how does that affect the electric field outside?

I think about Gauss's Law here. For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends on the total enclosed charge. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So what happens when we put a charge inside the cavity?

Oh right, when you place a charge inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor is neutral. So the charge +q inside the cavity will cause the inner surface of the conductor to have a charge of -q (since it's induced). Then, because the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. So the conductor ends up with a net charge of +q on its outer surface.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The conductor is initially neutral. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, it's inside a conductor. The conductor's free electrons will move. The inner surface of the conductor (inside the cavity) must have a charge of -q, because the charge +q induces opposite charges. Then, the total conductor is neutral, so the outer surface must have a charge of +q. That makes sense.

Now, considering a point outside the conductor (P
