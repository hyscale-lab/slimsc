Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics decay modes. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the possible decay products of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y)(ν + X(y))ψf(y). I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction between the boson X and fermions.

Wait, so the boson X is interacting with fermions. The problem is asking about kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. I think that means tree-level decays, right? So the possible decay products would be fermion-antifermion pairs since the interaction term looks like it couples X to two fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. Fermions have their own masses, so for a decay to be allowed, the sum of the masses of the fermion and antifermion should be less than or equal to the mass of X. So I need to list all the fermions whose combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The up and down quarks are the lightest. The up quark is about 2 MeV, down is around 4-5 MeV. But wait, in decays, when considering pair production, you have to consider the rest mass. But wait, in the Standard Model, quarks are confined, but for the sake of decay products, we consider possible particles that can be produced from X.

Wait, but for a boson decaying into a fermion pair, the fermions can be any as long as their rest mass is less than half of X's mass. Because each fermion would carry some energy, but their rest mass is the main constraint.

So, X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let me list the fermion masses:

- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1777 MeV (1.777 GeV)
- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): way heavier, ~173 GeV. But X is only 6 GeV, so top is out.

Wait, but for fermions like the electron, muon, tau, and the quarks, we need their masses to be less than 3 GeV each because each would need to have m < M_X/2. Because when X is at rest, each fermion in the decay would have energy E > m, but the minimal case is when they are produced at rest, so m_fermion * 2 ≤ M_X.

So for each fermion, if 2m ≤ 6 GeV, then they are allowed. So let's check each:

Electron: 0.511 MeV → 2m is ~1 MeV < 6 GeV → allowed.
Muon: ~0.21 GeV (since 105.7 MeV is 0.1057 GeV) → 2m ~0.21 GeV <6 → allowed.
Tau: ~1.777 GeV → 2m ~3.554 GeV. 3.554 GeV >6 GeV? No, wait 3.554 is less than 6. So 3.554 <6 → allowed.
Wait, wait. Because 1.777 GeV is the mass of the tau. So for a pair, it's 2 * 1.777 =3.554 GeV. Which is less than 6 GeV, so yes, tau pair is allowed.

Now for the quarks:

u quark: 2 MeV → 4 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.
d quark: ~5 MeV → 10 MeV <6 → allowed.
s quark: ~100 MeV → 0.2 GeV. 2m=0.2 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
c quark: ~1.5 GeV → 3 GeV. 3 <6 → allowed.
b quark: ~4.7 GeV → 2m=9.4 GeV. 9.4 >6 → not allowed.
t quark: way too heavy, so no.

So the possible fermions are: e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. But what about the quarks? Well, because X is a boson, when
