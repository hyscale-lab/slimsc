Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal. So, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I think it's calculated using something called the Bragg equation, but wait, maybe it's the interplanar spacing formula. Oh right! The formula for interplanar distance (d) is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles?), but I'm getting a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, no, I remember the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But wait, rhombohedral isn't strictly cubic, right? Because in a cubic system, the angles are all 90 degrees. So for rhombohedral, which has all angles equal but not 90, the formula must be different.

Right, the general formula for a crystal with lattice parameter a and angles between the axes, the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2hk cosβ)/(a²) - (2hl cosγ)/(a²)
