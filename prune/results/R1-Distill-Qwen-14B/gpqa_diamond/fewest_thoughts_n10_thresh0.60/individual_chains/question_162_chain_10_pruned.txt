Okay, so I've got this question about differential geometry, which is a bit challenging for me. Let me try to break it down. The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2, given a specific metric. 

First, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry. But wait, the metric given here is in 2D, so maybe it's a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space. Hmm, or perhaps it's a model of hyperbolic space itself. 

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I need to figure out what kind of geometry this describes. The denominator looks like 4 - (x² + y²), which reminds me of the metric for the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space. The Poincaré disk model usually has a metric like ds² = (4/(R² - (x² + y²))) (dx² + dy²), where R is the radius of the disk. Comparing that, in our case, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), so R² here is 4, meaning R=2. So this must be the Poincaré disk model with radius R=2.

The question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, no, the pseudosphere is a surface, but in this context, maybe it refers to the area of the 2D surface described by the metric. Or perhaps, since it's a pseudosphere, it's a 2-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature. 

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere in hyperbolic geometry—oh, wait, pseudosphere's area might be analogous to the area of a sphere in spherical geometry. But for a sphere of radius a in 3D, the area is 4πa². But this is a 2D surface with hyperbolic geometry. 

In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a surface with curvature K is given by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For a compact surface, the integral of Gaussian curvature over the surface equals 2π(1 - χ), where χ is the Euler characteristic. But wait, the Poincaré disk model is not compact; it's a model of the hyperbolic plane. So maybe the question is talking about a finite part of it, like a pseudosphere which might have finite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the entire hyperbolic plane, but that has infinite area. Wait, the options include +infty as option D, so that could be a possibility.

Wait, but the pseudosphere in this context—could it be a different kind of surface? Oh, wait, the term pseudosphere sometimes refers to a surface of constant negative curvature, like the tractricoid. The tractricoid has finite area, but I'm not sure about the exact area.

Wait, let me think about the metric again. The given metric is conformally flat, meaning it can be written as a multiple of the Euclidean metric. So, the line element is E(dx² + dy²), where E is 32/(4 -x² - y²).

I think to find the area, I can integrate the area element over the space. The area element in such a metric would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. But what are the limits of integration? The
