Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature through something called the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor describes the distribution of particles in different energy states.

The Boltzmann equation formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations of energy levels i and j, g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference (E_i - E_j) is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but wait, no, the problem says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J for the specific energy levels considered. So E_i is higher than E_j, right? Because that's how excitation works. So if the atoms are in an excited state, they have a higher energy level.

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n_1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_2 / n_j2 ), but wait, no, maybe I should model it differently. Let me clarify: the ratio of the number of excited atoms to unexcited in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Wait, but let's define variables. Let's say for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level (excited) to the lower (ground) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1, the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), where ΔE is the energy difference. Similarly for star_2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But wait, the problem states that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those
