Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. Parallax is actually inversely related to distance. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax value. Because parallax is the angle subtended by the star's position change as the Earth orbits the Sun. So if a star is nearby, that angle is bigger. Right, so distance d is approximately 1/parallax (in parsecs). So d = 1/plx. So parallax plx is 1/d.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we're looking at how the number of stars, say N, changes as a function of plx.

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, which probably means they have a uniform density in the galaxy. So the number of stars should depend on the volume of space that a certain parallax range represents.

Wait, parallax is 1/d, so d is 1/plx. So when plx increases, the star is closer. So a small plx means a more distant star.

But let's model this. Let's say we have a thin shell at distance d from us. The volume of a thin spherical shell of radius d and thickness dr would be approximately 4πd² dr. But wait, no, because the shell's thickness is dr, so the volume is 4πd² dr.

But parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So substituting, d = 1/plx. So dr would be related to dplx. Let me think: d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d → so plx = d^-1. Taking differential, d plx = - d^-2 * dd → so dr = - (d^2) d plx. Hmm, but since plx decreases as d increases, maybe I should express dr in terms of plx.

Alternatively, maybe I should express the volume in terms of plx. So the volume element in terms of d is 4πd² dd. But since d is 1/plx, let's substitute.

d = 1/plx → so d² = 1/plx². And dd is the change in d, which is the thickness of the shell. But how does dd relate to plx? Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So the shell's thickness in terms of d is the derivative, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of plx.

Wait, the number of stars in a shell is proportional to the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density of stars (which is uniform, so a constant).

So N = n * Volume.

Volume is 4πd² dd, where dd is the thickness in distance. But in terms of plx, since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But how to express dd in terms of plx.

We have dd = (d pl
