Okay, I need to figure this chemistry problem out. Let's start by reading the question carefully. So, it's about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five known compounds. The question gives various clues about substances A1 to A5, and I need to find the molecular weight range for A4.

First, let me parse each clue one by one.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is around 20°C, room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. So, the decomposition reaction probably produces F2 gas. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 oxidizes it, A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Since it's a binary compound with fluorine, maybe A1 is a high oxidation state fluorine compound.

A2 has an oF (I think that's the oxidation state of fluorine) of 31.96%. Wait, oxidation state percentages... Oh, wait, maybe that's the percentage composition by mass of fluorine. Let me check: if oF is 31.96%, that would be the mass percent of fluorine in A2. Or perhaps it's the oxidation number? Hmm, the notation might be a bit unclear. Oh, the question says ɷF=31,96%—so ɷ is possibly the symbol for oxidation state? Or maybe it's the molar percentage? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the fluorine content by mass. Let's think: if A2 is a compound of Y and F, and its fluorine content is 31.96%, that could help determine the formula.

Next clue: A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So A3 is probably YF (fluoride), but maybe in a different oxidation state. Since fluorination usually adds fluorine, perhaps YF is the formula. But wait, when you fluorinate an element, you're adding F. For example, if Y is a metal, fluorine would form a fluoride. But I'm not sure yet.

Then, when adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, you get A5. So A4 is a solution, maybe a solution of a salt. Adding Y in 1:1 ratio leads to A5. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So maybe A5 is a precipitate or a gas or something that breaks down.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about possible elements Y. Since we're dealing with fluorine compounds, Y is likely a metal that forms multiple binary fluorides. Let's think of metals that form several fluorides. For example, maybe Y is iodine? Or perhaps another metal. Wait, but fluorine is very electronegative. Maybe Y is a metal like sodium, but that's probably not it. Alternatively, maybe Y is something like lead or tin, which can form multiple fluorides.

Wait, another approach: A1 is a strong oxidizing agent and maybe a high oxidation state fluoride. For example, could it be something like F2O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is ClF3 or something, but wait,
