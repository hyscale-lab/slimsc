Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, which determines the population of energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. Wait, the photosphere is in LTE, so that makes sense.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I remember that the Boltzmann factor is e^(-Î”E/(kT)), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by this factor.

So the ratio of excited atoms to the lower level (or maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state) depends on temperature. The question says that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much. Let me think: if the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level, then the ratio n1/n2 = 2.

Wait, no. Or maybe the excitation potential is higher. Oh wait, the problem says the energy difference is the same for both stars. Oh, but each star's temperature affects how much excitation occurs.

The Boltzmann factor is (n_i)/(n_j) = g_i/g_j * e^(- (E_i - E_j
