Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, spin-half particles... I remember that spin is a type of angular momentum in quantum mechanics. The particle is in a superposition of spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis, right? So the state is given by 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. I think I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. 

Wait, expectation values. Oh right, the expectation value of an operator gives the average measurement you'd get over many measurements. The formula for the expectation value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the state vector.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. I can break this down into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. The expectation value of the sum is the sum of the expectation values, so I can compute them separately and add them.

First, let's find the expectation value of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. Eigenstates have definite eigenvalues. For σz, the eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. 

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. To find ⟨σz⟩, I can compute it as |c₁|² * (+1) + |c₂|² * (-1), where c₁ and c₂ are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

So c₁ is 0.5, so |c₁|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. c₂ is sqrt(3)/2, so |c₂|² is (3/4) = 0.75. Therefore, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Multiply that by 10, so 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Next, the expectation value of σx. Oh, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Instead, the eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the state given.

The Pauli matrices: σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So σx acts on the basis states as σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

Wait, but when calculating the expectation value for σx, I need to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

So writing ψ as a vector, since |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], then ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Now, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]].
