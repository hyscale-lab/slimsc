Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. So, when the star doesn't have spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is asking about the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (N1/N2) changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't.

I remember that in the stellar photosphere, under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the population of different energy levels changes with temperature. The formula should be something like N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio when there are spots versus without. Oh, but wait, when spots are present, the overall effective temperature of the photosphere decreases. So the temperature in the photosphere is lower when spots are present. But wait, do the spots themselves emit less, thus lowering the average Teff? I'm a bit confused here. Because the spots are cooler regions, so when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall emitted flux would be less, leading to a lower observed Teff. But how does that affect the photospheric conditions where the Ti atoms are?

Wait, but the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the star's overall Teff is lower when spots are present. So the temperature that the photosphere is at is lower. But wait, the star's photosphere is in LTE, so each region (with or without spots) has its own temperature. But the problem says when spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, the problem says the photospheric effective temperature decreases when spots are present. So the effective temperature is lower when spots are there. So the entire photosphere is at a lower temperature when spots are present. Or is it that part of the photosphere is cooler? Hmm, perhaps I should model this as an average. But wait, for the purposes of the problem, perhaps I can treat the photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So the temperature used in the Boltzmann factor would be the photospheric temperature. So when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower, affecting the ratio.

Wait, but the problem says that the Teff is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered. So the spots are cooler, so the overall star emits less, hence Teff is lower. But for the photosphere, each part is at a certain temperature. But the question seems to be considering the photosphere as a whole with an effective temperature of 5500 K when spots are present. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is treating the photosphere's temperature as 5500 K in the spotted case.

So the ratio N1/N2 without spots is R0 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T1) ), and with spots, R1 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T2) ) ), and the factor would be R0/R1 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )

Wait, wait. Let me get the formula right. The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), because N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), so N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So, if the effective temperature changes, the ratio changes.

So, without spots, T is 6000 K, and with spots, T is 5500 K. So the ratio when there are no spots is R1 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k * 6000) ), and when there are spots, R2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k * 5500) ). So the factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, but wait. Wait, R1 is the ratio without spots (T=6000), R2 is the ratio when spots are present (T=5500). So R1 is higher than R2 if the exponent is positive. Because as temperature decreases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases if ΔE is positive (since T is in denominator). Wait, let's think.

Wait, the energy levels: level 1 and level 2. Let's assume E2 > E1, so ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. So at higher temperature, the exponential term would be smaller, because 1/T is smaller. So when T increases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases.

So at T=6000, the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k *6000) ), and at T=5500, it's (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k *5500) )

So when T decreases (from 6000 to 5500), ΔE/(k T) becomes larger, so the exponential increases. So N1/N2 increases. So R1 (without spots) is (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k *6000) ), and R2 (with spots) is (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k *5500) )

Since 5500 <6000, 1/5500 > 1/6000. So the exponent for R2 is larger than that for R1, so R2 is larger than R1.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Wait, the problem states that "when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. That suggests that R2 (with spots) is less than R1 (without spots). So that can't be the case if the exponent is positive, because when T decreases, the exponent increases, making R2 larger. So I must have made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, wait. Wait, the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T) ). So when T decreases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, so N1/N2 increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. So that's a contradiction. Hmmm. So maybe I have the ratio backwards.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Boltzmann factor is N2 = N1 * (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So if ΔE is positive, and T decreases, 1/T increases, so the exponent increases. So exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, so N1/N2 increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So that would imply that under lower T, N1/N2 is lower. Which contradicts the expectation.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So either I'm misunderstanding the problem or miscalculating.

Wait, let's think again. Let's say E2 is higher than E1. So without spots, T is higher. So the exponent is higher (since 1/6000 is lower than 1/5500). So at T=6000, the exponent is ΔE/(k *6000), which is smaller than at T=5500.

Wait, no. Wait, 1/6000 is about 0.0001667, and 1/5500 is approximately 0.0001818. So when T decreases, 1/T increases. So ΔE/(k T) increases. So exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases. So N1/N2 increases when T decreases. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So this is opposite to the calculation.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps my understanding is wrong. Maybe the transition corresponds to a certain wavelength, and perhaps the energy difference is negative. Or perhaps I have the levels reversed.

Wait, maybe the transition is from level 2 to level 1, so perhaps the energy difference is E1 - E2, which would be negative. So ΔE = E2 - E1, but if the transition is from a higher to lower energy, maybe the energy is positive. But in the Boltzmann factor, it's the energy difference between the two levels.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the ionization or excitation. Wait, wait, the transition is between two energy levels, so E2 is higher than E1.

Wait, perhaps I should flip the ratio. Because the question is about the ratio N1/N2, and when spots are present, it's lower.

Wait, in terms of the ratio, if N1/N2 is lower when T is lower, that would be opposite to what the calculation suggests. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the excitation. Higher temperatures make it easier to excite atoms to higher energy levels. So in higher T, more atoms are in higher energy levels.

So without spots, T is higher. So N2 (higher level) would be higher, so N1/N2 would be lower.

With spots, T is lower. So N2 is lower, so N1/N2 is higher.

Wait, that's the opposite of what the problem states. The problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So in that scenario, N1/N2 is lower when T is lower.

Hmm, that's conflicting. So perhaps I'm getting the levels backwards.

Wait, maybe the ratio is N2/N1, not N1/N2. Let me check the question again.

The question says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), observed to decrease when spots are present. So it's N1/N2, or N2/N1?

Wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So let me consider both possibilities.

If the ratio is N1/N2, and this ratio decreases when T decreases, then that would imply that as T decreases, N1/N2 decreases. But according to the Boltzmann equation, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T) ), so as T decreases, this ratio increases. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if the ratio is N2/N1, then N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So as T decreases, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases, making N2/N1 increase. So the ratio would be higher when T is lower, so N2/N1 increases, which would mean N1/N2 decreases. So if the observed ratio is N2/N1, and it decreases when T decreases, that would require that my formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots (higher T), the ratio is higher. So if the ratio is N1/N2, then when T increases (no spots), N1/N2 increases. But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Which would require that N1/N2 is higher (no spots), lower (spots), which would imply that the ratio increases when T increases, which is what the formula says. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the ratio is N2/N1, then when T increases, N2/N1 increases (since more population in higher levels). So when the star has spots, T is lower, so N2/N1 decreases. So the ratio N2/N1 is lower when spots are present, which would mean that the ratio has decreased. Then the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So perhaps the ratio being discussed is N2/N1.

Wait, the problem states that the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two levels (level 1 and 2) decreases when the star has spots. If the ratio is N2/N1, then when T decreases (spots present), N2/N1 decreases, which matches the problem. So that's consistent.

But wait, the original question is about the ratio N1/N2. Wait, no, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots." So that's N1/N2. But according to the earlier calculation, when T decreases, N1/N2 increases because ΔE/(k T) becomes larger. So that contradicts the observation.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the transition wavelength. The problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet range. So maybe this transition is an ionizing transition? Or perhaps it's a forbidden line. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that affects the ratio.

Wait, the wavelength is 1448 Å. So the energy of the photon is E_photon = hc/lambda. Let me compute that. Planck constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. Lambda is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E_photon = hc/(lambda) = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (1448e-10) ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But to find the energy difference between the levels, ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/lambda. So ΔE = 1.372e-18 J. Let me convert that to eV because it's easier. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV. That's a pretty high energy transition. So E2 is 8.56 eV higher than E1.

Hmm, that's a big energy difference. So the energy levels are well-separated. Now, considering that, let's plug into the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But wait, with such a high ΔE, the exponent is going to be a large negative number, so the exponential is very small. So the population in level 2 is much lower than level 1, except at very high temperatures.

Wait, but when the temperature is 6000 K, let's compute  ΔE/(k T).

ΔE is 8.56 eV.

k is Boltzmann's constant, 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So k*T at 6000 K is 8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K ≈ 0.517 eV.

So ΔE/(k T) = 8.56 / 0.517 ≈ 16.56.

So the exponent is -16.56. exp(-16.56) is a very small number, about 1.3e-7. So N2/N1 is approximately (g2/g1) * 1.3e-7.

But when the temperature is 5500 K, k*T is 8.617e-5 *5500 ≈ 0.4739 eV.

So ΔE/(k*T) = 8.56 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.06.

So the exponent is -18.06, exp(-18.06) is about 1.4e-8.

So N2/N1 when T=6000 is (g2/g1)*1.3e-7, and when T=5500, it's (g2/g1)*1.4e-8.

So the ratio (N2/N1)_6000 / (N2/N1)_5500 = (1.3e-7) / (1.4e-8) ) ≈ 9.286.

Wait, so N2/N1 is higher at higher temperatures. But according to the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), the observed ratio (N1/N2) decreases. Hmm, but the ratio N2/N1 is higher when T is higher. So N1/N2 is 1/(N2/N1). So when T increases, N1/N2 decreases.

So in the case of no spots, T=6000 K: N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)) = (g1/g2) * exp(16.56) → but wait, wait no. Wait, N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T) ), which is (g1/g2) * exp(16.56), which is a huge number. So N1/N2 is much larger than N2/N1.

Wait, but for ΔE=8.56 eV, the exponential term exp(ΔE/(k T)) is huge, so N1/N2 is a very large number, meaning that level 1 is heavily populated compared to level 2.

But when the temperature decreases, the exponential term increases, making N1/N2 even larger. So, without spots, N1/N2 is larger, and when spots are present (lower T), N1/N2 increases even more. So the ratio N1/N2 is larger when the star has spots, which contradicts the problem statement that the ratio decreases.

This is confusing. There must be something I'm missing here.

Wait, perhaps I've flipped the levels. Maybe level 1 is higher than level 2. So E1 > E2. Then, the energy difference would be negative. So ΔE = E2 - E1 is negative. Then, the exponent would be negative, leading to a different outcome.

Let me try that. Let's suppose that level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. So E1 > E2, so ΔE = E2 - E1 is negative. Then, the Boltzmann factor for N2/N1 is (g2/g1) exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), which is (g2/g1) exp( positive value ), because ΔE is negative. So as T increases, the exponent increases, making N2/N1 larger. So N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) becomes smaller when T increases.

In the problem, when the star has spots, the temperature is lower. So T decreases. So N1/N2 would increase when T decreases, which again contradicts the problem statement that the ratio decreases.

Wait, but according to the problem, when there are spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, meaning that the photon emitted comes from a higher level (level 2) to a lower level (level 1). So ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive, but the transition energy is hc/lambda. So that's correct.

But according to the calculations, when the temperature is lower, N1/N2 increases, which would mean that the ratio is higher when lower T. But the problem says the ratio decreases when T is lower.

Hmm. Let me think about what the problem says again. The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels decreases when spots are present. So when T decreases, the ratio decreases. Which would mean that N1/N2 is higher when T is higher, which is what the formula says.

Wait, no. Wait, N1/N2 is (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T) ). So, higher T gives lower exponent, so lower N1/N2. Lower T gives higher exponent, so higher N1/N2. So when T is lower (spots present), N1/N2 is higher. But the problem says N1/N2 decreases. So this can't be.

Unless... Oh wait wait, perhaps I'm confusing the energy levels. Maybe the problem is talking about the ratio N2/N1, not N1/N2. Because if the ratio N2/N1 decreases when T decreases, then that would make sense.

Wait, let's model this again. Let's say the ratio being discussed is N2/N1. Without spots, T is 6000 K. So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). At higher T, the exponent is smaller (since 1/6000 is smaller than 1/5500, so ΔE/(k T) is smaller). So exp(-ΔE/(k T)) is larger at higher T. So N2/N1 is larger when T is higher.

When spots are present, T is lower, so N2/N1 is smaller. So the ratio N2/N1 decreases when T decreases. That matches the problem statement. So the observed ratio is N2/N1, which is decreasing when the star has spots.

But the problem says that the ratio of N1/N2 decreases. So if the ratio N2/N1 decreases, then N1/N2 would increase. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the star has spots, the observed flux is lower, so the effective temperature is lower, but the actual photospheric temperature is the same. Wait, maybe I should think about how the presence of spots affects the measured Teff.

Wait, perhaps the presence of spots doesn't change the photospheric temperature in the unspotted regions but makes the overall star appear cooler. So, in the unspotted regions, T is 6000 K, and in the spotted regions, T is lower, say T_spot. So the average Teff is 5500 K.

But for the purpose of calculating the ratio inside the photosphere, each region (spot or not) has its own temperature. But when the star is spotted, 40% of the surface is cooler. So when we observe the spectrum, the lines are formed in the photosphere, so the equivalent width or the line strength would be a combination of the contributions from the spotted and unspotted regions.

But the problem states that the photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. Or perhaps the star's photosphere is a blend of hotter and cooler regions. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, but the question says that the photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when spots are present. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when the star has spots. So the temperature used in the Boltzmann equation is 5500 K.

But earlier, I calculated that when T decreases from 6000 to 5500, the ratio N1/N2 increases. But the problem says that ratio decreases. So perhaps I'm getting the ratio backwards.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is negative. So ΔE is negative, which would invert the exponential.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the factor by which the ratio changes, regardless of the direction. Let me proceed step by step.

Given that the observed ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots, which implies that the ratio R = N1/N2 with spots / R without spots is less than 1. So the factor is less than 1.

Wait, no. Wait, when the star has spots, the ratio R_spot = N1/N2 is lower than R_no_spot.

So the factor is R_no_spot / R_spot = (N1/N2)_no_spot / (N1/N2)_spot.

Which would be greater than 1 if R_spot < R_no_spot.

But according to the earlier calculation, when T decreases from 6000 to 5500, the ratio R = N1/N2 increases. So R_no_spot / R_spot would be less than 1, which would mean that the factor is less than 1. But the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present, so R_spot < R_no_spot, so R_no_spot / R_spot is greater than 1.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Let me try to approach this numerically.

Given:

λ = 1448 Å → E_photon = hc/lambda.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

λ = 1448e-10 m.

E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) ) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) ) = approx 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E_photon = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

So ΔE = 8.56 eV.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

At T=6000 K: k*T = 8.617e-5 * 6000 ≈ 0.517 eV.

ΔE/(k*T) = 8.56 / 0.517 ≈ 16.56.

So the exponential term is exp(16.56). Let me compute that.

exp(16.56) is a very large number. Wait, but wait—no, wait, no. Wait, in the formula, it's exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, no, earlier I thought that for N1/N2, it's (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T) ). But when ΔE is positive, and T is lower, this term increases.

So (N1/N2)_no_spot = (g1/g2) * exp(16.56)

(N1/N2)_spot = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*T_spot)).

T_spot = 5500 K.

k*T_spot = 8.617e-5 eV/K *5500 ≈ 0.4739 eV.

ΔE/(k T_spot) = 8.56 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.06.

So exp(18.06) ≈ ?

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate the actual value.

exp(16.56) is approximately 1.3e7. Because exp(10) ≈ 22026, exp(15) ≈ 3.269e6, exp(16) ≈ 8.886e6, exp(16.56) is about 8.886e6 * exp(0.56) ≈ 8.886e6 * 1.75 ≈ 1.56e7.

Similarly, exp(18.06) would be exp(16.56) * exp(1.5) ≈ 1.56e7 * 4.48 ≈ 7.0e7.

Wait, but that can't be right because 18.06 is higher than 16.56. So the exponential increases as T decreases.

So (N1/N2)_no_spot = (g1/g2) * 1.56e7.

(N1/N2)_spot = (g1/g2) * 7.0e7.

So the ratio (no spot / spot) is (1.56e7) / (7.0e7) ) ≈ 0.223.

So the factor is approximately 0.223, meaning that the ratio without spots is 0.223 times the ratio with spots. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when spots are present, which would imply that (N1/N2)_spot < (N1/N2)_no_spot. But according to this calculation, (N1/N2)_spot is higher.

Wait, that's the opposite of what the problem states.

So perhaps I'm miscalculating. Or maybe the problem is considering the ratio N2/N1 instead.

Wait, let me compute N2/N1.

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

At T=6000 K: exp(-16.56) ≈ 7.48e-8.

At T=5500 K: exp(-18.06) ≈ 2.04e-8.

So (N2/N1)_no_spot = (g2/g1)*7.48e-8.

(N2/N1)_spot = (g2/g1)*2.04e-8.

So the ratio (N2/N1)_no_spot / (N2/N1)_spot ) = (7.48e-8) / (2.04e-8) ) ≈ 3.66.

So the ratio N2/N1 is higher when T is higher. So in the no-spot case, N2/N1 is higher than in the spot case. So N2/N1 decreases when T decreases, which matches the problem statement if the ratio being considered is N2/N1.

But the problem says that the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So if N2/N1 decreases, then N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) would increase.

So this is conflicting. I'm clearly getting something wrong here.

Alternative approach: Maybe the problem is considering the ratio of the populations in the two levels, but as observed through the spectrum. Since the spots are cooler, they might have a different line strength, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of spots affects the continuum emission, changing the measured equivalent width, but that's not directly about the ratio of populations.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Saha equation instead of the Boltzmann equation. But no, the Saha equation deals with ionization, not excitation between energy levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels, but the star's overall emission is a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions. So the observed line strength would be a mix of the two.

But the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so perhaps each region (spot and no spot) is in LTE, and the overall line is a composite.

But that's a different approach. Let's model it that way.

Suppose that 60% of the surface is at 6000 K (unspotted), and 40% is at a lower temperature, T_spot. The observed ratio would be a weighted average, but perhaps the line strength depends on the sum of the contributions from each region.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the number of atoms in each level in the entire photosphere. If the photosphere is a combination of regions at different temperatures, then the overall ratio would be a weighted average based on the contribution from each region.

Hmm, but that complicates the problem. Let me think. Each region contributes to the total number of atoms in each level.

Let me denote:

- Fraction of surface not covered by spots: f = 0.6.

- Fraction covered by spots: 1 - f = 0.4.

Assume that the temperature of the spotted regions is T_spot. But the problem says the overall effective temperature is 5500 K, which might imply a certain T_spot.

But wait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature drops to 5500 K. So the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at T_spot.

The effective temperature is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R^2 σ Teff^4.

The total luminosity is the sum of the contributions from the spotted and unspotted regions.

So L = L_unspotted + L_spotted.

L_unspotted = f * 4π R^2 σ T_unspotted^4.

L_spotted = (1 - f) * 4π R^2 σ T_spotted^4.

Then, the total luminosity is 4π R^2 σ (f T_unspotted^4 + (1 - f) T_spotted^4 )

The effective temperature is given by:

Teff^4 = f T_unspotted^4 + (1 - f) T_spotted^4.

So, given Teff = 5500 K, f = 0.6, T_unspotted =6000 K,

We can solve for T_spotted.

Compute:

5500^4 = 0.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 * T_spot^4.

Compute each term numerically.

Compute 6000^4: 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

Multiply by 0.6: 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

5500^4: 5.5e3^4 = (5.5)^4 * 1e12.

5.5^4 = (5.5^2)^2 = 30.25^2 ≈ 915.06.

So 5500^4 = 915.06 * 1e12 = 9.1506e14.

So,

9.1506e14 = 7.776e14 + 0.4 * T_spot^4.

Subtract 7.776e14 from both sides:

9.1506e14 -7.776e14 = 1.3746e14 = 0.4 * T_spot^4.

Divide by 0.4: T_spot^4 = 1.3746e14 / 0.4 = 3.4365e14.

Take fourth root: T_spot = (3.4365e14)^(1/4).

Let me compute that.

Take natural logs:

ln(3.4365e14) = ln(3.4365) + ln(1e14) ≈ 1.235 + 32.236 ≈ 33.471.

Divide by 4: 8.3678.

Exponentiate: e^(8.3678) ≈ 4381 K.

So T_spot is approximately 4381 K.

Now, the photospheric regions have T=6000 K (60% of surface) and T=4381 K (40% of surface).

So the total number of atoms in each level is the sum from each region.

Assume that the number of Ti atoms in each region is proportional to the area (since each region is at a certain T).

So, for each region, the ratio N1/N2 is given by the Boltzmann factor for that region.

The total N1 and N2 would be:

N1_total = f * N1_unspotted + (1-f) * N1_spotted.

Similarly, N2_total = f * N2_unspotted + (1-f) * N2_spotted.

But the ratio N1_total / N2_total would be a weighted average, which complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the observed ratio is the average of the ratios from each region.

Wait, but the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so each region is in LTE, but the overall ratio is a weighted average, perhaps.

Alternatively, the line formation is happening in the photosphere, which is a mix of regions at different temperatures. So the equivalent width or the line strength depends on the sum of the contributions from each region.

But the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels. So perhaps each region contributes its own N1 and N2, and the total ratio is a combination.

Let me proceed. Let me compute the ratio N1/N2 for each region, then compute the overall ratio.

In the unspotted region (T=6000 K):

N1_unspotted / N2_unspotted = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k * 6000)).

In the spotted region (T=4381 K):

N1_spotted / N2_spotted = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k * 4381)).

The total N1_total and N2_total would be the sum of contributions from both regions.

But wait, the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But we're considering the photosphere as a combination of two temperatures. So perhaps the observed ratio is a combination of the two ratios, weighted by the area.

So:

N1_total = f * N1_unspotted + (1-f) * N1_spotted.

N2_total = f * N2_unspotted + (1-f) * N2_spotted.

The overall ratio R = N1_total / N2_total.

But since each region has its own N1/N2 ratio, this could be complicated.

Let me denote:

R_unspotted = N1_unspotted / N2_unspotted = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k * 6000)).

R_spotted = N1_spotted / N2_spotted = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k *4381)).

Assume that in each region, the number of Ti atoms is proportional to the area (since each region has the same pressure and gravity, perhaps). So the number of Ti atoms in each region is proportional to the area, which is f and (1-f).

So, N1_unspotted = f * N1_unspotted_per_area * area.

N2_unspotted = f * N2_unspotted_per_area * area.

Similarly for the spotted region.

But since the ratio R_unspotted is N1_unspotted / N2_unspotted, which is R_unspotted = (f term) / (f term), the f cancels out. So N1_unspotted = f * x, N2_unspotted = f * y. The ratio x/y is R_unspotted.

Similarly, N1_spotted = (1-f) * a, N2_spotted = (1-f) * b. Ratio a/b is R_spotted.

So the total N1 = f x + (1-f) a.

Total N2 = f y + (1-f) b.

So the overall ratio R_total = [f x + (1-f) a ] / [f y + (1-f) b ].

But x/y = R_unspotted, so x = R_unspotted * y.

Similarly, a = R_spotted * b.

So,

N1_total = f R_unspotted y + (1-f) R_spotted b.

N2_total = f y + (1-f) b.

Factor out y and b:

N1_total = y [ f R_unspotted ] + b [ (1-f) R_spotted ]

N2_total = y [ f ] + b [ (1-f) ]

But without knowing the relation between y and b, this becomes tricky. Unless we assume that y = b, which would imply that the number of Ti atoms per unit area is the same in both regions, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the majority of the Ti is in the unspotted regions, but this complicates things.

This is getting too involved, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the ratio of the two temperatures and the exponential factor.

Given that, let me compute the ratio (N1/N2)_no_spot / (N1/N2)_spot.

Which is exp(ΔE/(k T_no_spot) ) / exp(ΔE/(k T_spot) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_no_spot - 1/T_spot) )

Because (N1/N2) is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T) ), so the ratio is the exponent of the difference.

So:

ΔE = 8.56 eV.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

T_no_spot = 6000 K.

T_spot = 5500 K.

Compute 1/T_no_spot = 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1.

1/T_spot = 1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4 K^-1.

Δ(1/T) = 1.8182e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1515e-4 K^-1.

So,

ΔE/(k) * Δ(1/T) = (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * 0.1515e-4 K^-1.

Compute step by step:

First compute (8.56) / (8.617e-5) = approx 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99323 K.

Multiply by 0.1515e-4:

99323 * 0.1515e-4 = 99323 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 99323 * 0.00001515 ≈ 1.505.

So the exponent is approximately 1.505.

So the ratio is exp(1.505) ≈ 4.5.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5.

So when the star has no spots, the ratio is 4.5 times higher than when it has spots.

But wait, the problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So (no spots) / (spots) = 4.5.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher by a factor of ~4.5. So the answer would be option C) ~4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Energy Difference (\( \Delta E \)):**  
   The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Temperatures:**  
   - Without spots: \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - With spots: \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \).

3. **Boltzmann Factor Difference:**  
   The ratio of the populations changes by a factor given by:  
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}}\right)\right).
   \]  
   Substituting \( \Delta E = 8.56 \, \text{eV} \), \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \), \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.6667 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.8182 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]  
   \[
   \Delta\left(\frac{1}{T}\right) = 1.8182 \times 10^{-4} - 1.6667 \times 10^{-4} = 0.1515 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99323 \, \text{K}.
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \Delta\left(\frac{1}{T}\right) = 99323 \cdot 0.1515 \times 10^{-4} \approx 1.505.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) is higher when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots by a factor of approximately **4.5**.
