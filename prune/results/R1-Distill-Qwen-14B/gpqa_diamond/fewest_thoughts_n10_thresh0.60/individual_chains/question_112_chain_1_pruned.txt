Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator A, and the average value of that operator. The operator A has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving two probabilities and an average value.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha>. Because the coefficients are given, but the state is said to be proportional to that. So, the actual state would be (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> divided by a normalization factor.

So, normalization. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient. Let's compute each coefficient's magnitude.

The first coefficient is (1+i). The magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2).

The second coefficient is (2−i). The magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5).

So the normalization factor N is sqrt( (sqrt(2))² + (sqrt(5))² ) = sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Because when you have a state a|up> + b|down>, the normalization is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. So, the given state is proportional, so we compute the norm as |1+i|^2 + |2−i|^2.

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. |2−i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2=4+1=5. So total is 2+5=7. So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> all over sqrt(7).

So the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> divided by sqrt(7).

Now, the operator A has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So, in a two-level system, the matrix is:

A = [ [ 0, hbar/2 ],
      [ hbar/2, 0 ] ]

Wait, that's for a 2x2 matrix. Because when i≠j, A is hbar/2, else zero. So it's a matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, but the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of this matrix. So I need to find the eigenvalues and their corresponding states, and then compute the probabilities.

Wait, but if I'm measuring the operator A, then the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of A. So I need to find the eigenvalues of A, and then find the probability that the state |alpha> is in each eigenstate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenstates of the operator A, express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates, and then the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

But perhaps another approach is to note that A is a Hermitian matrix because all the diagonal elements are real and the off-diagonal elements are equal (since it's symmetric). So A is Hermitian, which makes sense because it's an observable.

So, to find the eigenvalues of A. Let's compute the characteristic equation. The matrix is 2x2:

A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2,
