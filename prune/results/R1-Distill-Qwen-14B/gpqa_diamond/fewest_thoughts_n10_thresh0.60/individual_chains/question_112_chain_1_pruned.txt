Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question involves an electron state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2−i)|down⟩. |up⟩ and |down⟩ are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation is given by A_ij. Specifically, A_ij is ℏ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I have to calculate the average value of that operator. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I need to normalize the state |α⟩ because it's only given as proportional. Then, I should find the eigenstates of the operator A. Once I have those, I can compute the probabilities of measuring the electron in each eigenstate. And then compute the expectation value.

Wait, but wait. The operator A's matrix is such that the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ℏ/2. So the matrix is a 2x2 since it's spin-1/2. Let me write that matrix out:

A = [ [0, ℏ/2],
      [ℏ/2, 0] ]

Hmm, yes, because for a 2x2 matrix, the elements where i≠j are on the off-diagonal. So A is [[0, ℏ/2],[ℏ/2, 0]].

Wait, but wait, operator A is given as having elements A_ij = ℏ/2 when i ≠ j, else zero. So the matrix is actually zero on the diagonal and ℏ/2 elsewhere. So that's correct.

Wait, but actually, for a 2x2 matrix, when i≠j, that's the (1,2) and (2,1) positions. So the matrix is indeed:

0   ℏ/2
ℏ/2  0

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. Because the eigenstates of A will determine the possible outcomes when measuring the operator.

So, to find the eigenvalues of A
