Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The problem is asking about the minimum resolution needed in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what do I know about decay processes and detection? Oh right, when a particle decays, the particles it produces will move away, and the distance they travel before being detected depends on their speed and the lifetime of the original particle. But wait, if the original particle is moving, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So the distance they travel is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime, c times that.

So, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle. The velocity can be found using the energy. Oh wait, energy is given as 27 GeV. The mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. So I can find the gamma factor using the energy formula.

Energy E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). Wait, but in units where c=1, energy in GeV and mass in GeV/c², so E is in GeV, so γ = E/m. So γ is 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ let's calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41, that's about 7.918, so approximately 7.92.

So γ is about 7.92. Then the lifetime τ is γ τ₀. So τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.92 *8 = 63.36, so 63.36e-16 s. That's 6.336e-15 seconds.

Wait, but what's the significance of this? The particles Y⁺ and Z⁻ will travel a certain distance before decaying. For the chamber to detect them, the distance they move should be longer than the chamber's resolution. Or maybe it's about the minimum distance they have to move for us to see them.

Wait, no, I think the problem is about the minimum distance that the decay products have to travel so that the chamber can resolve them. So the particles will move a distance L = c * τ * beta, where beta is v/c. Wait, but wait, the lifetime is τ, so the time is τ, and then the distance is v * τ = beta c * τ. Which is beta c gamma τ₀.

So L = beta c gamma τ₀. But gamma is E/(m c²), but since c=1 in these units, it's just E/m. So gamma is 27/3.41 ~7.92. So beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Hmm, since gamma is large, beta is approximately 1. So perhaps we can approximate beta as 1 for simplicity, unless gamma isn't that large. Wait, gamma is around 7.92. So 1/gamma² is about 1/62.7, so 0.016. So sqrt(1 - 0.016) is sqrt(0.984) which is approximately 0.992. So beta is about 0.992. Close enough to 1, so maybe we can approximate beta as 1 for this calculation.

So L ≈ c * gamma * τ₀. Let's compute that.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

gamma τ₀ is 7.92 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.336e-15 s.

So L ≈ 3e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s = 3*6.336e-7 m. Let's calculate that: 3*6.336 is about 19.008, so 19.008e-7 m which is 1.9008e-6 meters, or 1.9008 micrometers.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh! Because if the particles don't travel far enough, we can't see them. So the detection requires that the particles have traveled a distance L that the chamber can resolve. So the fraction observed would depend on the probability that L is greater than the chamber's resolution.

Wait, but more accurately, the number of decays observed is proportional to the probability that the decay occurs within the observed path. Wait, no, actually, the decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So, the decay probability is given by 1 - e^{-t/τ}, but in this case, the decay occurs once, so we're dealing with the decay length.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The proper lifetime is τ₀, and in the lab frame, it's τ = γ τ₀. The mean distance the particle travels before decaying is L = c * τ * beta. So the average decay length is L_avg = c * beta gamma tau_0.

Wait, so for a particle moving at speed v, the average distance before decay is L = beta c gamma tau_0. So in our case, beta is about 0.992, so L is approximately 0.992 * c * gamma tau_0.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, I think that refers to the minimum distance that the decay products must travel so that the chamber can detect them. So, if the decay length is longer than the chamber's resolution, then you can see it. But wait, actually, if the decay length is shorter than the resolution, you can't distinguish the decay vertex, perhaps.

Wait, no. The problem is about the minimum resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So perhaps the resolution is the distance that must be covered so that the probability of the decay occurring beyond that is 30%. So the probability P that the decay occurs beyond a certain distance L is given by the exponential decay law.

The decay probability is 1 - e^{-L/(L_avg)}, where L_avg is the mean decay length. So if P is 30%, then:

0.3 = 1 - e^{-L/(L_avg)}
e^{-L/(L_avg)} = 0.7
-L/(L_avg) = ln(0.7)
L = - L_avg ln(0.7)

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The probability that the decay occurs after a certain time (or distance) is P = e^{-t/tau} for a decay process. But in terms of distance, t = L/(v), so P = e^{-L/(v tau)}.

Wait, but v is beta c. So, P = e^{- L/(beta c tau)}.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, the mean decay length is L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0. So the probability that a decay occurs beyond a certain distance L is P = e^{-L/(L_avg)}.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The probability that a decay happens after a distance L is the same as the probability that the lifetime is longer than L/(beta c), because L = beta c t => t = L/(beta c). So the probability is P = e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)} }.

Wait, because tau is gamma tau_0. So t = L/(beta c) = [L/(beta c)].

So P = e^{- t/(tau)} = e^{- (L/(beta c)) / (gamma tau_0)} }.

But gamma tau_0 is tau, so substituting, we have:

P = e^{- (L) / (beta c gamma tau_0) }.

But L_avg is beta c gamma tau_0, so P = e^{- L / L_avg }.

So for P = 0.3 (30% probability, meaning you observe 30% of the cases), then:

0.3 = e^{- L / L_avg }

Taking natural logs on both sides:

ln(0.3) = - L / L_avg

=> L = - L_avg * ln(0.3)

What's ln(0.3)? Hmm, ln(1/3.333) ≈ ln(0.3) ≈-1.2039.

So L = L_avg * 1.2039.

So L_min is approximately 1.2039 times L_avg.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the problem states that the chamber needs to have a minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So the resolution is the distance that the decay products must travel beyond which we can detect them. So the requirement is that the decay occurs beyond this resolution distance, so the probability that L > resolution R is 30%.

So the probability P is 30% that L > R. So P = 0.3 = e^{- R / L_avg }

Wait, no, because P = e^{- R / L_avg }, so solving for R when P=0.3.

Wait, let me see. The probability that the decay occurs beyond distance R is 0.3. So:

0.3 = e^{- R / L_avg }

Take natural log:

ln(0.3) = - R / L_avg

=> R = - L_avg * ln(0.3) = L_avg * (ln(1/0.3)) ) = L_avg * ln(10/3) ≈ L_avg * 1.2039.

So R is about 1.2039 times L_avg.

Wait, but earlier I thought that L_avg is about 1.9e-6 meters. So R would be approximately 1.204 * 1.9e-6 m, which is about 2.287e-6 m.

Wait, but let me compute L_avg more accurately.

Earlier I approximated beta as 1, but let's be more precise.

Gamma is 27 / 3.41 = approximately 7.918. So gamma =7.918.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Compute 1/gamma^2: (1/7.918)^2 ≈ 1/(62.7) ≈ 0.01596.

So sqrt(1 - 0.01596) = sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.9920.

So beta is approximately 0.992.

So L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0.

Let's compute gamma tau_0 first.

Gamma tau_0 =7.918 *8e-16 s = 6.3344e-15 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L_avg = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.3344e-15 s.

Let me compute that:

3e8 *6.3344e-15 = 1.90032e-6 meters.

Multiply by 0.992: 1.90032e-6 *0.992 ≈ 1.886e-6 m.

So L_avg is about 1.886e-6 m.

Then R = L_avg * 1.2039 ≈ 1.886e-6 *1.2039 ≈ 2.27e-6 m.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, but why is that? Because maybe I made an approximation somewhere. Let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV.

Gamma = E/(m c²) = 27 / 3.41 = let me compute that more precisely.

3.41 *7 = 23.87. 27 -23.87=3.13. So 3.13/3.41 ≈ 0.917. So gamma is 7.917 approx.

Alternatively, 3.41 *7 =23.87. 3.41 *7.917 = 3.41 *7 + 3.41 *0.917.

3.41 *0.917: 3 *0.917=2.751, 0.41 *0.917≈0.376. So total 3.127. So 23.87 +3.127=26.997, which is approximately 27. So yes, gamma is about 7.917.

Now, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)=sqrt(1 - 1/(7.917)^2).

Compute 7.917^2: approximately 62.68.

So 1/62.68 ≈0.01596.

So 1-0.01596=0.98404. sqrt(0.98404)=approx 0.9920.

So beta is 0.992.

So L_avg is beta * c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, c tau_0 is 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s = 24e-8 m = 2.4e-7 m.

Gamma is 7.917, so gamma * c tau_0 = 2.4e-7 *7.917 ≈1.899e-6 m.

Then, multiply by beta (0.992): 1.899e-6 *0.992 ≈1.882e-6 m.

So L_avg is approximately 1.882e-6 m.

Wait, but earlier I said R is about 1.2039 * L_avg, which would be 1.882e-6 *1.2039 ≈ 2.266e-6 m.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, this is lower than my calculation. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should instead calculate the minimum resolution R such that the probability of the decay occurring beyond R is 30%. So P = 0.3 = e^{- R/(L_avg)}.

Wait, earlier I thought that the probability that the decay occurs beyond R is 0.3, so 0.3 = e^{-R/(L_avg)}, so R = - L_avg ln(0.3) ≈ L_avg * 1.2039.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of the minimum distance that 30% of the decays are observed. That would mean that 30% of the decays have L > R, so 70% have L ≤ R. So the cumulative distribution function is P(L ≤ R) = 0.7, so P(L > R) =0.3.

So, R is the 70th percentile of the decay length.

Wait, but in exponential distribution, the probability that L > R is e^{-R/(L_avg)}. So, e^{-R/(L_avg)} = 0.3 → R = - L_avg ln(0.3) ≈ 1.2039 L_avg.

So using L_avg as 1.882e-6 m, R would be 1.2039 *1.882e-6 ≈ 2.266e-6 m. But none of the options match that exactly.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 microns.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the calculation steps for any errors.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is simply asking for the decay length L, without considering the 30% probability, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question states: "What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?"

So the resolution refers to the detection threshold. If the decay occurs within a certain distance, the chamber can't resolve it. So the minimum resolution R is the threshold where 30% of the decays are beyond R, meaning we can detect them. So R must be such that the probability of decays beyond R is 0.3.

So, using the same calculation: R = L_avg * ln(1/(1-0.3)) = L_avg * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L_avg * 0.3567.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. The probability that the decay occurs beyond R is 0.3, so P = 0.3 = e^{-R/(L_avg)}.

So, taking natural logs: ln(0.3) = -R/(L_avg).

So R = - L_avg ln(0.3) ≈ L_avg * 1.2039.

Wait, no, because ln(0.3) is -1.2039, so R = L_avg * 1.2039.

So with L_avg =1.882e-6 m, R=1.882e-6 *1.2039≈2.266e-6 m.

But the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 2.08e-6 m.

B) 2.08e-9 m.

C) 2.08e-1 m.

D) 2.08e-3 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L_avg.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the decay length is L = c * beta * gamma tau_0.

So let's compute that. Let's compute the exact values.

Given:

E =27 GeV,

m =3.41 GeV/c²,

tau_0=8e-16 s.

Compute gamma = E/(m c²) =27/(3.41) = approx7.91795.

Compute beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 )= sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2)= sqrt(1 -0.01594)=sqrt(0.98406)=approx 0.99201.

So beta is 0.99201.

Compute L = c * beta * gamma * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s,

gamma=7.91795,

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So:

L =3e8 *0.99201 *7.91795 *8e-16.

Compute step by step.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7.

Multiply by 7.91795: 2.4e-7 *7.91795 ≈1.9003e-6.

Multiply by 0.99201: 1.9003e-6 *0.99201 ≈1.883e-6 m.

So L_avg =1.883e-6 meters.

Now, the minimum resolution R is such that P(L > R) = 0.3.

So R = L_avg * (-ln(1-0.3)) = L_avg * ln(1/0.7) ≈1.883e-6 * 0.35667 ≈ 0.671e-6 m.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, R is the value such that the probability of decay beyond R is 0.3.

So P(L > R) =0.3 → R= - L_avg ln(0.3) = L_avg * ln(10/3) ≈ L_avg * 1.2039.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought it was 1.2039, but now I'm getting confused. Let me recheck.

The exponential distribution says that the probability that the decay occurs beyond R is P = e^{-R/(L_avg)}.

So, for P=0.3:

0.3= e^{-R/(L_avg)}.

Taking natural log:

ln(0.3) = - R/(L_avg).

So R = - L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ L_avg * 1.2039.

So R=1.883e-6 *1.2039 ≈2.266e-6 m.

But none of the options match this. The closest is option A: 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma or beta.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

E=27 GeV,

m =3.41 GeV/c²,

gamma=E/(m c²) =27/3.41 =7.91795.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is expecting a different approach. Maybe using the speed instead of beta.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the resolution needed is the average decay length L_avg, because if the chamber can resolve up to that length, then on average, 37% of the decays are observed beyond that (since e^{-1} ≈0.3679, so 63% are before L_avg, 37% after. But we need at least 30%, which is less than 37%, so perhaps the minimum resolution is lower than L_avg.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30%, meaning that 30% of the decays must have a path longer than R. So R must be chosen such that P(L> R)=0.3.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for R where P(L> R)=0.3.

Which is R= L_avg * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L_avg * 0.3567.

Wait, no, because ln(1/0.7)= ln(10/7)≈0.3567.

Wait, no, wait, because:

P(L> R) = e^{- R/(L_avg)} =0.3.

So, R= L_avg * ln(1/0.3) ≈L_avg *1.2039.

Wait, no, because ln(1/0.3)= ln(10/3)=1.2039.

So R= 1.2039 * L_avg.

So 1.2039 * 1.883e-6 m= 2.266e-6 m.

Hmm, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing L_avg.

Wait, perhaps I should compute L_avg more accurately.

Let me recalculate L_avg.

L_avg = beta * c * gamma * tau_0.

beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)) = sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)).

Compute 3.41^2=11.6281.

27^2=729.

So 11.6281/729≈0.01596.

So 1 - 0.01596 =0.98404.

sqrt(0.98404)=0.99201.

So beta=0.99201.

gamma=27/3.41=7.91795.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L_avg=0.99201 *3e8 *7.91795 *8e-16.

Let me compute each part:

0.99201 *3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

2.976e8 *7.91795 ≈ 2.976e8 *7.91795 ≈ let's compute 2.976 *7.91795 ≈ 23.595. So 23.595e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Wait, no, wait: 3e8 *7.91795 is 2.375385e9 m/s.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.

3e8 m/s *7.91795= 2.375385e9 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.375385e9 *8e-16 = 1.900308e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.99201: 1.900308e-6 *0.99201≈1.883e-6 m.

So L_avg=1.883e-6 m.

So R=1.2039 * L_avg=1.2039 *1.883e-6= approx 2.266e-6 m.

Hmm, none of the options match that. Closest is option A:2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation is wrong. Let me try another approach.

Another approach: the average decay length is L_avg= c * beta * gamma tau_0.

But perhaps the calculation is expecting to ignore the beta, or to calculate it differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply using gamma * tau_0, without beta.

Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense because L is v * t. So if you don't include beta, you're missing a factor of beta.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed as c, which is an approximation, but that still doesn't change the outcome much.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to have at least 30% of the decays observed, which would be the case when the resolution is set to the point where 30% of decays are beyond that. So, R = L_avg * ln(1/(1-0.3)) = L_avg * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L_avg *0.3567.

Wait, but that would be R=1.883e-6 *0.3567≈ 6.70e-7 m. Which is 0.67 microns. But that doesn't match any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the mean lifetime, not considering gamma. But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the decay length. Let me think again.

The proper lifetime is tau_0. The lab frame lifetime is tau=gamma tau_0.

The average path length is L_avg= beta c tau.

So L_avg=beta c gamma tau_0.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking about the minimum velocity, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward: calculate the decay length L_avg, and the minimum resolution is just that.

But if the required observation is 30%, why is the answer about 2 microns when the options don't have that?

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the numbers more exactly.

Wait, let's compute gamma more accurately.

E=27 GeV,

m=3.41 GeV/c².

gamma = E/(m c²) =27 /3.41 =7.91795.

So gamma is 7.91795.

Now, beta= sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

m²= (3.41)^2=11.6281.

E²=27^2=729.

m²/E²=11.6281/729≈0.01596.

So 1 - 0.01596=0.98404.

sqrt(0.98404)=0.99201.

So beta=0.99201.

So L_avg= beta c gamma tau_0.

beta=0.99201,

c=3e8 m/s,

gamma=7.91795,

tau_0=8e-16 s.

Compute:

beta*c=0.99201 *3e8 = 2.97603e8 m/s.

gamma * tau_0=7.91795 *8e-16=6.33436e-15 s.

Multiply those: 2.97603e8 m/s *6.33436e-15 s = 2.97603 *6.33436e-7.

2.97603 *6.33436≈18.914.

So 18.914e-7 m=1.8914e-6 m.

So L_avg=1.8914e-6 m.

So, R=1.2039 *1.8914e-6≈2.276e-6 m.

Hmm, but none of the options match that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m. Let's see what R would have to be for R = L_avg * 1.1. 1.89e-6 *1.1 = 2.079e-6, which is option A.

Ah, perhaps the mistake is that the calculation assumes that the minimum resolution is when 30% of the decays are observed, which would require a higher R than L_avg, but I'm not getting the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the 30% part and is asking for the average decay length, which would be option A, 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, but how does 2.08e-6 come from our calculation?

Wait, let me compute 27 GeV divided by 3.41 GeV. 27 /3.41 is approximately 7.918.

7.918 *8e-16=6.334e-15 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So L=3e8 *6.334e-15=1.9002e-6 m.

Wait, so without considering beta, that's about 1.9e-6 m. Option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is in including beta, but perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic velocity as v= c, ignoring beta. So L= c * gamma tau_0.

Which would be 3e8 *7.918 *8e-16=3e8 *6.334e-15=1.900e-6 m.

But that's without beta, but beta is about 0.992, so L=0.992 *1.9e-6≈1.88e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not considering the 30% part, and just asks for the average decay length, but that's not what the question says.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute L_avg without worrying about the 30% part.

But the question is specifically about observing at least 30% of the decays, so that requires the 30% calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what each option represents.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m which is about 2 microns.

Option B is 2.08e-9 m, which is about 2 nanometers.

Option C is 20 cm, which is way too big.

Option D is 2.08 mm, which is 2.08e-3 m.

Well, in a bubble chamber, the resolution is typically on the order of micrometers, so option A makes sense.

But according to the calculations, the correct R is about 2.27e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, 27 divided by 3.41 is exactly?

Let me compute 3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41= approx 0.917.

So 7.917.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.41 ×7.917 = ?

3.41 ×7=23.87.

3.41 ×0.917= let's compute:

3.41 ×0.9 =3.069.

3.41 ×0.017≈0.05797.

Total 3.069 +0.05797=3.12697.

So 23.87 +3.12697=26.99697, which is about 27 GeV.

So gamma=7.917.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute L_avg again:

L_avg=beta * c * gamma * tau_0.

beta=0.99201,

c=3e8 m/s,

gamma=7.917,

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So:

beta*c=0.99201 *3e8=2.97603e8 m/s.

gamma*tau_0=7.917 *8e-16=6.3336e-15 s.

Multiply those: 2.97603e8 *6.3336e-15= (2.97603 *6.3336) *1e-7.

2.97603 *6.3336 ≈ let's compute:

2 *6=12,

2 *0.3336=0.6672,

0.97603 *6=5.856,

0.97603 *0.3336≈0.3256.

So adding all:

12 +0.6672=12.6672,

+5.856=18.5232,

+0.3256=18.8488.

So approximately 18.8488e-7 m=1.88488e-6 m.

So L_avg=1.88488e-6 m.

Now, R= - L_avg * ln(0.7) =1.88488e-6 *0.35667≈0.670e-6 m.

Wait, wait, no. Because R= L_avg * (- ln(0.3))= L_avg *1.2039.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the probabilities again.

Let me clarify: The equation is R= L_avg * ln(1/0.7)= L_avg *0.3567.

Wait, no, because P(L> R)=0.3 → e^{- R/(L_avg)}=0.3 → R= L_avg * ln(1/0.3)=1.2039 * L_avg.

So R=1.2039 *1.88488e-6≈2.268e-6 m.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the question is asking for the average decay length, not considering the 30% part.

In that case, the average decay length is ~1.88e-6 m, which option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not requiring the 30% consideration, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the natural logs.

Wait, ln(0.3) is approximately -1.2039.

So R= - L_avg * ln(0.3) = L_avg *1.2039.

1.88e-6 m * 1.2039≈2.26e-6 m.

But the options don't have that.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe the minimum resolution is such that the mean path length is at least 30% of the maximum path.

No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the proper lifetime.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the velocity as beta * c, but without gamma.

No, that can't be, because the lifetime is longer due to gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should rethink the entire approach.

Another approach: the proper lifetime is tau_0=8e-16 s.

In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0.

The distance the particle travels is v*tau=beta c * gamma tau_0.

So, L= beta c gamma tau_0.

Now, the resolution R must be such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So the fraction observed is 30%, meaning that 70% are not observed. So the probability that L < R is 70%, and P(L> R)=30%.

So, the equation is 0.3= e^{- R/(L_avg)}.

Solving for R: R= - L_avg * ln(0.3) ≈ L_avg *1.2039.

So, R= L_avg *1.2039.

So, with L_avg=1.88e-6 m, R=2.26e-6 m.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the energy is 27 GeV per particle, but perhaps I should use the total energy.

Wait, probably not, because the energy given is the energy of the X⁰ particle.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to detect any decay, not considering the 30% part. So L_avg is the average decay length, which is 1.88e-6 m. The closest option is A, 2.08e-6 m.

But that's about 10% higher, which could be due to rounding.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done with gamma as 7.918, and L_avg=1.88e-6 m, but the actual correct option is A.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option A:2.08e-6 m.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of $X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^-$ in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process and its implications for the distance traveled by the decay products. The proper lifetime of $X^0$ is $\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s}$, and the energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame is $E = 27 \, \text{GeV}$, with its mass $m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2$. The speed of light is $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Relativistic Factors**:
   - The Lorentz factor $\gamma$ is calculated as:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.918
     \]
   - The velocity factor $\beta$ is:
     \[
     \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{7.918^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.01596} \approx 0.992
     \]

2. **Mean Decay Length**:
   - The mean decay length $L_{\text{avg}}$ is given by:
     \[
     L_{\text{avg}} = \beta c \gamma \tau_0
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     L_{\text{avg}} = 0.992 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot 7.918 \cdot (8 \times 10^{-16})
     \]
     Breaking it down:
     \[
     \beta c = 0.992 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.976 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
     \]
     \[
     \gamma \tau_0 = 7.918 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
     \]
     \[
     L_{\text{avg}} = (2.976 \times 10^8) \cdot (6.334 \times 10^{-15}) \approx 1.891 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
     \]

3. **Minimum Resolution**:
   - To observe at least 30% of the decays, the resolution $R$ must satisfy:
     \[
     P(L > R) = 0.3 = e^{-R / L_{\text{avg}}}
     \]
     Solving for $R$:
     \[
     R = -L_{\text{avg}} \ln(0.3) \approx L_{\text{avg}} \cdot 1.2039
     \]
     Substituting $L_{\text{avg}} \approx 1.891 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}$:
     \[
     R \approx 1.891 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 1.2039 \approx 2.276 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated $R \approx 2.276 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}$ does not match any option exactly. However, the closest option is **A) $2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}$**, which is within 10% of the computed value. This discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is best approximated by **A) $2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}$**.
