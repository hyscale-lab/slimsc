Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts by talking about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, so X is probably a compound made of elements which have isotopes. One of them is using a heavier isotope. 

Then, when X reacts violently with liquid Y, it releases a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of neutrons and protons? That suggests that the molecule is something like H2O or something else where each molecule has equal numbers of n and p. Or maybe it's a molecule where each atom has equal n and p. Oh wait, noâ€”because the whole molecule. Let me think: for example, O2 has 8 protons each, 8 neutrons each. So each O has 8n and 8p, but the molecule would have 16 p and 16 n? No, wait, that's for each molecule. Hmm, maybe CO2? No, wait, that's 1 C (6 p, 6 n) and 2 O (8 each). Wait, but each molecule would have a total of (6+16) p and (6+16) n? That might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is CH4? No, that's 6 p, 6 n for C, and 4 H each with 1 p and 0 n. So the molecule would have 6+4=10 p and 6+0=6 n. Not equal.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like CO. Let's see: C has 6 p, maybe 6 n (if it's the lighter isotope), O has 8 p and 8 n. So CO would have 14 p (6+8) and 14 n (6+8). Oh! So the molecule would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. So gas W is likely CO. Or perhaps another molecule where the total p and n are equal.

Another possibility is H2O. Let's see: H2O has 2 H (each 1p, 0n) and 1 O (8p, 8n). So total protons are 2 +8 =10,
