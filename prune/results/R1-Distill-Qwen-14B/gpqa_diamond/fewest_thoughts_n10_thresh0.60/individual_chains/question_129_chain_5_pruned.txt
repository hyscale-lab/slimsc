Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the reaction steps and the given information.

The problem goes like this: Starting with compound A, it reacts with HCN to form B. Then B is reduced with H2 and Pd to become C. Next, C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and finally, D loses an inert gas to form E. The options are various cycloketones, so E must be a cyclic ketone. 

Looking at the hints, hint a) says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, that structure sounds like a cyclopentane ring with substituents. Let me visualize it. The propan-2-ylidene group is a CH2-C(CH3)2 group attached as a substituent. So maybe A is a dienophile in some Diels-Alder reaction, but more likely, since it's reacting with a ylide, it's a Michael addition or some kind of 1,2-addition.

But wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So if A reacts with a ylide to form that cyclopentane compound, A must be a carbonyl compound. Because in a Wittig, the ylide attacks the carbonyl, so A would be a ketone or aldehyde.

Looking at the product structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene group is a CH2-C(CH3)= group, or perhaps it's a substituent attached via a double bond. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH₂-C(CH₃)=, no, wait, I think the propan-2-ylidene group is actually a substituent where the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure would have a cyclopentane ring with two methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and at position 4, there's a substituent which is a group like (
