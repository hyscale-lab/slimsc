Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO and HIRES. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. Let me try to break this down.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different properties. I need to figure out which ones are observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. The key points from the question are about the apparent V magnitude each telescope can handle. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, which I think means anything with V magnitude less than or equal to 17. HIRES can go down to 16 mag, so it can see brighter (lower magnitude) stars than ESPRESSO.

Wait, no, wait. Magnitude scales are a bit confusing. Oh right, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So if a telescope can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, that's apparent magnitude less than 17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17, and thus more likely to be detectable.

So, for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction (dust absorption) if given. Because some stars have E(B-V) values, which affect their observed magnitudes.

ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag ≤17. HIRES can observe stars with apparent V mag ≤16. So a star must have apparent V mag ≤16 to be seen by both. Because if a star is brighter than 17 (like 16.5), ESPRESSO can see it. But for both, the star must be within the limit of both, so for HIRES, the limit is stricter (brighter than 16 mag, i.e., V ≤16).

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The question says: With ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. So V <17. With HIRES, V <16. So the overlapping range is V <16. So any star that's V ≤16 can be observed by both. So I need to find which stars have apparent V magnitude ≤16 after correcting for extinction.

Each star: Let's go one by one.
