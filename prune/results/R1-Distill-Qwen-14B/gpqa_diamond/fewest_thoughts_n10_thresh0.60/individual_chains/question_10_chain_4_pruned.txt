Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D, each corresponding to one of the options.

Let me read the options again:

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So this planet has the same mass and radius as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? Because Earth is made of rock and metal. So this planet's density should be the same as Earth's.

b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, so they're giving the density directly here. So this planet's density is 5.5. Hmm, same as Earth. But wait, mass is 2 Earth masses. But wait, the density is given, so maybe the density is a factor here.

c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Okay, so same composition as Earth. Since composition affects density, same composition would mean same density, I think. Because density depends on the materials. So Earth's density is about 5.5, so if this planet has the same materials, same density. But wait, mass is 5 times higher. So how does that affect density? Let me think. Let me think about how mass and radius relate to density.

Density is mass divided by volume. Volume depends on radius cubed. So if the mass increases but the radius also increases, the density might stay the same or change.

Wait, this planet has the same composition as Earth. So I think that implies that its average density is the same as Earth's. Because composition dictates the density. So regardless of the mass, if the composition is same, then the density is same as Earth's, which is 5.5. But wait, the mass is 5 times Earth's. So how does that affect the radius? Let's think.

If the mass increases by a factor of 5, assuming the same density, the radius would scale with cube root of (mass / density). Wait, the formula for density is ρ = M/V, so V = M/(ρ). Volume is (4/3)πr³, so r³ = 3M/(4πρ). So
