Okay, so I have this question about a drug's effect on mitochondria and which experiment wouldn't help determine that. Let me think through each option.

The question says that the drug is new and being tested on HEK293 cells, which are a common cell line. The goal is to find out if the drug affects mitochondria. The setup involves various experiments, and I need to pick the one that won't help discover the mitochondrial role.

First, I'll go through each option one by one to understand what each experiment does.

Option A: Differential centrifugation to extract mitochondria followed by a Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay. Differential centrifugation is a standard method to isolate mitochondria. Once you have pure mitochondria, using a glucose uptake assay would measure how well they're taking up glucose. If the drug affects mitochondria, maybe it would alter their ability to metabolize glucose. So this experiment would show if the drug affects mitochondrial function, specifically in glucose uptake. That makes sense as a relevant experiment, so it's probably not the answer.

Option B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and luminometer after adding luciferin. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Recombinant luciferase is an enzyme used in reporter assays. But in this context, maybe they're using it to measure something else. Alternatively, perhaps this is about measuring ATP levels because luciferase uses ATP to emit light. So if the drug affects ATP production in mitochondria, this assay would show a change in luminescence. So this would help determine mitochondrial function, as mitochondria are the main source of ATP. So this experiment is relevant and wouldn't be the one that doesn't help.

Option C: Flow cytometry with 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me think. Oh, wait, that's JC-1 dye. JC-1 is a mitochondrial membrane potential probe. It intercalates into the mitochondrial DNA and changes its fluorescence based on membrane potential. When the mitochondria are healthy, the dye accumulates and emits a red fluorescence. If the membrane potential is lost (like in damaged mitochondria), it emits green. So flow cytometry can measure this. So this experiment would show if the drug affects mitochondrial membrane potential, which is a key function. So this is
