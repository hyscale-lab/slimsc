Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the decay channels of a boson X. The problem gives the Lagrangian interaction term between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ_f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I might have misread that. Oh right, perhaps it's L(y) = - λ f ψ̄ f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)? Hmm, maybe I should parse it more carefully. Oh, wait, perhaps the term is written as L(y) = -λ ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), where λ is a coupling constant, and f represents the fermion type. So, this interaction term would imply that the boson X couples to fermions through Yukawa interactions. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. The options are various combinations of fermion-antifermion pairs.

So first, I need to figure out which fermions can be produced when X decays. Because X is a boson, when it decays, it must produce a pair of particles, like a fermion and its antiparticle. But the key here is the mass of X and the masses of the fermions involved.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, any fermion pair that X can decay into must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Wait, no, actually, the sum of the masses of the fermion and antifermion must be less than the mass of X because the decay products must be real particles, not virtual. So each possible decay X → f f̄ must satisfy 2 m_f ≤ m_X, because each f has mass m_f. So each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV, since 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but fermion masses are usually given
