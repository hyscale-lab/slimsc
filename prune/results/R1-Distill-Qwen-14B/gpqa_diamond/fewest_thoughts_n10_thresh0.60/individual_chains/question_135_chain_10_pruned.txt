Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction terms in the theory. So, this term looks like it's the Yukawa interaction because it's similar to how fermions interact with a scalar field. In the Standard Model, the Yukawa coupling is what gives mass to fermions through their interaction with the Higgs field. So, I guess here, X is a boson similar to the Higgs, and the interaction is Yukawa-like.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So, I need to find out what particles it can decay into at the lowest order. The options are different combinations of fermion-antifermion pairs.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the energy of the fermion pair must be less than the mass of the boson. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the total energy in the decay products is less than the rest mass energy of the parent particle. So, the mass of the boson must be greater than twice the mass of the fermion because each fermion (and its antiparticle) would take some energy.

Wait, so for a decay X → f f̄, the condition is m_X > 2 m_f. So, I need to find all fermions where 2 times their mass is less than 6 GeV. Also, since the interaction is Yukawa-like, X can only decay into fermions that it couples to. The problem gives the interaction term involving ψ_f, so X couples to all fermions ψ_f. But wait, in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to all fermions, but maybe here the coupling is only to certain ones? Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L = -λ f ψ_f (υ + X) ψ_f. So, the coupling term is λ f ψ_f X ψ_f. So, this would imply that X couples to all the fermions ψ_f, but perhaps the Yukawa coupling for each fermion is different. But the problem says the interaction is given by this term, so I guess X can interact with any fermion ψ_f, but each with their own coupling λ.

Wait, but in reality, the Higgs (which is a boson) couples to fermions with a strength proportional to their mass. So, for each fermion, the coupling is λ_f = m_f / v, where v is the Higgs VEV. But in this problem, maybe the coupling is the same for all, or perhaps we don't need to worry about the coupling strength, just whether the decay is kinematically allowed.

So, the key point is the mass. So, let's list all the possible fermions that have a mass less than 3 GeV (since m_X is 6 GeV, half of that is 3 GeV). Because X can decay into any fermion pair where each has mass less than 3 GeV.

But wait, wait, fermions in the Standard Model come in different generations. Let me list the masses of the known fermions (approximately):

First, the up-type quarks:
- Up quark (u): mass ~ 2 MeV (so about 0.002 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV

Down-type quarks:
- Down quark (d): ~3 MeV
- Strange qu
