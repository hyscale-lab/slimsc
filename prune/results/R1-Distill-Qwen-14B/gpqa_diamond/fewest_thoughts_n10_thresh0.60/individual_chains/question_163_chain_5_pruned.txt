Okay, I need to figure out how to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ with a strong monobasic acid and find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed, plus the pH of the solution. Hmm, let's think step by step.

First, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so it should react with a strong acid like HCl. The reaction should produce Fe^3+ ions and water. The balanced equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Right, so each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

I need to find the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is Fe (55.85) + 3*(O=16 + H=1) = 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol. So 0.1 g divided by 106.85 gives moles. Let me calculate that: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 9.36e-4. Since each mole needs 3 H+ moles, the H+ needed is 3 * 9.36e-4 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, so to find the volume, moles = Molarity * Volume → Volume = moles / Molarity. So 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. That's about 28.08 mL, so looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is pretty close. But wait, maybe I should consider whether all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved?

Wait, but the total solution volume is 100 cm³. So when adding the acid, the total volume will be 100 cm³ plus whatever acid we add. Oh wait, the question says we are preparing a solution with a total volume of 100 cm³. So the acid volume plus the solution volume? Or is the 100 cm³ after adding the acid? Hmm, the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. The question says, "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So I think the total volume after dissolution is 100 cm³. So the acid (volume V) plus the Fe(OH)3 solution (maybe you can consider it as negligible or part of the total) sums to 100 cm³. So the acid volume V plus the initial solution volume is 100 cm³. Wait
