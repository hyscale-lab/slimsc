Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about exoplanets detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both similar in mass to Neptune. The planets have circular orbits.

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. For Planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravity making the star move. The star's velocity is what we're measuring. The formula I think relates the velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period, the planet's mass, and the star's mass.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( sin(i) ) / ( (4π²/P²) )^(1/3) )

Wait, but since the planet masses are much smaller than the star's mass, M_p is negligible compared to M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e (eccentricity) is zero. Oh, and sin(i) is 1 because the orbits are edge-on (but wait, the problem doesn't say that, but in RV method, you get maximum shift when the orbit is edge-on; if it's not, the measured K is lower. But the problem doesn't specify, so I think for the sake of this problem, we can assume that both have the same inclination, or perhaps that the Doppler shift is the same in terms of their K. Hmm, but the problem gives the shifts, so maybe the K values are different.

Wait, but the problem states the shift in spectral lines, which is related to the velocity of the star. So the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. So, for each planet, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the velocity shift. So, Planet #1 has K1 = 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has K2 =7 milliangstroms. Wait, no. Wait, no, the shift in wavelength is measured in milliangstroms, but the velocity is derived from that. So, the actual velocity K is proportional to the wavelength shift (delta_lambda) divided by the original wavelength (lambda_0), so K = c * (delta_lambda / lambda_0). But since both are measured at the same wavelength, the ratio of their velocities K1/K2 would be the same as the ratio of their delta_lambdas. Because lambda_0 is the same for both measurements since it's the same spectral line.

So, K1/K2 = (5)/(7) ≈ 0.714.

But wait, I'm not sure about this. Maybe the actual formula is K = (v) which is calculated from the wavelength shift
