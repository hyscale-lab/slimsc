Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets have circular orbits.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods — specifically, how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I think the RV shift is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula I remember is something about the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) being proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ), where P is the orbital period. But since the stars have the same mass and the planets are similar (same mass and same orbital inclination if we assume edge-on), the sin i would be the same, maybe 1 if they're both edge-on.

Wait, the formula from the RV method: K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / (4π²) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / [ (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ]) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Oh wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the relation between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P. Since the star and planet masses are similar, and the planet masses are much less than the star's mass, M_p << M_star, so the denominator term (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) can be approximated as M_star^(1/3). So then K scales with (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but more accurately, the semi-amplitude K is given by: 

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π G) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for the relation between K and P. Since the stars are same mass, M_star, and the planet masses are same (Neptune), M_p same for both.

So for each planet, K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3) )

Because K = (constant) * (M_p)^(1/3) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, actually, the precise formula I think is:

K = (v) = [ (2π G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ [ (2π G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M
