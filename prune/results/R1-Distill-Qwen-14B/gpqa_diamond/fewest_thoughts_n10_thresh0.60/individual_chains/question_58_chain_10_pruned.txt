Okay, so I've got this question here about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. Right, because when you calculate loop diagrams, you often end up with integrals that diverge. Regularization helps you handle that by introducing a cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you take the limit where the cutoff goes away.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization. So I need to think about each option and whether they have such issues.

Option A is Superstring Theory. Wait, string theory is a theory of quantum gravity, right? And it's supposed to be a background-independent theory. But I also remember that string theories have something called the 't Hooft vertex or maybe something about perturbative expansion. Oh wait, in string theory, the interactions are handled by the worldsheet with different conformal field theories. But do they require regularization? I think in string theory, the perturbative expansions are finite because the theory doesn't have the same kind of divergences as in, say, quantum electrodynamics. Because in string theory, the interactions are calculated using the sum over different topologies (genus), and the perturbative terms are organized as a series expansion which is finite. So maybe string theory doesn't require regularization because the divergences are somehow tamed by the theory's structure. But I'm not entirely sure.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a
