Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when particles like mesons are produced, their mean decay distance depends on their lifetime and their velocity. Wait, but how do I calculate that exactly?

Let me think. The formula for mean decay distance is usually given by the product of the lifetime (tau) and the velocity (v) multiplied by the speed of light (c), right? So the formula is d = v * tau * c. Or wait, is it c times tau times v? Oh wait, no, wait. I think it's the other way around. Because velocity is in units of c, so maybe it's d = c * tau * v. Or perhaps I'm mixing that up. Let me make sure.

Wait, no, I think the formula is proper time multiplied by velocity and the speed of light. So the mean decay length L is L = gamma * v * c * tau, but wait, tau is the proper lifetime, and gamma is the Lorentz factor. Hmm, but I might be getting confused. Alternatively, the mean path might be c multiplied by the lifetime (as measured in the lab frame) multiplied by the velocity of the particle. Wait, no, let me think. The mean decay distance is the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime of the particle. So L = v * tau. But wait, tau here is the lifetime as measured in the particle's rest frame, right? Because the particle moves, so the lifetime is dilated in the lab frame. Oh wait, no. Or wait, no, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame, due to time dilation, the lifetime is longer. So the lab lifetime is gamma * tau. And the speed is v, so the distance is v multiplied by gamma tau. So L = v * gamma * tau. Alternatively, L = (v gamma) * tau. But wait, v gamma is the same as gamma v, and gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Hmm.

Alternatively, I remember that the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So tau_lab = gamma * tau. So the mean decay distance would be L = v * tau_lab = v * gamma * tau. Alternatively, since gamma is v/c approximately, no, wait gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)), so it's not exactly v, but for high energies, v is close to c.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach this systematically.

The problem gives E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Gamma_X = 320 MeV.

So first, I need to find the lifetime of the meson. The width Gamma is related to the mean lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The mean lifetime tau is related to the width by the equation Gamma = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Gamma.

Wait, no, because Gamma is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime is tau = ħ / Gamma. But wait, sometimes in particle physics, the width is given in energy units, and to get time, you use the relationship E * time ≈ ħ (in natural units). So in natural units, ħ = c = 1, so the mean lifetime tau is approximately 1/Gamma. But wait, the units here are in GeV and MeV. So I need to be careful.

Wait, let's think in natural units. In natural units, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm. But perhaps it's easier to compute using the relation tau = ħ / Gamma, but I have to make sure the units are consistent.

Alternatively, the decay width Gamma is given as 320 MeV. So Gamma = 320 MeV. So tau = ħ / Gamma. But ħ in units where ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So converting Gamma to GeV, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s. Let me compute that.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait, that's the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle, right? Because decay width is inverse lifetime in the particle's rest frame.

But wait, no, the width Gamma is the total decay width, which is measured in the rest frame. So tau is the proper lifetime.

So then, the lifetime in the lab frame will be gamma times tau. Gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, the particle is moving with some velocity, so the lifetime is longer in the lab frame. So the mean decay length is v multiplied by gamma * tau, since L = v * t, and t is the lab frame lifetime.

But how do I find gamma?

To compute gamma, I need to find the velocity of the meson when it's produced. The production energy is given as E_X =8 GeV, and mass m_X =1.2 GeV.

So the total energy E = γ m c², but in units where c=1, E = γ m. So gamma is E / m. So gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

So gamma is about 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found from gamma. The relation between gamma and velocity is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) * c.

But since gamma is large (6.667), 1/gamma² is about (0.15)² = 0.0225, so 1 - 1/(gamma^2) is approximately 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So v ≈ sqrt(0.9775) c. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Hmm, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

But wait, I can compute it more precisely.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

So 1/gamma² is (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 1/gamma² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is... Let me compute:

0.9887^2 = (approx) 0.9775. So yes, v is approximately 0.9887 c.

So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Now, the mean decay length is L = v * gamma * tau. Wait, let me think. Wait, no. The proper lifetime is tau. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. The particle is moving at velocity v, so the distance would be v multiplied by the lab lifetime.

So L = v * (gamma tau) )

So substituting the numbers:

v = 0.9887 c

gamma tau is gamma * tau. Tau was calculated as about 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait! Wait, tau is in seconds, but when I compute L, I have to make sure that the units are correct.

Wait, tau is in seconds, v is in m/s, so L would be v * tau_lab = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, but let me compute each part step by step.

First, let's compute gamma:

gamma = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.

Next, compute tau (proper lifetime):

Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

tau = hbar / Gamma.

hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, tau_lab = gamma * tau = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.373e-23 seconds.

Then, the velocity v is approximately 0.9887 c, where c is 3e8 m/s.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, more precisely, 0.9887 * 3e8 = 0.9887 * 3 = approx 2.966, so 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, L = v * tau_lab ≈ (2.966e8 m/s) * (1.373e-23 s) = ?

Let me compute that: 2.966e8 * 1.373e-23 = (2.966 * 1.373) * 1e-15.

Compute 2.966 * 1.373. Let's see:

2 *1.373 = 2.746

0.966 *1.373 ≈ about 1.323.

So total approx 2.746 + 1.323 = 4.069.

So 4.069e-15 meters.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

2.966 × 1.373:

2.966 * 1 = 2.966

2.966 * 0.3 = 0.8898

2.966 * 0.07 = 0.20762

2.966 * 0.003 = 0.008898

Adding them up:

2.966

+0.8898 → 3.8558

+0.20762 → 4.06342

+0.008898 → 4.072318.

So approximately 4.0723e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655 * 1e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15.

Hmm, close to 4.07e-15. So the answer would be option B?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the velocity calculation.

Wait, gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is 400/9 ≈44.444.

So 1/gamma² is about 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/gamma² is 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887 as before.

So v=0.9887c.

But perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute beta = v/c.

From gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So 1/gamma^2 = 1 - beta^2.

So beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2.

gamma is 20/3, so 1/gamma^2 is (9/400) = 0.0225.

So beta^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) = 0.98868.

So v = 0.98868 c.

Which is approximately 0.9887 c.

So when I compute v * gamma * tau:

Let me compute each term again.

gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

gamma * tau =6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = approx 1.373e-23 s.

v = 0.98868 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

v * (gamma tau) = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.373e-23 s = ?

2.966e8 * 1.373e-23 = (2.966 * 1.373) * 1e-15.

2.966 *1.373: Let's calculate precisely.

2 *1.373 = 2.746.

0.966 *1.373:

Compute 0.9 *1.373 = 1.2357.

0.066 *1.373 ≈ 0.0909.

So 1.2357 + 0.0909 = 1.3266.

So 2.746 +1.3266 =4.0726.

So 4.0726e-15 meters.

Looking at the options again:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, very close. Perhaps the exact calculation would give a more precise result.

Wait, perhaps I should not approximate beta but compute it more accurately.

Compute beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma)^2).

gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is 400/9.

1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So beta squared is 0.9775.

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

Let me compute that more accurately.

I know that 0.9887^2 = 0.9775.

Wait, 0.9887 * 0.9887: let's compute that.

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

Wait, 0.9887 * 0.9887:

Breakdown:

= (0.98 + 0.0087)^2

= 0.98^2 + 2*(0.98)*(0.0087) + (0.0087)^2

= 0.9604 + 0.02 * 0.0087 * 2? Wait no:

Wait, 0.98 is 98/100, 0.0087 is 87/10000.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 0.9887 * 0.9887:

Let me compute 9887 * 9887.

But that's a bit tedious. Alternatively, note that 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.9775, as I thought earlier.

Let me use a calculator approach:

Compute 0.9887 × 0.9887.

= (0.98 × 1) + (0.0087 × 0.98) × 2 + (0.0087)^2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think correctly.

0.9887 × 0.9887 is equal to:

= (0.9000 + 0.08 + 0.0087)^2.

Wait, perhaps better to do it step by step.

First, 0.9887 × 0.9887:

Multiply 9887 × 9887.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 0.9887 × 0.9887:

= 0.9887 * 0.9887 = ?

Let me compute 0.9887 × 0.9887:

(0.9887)^2 = ?

Compute 9887^2:

9887 ×9887.

Well, 9887 ×9887 = (9800 + 87)^2 = 9800² + 2*9800*87 + 87².

Compute each term:

9800² = (98)^2 * (100)^2 = 9604 * 10000 = 96,040,000.

2*9800*87 = 2*9800=19600; 19600 *87 = ?

Compute 19600 ×80 = 1,568,000.

19600 ×7 = 137,200.

Total: 1,568,000 + 137,200 = 1,705,200.

87² = 7569.

So 9887² = 96,040,000 +1,705,200 +7,569 = 96,040,000 +1,705,200 =97,745,200 +7,569 =97,752,769.

So 9887² =97,752,769 → 0.9887² = 97,752,769 / 1e8 → 0.97752769.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, because 9887 is 0.9887 in terms of 10^4, so 9887^2 is 97,752,769 → as a decimal, 0.9887^2 is 0.97752769.

Oh, that's more precise. So beta is 0.9887, so beta^2 is 0.97752769.

So beta is sqrt(0.97752769) which is 0.9887, as we had earlier.

So v = 0.9887 c.

So going back, the product v * gamma * tau.

v =0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

gamma =20/3 ≈6.6666667.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So v * gamma * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * (6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s ) = 2.966e8 * 1.373e-23 = ?

Wait, 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.373e-23.

So 2.966e8 m/s * 1.373e-23 s = 2.966 *1.373e-15 m.

Wait, 2.966 *1.373 = ?

Let me compute it precisely.

2.966 ×1.373:

Let me break this down:

= (2 + 0.966) × (1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.003)
But that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, compute 2.966 ×1.373:

= 2.966 ×1 = 2.966

2.966 ×0.3 =0.8898

2.966 ×0.07 = 0.20762

2.966 ×0.003 = 0.008898

Now add them all:

2.966 + 0.8898 = 3.8558

3.8558 + 0.20762 = 4.06342

4.06342 + 0.008898 =4.072318.

So 4.072318e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, 4.072 vs 4.0655. Close, but not exactly the same. Perhaps I made an approximation in gamma calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Gamma is 8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.666666..., which is 20/3. So gamma is exactly 6.6666666667.

So tau = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 /0.32) *1e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32: 6.582 divided by 0.32.

Compute 0.32 *20 =6.4, so 6.582-6.4=0.182. So 20 + (0.182/0.32) =20 + 0.56875=20.56875.

So 6.582/0.32=20.56875.

So tau =20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

So gamma * tau =6.666666667 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

6 * 2.056875e-24 =1.234125e-23.

0.666666667 *2.056875e-24 =approx 1.37125e-24.

So 1.234125e-23 +1.37125e-24 =1.234125e-23 +0.137125e-23=1.37125e-23.

Wait, no, 0.666666667 *2.056875e-24 = (2/3) *2.056875e-24 = approx 1.37125e-24.

So 6.66666667 * 2.056875e-24 = (6 *2.056875e-24) ) + (0.66666667 *2.056875e-24) =12.34125e-24 +1.37125e-24 =13.7125e-24 s =1.37125e-23 s.

So tau_lab =1.37125e-23 s.

v =0.9887 *3e8 m/s =2.9661e8 m/s.

L =v * tau_lab =2.9661e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Compute 2.9661e8 *1.37125e-23 = (2.9661 *1.37125) *1e-15.

Compute 2.9661 *1.37125.

Let me compute this:

2.9661 *1.37125.

Break it down:

= (2 + 0.9661) * (1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.00125 )

= not so helpful.

Alternatively, compute 2.9661 ×1.37125.

Compute 2.9661 ×1 =2.9661.

2.9661 ×0.3=0.88983.

2.9661 ×0.07=0.207627.

2.9661 ×0.00125= 0.003707625.

Now sum all:

2.9661 + 0.88983 =3.85593.

3.85593 +0.207627=4.063557.

4.063557 +0.003707625≈4.0672646.

So 4.0672646e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close.

So perhaps the exact calculation would give around 4.067e-15, but the options have 4.0655e-15 (option B) or 5.0223e-15 (option C).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, the production energy is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So, the total energy E =8 GeV, rest mass m=1.2 GeV. So gamma=E/(m c²) but in natural units, E=gamma m, so gamma = E/(m) =8/1.2=6.6666667.

Now, beta can be found from gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma =20/3 → gamma^2=400/9 → 1/gamma^2=9/400=0.0225.

So beta= sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=approx 0.9887.

But perhaps I should compute beta more accurately. As we saw earlier, beta is sqrt(0.97752769)=0.9887.

So v=0.9887 *3e8=2.9661e8 m/s.

Now, L= v * gamma tau = v * (gamma tau).

Gamma tau is (20/3) * (6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV).

Let me compute gamma tau: (20/3) * (6.582/(0.32))e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.32 =20.56875.

So 20/3 *20.56875e-25 = (20 *20.56875)/(3) )e-25.

20 *20.56875 =411.375 → 411.375/3 =137.125 → 137.125e-25 s =1.37125e-23 s.

So v * gamma tau =2.9661e8 m/s *1.37125e-23 s = (2.9661 *1.37125) *1e-15.

As calculated earlier, 2.9661 ×1.37125 ≈4.06726e-15 m.

So 4.06726e-15 m, which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

But the option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close, which suggests that perhaps I should carry out the calculation with more precise figures.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation should be done without approximations.

Let me try using exact values without approximating beta.

Compute beta using gamma =20/3.

So gamma =1/sqrt(1-beta^2)=20/3.

So 1-beta^2 = (3/20)^2 =9/400.

So beta^2=1-9/400= (400-9)/400=391/400 =0.9775.

So beta=sqrt(391/400) =sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.98868.

So beta=0.98868.

So v =0.98868 c =0.98868 *3e8 m/s=2.96604e8 m/s.

Gamma tau = (20/3) * (6.582e-25 /0.32) = (20/3)*(20.56875e-25) = (411.375/3)e-25 =137.125e-25 =1.37125e-23 s.

So L = v * gamma tau =2.96604e8 *1.37125e-23.

Compute 2.96604 ×1.37125.

Let me compute 2.96604 ×1.37125:

Break it down:

2.96604 ×1 =2.96604

2.96604 ×0.3=0.889812

2.96604 ×0.07=0.2076228

2.96604 ×0.00125=0.00370755

Adding them up:

2.96604 +0.889812 =3.855852

3.855852 +0.2076228 =4.0634748

4.0634748 +0.00370755=4.06718235.

So L=4.06718235e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options again:

Option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Option C:5.022e-15 m.

Hmm, 4.067e-15 is closer to option B, but perhaps due to more precise calculations, I could get 4.0655e-15.

But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps when computing tau, I should compute it more accurately.

hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV =0.32 GeV.

Tau = hbar / Gamma =6.582e-25 / 0.32.

Compute 6.582 / 0.32:

6.582 ÷ 0.32.

0.32 ×20=6.4. 6.582-6.4=0.182.

0.182 ÷ 0.32=0.56875.

So 6.582/0.32=20.56875.

So tau =20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

So gamma * tau = (20/3) *2.056875e-24.

20/3 is approximately 6.6666667.

20/3 *2.056875e-24= (20 *2.056875e-24)/3.

20 *2.056875=41.1375.

41.1375e-24 /3=13.7125e-24 =1.37125e-23 s.

So v=0.98868 *3e8=2.96604e8 m/s.

So L=2.96604e8 *1.37125e-23 = (2.96604 *1.37125) *1e-15.

Compute 2.96604 ×1.37125:

=2 *1.37125 =2.7425.

0.96604 ×1.37125.

Hmm, 0.9 *1.37125=1.234125.

0.06604 ×1.37125≈0.0906.

So sum:1.234125+0.0906=1.324725.

So total is 2.7425 +1.324725=4.067225.

So L=4.067225e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

The option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. Perhaps some rounding differences in the calculation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay distance is given by L = c * tau * (gamma * beta).

Because tau is the proper lifetime, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So the time is gamma tau, and distance is v multiplied by time, which is v gamma tau.

Wait, but v = beta c. So L = beta c * gamma tau.

Which is L = beta gamma c tau.

So L = (beta gamma) * c tau.

But tau = hbar / Gamma.

So L = beta gamma c (hbar / Gamma).

So let's compute this.

Beta gamma is beta multiplied by gamma.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(391)/20 ≈19.773/20≈0.98865.

Gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Beta gamma =0.98865 *6.6666667 ≈6.591.

So beta gamma ≈6.591.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

Tau is hbar / Gamma=6.582e-25 GeV s /0.32 GeV =2.056875e-24 s.

So L= beta gamma * c * tau=6.591 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.591 *3e8 =1.9773e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau:1.9773e9 *2.056875e-24.

1.9773e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9773 *2.056875) *1e-15.

1.9773 *2.056875.

Compute 2 *2.056875=4.11375.

Subtract (0.0227 *2.056875) because 2 -1.9773=0.0227.

Wait, wait, no. 1.9773 is approx 2 -0.0227.

So 1.9773 *2.056875 = (2 -0.0227) *2.056875.

= 2*2.056875 -0.0227*2.056875.

=4.11375 -0.04669.

=4.06706.

So L=4.06706e-15 m.

So 4.067e-15 m.

Which again is close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m, but perhaps a slight discrepancy due to more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps we should compute beta gamma more accurately.

Compute beta = sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(391)/20.

Compute sqrt(391) accurately.

391 is between 19^2=361 and 20^2=400.

19^2=361 → 19.76^2=?

19.76^2 = (20 -0.24)^2=400 - 2*20*0.24 +0.24^2=400-9.6 +0.0576=390.4576.

Which is less than 391.

19.77^2: (19.76+0.01)^2= 19.76^2 + 2*19.76*0.01 +0.01^2.

=390.4576 +0.3952 +0.0001=390.8529.

19.77^2=390.8529.

19.77^2=390.8529.

19.78^2= (19.77+0.01)^2=390.8529 + 2*19.77*0.01 +0.0001=390.8529 +0.3954 +0.0001=391.2484.

But 391 is between 19.77^2=390.8529 and 19.78^2=391.2484.

Compute 19.77 + x where x is the fraction.

Let me compute x.

We have 19.77^2=390.8529.

We need 391.

So 391 -390.8529=0.1471.

The difference between 19.78^2 and 19.77^2 is 391.2484 -390.8529=0.3955.

So x is 0.1471 /0.3955 ≈0.372.

So sqrt(391)≈19.77 +0.372*(0.01)=19.77372.

So sqrt(391)= approx 19.7737.

So beta=19.7737/20=0.988685.

So beta=0.988685.

Gamma=20/3=6.6666667.

So beta gamma=0.988685 *6.6666667.

Compute this:

0.988685 *6 =5.93211.

0.988685 *0.6666667= approx 0.988685 * (2/3) =approx 0.659123.

So total beta gamma=5.93211 +0.659123=6.591233.

So beta gamma=6.591233.

Now, compute L= beta gamma * c * tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

Tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L=6.591233 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.

Compute 6.591233 *3e8 =1.9773699e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

1.9773699e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9773699 *2.056875) *1e-15.

Compute 1.9773699 *2.056875.

Let me compute:

1.9773699 ×2 =3.9547398.

1.9773699 ×0.056875.

0.056875 is 56875e-7.

Hmm, 1.9773699 ×0.05 =0.098868495.

1.9773699 ×0.006875= approx 0.013556.

So total 0.098868495 +0.013556≈0.112424.

So 1.9773699 ×2.056875 ≈3.9547398 +0.112424≈4.0671638.

So L≈4.0671638e-15 m.

Which is 4.06716e-15 m.

The options are option B:4.0655e-15, which is very close. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculation steps or rounding in the provided options.

So the correct answer is option B, 4.0655e-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the formula:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

where \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau \) is the dilated lifetime in the lab frame, \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime, and \( v \) is the velocity of the particle. The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The decay width is given as \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m},
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) is the mass. Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the lab-frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
The lab-frame lifetime is:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \implies v = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \cdot c.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
v = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} \cdot c = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} \cdot c = \sqrt{0.9775} \cdot c.
\]

Using \( \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887 \), we find:

\[
v = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} = 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = (2.9661 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}).
\]

Substituting:

\[
L = (2.9661 \cdot 1.37125) \times 10^{-15}.
\]

First, calculate \( 2.9661 \cdot 1.37125 \):

\[
2.9661 \cdot 1.37125 = 4.06716.
\]

Thus:

\[
L = 4.06716 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 6: Compare with the options
The closest option to \( 4.06716 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**Option B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
