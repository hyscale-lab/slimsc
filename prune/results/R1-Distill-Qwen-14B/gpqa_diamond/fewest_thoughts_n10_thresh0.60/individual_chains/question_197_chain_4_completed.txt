Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus with HI is used for something like hydrolysis reactions, maybe the hydrolysis of a nitrile group or something else. Wait, no, wait. Oh right! Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of alkenes to form alcohols, but wait, no, that's for the oxymercuration maybe? Or wait, I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used to remove a protecting group, like in the case of the benzyl group. Oh, right! The Clemmensen reduction uses HCl and Zn(Hg)/Hg, but that's for reducing ketones to alkanes. Wait, maybe that's not it.

Wait, another thought: when you have a reaction with red phosphorus and HI, that's sometimes in the context of the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I recall that red phosphorus and HI can be used to cleave certain functional groups. Oh wait! Maybe it's related to the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that's more about ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile? No, nitriles usually hydrolyse with H2O and acid, or maybe H2O under acidic conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should start by analyzing the given data for Compound X. The IR and NMR data will help me figure out what functional groups are present in Compound X, which in turn will help me determine what reaction happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500, which suggests an O-H stretch, maybe a carboxylic acid (broad) or an alcohol. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might suggest aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data: 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet for 1H. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because alcohols usually don't show up that high, and aldehydes are around 9-10 but as a singlet. So if there's a peak at 10.5, that's probably the -COOH proton.

Then the rest: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two doublets each integrating to 2H. So the aromatic ring has substituents in para positions. The downfield shift at 8.0 and 7.2 suggests substitution with electron-withdrawing groups, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, that would make sense as a substituent. So perhaps the ring has a COOH group at position 4, and another substituent.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be adjacent to a carbonyl, maybe a CH next to a carbonyl. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) suggests maybe a CH2 group next to something, perhaps a branching. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 group attached to something, maybe a CH2 group. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like in an ethyl or propyl group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group at the para position and a substituent that's a branched alkyl chain. For example, something like a propyl group attached to the ring, with branching.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene could be a butyl group. Let me see: the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is typical for a CH3 group at the end of an ethyl or propyl chain. The d at 1.4 ppm (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2 perhaps, like in an iso-butyl group.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure. The aromatic ring has a carboxylic acid group and a substituent. For the aromatic substituent, maybe it's a sec-butyl group or an iso-butyl group. Because the NMR has a triplet at the end (0.9 ppm, 3H) and a doublet of 3H at 1.4 ppm. So perhaps the substituent is an iso-butyl group attached to the benzene.

So the structure could be 4-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)benzoic acid? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group with branching. Let's consider the possible structure of the substituent. The 2.9 ppm multiplet suggests a CH adjacent to something, perhaps a carbonyl. So maybe the substituent is something like CH2-COOH, but that wouldn't fit with the substituent on the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. Let me think: if there's a CH2 group next to a CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene is a butyl group. Let's imagine the structure: the benzene ring has a COOH group and a substituent which is a butyl group. Let me see the NMR shifts. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to a carbonyl, perhaps part of a ketone or ester, but in this case, the compound has a COOH group. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH in a branched alkyl chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. Let's see: the substituent is attached as a -CH2CH2CH2- but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Let me sketch the structure.

So for substituent: if it's a sec-butyl group, that would be a four-carbon chain where the second carbon is attached to the benzene. So the structure would be CH2-C(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Wait, no. Wait, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. So the benzene has a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached.

Wait, but then the NMR would show a CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me think about the shifts. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH next to the branching, and then the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the CH3 attached to the CH.

Wait, but a sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. That would make the adjacent CH to the benzene have a CH2 group. Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about the substituent as an iso-butyl group. An iso-butyl would be (CH2CH2)C-CH3 attached to the benzene. Wait, no, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- no, wait, iso-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH3? No, wait: the substituent is a butyl group, either straight or branched.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an iso-propyl group attached to the benzene. Let me think, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9, so perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propan-2-yl group, which is an iso-propyl. So the structure would be benzene with a COOH and a iso-propyl group.

But wait, looking at the NMR shifts:

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2 group, perhaps in an ethyl group. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) would be the terminal CH3 of an ethyl group. Hmm, perhaps we have a ethyl group attached somewhere.

Wait, but the substituent on the benzene is a butyl group. Let me think of a butyl group as CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's straight, but the NMR doesn't match that.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, like a sec-propyl? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. So that would be a pentyl group? No, wait, it's attached as a substituent.

Wait, perhaps it's a 3-methylbutyl group attached to the benzene. Let me think: that would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached. No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. Then, looking at the NMR:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the central CH of a propyl group, but I'm not sure. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, but then the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a CH3 attached to something, perhaps a CH2 next to the benzene.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Let me try to imagine the structure. The benzene has a COOH group at position 4 (para) and a substituent at position 1, which is a propyl group attached as -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group, but that doesn't seem to fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. Hmm, I'm stuck on this. Maybe I should think about the possible products after the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So, what functional groups would react under those conditions?

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the hydrolysis of a benzyne intermediate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI are used in the dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Wait, no, elimination usually uses a base.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Compound X is a benzoyl chloride. But wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl, perhaps an ester or a ketone, but I thought it was a carboxylic acid because of the broad peak at 10.5 ppm. But wait, in the IR, the 3400-2500 range could also include an O-H from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the presence of a broad peak around 10 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid. So the compound has a COOH group. Then, the IR at 1720 might be an ester or a ketone, but if the compound has a COOH, it's possible that it's a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but then what's the other carbonyl? Oh, perhaps it's a carbonyl from an aromatic ring substitution like a ketone. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the 1720 is the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. So 1720 might suggest an ester or a ketone.

Wait, maybe the compound is an ester. Let me think again. If it's an ester, the O-H from the acid might not be present, but wait, the broad peak around 10 ppm could be an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Hmm, perhaps I should reevaluate.

If the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl. So, perhaps the compound is an ester, which would have a carbonyl around 1720. But then the broad peak at 10.5 ppm would suggest an -OH group, maybe from a hydroxyl, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's an ester, the O-H would not be present unless there's another functional group. So perhaps the compound has both a carboxylic acid and an ester group? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 is an aldehyde. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet (bs). That's highly indicative of a carboxylic acid proton. So the compound must have a -COOH group. So the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 must be the carbonyl of the -COOH group. Wait, but carboxylic acids have lower wavenumber carbonyls, around 1700 cm-1, sometimes lower. So maybe 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester or another carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone. So the compound could have a ketone and a carboxylic acid. But in that case, the IR would show two carbonyl peaks, but looking at the data, only 1720 is clearly marked. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1720 is an ester, and the 10.5 is an aldehyde. But aldehydes don't usually have such broad peaks. They are usually sharp singlets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid and another group like an aromatic ring with substituents. Let me think again about the NMR. The aromatic protons are in a para-substituted pattern, so the substituents are in para positions.

So, the structure is likely a para-substituted benzoic acid. The substituent is a branched alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR shifts again. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH2, and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH2 which is connected to something else, perhaps a longer chain.

So perhaps the substituent is a butyl group attached to the benzene. Let's think: the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)2? Wait, that's a tertiary butyl group. No, perhaps it's -(CH2)2CH2CH3, but that's a straight butyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. For example, the substituent could be -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. No, that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that's a five-carbon group? No, wait: the substituent is a four-carbon group attached to the benzene. So, maybe it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is three H, so a terminal CH3. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is another CH3, perhaps attached to a CH2 group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH, perhaps attached to another CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) are two CH2 groups.

So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but with a branch. Let me think of it as a (CH2)2CH group attached to a CH3. Wait, that would be a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, no. Let me structure it correctly. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

But then, the NMR would show:

The CH(CH2CH3) would have a triplet or maybe a multiplet. Wait, perhaps I should imagine the structure as:

Benzene ring with a COOH group at one position and a substituent at the opposite (para) position. The substituent is a butyl group, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. But wait, that's a five-carbon chain? No, wait. Wait, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. No, that's a three-carbon branch. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CH2 group, but that's a straight butyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that would be a tertiary structure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)3CH3 group, which is a straight butyl group. But that wouldn't explain the 1.4 ppm doublet. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH3, which is a pentyl group. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like -CH2CH(CH3)2. But that would have a quaternary carbon, which wouldn't show up in the NMR as a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a iso-butyl group, which is -(CH2)C(CH3)2. No, iso-butyl is -(CH2)C(CH3)2. So, the substituent would be:

Benzene ring- attached to a -CH2-C(CH3)2 group. So, the substituent is an iso-butyl group.

In that case, the NMR would have the following signals:

The iso-butyl group would have a CH2 group attached to the benzene, then a CH connected to two CH3 groups.

So, the CH2 would be at around 2.9 ppm, perhaps as a multiplet. The CH would be at around 1.4 ppm, perhaps as a doublet. The two CH3 groups attached to the CH would each show as a triplet around 0.9 ppm. Wait, but in the given NMR, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (t) for 3H. Hmm, but the iso-butyl group would have two CH3 groups, each as a triplet, but in the NMR, only one triplet is present.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again: the substituent is an iso-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. No, wait, the iso-butyl group is -(CH2)C(CH3)2. So the structure is:

Phenyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH that is connected to two CH3 groups.

In such a structure, the CH would be a singlet, but in the NMR, it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm. Hmm, maybe the CH is split due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, leading to a structure like CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but that would give a CH with two CH3 groups attached, which might not split into a triplet. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH3 group, but that's a straight butyl, which doesn't explain the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a pentyl group, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the possible options given.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, wait. Let me look at the options.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1.

The structure would be:

Benzoic acid with a substituent at the para position, which is a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene. The structure would be:

Phenyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH group that is attached to a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, no. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. No, wait, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is a butyl group with branching on the second carbon.

So, the structure would be benzene with a COOH group at para and a sec-butyl group at another position.

But wait, the NMR data of the substituent: the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) would correspond to the terminal CH3 of the ethyl group in the sec-butyl. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) would be the methyl group attached to the CH in the sec-butyl.

Wait, but in the substituent, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. So the CH2 group attached to the benzene would have two protons, which would show up as a triplet around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), perhaps. The CH group in the middle would have one proton, which would show up as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The CH2CH3 group would have its CH2 as a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), and the CH3 next to the CH might be a quartet or something else, but in the NMR, it's a doublet at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H).

Wait a second, that fits. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So let me outline the structure:

Benzene ring:

- At position 1: a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

- At position 4 (para): a COOH group.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group at the para position relative to the COOH.

In the NMR:

- The aromatic protons are split into two doublets, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), which makes sense for a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents (COOH and sec-butyl).

The protons on the aromatic ring are each in doublets because of coupling with the adjacent H, but since it's para, the coupling constants would be similar.

Now, looking at the substituent's NMR signals:

- The CH2 group attached to the benzene (let's call this CH2-A) is next to the CH group (CH-B) which is attached to CH2CH3 (CH2-C). So in the NMR:

- CH2-A: two H, adjacent to CH-B. The shifts would be around 2.9 ppm, but the data shows 2.9 as a multiplet for 1H. Wait, that doesn't quite fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me reconsider the substituent.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propan-2-yl group, which is an iso-propyl. So the substituent is -(CH2)C(CH3)2. Then, the structure would be:

Benzene attached to CH2, which is attached to a C(CH3)2. So the substituent is an iso-butyl group.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 group (attached to benzene) has two H, which would appear as a triplet or quartet. The data shows 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which could correspond to this.

- The C(CH3)2 group has a single CH, which might split into a multiplet. The data shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which fits.

- The two CH3 groups attached to the central CH would each be a triplet, but in the data, there's a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and a 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Wait, but that would suggest only one CH3 group is attached, which doesn't fit with an iso-butyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the substituent:

If it's a sec-butyl group, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the structure would be:

Benzen ring attached to CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So:

- The CH2 group (attached to benzene) would have two H. They'd be in a triplet, perhaps around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet (but that's m, which could be from coupling with the adjacent CH).

- The CH group in the middle (CH connected to CH2CH3) would have one H, which would appear as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm.

- The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

But then, the CH group is attached to a CH2CH3, which has a triplet. But wait, the CH group is connected to two other CH2 groups? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the CH group is connected to a CH2CH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-, so:

- The benzene is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH group, which is attached to a CH2CH3.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Then, in the NMR:

- The CH2 next to benzene: 2 H, perhaps as a triplet or quartet, but the data shows 1.7 ppm as m, 2H.

- The CH group: 1 H, as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm.

- The CH2CH3 group: 2 H in the CH2, which would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

But then, what about the CH3 attached to the CH group? That would be the CH(CH2CH3) group. The CH2CH3 is a triplet, and the CH3 would be a quartet if coupled with the CH's H. But in the data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d, 3H), which would suggest a CH3 attached to a CH2 that's next to something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group on the benzoic acid.

So, the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Benzoic acid is Ph-COOH. So the substituent is on the benzene, not on the COOH. So, the structure would be Ph-(substituent)-COOH, with substituent being a sec-butyl group in the para position.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the COOH is at the para position.

In this case, the substituent's NMR signals would be:

- The CH2 group attached to the benzene (CH2-A) would have two H, perhaps as a triplet around 1.7 ppm. But in the data, 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H.

- The CH group (CH-B) has one H, which would be a multiplet around 2.9 ppm. That fits.

- The CH2CH3 group (CH2-C) would have two H (the CH2) that are a triplet around 0.9 ppm. The CH3 in CH2CH3 would be a triplet as well, but perhaps it's the same as the 0.9 ppm signal.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d, 3H). That doesn't fit with the CH2CH3 group because that would be a triplet around 0.9 ppm.

Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group. But that would have a singlet for the CH3 groups, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a different branching.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction of Compound X with red phosphorus and HI leads to the formation of an alcohol. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus with HI is sometimes used in the reduction of carbonyl groups to alcohols. For example, in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, or esters to alcohols.

But wait, in that case, if Compound X has a carbonyl group (like a ketone), the reaction would reduce it to a secondary alcohol. But in our case, the IR suggests a carboxylic acid (from the broad peak at 10.5), which would not be reduced under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of chlorides or bromides, perhaps in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Hofmann degradation. Hofmann degradation uses a strong base to remove an amine group, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride to a carboxylic acid, but then why use red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the reaction. So let's recap:

- Compound X has a COOH group (from NMR and IR).

- The substituent on the benzene is a butyl group of some sort.

- The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI.

So, what would happen when a benzoic acid derivative reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of a chloride. For example, if the substituent is a chloroalkyl group, HI could substitute it, but that's not indicated in the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile to an amine. But our compound doesn't seem to have a nitrile.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is an ester group, which upon reaction with HI would undergo hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But our compound already has a COOH group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acyl group, like an acetyl group, which upon reaction with HI would be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. But again, the compound already has a COOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, and the reaction is cleavage to form a benzylic alcohol. But that doesn't fit the NMR.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible products in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the product would be the same as the starting material, which doesn't make sense if there's a reaction.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the product would have a propanoic acid group and an ethylphenyl group.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So the product is a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So the product is a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but the starting material has a COOH group. So the reaction must be modifying that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is removing the COOH group. For example, if the COOH is protected as an ester or something else, and the reaction hydrolyzes it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromide or chloride, and the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, but the IR doesn't show a strong peak around 700 cm-1, which would suggest an aromatic C-Br or C-Cl stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a leaving group, and the reaction replaces it with an -OH or something else.

But without more data, it's challenging to say.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the COOH group to a CH2OH group, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but I don't know the conditions for that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the removal of the COOH group, leaving a benzene ring with another substituent.

Wait, but looking at the options, only Option C and A have a COOH group. So the product would either retain the COOH or lose it.

Wait, but the question states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps the COOH group remains, and another substituent is modified.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid. But in that case, the initial structure would have an ester group, and the product would have a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid, so perhaps the starting material already has a COOH group. So the reaction would transform another part of the molecule.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is an alkyne, and the reaction adds HI to it. But I don't see peaks in the IR that would suggest an alkyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, and the reaction reduces it to a secondary alcohol. Then, the product would have an -OH group.

But the starting material has a COOH group, and the product would have an additional OH.

Wait, but the options don't include such a product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile, and the reaction reduces it to an amine. But again, the options don't reflect that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible reactions of a benzoic acid derivative with red phosphorus and HI. Another thought: perhaps it's a benzoin condensation, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration of a double bond. But looking at the IR and NMR, I don't see evidence of a double bond.

Wait, another angle: the substituent on the benzene is a butyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a dehydrohalogenation, but without a leaving group, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzylic halide, and the reaction performs a substitution. For example, a benzyl bromide would react with HI to form an alcohol.

But in that case, the starting material would have a bromide or other halide in the substituent. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest that.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is an alkoxy group, and the reaction replaces it with something else. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks indicative of an ether.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitro group, and the reaction reduces it. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks for that.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another angle. Let me think about the possible IR and NMR data again.

The NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2 group, which is probably at the end of a chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2 that's next to another group. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) suggests a CH group that is adjacent to other groups, perhaps a carbonyl.

Putting this together, the substituent is likely a butyl group with a branch, such as a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, which has a COOH group in the para position.

So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Now, when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but if the starting material is already a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction is something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction removes the COOH group. How? For example, if the COOH is part of an ester, but no, the starting material is a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. Under certain conditions, a β-keto acid can lose CO2. But in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, not a keto group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the COOH group to a CH2OH group. But I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a bromide or chloride, and the reaction is a substitution. But in the NMR, there's no indication of an aromatic bromide or chloride.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester, which upon hydrolysis with HI would become a carboxylic acid. But again, the starting material is already a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the reaction in the question again. The reaction is between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, red phosphorus is often used as a reducing agent. For example, in the reduction of nitro compounds to amines. But in the presence of HI, perhaps it's part of a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of carboxylic acids with red phosphorus and HI might lead to the formation of alkenes via a Hunsdiecker-like reaction. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but that doesn't seem to fit with the reagents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid bromide, but that's not directly supported by the reagents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the COOH group as CO2, forming an alkane. But I'm not sure about the conditions for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's unlikely with these reagents.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group, which upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus would be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. But again, the product would already be a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the COOH group, forming a benzene ring with a substituent that's an alkene or something else.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Since the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction conditions involve red phosphorus and HI, let's consider what would happen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the removal of the COOH group. For example, if the COOH is deprotonated and then undergoes substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the COOH group to a CH2OH group. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but that would require a different reagent, like SOCl2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acylide, using red phosphorus and HI. That's a possibility. When a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it can form an acylide ion, which could lead to the formation of an alkane via the Hiyama coupling or similar, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the formation of an acylide would typically require a strong base like red phosphorus and HI. The reaction could proceed as:

RCOOH + P (red) + HI → R-C≡P + H2O

But then, what would happen next? Perhaps the acylide could undergo elimination or substitution.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl chloride, and the reaction is a substitution, but then the starting material wouldn't have a COOH group.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the reaction outcome based on the options.

If the product is option C, then no reaction occurs, which is unlikely.

If the product is option A, which is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, that would imply some kind of addition or substitution on the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester group to a carboxylic acid, but again, the starting material is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid, but then the starting material would have a nitrile, which isn't indicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid. But again, the starting material already has a COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an acyl chloride, and the reaction is the hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But the starting material would have a chloride in the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromide, and the reaction substitutes it with something else.

Wait, considering the NMR data, the substituent is a butyl group. If the reaction is a substitution of a bromide in the substituent, then the product would have an -OH group instead.

But I'm not seeing any peaks in the NMR that suggest a bromide.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the product is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, but that would mean no reaction occurred, which is unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the COOH group into something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the COOH group is converted into a methyl group. But under what conditions? For example, using LiAlH4 would reduce a COOH to CH2OH, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is decarboxylated, losing CO2 and forming a benzene ring with the substituent as an alkane. But I'm not sure about the conditions for that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Benzoin condensation, but that's for ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an enol ether, but that doesn't fit the reagents.

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently. What reaction typically uses red phosphorus and HI?

Ah! I think I remember now. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones to form ketones with an oxygen inserted. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines.

Wait, but the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Wait, another reaction: the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/Hg and HCl to reduce ketones to alkanes. But the reagents here are red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydroboration of an alkene, but without an alkene present, that's not possible.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be the reduction of a nitrile group to an amine. But the starting material doesn't have a nitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl chloride, and the reaction is the substitution with HI to form a benzyl iodide, but I don't see any indication of that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a halide, and the reaction is the elimination to form an alkene. But again, no indication of that in the starting material.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid bromide or acid chloride, but that's not indicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, and the reaction adds HI across the double bond. But again, the starting material doesn't have a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an epoxide, which would open with HI, but no.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI leads to the formation of an alcohol.

Wait, but how? If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a ketone in the substituent to an alcohol. But where would the ketone be?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a ketone, but that's not indicated in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a ketone, but again, the NMR doesn't show that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile, which upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus becomes an amine. But again, the starting material doesn't have a nitrile.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the data, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I'm not certain what reaction occurs, but the options suggest that the product would be either another benzoic acid derivative or a benzene with a substituent.

Looking at the options, option C is the same as the starting material, so it's not the product. So the product must be one of the others.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would imply that the substituent is a sec-butyl group and a methyl group. But the starting material has a COOH group, so that would require the COOH to be replaced by a methyl group, which doesn't make sense under these reaction conditions.

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Again, this would require the COOH group to be replaced, which I don't see happening.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would imply that the substituent is an ethyl group attached to the benzene, and the COOH is in another position.

But I'm not sure how that would form from the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the COOH group with a methyl group, but that would require a strong base, which I'm not sure HI provides.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the decarboxylation of the benzoic acid to form toluene. But I'm not sure about the conditions for that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, and the reaction is the reduction of a triple bond. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks indicative of an alkyne.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the data, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I'm not entirely sure what the product is, but perhaps the reaction doesn't change the COOH group, so the product remains a benzoic acid derivative.

But the options don't clearly indicate which reaction occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but the starting material is already a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it. For example, if the substituent is a ester group, then hydrolysis would give a carboxylic acid. But in that case, the starting material would have an ester, not a COOH group.

I'm really not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely involves a substitution or reduction. Considering the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and without any clear indication of a reaction that would change the COOH group, perhaps the product remains the same, which would be option C. But that's unlikely because the question implies a reaction occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the COOH group to a CH2OH group, but that's not supported by the reagents.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But again, the starting material is a carboxylic acid.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with option C as the starting material, and perhaps the reaction doesn't change the COOH group. Or maybe the reaction is something else I'm not considering.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid bromide, but that doesn't fit with the reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that requires a metal, which isn't present here.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option C, but I'm not certain.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data provided for Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The broad peak at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid or an ester. However, the broad peak at 10.5 ppm in the NMR strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.

### NMR Analysis:
- The **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)** peak is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
- The aromatic protons at **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H)** indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.
- The signals at **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**, **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**, **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**, and **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** suggest a branched alkyl group, likely a **sec-butyl group**, attached to the benzene ring.

### Structure of Compound X:
From the IR and NMR data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure consists of:
- A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at the para position.
- A sec-butyl group (-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)) attached to the benzene ring.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for hydrolysis reactions, such as the conversion of nitriles to carboxylic acids or the reduction of certain functional groups. However, since Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, the reaction conditions do not appear to alter the carboxylic acid group. The substituent on the benzene ring (the sec-butyl group) also does not suggest a reaction pathway that would change its structure under these conditions.

### Evaluation of Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure does not match the starting material or the reaction conditions, as the starting material has a sec-butyl group, not an ethyl group, and no propanoic acid group is formed.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure implies the removal of the carboxylic acid group and the addition of a methyl group, which is not consistent with the reaction conditions.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This matches the structure of Compound X. Since the reaction does not appear to alter the carboxylic acid group or the sec-butyl substituent, this is likely the starting material and not the product.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure suggests the removal of the carboxylic acid group and the addition of a methyl group, which is not supported by the reaction conditions.

### Conclusion:
The reaction conditions do not appear to modify the structure of Compound X. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that no reaction occurs, and the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
