Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about an electron state and measuring the probability of it being in certain eigenstates of an operator. Also, finding the average value of that operator. Oh boy, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try.

First, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. So I think the first step is to normalize this state. That is, find the coefficient so that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients equals 1.

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional, so the actual state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, multiplied by some normalization constant. So let's compute the norm of this vector. The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 + i). Because when you have a vector a|up> + b|down>, the norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2. Because (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 +1=2.

Wait, wait. No, that's correct. |a|^2 is a multiplied by its complex conjugate. So for (1+i), the conjugate is (1-i), so (1+i)(1-i)=1 -i^2=2. So yeah, 2.

Then for (2-i), the conjugate is (2 + i). So (2 - i)(2 +i)=4 +2i -2i -i^2 =4 - (-1) =5. So |2 -i|Â² is 5.

So the total squared norm is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the state |alpha> is (1/i) multiplied by 1/sqrt(7), because the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Wait no, the normalization is 1 over the square root of the sum. So the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt
