Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think that means they're the standard spin-up and spin-down states for the z-axis.

The task is to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator has a matrix representation where the elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. So the matrix is 2x2 since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles (since it's an electron, right?).

Wait, so let me think about the operator. The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 for i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So in a 2x2 matrix, that would look like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, operators are usually Hermitian, right? Because observables are represented by Hermitian operators. Is this matrix Hermitian? Let's check. For a matrix to be Hermitian, A_ij must equal the complex conjugate of A_ji. So, in this case, the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2, which are real numbers (since hbar is real, right?), so A_ij is equal to A_ji. So the matrix is symmetric, hence Hermitian. That makes sense because it's an observable operator.

Wait, but wait, the matrix as given has zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. So this operator is: A = (hbar/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). Alternatively, this can be written as (hbar/2)(σ_x), where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z
