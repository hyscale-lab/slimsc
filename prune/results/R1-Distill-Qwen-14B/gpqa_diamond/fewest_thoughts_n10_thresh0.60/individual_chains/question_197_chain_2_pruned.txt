Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find out what the final product is from the options given. They've provided the IR and NMR data for Compound X, so I think I should first analyze that to determine the structure of X.

Let's look at the IR data first. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad region, probably due to O-H or N-H stretches. But since the other peaks don't suggest amines, maybe it's an O-H from a carbonyl group. Wait, but there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ regions are around where aromatic C=C stretches appear, so there's probably a benzene ring involved.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR spectrum shows several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as a triplet or singlet, but sometimes it can be broader if there's some exchange happening.

Wait, but I also thought about carboxylic acids; their O-H protons are usually broad around 10-12 ppm. But the integration here is 1H, which matches an aldehyde. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde group. Alternatively, could it be a phenolic O-H? But phenols usually have a broader peak, maybe around 5-7 ppm, but sometimes if it's more acidic, like if it's attached to something electron-withdrawing, it could be upfield. Wait, no, the 10.5 ppm is more likely an aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: if the peak at 10.5 is a carbonyl group, but as a proton, it's the aldehyde. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group attached to a benzene ring. But
