Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm.

First, let me look at the given data. The IR shows strong absorption around 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either an O-H stretch (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or an N-H stretch, but since there's no N mentioned, maybe it's O-H. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. And other peaks around 1610 and 1450 cm-1, maybe C=C stretching or something else like aromatic rings. 

Looking at the NMR data: The 1H NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet, which is pretty high. That makes me think of an aldehyde proton (which is usually around 9-10 ppm), but wait, an aldehyde would have a triplet or something else, but here it's a broad singlet. Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton, which is typically around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – that looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the aromatic protons are in a doublet each, which suggests coupling between adjacent protons. So like, in a benzene ring where two protons are on the ortho positions relative to each other and para to substituents. Wait, no, wait, if it's a para substituent, the two protons would be adjacent in the NMR. Or maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. So, for example, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in opposite positions.

Then we have signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's think about what that could be. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is likely a methyl group attached to something that's split into a triplet, like a CH2CH3. So maybe a ethyl group somewhere. The d at 1.4 ppm (3H) might be a CH3 attached to a CH2 or something else. Like perhaps a CH(CH3) group, as in an isopropyl or maybe a butyl group.

Putting this together: The aromatic part is para-substituted. So maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (from the IR) and another group. The IR has a strong carbonyl at 1720, which could be a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 which is broad, which is more likely a carboxylic acid because the IR also shows a strong O-H stretch in the 3400-2500 range. So maybe the structure is a benzoic acid with a substituent.

Wait, but the IR also shows a 1610 cm-1, which is in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So this compound is likely an aromatic compound with a substituent and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the substituents on the benzene ring: if there's a COOH group, then perhaps another substituent. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is likely
