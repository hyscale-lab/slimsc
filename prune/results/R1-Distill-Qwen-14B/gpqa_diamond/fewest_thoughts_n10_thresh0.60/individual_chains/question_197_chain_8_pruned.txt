Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, then figuring out the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I think red phosphorus and HI are involved in some kind of substitution reaction, maybe something like a hydrohalogenation or elimination. Wait, no, wait—red phosphorus is often used in the hydroxymercuration reaction, but that's for alkenes. Or wait, maybe it's a different type of reaction. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used in the Bayer-Villiger oxidation? No, I'm getting confused. Oh wait, another reaction! I think when you have red phosphorus and HI, it's used for the substitution of certain groups, like maybe the formation of a ylide or in the Michaelis-Arburn reaction. Or wait, maybe it's for the substitution of a nitro group or something else. Wait, no, I'm getting off track. Let's start by figuring out what the original compound X is.

Looking at the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests O-H stretch, maybe a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But also, the 1720 cm-1 peak is indicative of a carbonyl group. So that could be an ester, ketone, or maybe a carboxylic acid, but wait, a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H peak around 3000-25
