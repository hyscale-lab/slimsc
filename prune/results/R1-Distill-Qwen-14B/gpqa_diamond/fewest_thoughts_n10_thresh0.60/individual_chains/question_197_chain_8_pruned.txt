Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since there are no NMR signals that would suggest amines, I'm thinking it's an O-H group, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but in the IR, the other strong peak is at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that's probably a carboxylic acid because the O-H and C=O together would fit that. Alternatively, it could be an ester or ketone, but the 3400 peak might suggest hydroxyl.

But wait, another peak is at 1610 cm-1. That's around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs. And 1450 cm-1 is another aromatic ring vibration, maybe the C-O stretching in phenols? But if it's a carboxylic acid, maybe the 1610 is the aromatic ring, and the 1720 is the carboxylic acid's carbonyl. So, maybe the compound has a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group.

Then the NMR data: Let's go through each signal.

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 is likely an -OH proton, like a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols' protons usually are around 1-5, but a carboxylic acid is usually broad around 10-12 ppm. So that fits with the IR data pointing towards a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. So, the protons are
