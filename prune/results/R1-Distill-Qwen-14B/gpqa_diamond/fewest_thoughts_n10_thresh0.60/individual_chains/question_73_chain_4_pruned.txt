Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, so I guess I need to compute both the relative speed and the total energy correctly.

First, let's tackle the relative speed. I remember that when you have two objects moving at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract their speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Because of the speed addition formula in special relativity, right? Oh wait, yeah, the formula is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, no, wait, that's when you're finding how one object's speed appears from the other's frame. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the astronauts are moving in the same direction. So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So from the perspective of astronaut A, what's the speed of astronaut B? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the question says, "relative speed." So I think it's the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. So if A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c, same direction, then from A's frame, B is moving at (vB - vA)/(1 - (vB vA)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Because in relativity, the relative velocity formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object and v is the velocity of the frame. So if we're finding the velocity of B as seen from A's frame, then u is B's velocity in the original frame, and v is A's velocity.

Wait, wait, no, no. Let me think again. The formula for the relative velocity when you have two frames moving at velocity v relative to each other is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So if we're in A
