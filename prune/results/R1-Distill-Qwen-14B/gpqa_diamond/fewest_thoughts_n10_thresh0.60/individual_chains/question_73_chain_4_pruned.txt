Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? Because when things are moving close to the speed of light, you can't just say 0.6c minus 0.5c equals 0.1c. No, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). But wait, u and v are the velocities of the two objects as observed from the same frame, I think.

Wait, but wait. Both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed is the difference between their speeds, but relativistically. So let me get the formula right. So if astronaut A is moving at u =0.6c, and astronaut B at v=0.5c, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c²)) ?

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. The relative speed depends on the frame of reference. If I want B's speed relative to A, I need to compute (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u is the speed of A as observed in the lab frame, and v is the speed of B in the lab frame. Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure.

Actually, the velocity of B as seen from A's frame would be (v - u) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). So u is A's speed in the lab frame (0.6c), and v is B's speed in the lab frame (0.5c). Wait, but wait a minute. If both are moving in the same direction, then from A's frame, B is moving slower. So v is 0.5c, which is less than u (0.6c), so the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1-(
