Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. The reaction is between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. I need to figure out what the major product is. Hmm, let's think about what I know.

First, I remember that cyclopent-1-enol is a cyclic enol. Enols can undergo various reactions, especially addition reactions. Bromine (Br2) is a dienophile in some cases, but wait, that's for dienes. Wait, no, cyclopent-1-enol isn't a diene, it's a cyclopentene ring with an enol group. Or wait, is it a cyclopentenol? Maybe I should draw the structure.

4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the cyclopentene ring has a double bond between C1 and C2. Then, the enol group is at C1 as well. So the structure is a five-membered ring where C1 is double-bonded to C2, and there's an -OH group attached to C1, or is it C2? Wait, wait. Enol structure: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl is on C2? Or C1? Let me think. In cyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl is on C1 because the enol form has the OH on the same carbon as the double bond. Wait, no, the enol form has the double bond adjacent to the
