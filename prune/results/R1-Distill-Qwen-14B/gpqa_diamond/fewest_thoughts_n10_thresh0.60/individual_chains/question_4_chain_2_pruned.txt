Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets are dipoles, meaning they have both a North and South pole, and you can't isolate just one pole. But the question is about how Maxwell's equations change in a different scenario.

First, I need to recall what Maxwell's equations are. There are four of them, each describing different aspects of electric and magnetic fields. Let me list them:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E is rho over epsilon_0. So ∇·E = ρ/ε₀.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of B is zero. ∇·B = 0.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is negative the time derivative of B. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of H is the current density plus the time derivative of D. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t.

Wait, wait. I think the exact phrasing might vary depending on whether you're using E and B or D and H, but the main ideas are the same.

Now, the question is about a universe where a magnet can have isolated poles. That means that a magnetic monopole exists. In our universe, we don't have monopoles, so the divergence of B is zero. But if monopoles existed, then ∇·B wouldn't be zero anymore. Because monopoles are like the magnetic equivalents of charges. So, Gauss's Law for magnetism would change.

Wait, how exactly? In our case, ∇·B = 0. But if there are magnetic charges (monopoles), then the divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. Like Gauss's law for E, which relates to electric charge, for B it would relate to magnetic charge. So, ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.

So in this scenario, Maxwell's equation for the divergence of B would change. That's one equation that would look different.

But the question is asking which equations are different. Are there more
