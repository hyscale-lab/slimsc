Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix ρ is located in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But wait, the question is about its geometrical position. I think that refers to the Bloch sphere representation.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out. So each term is a projector, and when you add them and multiply by 1/2, it's like an equal mixture of the states |0> and |1>.

Wait, wait. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state, the qubit is on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside. But how does this apply to density matrices?

I think the Bloch vector represents the density matrix in terms of coordinates on the Bloch sphere. For a general density matrix ρ, which is a 2x2 positive semi-definite matrix with trace 1, the Bloch vector r is found by expressing ρ in terms of the Pauli matrices.

The formula goes something like ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z). Let me write that down:

ρ = (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2.

So for the given ρ, it's (I)/2 plus something. Wait, because the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute |0><0| and |1><1| in terms of Pauli matrices.

I remember that |0><0| is (I + σ_z)/2. Similarly, |1><1| is (I - σ_z)/2. So if I add them together:

|0><0| + |1><1| = [(I + σ_z)/2] + [(I - σ_z)/2] = [I + σ_z + I - σ_z]/2 = (2I)/2 = I.

So ρ = (1/2)(I). That's interesting. So ρ is I/2.

Now, let's plug that into the Bloch vector formula. From ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Rearranging, 2ρ = I + r·σ. So, 2*(I/2) = I = I + r·σ.

Wait, that gives I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ. So the vector r must be zero. Because the only way the sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by their components equals zero is if each component is zero. So r = (0,0,0). 

So that would be option C. Let me check the options again. Option C is (0,0,0), which is the origin. That makes sense because the density matrix is a completely mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, a completely mixed state (like I/2) is at the center because it's maximally uncertain, so its Bloch vector is zero.

Let me think again. For a pure state |0>, the density matrix is |0><0|, which is (I + σ_z)/2. So the Bloch vector would be (0, 0, 1). Similarly, |1> would be (0,0,-1). But when you mix them equally, like (|0> + |1>)(<0| + <1|)/2, the density matrix becomes (I)/2, which is the maximally mixed state. So the vector is at the center, r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. A density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), we compute:

\[
\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| = \frac{I + \sigma_z}{2}, \quad \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| = \frac{I - \sigma_z}{2}.
\]

Adding these projectors:

\[
\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| = \frac{I + \sigma_z}{2} + \frac{I - \sigma_z}{2} = I.
\]

Thus, the given \( \rho \) simplifies to:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

Substituting this into the Bloch vector formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
2\rho = I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}.
\]

Since \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), we find:

\[
I = I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}.
\]

Subtracting \( I \) from both sides:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0.
\]

This implies \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Therefore, the geometrical position of \( \rho \) in the qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).
