Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The problem says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator A is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The equation given is Ay(φ) = a(φ), where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix Ay is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0].

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. For a spin-1/2 particle, like an electron or muon, the spin matrices are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh right, the intrinsic angular momentum operator S is ħ/2 times these matrices. But wait, in this case, the matrix S is given as [0 -i; i 0]. Let me think—does that match any Pauli matrix?

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Yes, that's exactly what S is. So S is σy. Therefore, Ay is c * σy. And c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, I need to solve the eigenvalue equation Ay |φ> = a |φ>. Alternatively, in matrix form, (Ay - a I) |φ> = 0. The eigenvalues a are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So let's compute the matrix Ay. Since S is σy, which is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], multiplying by c = h/(4π) gives:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
So each element is multiplied by h/(4π).

The matrix becomes [[0, -i (h/(4π))], [i (h/(4π)), 0]].

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to factor out constants. Since S is σy, and Ay = c S, the eigenvalues of Ay are c times the eigenvalues of S. Because if S has eigenvalues s, then Ay has eigenvalues c*s.

What are the eigenvalues of S (σy)? The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but wait wait, let me think. Wait no, the spin matrices S for spin-1/2 particles are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So for S being (σy), the eigenvalues of S would be (ħ/2)(±1). But wait, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, the spin operator S is ħ/2 * σ, so each component Sx, Sy, Sz is (ħ/2) times the respective Pauli matrix. But in this problem, S is given as the matrix [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] which is σy. So S is σy, which is the Pauli matrix. So the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1? Wait no, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. But wait, wait, S is given as [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], which is σy, which is a Pauli matrix. So the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1, but scaled by (ħ/2) for the spin operator. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the Pauli matrices and the actual spin operators. Let me think again. The intrinsic angular momentum operator for a spin-1/2 particle is S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli vector. So each component, like Sy, is (ħ/2) σy. So the matrix for Sy would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli y matrix. So in this problem, the matrix S is σy, meaning that the operator is S = σy. But that can't be right because the spin operator should include the ħ/2 factor. Wait, but in the problem statement, Ay is c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. So that would make Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. But if S is σy, then Ay would be (h/(4π)) * σy. Let me compute the eigenvalues of Ay.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed directly. The eigenvalues of a matrix M are found by solving det(M - a I) = 0.

So let's compute the characteristic equation for Ay.

Ay is 2x2:

[ 0*(c)        (-i c) ]
[ i c          0 ]

Wait, actually, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so when multiplied by c, which is h/(4π), the matrix becomes:

Ay = [ [0, -i c], [i c, 0] ]

So the matrix is:

Row 1: [ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]

Row 2: [ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

So the matrix Ay is:

[ 0,          -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π),    0        ]

Now, the determinant equation is det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a,          -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π),    -a       ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) (i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating each part:

(-a)(-a) = a².

The other term: [ (-i) * (i) ] * (h/(4π))².

(-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So the determinant is a² - [ (1) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ] = 0.

So the equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

Solving this, a² = h²/(16 π²), so a = ± h/(4 π).

So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4 π). Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any option that says the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). Let me check the options again.

Option A: Im(a) are ±2πh, Re(a) are ±h/(4π). That can’t be right because the eigenvalues are real, I think. Wait, because the matrix Ay is Hermitian?

Wait, is Ay a Hermitian matrix? Because angular momentum operators are Hermitian. Let me check: Ay is [ [0, -i c], [i c, 0] ]

The Hermitian conjugate is [ [0, i c], [ -i c, 0 ] ].

Wait, so if c is real, then the Hermitian conjugate is [ [0, i c], [ -i c, 0 ] ], which is not the same as the original matrix, unless c=0, which it's not. So wait, perhaps S is not Hermitian? Or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian because each is equal to its conjugate transpose. Let me check: the conjugate transpose of S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as S. Because S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], so the conjugate would change the signs of the imaginary parts.

Wait, the (1,2) element is -i. Conjugate is i. So S's conjugate transpose would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]] which is the same as S because the (2,1) element is i. So yeah, S is Hermitian.

Wait, so then Ay = c * S, with c being real (h/(4π)), so Ay is Hermitian as well. That means its eigenvalues should be real. So the eigenvalues are real numbers.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the eigenvalues, I got a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real. So option A suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which can't be right because the matrix is Hermitian. So option A is not correct.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation. The determinant equation was a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0. So a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, just ± h/(4π).

Looking again at the options:

Option B: The imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That would give complex eigenvalues, which can't be right because Ay is Hermitian. So Option B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Hmm, A² is the square of the angular momentum operator. For spin-1/2 particles, A² would have eigenvalues (since A is the total angular momentum, but wait, wait. Wait, in this problem, A is the intrinsic angular momentum, so perhaps A^2 would be (Sx² + Sy² + Sz²). But wait, in this case, we're dealing with the Y-component operator.

Wait, but each component of angular momentum satisfies S² = (Sx² + Sy² + Sz²) = (ħ/2)^2 * 3, because for spin-1/2, S² is ħ² s(s+1), where s=1/2, so (1/2)(3/2) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². So A² here, if A is the operator, would have eigenvalues (3/4) ħ². But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if Ay is one component, then A² is the square of the vector operator, which commutes with each component. So eigenfunctions of Ay would also be eigenfunctions of A². Because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions.

Wait, so if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it must also be an eigenfunction of A². So the statement in option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So that's correct? Because A² commutes with all components, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². But the eigenfunctions of Ay won't generally be eigenfunctions of Az, because Ay and Az don't commute. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure. Basis functions probably refer to the eigenbasis. So the matrix in its eigenbasis is diagonal, so its eigenfunctions form a basis. But I'm not sure if option D is correct. Alternatively, perhaps since Ay is 2x2, it has two eigenvectors, which form a basis for the space, so any vector can be expressed as a combination of these.

But let's think about the statements.

Option C is about the eigenfunctions. Since Ay commutes with A², their eigenfunctions are the same. So φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². But it won't be an eigenfunction of Az because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something, so their eigenfunctions are different.

So option C is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

Looking back, the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, that makes sense. So option C would be correct.

Looking again at the other options:

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the term "basis functions" is a bit ambiguous. In linear algebra, any set of eigenvectors that form a basis can be considered the basis for the operator. So if the operator is diagonal in its eigenbasis, then yes. So perhaps option D is also correct.

Wait, but the operator's matrix is given, and the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator. Because when you diagonalize the matrix, the eigenvectors form the basis. So option D is correct.

But wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So I need to figure out which is correct.

Wait, during calculation, when you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So that's correct.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, the question gives four options. Let's see:

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Which one is correct?

Well, option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So that's a correct statement.

Option D is also correct, perhaps. Because when you diagonalize the matrix, the eigenfunctions form the basis.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But that's not possible because it's a multiple-choice question.

Wait, no, let me reexamine the options.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so their eigenfunctions don't overlap.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That is, the eigenvectors form the basis for the space on which Ay acts. Which they do, because any 2x2 matrix can be diagonalized, and the eigenvectors form a basis. So option D is correct as well.

But wait, looking at the options, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps only one option is correct. Let me see.

If I made a mistake earlier, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π). So the real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So looking back at option A: it says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and the real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't fit because the eigenvalues are real. So option A is incorrect.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That would imply complex eigenvalues, which can't be correct since Ay is Hermitian. So B is incorrect.

So the correct options are either C or D.

Wait, but let me think about option D. The statement says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So when you have a matrix operator, its eigenfunctions form a basis in which the operator is diagonal. So yes, the eigenfunctions are a basis for the operator, but I'm not sure if that's what option D is exactly saying.

Alternatively, option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form the basis for the matrix operator. So in that sense, option D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which is correct during the calculation. So when you calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you find that the eigenvectors form a basis. So both C and D could be correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, but the options are separate, so only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the basis functions are the eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π). Let's compute the eigenvectors.

For a = h/(4π), the matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -h/(4π),   -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π),  -h/(4π) ]

We can write the equations:

(-h/(4π)) φ1 + (-i h/(4π)) φ2 = 0

(i h/(4π)) φ1 + (-h/(4π)) φ2 = 0

Simplify by multiplying both sides by 4π/h:

-φ1 - i φ2 = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2

Similarly, the second equation:

i φ1 - φ2 = 0 → i φ1 = φ2

Substituting φ1 from the first equation into the second: i (-i φ2) ) = φ2 → (-i²) φ2 = φ2 → (1) φ2 = φ2, which holds.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i φ2, φ2 ] or, choosing φ2 =1, [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly, for a = -h/(4π), the matrix Ay + a I is:

[ h/(4π),   -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π),  h/(4π) ]

So the equations are:

h/(4π) φ1 - i h/(4π) φ2 = 0 → φ1 = i φ2

i h/(4π) φ1 + h/(4π) φ2 = 0 → i φ1 + φ2 = 0 → substituting φ1 = i φ2, we get i*(i φ2) + φ2 = 0 → (-1 φ2) + φ2 =0 → 0=0. So the eigenvectors are proportional to [i, 1].

So the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [i, 1 ].

These vectors form a basis for the space, so option D is correct.

But I'm getting confused between options C and D.

So to recap:

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Which one is correct?

In quantum mechanics, any operator's eigenstates form a basis for the space. So option D is correct. But also, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² because they commute. So option C is correct as well.

Wait, but in the problem, we're dealing with a 2x2 matrix, which could only have two eigenfunctions. So each eigenfunction is a vector in C², which has dimension 2. So the eigenfunctions are a basis for the space, so D is correct.

But the problem is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct. But the options are four, and only one is correct.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of an operator form a basis for the space on which the operator acts. So D is a correct statement.

But I'm not sure if all the options are correct. Let me think about the knowledge required.

In the case of spin-1/2 systems, the eigenfunctions of Sy (which is what Ay is) are not eigenfunctions of Sz because Sy and Sz don't commute. So any eigenstate of Sy will not be an eigenstate of Sz. So the statement in option C is correct.

Additionally, since A^2 (the square of the angular momentum) commutes with Sy, the eigenfunctions of Sy are also eigenfunctions of A^2. So option C is correct.

So both C and D seem correct, but I can't have two correct answers. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps option D is incorrect because the matrix operator's basis is not necessarily the same as the eigenfunctions. Wait, for a diagonalizable matrix, the eigenfunctions form a basis. So D is correct.

But in the problem, the matrix is 2x2, so it must have two eigenfunctions, which are linearly independent and form a basis. So option D is correct.

But I'm confused because the question gives four options, and only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should evaluate each option.

Option C: Correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A².

Option D: Also correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But the options are presented as mutually exclusive, so only one can be correct.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think about the options again.

Looking back:

The eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, and thus the imaginary parts are zero. So option A's statement about imaginary parts being ±2πh can't be correct.

Option B's eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts, which is impossible. So options A and B are incorrect.

So the correct options are either C or D.

Now, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me think about the process.

When solving for eigenvalues and eigenvectors, what do I do? I set up the eigenvalue equation, find the eigenvalues, then find the eigenvectors. The eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so option D is correct because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

But also, since A² commutes with Ay, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

Wait, but the question provides four options, and only one is correct. So which is it?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the correct statements during the calculation. So while calculating eigenvectors, which statements are correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Yes, because the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis.

So perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, considering the problem statement, it says the matrix operator is 2x2, so the eigenfunctions are a basis. So option D is correct.

But I'm still confused because I thought C is also correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, let me think about what the eigenfunctions are of A^2.

A^2 is Sx^2 + Sy^2 + Sz^2. Since A is the intrinsic angular momentum, A^2 is fixed for a spin-1/2 particle. So any eigenstate of Ay will also be an eigenstate of A^2, because A^2 commutes with Ay.

So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A^2. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because any operator's eigenvectors form a basis for the space.

Hmmm, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct, but the options are presented as four separate options, with only one correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the options. Let me read option D again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

In quantum mechanics, 'basis functions' refers to the basis vectors of the space. So the eigenvectors φ form a basis for the space, which is correct. So option D is correct.

But I'm not sure if the problem expects only one correct statement. Let me think again.

Given that the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Which is correct?

Well, both statements are correct. But perhaps in the context of the problem, only one is presented as correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the statement is about the eigenvectors, while option C is about commuting operators.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should pick option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the question gives four options, and I've determined that the eigenvalues are real (so options A and B are wrong), and I'm left with C and D.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, the problem says that Ay is the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator. So A² would be the square of the intrinsic angular momentum, which is (Sx² + Sy² + Sz²). For a spin-1/2 particle, this would be ( (ħ/2)^2 )(3) )= (3 ħ²)/4. So A² has eigenvalue 3ħ²/4, and any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A², because they commute.

So option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D is correct because the eigenfunctions are a basis for the space, so they are the basis functions.

But since the options are mutually exclusive, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D because the matrix operator's eigenfunctions are the basis.

But I'm not entirely certain. Wait, the question is, during the calculation, which statement is correct.

I think I should pick option C as correct because it's a specific statement about the relationship between Ay and A² and Az.

So, given all the confusion, I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves determining the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component angular momentum operator \( A_y \), represented by the matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( A_y \) is Hermitian because \( S \) is Hermitian and \( c \) is real. Therefore, its eigenvalues are real.
   - The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues are \( a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - The eigenvalues are real, so any statement suggesting imaginary parts for the eigenvalues (e.g., options A and B) is incorrect.

2. **Eigenfunctions of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \) are computed and found to be linearly independent. These eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional space, meaning the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions of the operator \( A_y \) (option D is correct).

3. **Relationship with \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \):**
   - The operator \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (option C is correct).

4. **Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues are real, not complex, so the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are zero.
   - **Option B:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues are real, not complex, so the statement about imaginary parts being \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts being \( \pm 1 \) is false.
   - **Option C:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \), as \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.
   - **Option D:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional space, making them the basis functions of the operator.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, since the question specifies a single correct answer, the focus on the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \) makes option C the most appropriate choice.

### Conclusion:

The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but they are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This aligns with the commutation relations and the properties of angular momentum operators.

**Answer: C**
