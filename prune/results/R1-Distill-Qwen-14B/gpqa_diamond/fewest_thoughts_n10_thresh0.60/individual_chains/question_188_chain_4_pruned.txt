Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances in crystals are calculated using some formula involving the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, right? Oh right, rhombohedral means all the edges are equal and all angles are the same. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the lattice parameter a, right? Because in a cubic system, the interatomic distance is the edge length. But rhombohedral isn't cubic, but since all edges are equal, a is the same in all directions.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ), but wait, no, I'm getting that mixed up. Oh wait, no, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ), but wait, I think that's for a general hexagonal or other systems. Wait, no, that's actually for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles between them. But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles
