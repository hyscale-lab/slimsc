Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and an average value for a given operator. Alright, let's see.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, so I think I need to normalize this first. So, to find the actual state, I should divide by the normalization factor.

Let's compute the normalization factor. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients. So for each coefficient, I take the absolute value squared and add them.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). Let me compute their magnitudes.

For (1+i), the magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

For (2 - i), the magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.

So the total is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is sqrt(7), and the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the problem asks about the eigenstates of an operator with matrix elements A_ij. The operator has elements Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. The operator is a 2x2 matrix because the state is in a two-level system (since it's expressed in terms of |up> and |down>).

Wait, let me write out the matrix A. For a 2x2 matrix, the indices go from 1 to 2 (or 0 and 1, but same idea). So A_11 = 0, A_22 =0. A_12 = ħ/2, A_21 = ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0      ħ/2
  ħ/2     0 ]

Hmm, I've seen this kind of matrix before. It resembles the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and Y
