Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says a chemist did two reactions with two unknown compounds, treating them with different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually, looking again: Reaction A gives (R)-, and reaction B gives (S)-. So when each starting material is treated with a different reducing agent, the results are enantiomers? Or maybe they're diastereomers? Hmm, not entirely sure yet.

The question is asking which starting materials A and B are, given the options provided. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different compounds for A and B. All the options have the same structure but different configurations (R or S) for A and B.

Wait, the products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one but with R and S configurations. So the products are enantiomers of each other. So that must mean that the starting materials were epimers or something that, upon reduction, led to enantiomers.

Wait, no, the products are (R) and (S), but wait, is that correct? Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. Pyran-2-one is a
