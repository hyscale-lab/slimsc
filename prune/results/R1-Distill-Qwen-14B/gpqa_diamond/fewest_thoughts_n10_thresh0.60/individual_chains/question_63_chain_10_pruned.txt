Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. So, this combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the fundamental state is probably the lowest energy state. So, when it absorbs a photon, it'll move to the next higher energy state. Now, the next state with the lowest energy—so I guess that's the first excited state.

But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotation and vibration. So, the energy transitions would involve changes in both rotational and vibrational quantum numbers. But I'm not entirely sure how these are treated together.

I remember that for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as well. The vibrational energy levels are given by the formula E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0 for ground state, v=1 for first excited, etc.). The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number.

In the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but in the non-rigid rotor (like the vibration-rotation model), the bond length can change, so the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy transitions.

Wait, the question is about a photon being absorbed. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the initial and final states. The initial state is the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state—so that's probably the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, initial state would have v=0 and J=0 or maybe J=1? Wait, no, for rotation, the ground state is J=0. So initial state is v=0, J=0.

Now, the next state with the lowest energy would involve the smallest possible increase in energy. So perhaps the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or its rotational state. But which transition would require less energy?

The vibrational energy levels have a much
