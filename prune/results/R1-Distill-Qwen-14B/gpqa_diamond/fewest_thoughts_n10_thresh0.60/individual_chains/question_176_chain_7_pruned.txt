Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but I think in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they must be normalized. Oh wait, the vector given is (-1, 2, 1). Let's check its normalization.

The norm would be the square root of the sum of squares of the elements. So that's sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the state vector isn't normalized yet. But wait, I think the state should be normalized because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are unit vectors. Alternatively, maybe the given vector is already normalized? Let me calculate: 1 +4 +1 is 6, so the norm is sqrt(6). So perhaps the state is not normalized. Hmm, but maybe the vector is already normalized, but that can't be because 6 isn't 1. Oh wait, wait, I might have misread the vector. Let's see, the state is (-1, 2,1). So the components are -1, 2, and 1. So yeah, the norm is sqrt(6). So perhaps we need to normalize it before proceeding. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must have a norm of 1 for probabilities to make sense.

Wait, but the question is about measuring P and then Q. So perhaps the initial state is the given vector, but maybe it's already normalized. Wait, perhaps I should proceed without normalizing for now and see if it affects the final probability.

The operator P is given by a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, not sure what P represents. It might be an observable, so presumably Hermitian, but let me check. The matrix for P should be Hermitian because observables are Hermitian. Let's see: the (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), the (2,1) is also 1/sqrt(2), so that's symmetric. The (2,3) element is 1/sqrt(2), and (3,2) is 1/sqrt(2), same as (2,3). The diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So yes, it's symmetric, so it's Hermitian. So P is a valid observable.

The operator Q is given as a diagonal matrix: first row 1,0,0; second row 0,0,0; third row 0,0,-1. So Q is also diagonal and thus Hermitian, so it's a valid observable.

The question is: what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first and then Q? So it's a sequential measurement. After measuring P and getting 0, the system collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q on that state would yield the probability of -1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first, we measure P. The possible eigenvalues of P need to be found.

Wait, let me think. The operator P is a 3x3 matrix. To find its eigenvalues, we can compute the characteristic equation det(P - Î»I) = 0.

So the matrix P is:
Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2
