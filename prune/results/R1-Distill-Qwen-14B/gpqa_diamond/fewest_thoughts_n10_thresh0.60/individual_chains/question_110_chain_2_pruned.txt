Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph and HIRES spectrograph. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about these instruments. 

ESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory, which is in Chile, and HIRES is at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Both are high-resolution spectrographs, but I think their brightness limits differ.

Wait, the problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So that's V < 17, since brighter means lower magnitude. HIRES can go to brighter than 16 mag, so V <16. So the same star needs to be within both limits, meaning the apparent V magnitude has to be less than 16, because that's the stricter condition. So any star with V mag less than 16 can be seen by both.

Wait, no. Wait, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, meaning V up to 17. HIRES can observe up to 16. So a star must have V <16 to be visible by both. Because if it's between 16 and 17, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So only stars with V <16 can be seen by both.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, it's the apparent magnitude. The lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. So for ESPRESSO, the stars must be brighter than
