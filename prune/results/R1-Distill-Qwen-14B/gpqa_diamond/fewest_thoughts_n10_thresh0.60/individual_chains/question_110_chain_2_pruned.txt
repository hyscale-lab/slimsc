Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. Hmm, the question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. So, I need to figure out which stars are bright enough for both instruments based on their apparent magnitudes.

First, I remember that both telescopes have different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. So, the star's apparent V magnitude has to be ≤16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. That means the star must have an apparent magnitude ≤16 because that's the stricter limit. Wait, no, wait. Because the question is asking which stars can be observed by both. So, the star must be within each telescope's brightness capability. So, a star must have an apparent V mag ≤16 to be observed by HIRES, and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. So any star that is ≤16 in apparent V mag can be seen by both, because HIRES can't see beyond 16, but ESPRESSO can see up to 17. So, the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤16.

Wait, no. Because to be detected by both, the star needs to be bright enough for both. So, it needs to be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, no. Wait,
