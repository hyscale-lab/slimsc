Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and it's moving toward the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. And the light is going in the same direction as the glass's movement. Hmm. I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed depends on the medium's index of refraction. Oh right, the general formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But in this case, the medium itself is moving.

So, I'm thinking maybe I should consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh wait, but wait, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, so perhaps using the relativistic velocity addition formula would be necessary here.

Wait a second, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is moving through the glass, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is the ratio of c to the speed of light in the medium. So inside the glass, the speed of light is v_glass = c/n.

But from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, how does that speed change? Oh, right, because the glass is
