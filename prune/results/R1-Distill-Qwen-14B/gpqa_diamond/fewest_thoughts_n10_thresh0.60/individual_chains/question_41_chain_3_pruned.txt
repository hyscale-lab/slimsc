Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see what the question says. A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember something about how light speed in a medium depends on the medium's properties and its motion relative to the observer. Oh right, in a medium at rest, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the medium is moving.

So, the glass is moving. I think this involves relativistic considerations, but wait, the speed v is probably non-relativistic because the options don't look like they involve gamma factors. So maybe I should approach this using the velocity addition formula from classical mechanics, or perhaps it's different.

Wait, no, in classical mechanics, the velocity of the light as observed would just be the sum of the medium's velocity and the light's velocity in the medium. But I'm not sure if that's correct. I remember that in a moving medium, the speed of light isn't simply additive because the medium's motion affects the light's speed, but perhaps in a non-relativistic case, it's additive.

Wait, another thought: the speed of light in the glass in its own rest frame is c/n. So if the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction
