Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound X, which undergoes a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Then, I need to figure out the final product. The options are all different organic compounds, so I need to figure out what X is first, and then what the reaction does.

The data given are the IR and NMR spectra of compound X. Let's look at the IR first. The IR peaks can tell us about functional groups. The big peaks are in the regions 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, usually indicating O-H or N-H stretches. But since this is probably an organic compound without nitrogen, it's more likely an O-H group, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but wait, I also see a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is typical for carboxylic acids (around 1700-1725 cm-1), esters, ketones, etc. Another peak at 1610 cm-1, which is around the region for aromatic C=C stretching. And 1450 cm-1 might be another aromatic ring vibration, maybe a bending or another stretching.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H), which is a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because the broad peak around 10 ppm is typical for the -OH in a carboxylic acid. Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets suggest two sets of protons, each integrating to 2H. So, like a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions, each causing the neighboring H's to split into doublets. So the substituents are probably at para positions.

Then, there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet integrating to 1H. That might be a methylene or a methine group attached to
