Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. Let me see what the question is about.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, when you have a benzylic or allylic hydrogen, red phosphorus and HI can lead to a substitution reaction, like dehydrohalogenation or maybe elimination. Or wait, maybe it's more about the addition? No, wait, I think it's a reaction where the phosphorus helps in removing a halogen, maybe leading to an alkyne or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that part. Alternatively, I think that red phosphorus can cause the elimination of HX (like HI) from a compound, leading to the formation of an alkene. Or wait, perhaps it's more about the formation of a more substituted double bond via a dehydrohalogenation. Or maybe it's the phosphorus-induced elimination, like the Wurtz reaction? No, Wurtz is when two alkyl halides are reacted in presence of sodium, leading to elimination of a halide and forming a longer carbon chain. Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible reaction first.

But wait, the problem is about identifying the product, so maybe I should first figure out what Compound X is from the given spectroscopic data. Once I know X, I can predict what the product would be after reacting with red phosphorus and HI.

So the IR and NMR data are given. Let me look at the IR first. The IR peaks are: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, maybe O-H stretch or an alcohol. But the other peaks: 1720, which is likely a carbonyl (C=O) group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. Then 1610 and 1450 cm-1. These are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring, and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. A
