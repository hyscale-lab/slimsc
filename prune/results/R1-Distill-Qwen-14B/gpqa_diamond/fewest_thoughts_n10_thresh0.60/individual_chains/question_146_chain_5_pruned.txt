Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major product when 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene reacts with maleic anhydride. Hmm, I remember that maleic anhydride is a dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions. So, the first thing that comes to mind is that this is a Diels-Alder reaction question.

Wait, Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. The diene should be conjugated and in the s-cis conformation. The molecule given is 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. Let me visualize that structure. Cyclopenta-1,3-diene means a five-membered ring with double bonds at positions 1 and 3. Oh wait, waitâ€”no, cyclopentadiene would have two double bonds? Wait, no, 1,3-diene would have a conjugated diene in a five-membered ring. So the structure is like a cyclopentene with double bonds at 1,3 positions, making it conjugated. So, the molecule is cyclopentadiene with a fluorine at position 5.

Wait, numbering the cyclopentadiene... so if the ring is numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in a five-membered ring. The double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4? So the structure is fluorine on carbon 5, and double bonds between
