Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y, and then choose the correct statement from the options given.

Wait, right, the intrinsic angular momentum for a muon is similar to spin-1/2 particles like electrons. The spin matrices are typically represented by S_x, S_y, S_z, each being proportional to the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, in this case, S is given as a specific matrix. So let's think about that.

The matrix S is:
[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]
Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices (which are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) are 2x2. The S matrices for angular momentum are usually (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. But here, S is given, so let's see.

Wait, the operator A_y is c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π). So let's compute A_y first.

Let me write down S:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So, c = h/(4π). So A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

So, A_y will be:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                 [i, 0]]

Which simplifies to:

A_y = [[0, -i h/(4π)],
       [i h/(4π), 0]]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of A_y, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

The matrix A_y minus a I is:

[[-a, -i h/(4π)],
 [i h/(4π), -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating each part:

(-a)(-a) = a²
The other term is (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))². Let's compute that:

(-i)(i) = -i² = -( -1 ) = 1. So that term becomes (1) * (h²)/(16 π²).

So the determinant is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So, a² = (h²)/(16 π²)
Taking square roots: a = ± h/(4 π)

Wait, wait a second. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers. Hmm, but looking at the options, options A and B mention both real and imaginary parts. That suggests that maybe I made a mistake because the eigenvalues are real, not complex.

Wait, let's double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me redo the determinant.

The matrix A_y - a I is:

Row 1: [-a , (-i h)/(4π) ]
Row 2: [ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

So, (-a)(-a) is a².

The product of the other two elements: (-i)*(i) is (-i²) = 1. Because i * (-i) = -(i^2) = -(-1)=1. Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. Wait, the elements are (-i h/(4π)) and (i h/(4π)).

So when I multiply them, it's (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))^2.

(-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is 1 * (h²)/(16 π²).

So the determinant becomes a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4 π). So any option that talks about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts can be dismissed.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh or ±h/(4π). Since the eigenvalues are real, that's not correct.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real ±1. That also can't be right because our a is h/(4π), which is a real number, not 1.

Options C and D: Let's think about them. 

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

Hmm, A squared would be (c S)^2 = c² S². Let's compute S².

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S squared is:

First element (1,1): (0)(0) + (-i)(i) = 0 + (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

(1,2): (0)(-i) + (-i)(0) = 0.

(2,1): (i)(0) + (0)(i) = 0.

(2,2): (i)(-i) + (0)(0) = (-i^2) = -(-1)=1.

So S² is [[1, 0], [0, 1]] = I.

So A^2 = c² S² = c² I. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A², because when you apply A², you get c² times the eigenvalue squared times the eigenfunction. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A^2. So option C says that they can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That can't be right because the eigenfunctions of Ay (which are in the S_y direction) are orthogonal to those of S_z (the z-direction). Wait, but for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates of S_x, S_y, and S_z are mutually non-commuting, so their eigenstates are not the same. So the eigenfunctions of Ay (S_y) are not eigenfunctions of Az (S_z). So option C is correct in stating that they can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. So C could be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not sure. The basis functions of the matrix operator would likely refer to the eigenvectors forming a basis. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the two eigenvectors (which are orthogonal) form a basis for the space, so D could be correct. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors of an observable form an orthogonal basis. So D seems correct as well.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So I need to see which statements are correct based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, let's think again about the eigenvalues. We found that the eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π). So any option suggesting complex eigenvalues is wrong. So option A and B are incorrect.

Now, option C: Can the eigenfunctions of Ay be eigenfunctions of A^2? Yes, because A^2 is a multiple of the identity matrix. So any vector is an eigenstate of A², with eigenvalue c² multiplied by the square of the eigenvalue of A. So for any vector, including the eigenvectors of Ay, they are eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of option C is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since Az is S_z scaled, and the eigenstates of S_y and S_z are orthogonal and not the same, the eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenstates of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the matrix operator's basis functions would be its eigenvectors, which form a basis. So eigenfunctions of Ay form a basis for the space, so D is correct. But wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct? Wait, looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis, but the basis is generally the set of all possible eigenvectors. So D is correct in saying that the eigenfunctions form a basis. But all vectors in a 2D space can be expressed as linear combinations of the eigenvectors, so D is correct.

But wait, the question is which statement is correct. So between C and D, which is correct?

C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² is (c S)^2 = c² S² = c² I, which commutes with everything. So any state is an eigenstate of A². Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since Az is another component, which doesn't share eigenvectors with Ay, the second part is correct. So C is correct.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalue and eigenvectors. So perhaps the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis functions of the operator. Wait, I'm a bit confused. The basis functions of the operator Ay refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal, which are its eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors, so D is correct.

Wait, but the question is multiple-choice, and only one option is correct. Let me review each option again.

Option A: Im eigenvalue are ±2πh or ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Im part ±1/2, real ±1. No.

Option C: Eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Correct because A² is identity scaled, so any state is eigenfunction. So any eigenfunction of Ay is eigenfunction of A². But not of Az, as they are different directions.

Option D: Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. So the eigenvectors form the basis. Yes, because any 2x2 matrix's eigenvectors (if distinct) form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, only one is correct.

Hmm. Let me think about the statements.

Option C says eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2. Since A^2 is proportional to identity, every vector is an eigenstate of A^2. So the eigenstates of Ay are eigenstates of A^2, but not of Az. So C is correct.

Option D says eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. The basis functions would be the eigenvectors, which are the eigenfunctions. So D is correct.

Wait, but wait, if the matrix is diagonal in its eigenbasis, then the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C and D are correct. But since the options are individual, perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the eigenvalues. Let me recheck.

Wait, earlier when I computed A_y = c S, and then found the eigenvalues a = ±c. Because A_y is c times S, and S has eigenvalues ±1/2. Wait, wait, wait a minute.

Wait, wait a second! Wait, the Pauli matrices (like S_x, S_y, S_z) have eigenvalues ±1/2. Because for spin-1/2 particles, S² = (ħ/2)^2 (σ·σ) =  (ħ²/4) I, so the eigenvalues of S are ± ħ/2. Oh wait wait, no, the S matrices are (ħ/2)σ, so for each component, S_i has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, no, Wait. Let me think again.

Intrinsic angular momentum operator is given by J = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So each component, J_x, J_y, J_z are (ħ/2) σ_x, etc.

So the eigenvalues of J_i are ± ħ/2.

In this problem, S is given, but without any scaling. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The question says: "the matrix operator has the form Ay = c·S; where the constant c=h/4π and S being a 2×2 matrix." So, Ay = (h/4π) * S.

So, S is the given matrix, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let's compute the eigenvalues of S.

The trace of S is 0 + 0 = 0. The determinant of S is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i²) = 0 - ( - (-1) )) → wait, (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is 0 -1 = -1? Wait, no. Wait, determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - [ (-i)(i) ] = 0 - [ (-i²) ] = 0 - [ ( - (-1) ) ] → 0 - (1) → determinant is -1.

Wait, for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]], determinant is ad - bc.

So for S: a=0, d=0, b=-i, c=i.

So det(S) = (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i²) → - ( - (-1) ), because i²=-1. So let's compute:

(-i) * (i) = (-i^2) = - (i^2) = - (-1) = 1. So determinant is 0 - 1 = -1.

The trace is 0.

So the eigenvalues of S are roots of λ² - tr(S) λ + det(S) = 0 → λ² - 0 λ -1 = λ² -1=0 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1.

Then, since A_y = c * S = (h/(4π)) * S.

So the eigenvalues of A_y are c times the eigenvalues of S. So a = c * λ.

So a = (h/(4π)) * (±1) → a = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, as I found earlier.

So options A and B are wrong because they suggest complex eigenvalues.

Looking back at the options, only C and D are possible.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

As I thought earlier, since A^2 is (c S)^2 = c² S². What's S squared?

Compute S²:

S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
S² = S * S.

First row, first column: (0)(0) + (-i)(i) = 0 + (-i²) = -(-1) = 1.

First row, second column: (0)(-i) + (-i)(0) = 0 + 0 = 0.

Second row, first column: (i)(0) + (0)(i) = 0 + 0 = 0.

Second row, second column: (i)(-i) + (0)(0) = -i² + 0 = -(-1) = 1.

So S² = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] = I.

So A_y squared is (c S)^2 = c² S² = c² I.

So A^2 is c² I. So any vector is an eigenstate of A^2 with eigenvalue c². So the eigenfunctions of A_y are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of option C is correct.

The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since Az corresponds to the z-component of angular momentum, which would be a different operator. The eigenstates of Ay and Az are related but not the same. For example, the eigenstates of S_y are superpositions of the eigenstates of S_z. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. The basis functions of the operator would typically refer to the eigenvectors, which form a basis. Since the matrix is 2x2, the two eigenvectors (assuming distinct eigenvalues, which they are) form a basis. So D is correct. But the question is among the options which is correct, and both C and D could be correct. But looking back, the options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps all four options are claims about the process, and the correct one is the one that is true.

Let me think again about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

That's correct because any vector is eigenfunction of A², and the eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. That would also be correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Hmm, but the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options are given as four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of S². Let me recompute S squared.

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
S squared:

Row 1, column 1: (0)(0) + (-i)(i) = 0 + (-i^2) → (-i^2)= -(-1)=1.

Row 1, column 2: (0)(-i) + (-i)(0) = 0.

Row 2, column 1: (i)(0) + (0)(i) = 0.

Row 2, column 2: (i)(-i) + (0)(0) = -i^2 = -(-1)=1.

So yes, S² is the identity matrix. So A^2 is c² I.

So any vector is an eigenstate of A^2, so the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A^2. So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. The basis functions would be the set of vectors that diagonalize Ay, which are the eigenvectors. So yes, the eigenfunctions form the basis for the operator. Therefore, D is correct.

Wait, but wait, the matrix operator's basis functions would be the eigenvectors, but in the context of the problem, it's about whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So D is correct.

But how can both C and D be correct? Let me re-examine the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Correct.

So, perhaps both are correct, but looking at the options, only one is correct. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about the calculation process. Which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps during the calculation, you find that the eigenvalues are real, so option C is correct because it discusses properties of the eigenfunctions in relation to other operators.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator.

But I have to choose the correct option.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the eigenvectors of Ay.

The eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

For a = h/(4π), the matrix (A_y - a I) is:

[ [ -a, -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -a ] ]

Which becomes:

[ [ -h/(4π), -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -h/(4π) ] ]

We can factor out h/(4π):

h/(4π) * [ [-1, -i], [i, -1] ]

To find the eigenvectors, we solve (A_y -a I) v =0.

Let me write the equations:

- (h/(4π)) (1) v1 - (h/(4π)) i v2 =0

(h/(4π)) i v1 - (h/(4π)) (1) v2 =0

We can divide both equations by h/(4π):

- v1 -i v2 =0 → equation 1

i v1 - v2 =0 → equation 2.

From equation 1: v1 = -i v2.

Substitute into equation 2: i (-i v2) - v2 =0 → (-i²) v2 -v2 = [ since i*(-i) = 1 ] → v2 - v2 =0 → 0=0. So equation is satisfied.

So the eigenvector for a= h/(4π) is any vector proportional to [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly, for a= -h/(4π):

The matrix (A_y + a I) would be:

[ [ h/(4π), -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), h/(4π) ] ]

Again, factor out h/(4π):

h/(4π) [ [1, -i], [i, 1] ]

The equations are:

v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = i v2.

i v1 + v2 =0 → substituting v1 =i v2 → i*(i v2) + v2 = (-v2) + v2 =0 → 0=0.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [i, 1].

So the eigenfunctions are [ -i, 1 ] and [i, 1 ] (or any scalar multiples, including normalization).

Now, what about option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Yes, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form an orthogonal basis for the 2D space in which the matrix operates. So D is correct.

But let's look at the options again.

Option C is correct because the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which they are, and they are not eigenfunctions of Az.

So both C and D seem correct. But wait, the problem states that only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the way the options are phrased is important.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is a scalar multiple of identity, all vectors are eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So the first part is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Yes, because the matrix is a 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But looking back at the options, perhaps D is a correct statement. Because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the vector space, which is the basis for the operator's matrix representation. So D is correct.

But the problem is, I'm supposed to choose the correct option. Let me go through each option again.

Option A: Incorrect, eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Also incorrect, eigenvalues are real.

Option C: Correct, because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: Also correct, because the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator.

Hmm, but perhaps the question is which statement is correct during the calculation, which might mean which statement is true. All correct statements are possible, but perhaps only one is correct based on the options.

Wait, the options C and D are both correct in their own ways. But the problem is presented as a multiple-choice, so I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the calculation process. Let me re-examine the options.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². But during the calculation, when you find the eigenfunctions of Ay, you can also note that they are eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Well, the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, so D is correct as well.

But maybe D is incorrect. Because the basis functions of the matrix operator are the basis in which the matrix is diagonal, which are precisely the eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions form the basis of the operator. So D is correct.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the possible answers.

The correct answer is likely option C.

Wait, wait, let me think again. If I look at the eigenfunctions, they are not eigenfunctions of Az because Az and Ay do not commute. So option C is correct.

But the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation, which would encompass what's true about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, given that, I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the given \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \), as shown by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(S - \lambda I) = 0 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), which simplifies to \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - The eigenvalues are real, not complex. This eliminates **Option A** and **Option B**, as both suggest complex eigenvalues.

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - For \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - For \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - These eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space, confirming that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of \( A_y \). This makes **Option D** correct.

3. **Eigenfunctions and Other Operators:**
   - The operator \( A_y^2 = (c \cdot S)^2 = c^2 \cdot S^2 \). Since \( S^2 = I \), \( A_y^2 \) is proportional to the identity matrix, meaning any vector is an eigenstate of \( A_y^2 \). Thus, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A_y^2 \).
   - However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (the z-component of angular momentum), as the eigenstates of \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) are orthogonal and do not overlap. This confirms the first part of **Option C**.

4. **Comparison of Options:**
   - **Option A** and **Option B** are incorrect because the eigenvalues are real, not complex.
   - **Option C** is correct because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A_y^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D** is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator \( A_y \).

5. **Final Decision:**
   - The question asks for the correct statement "during the calculation." While both **Option C** and **Option D** are factually correct, **Option C** is more directly tied to the properties of the eigenfunctions in relation to other operators, making it the most appropriate choice.

### Conclusion:

The correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
