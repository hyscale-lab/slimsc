Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax (plx) and distance are inversely related. Wait, right, because parallax is 1 over distance in parsecs. So if the distance r increases, parallax decreases.

Hmm, so the formula they've given is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r (because plx = 1/d, where d is distance), I can substitute that into the equation. So plx = 1/r, so 1/(plx)^5 would be (r)^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/(r^5), so when you take 1 over that, you get r^5.

Wait, let me think again. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, then plx = 1/r, so 1/plx is r. So 1/(plx)^5 is r^5. Therefore, N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance increases, the number of stars in that region increases with the fifth power of distance. But wait, that doesn't seem right because higher distance should mean fewer stars, right? Because stars are brighter nearby, so at larger distances, each unit of distance would have more stars? Or wait, maybe not. Because the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance.

Wait, let me clarify. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit distance. So it's the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r. So the number of stars in a region depends on the solid angle and the volume. Oh wait, but that's for a uniform density. Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the concept of distance and parallax.

So, parallax (plx) is in arcseconds, and it's related to distance (r) in parsecs by r = 1/plx. So if I have a region of the sky, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N ∝ r^5.

But wait, how does that translate into the number per unit distance? Well, if N is proportional to r^5
