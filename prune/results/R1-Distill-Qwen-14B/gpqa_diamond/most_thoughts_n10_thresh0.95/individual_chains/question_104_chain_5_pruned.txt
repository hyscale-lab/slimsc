Okay, I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both host stars have the same mass as the Sun. Each star has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

They detected one planet around each star. The spectral line shifts are given: planet 1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet 2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet 2 is compared to planet 1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to its movement caused by the planet's gravity. The formula for that shift is related to the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's orbit.

The key formula here is the one relating the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) to the orbital period (P). I think the formula involves the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period. Wait, the formula I recall is K = (v) where v is the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance.

Alternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P/(2π)) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(2/3) ) )) 

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Since the planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star’s mass, I can approximate M_p << M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the eccentricity e is zero because the orbits are circular. So the formula simplifies.

I think the simplified formula for K is something like K = (v) = ( (27 * G^(1/3) ) / (c * 2π) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + (M_p/M_star))^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )) 

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Or is it directly proportional? Wait, let me think.

The RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the mass of the planet and the star, and the orbital period. The formula I'm trying to recall is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (P/(2π)) )^(1/3) )

But in the approximation where M_p << M_star, this simplifies. Let's see.

Let me write the more precise formula for K. The formula is:

K = [ ( (G * P) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) ] / ( (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) ) )

Since M_p << M_star, (1 + M_p/M_star) ≈ 1. So K ≈ [ (G P/(2π) )^(1/3) * M_p ] / M_star^(2/3) )

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, another approach: the formula for K is given by:

K = (v) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) ) / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the proportionality. Since the two stars have the same mass (M), and the planets have similar masses (m), but the RV semi-amplitude K is different.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the inclination (but assuming it's edge-on, which is sin i =1), and the orbital period. 

Wait, I think the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (P/(2π)) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to express K in terms of P. Let me rearrange the formula.

Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) )

But since M_p << M_star, (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ [ (G M_p / M_star ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) )

Factor that differently: K ≈ [ (G M_p) / (M_star) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π)^(1/3) / (P^(1/3) ) )

Which can be written as:

K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) * (2π)^(1/3) ) ) / ( M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

But since G and 2π are constants, and M_p and M_star are similar for both planets (since both have same mass as Sun and planet masses similar to Neptune), the ratio K1/K2 would depend on P1 and P2.

Wait, the question says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both. The stars have same mass, M. So M_p is same, M is same.

So K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

Wait, if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3).

So let me think about the relation between K1 and K2.

Given that K1 = 5 miliangstrom and K2=7 mili
