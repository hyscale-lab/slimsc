Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out where the given density matrix is located in the qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my density matrices, but let's try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait a second, that looks familiar. Oh right, when you have a density matrix like this, it's a mixed state. Because each term is a projector, and they're added together and scaled by 1/2. 

So, I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), and any state can be described by a vector r on this sphere. The pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

Let me recall the general form of a density matrix for a qubit. It's usually written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the vector (x, y, z) that points to a point on the Bloch sphere. The length of r must be ≤1 because the maximum is for a pure state (r=1) and mixed states have r<1.

So, let's compare this with the given ρ. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute each term.

|0⟩⟨0| is the projector for state |0⟩. It's a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 in (1,1), others 0. Adding them gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off. So ρ is (1/2)([[1,0],[0,1]]) which is the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2.

Wait, the identity matrix is I, so ρ is (I)/2. Comparing this to the general form, I = (ρ - (r·σ)/2)*2. Wait, no, wait. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So if our ρ is I/2, then I/2 equals (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ. Subtract I: 0 = r·σ. So r·σ must be zero. 

r·σ is the sum of the components times each Pauli matrix: rxσx + ryσy + rzσz. So for r·σ to be zero, each component must make each term zero. That can only happen if rx=0, ry=0, rz=0. Because σx and σy and σz are all non-zero matrices, their coefficients must be zero.

So r is (0,0,0). That's the origin in the Bloch sphere. 

Wait, what's the significance of r being zero? Oh, that's the completely mixed state. Because when you have equal probability of being in |0⟩ and |1⟩, but no coherence between them. So the density matrix has zero off-diagonal elements and diagonal entries (1/2, 1/2). That's a maximally mixed state, which lies at the center of the Bloch sphere.

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which should be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state for a single qubit. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch sphere coordinates \((x, y, z)\) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which means all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero (\(x = 0\), \(y = 0\), \(z = 0\)). Therefore, the density matrix corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state.

From the options provided:

- **A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere.
- **B) \(r = (0,0,1):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state at the north pole of the Bloch sphere.
- **C) \(r = (0,0,0):** Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.
- **D) \(r = (1,1,1):** Incorrect, as this is not a valid point on the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0,0,0)\). 

Answer: C
