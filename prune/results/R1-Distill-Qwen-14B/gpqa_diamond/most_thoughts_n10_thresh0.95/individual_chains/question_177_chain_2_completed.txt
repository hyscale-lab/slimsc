Okay, so I’ve got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the solution step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The key points are:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, mass might not directly affect luminosity here unless we're considering something like the mass-luminosity relation. Hmm, but the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so maybe mass isn't directly needed for the calculation. Interesting.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body is related to its temperature by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is the same, then T = b / λ, so same λ means same T.
- The radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So Star_2 is moving towards us (or away, depending on the sign) which would shift its observed wavelength. But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Does that mean the observed wavelengths are the same, or the intrinsic (rest) wavelengths are the same? I think it's the observed ones. Because the question says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So Doppler shift would affect this.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The luminosity is intrinsic, but the observed brightness also depends on distance. But the problem is about their computed luminosities, so perhaps radial velocity doesn't directly affect the calculation here because luminosity is an intrinsic property. Alternatively, perhaps the observed wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) for relativistic speeds, but I'm not sure. However, 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), so maybe a non-relativistic Doppler shift applies.

The Doppler effect for non-relativistic speeds is approximately Δλ/λ = v_r / c, where v_r is the radial velocity. If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its observed wavelength would be blueshifted. So its observed λ would be λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (c - v_r) / c ≈ λ2_emit * (1 - v_r/c). Wait, no, the formula for the Doppler shift when the source is moving towards the observer is λ_obs = λ_emit * (c - v)/c. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ is shorter than its emitted λ.

But according to the problem, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs. But λ1_emit and λ2_emit could be different if their temperatures are different. Wait, earlier I thought their temperatures must be the same because their λ_max (intrinsic) would be the same. But wait, that's not correct because of the Doppler shift. Maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. Because they appear brightest at the same wavelength. So the observed λ_peak for both stars is the same. But the intrinsic λ_peak is determined by their temperatures. So if the observed λ_peak is the same, but their actual temperatures could be different, because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies. So the intrinsic emission is a black body spectrum, but their observed spectrum is affected by Doppler shift. So the observed peak λ is T * something.

Let me try to model this. Let’s say the intrinsic peak wavelength for Star_1 is λ1_emit = b / T1, and for Star_2, λ2_emit = b / T2. But because Star_2 is moving with a radial velocity v, its observed λ is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) for relativistic speeds, but for small v, we can approximate it as λ2_obs ≈ λ2_emit * (1 + v/c). Wait, no: when a star moves towards us, the observed wavelength is blueshifted, so shorter. So the formula would be λ_obs = λ_emit * (c + v)/ (c - v) )^(1/2). But for small v, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v/c). Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is: λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) , where v is the radial velocity towards the observer. But if v is much less than c, we can approximate it as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c). Wait, but if the source is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, so v is positive when moving towards. So if the star is moving towards us, v is positive, and λ_obs is less than λ_rest.

Wait, but let me think about the exact formula. The relativistic Doppler effect formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), where v is the recession velocity. If the source is moving towards us, v is negative, so (1 + v/c) becomes (1 - |v|/c), and (1 - v/c) becomes (1 + |v|/c). So the formula becomes sqrt( (1 - |v|/c)/(1 + |v|/c) ), which is less than 1, so λ_obs is less than λ_rest. That makes sense because the wavelengths are blueshifted.

So, if Star_2 is moving towards us at v = 700 km/s, then λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ≈ λ2_rest * (1 - (v/c)) when v is small compared to c.

Wait, but if Star_1 has radial velocity 0, then λ1_obs = λ1_rest. So we have λ1_obs = λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

But wait, I think I might have gotten the formula wrong. Let me double-check. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength can be written as:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no. Because when the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is smaller. So let's let v be positive if the source is moving towards. So, the formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( [ (1 - v/c) ] / [1 + v/c] )

Which is correct because as v increases, λ_obs decreases.

So, for Star_2, moving towards us at v=700 km/s, its observed wavelength is:

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) )

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs (given in the problem), and λ1_rest = λ1 = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

So, λ1_rest = λ1 = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

Setting λ1_obs = λ2_obs:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs
=> (b / T1) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Divide both sides by (b / T2):

(T2 / T1) = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Square both sides:

(T2^2 / T1^2) = (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c)

So,

(T2 / T1)^2 = (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)

We can solve for T2 in terms of T1, or vice versa.

But wait, do I have enough information? Let me think about what else is given. The problem is about the luminosities. Luminosity of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So,

L1/L2 = (1.5²) * (T1^4 / T2^4)

= (2.25) * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

So, we need to find T1/T2. Let's see.

We have from earlier:

(T2^2 / T1^2) = (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c)

Let me rearrange that:

(T1^2 / T2^2) = (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)

Take square roots:

(T1 / T2) = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 = [ (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ]^2

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 + v/c)^2 / (1 - v/c)^2 ]

Now, plug in the numbers. v is 700 km/s. Let's compute v/c.

v = 700,000 m/s. c ≈ 3e8 m/s.

v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 ≈ 7/(300) = approximately 0.002333...

So, v/c ≈ 0.002333.

Let me compute (1 + v/c) ≈ 1.002333, and (1 - v/c) ≈ 0.997667.

So,

(1.002333) / (0.997667) ≈ approx? Let's compute:

1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ approximately 1.0047 (since 0.997667 is about 1 - 0.002333).

But more accurately, let's compute it as:

(1 + x)/(1 - x) where x = 0.002333.

Which is approximately 1 + 2x for small x, since (1 + x)/(1 -x) ≈ (1 + x)(1 + x) ) = 1 + 2x for small x. So 2x = 0.004666.

But let me compute it more accurately.

Compute numerator: 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

Denominator: 1 - 0.002333 = 0.997667.

Divide 1.002333 by 0.997667.

Let me compute 1.002333 / 0.997667.

Let me do this division:

0.997667 * 1.0047 = 0.997667 *1 = 0.997667; 0.997667 *0.0047 ≈ 0.004688. So total 1.002355. Which is very close to 1.002333. So 1.0047 is a good approximation.

But let me compute it precisely.

Compute 1.002333 / 0.997667.

Let me write this as (1.002333) / (0.997667) = ?

Let me compute it as (approx):

0.997667 * 1.004666 = ?

0.997667 *1 = 0.997667

0.997667 *0.004666 ≈ 0.004646

Adding together: 0.997667 + 0.004646 ≈ 1.002313. Which is very close to 1.002333. So the actual value is just a bit higher than 1.004666.

So, (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.004666 + (1.002333 -1.002313)/(0.997667*1.004666)

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute it using a calculator-like approach.

But perhaps a better approximation is to compute (1 + x)/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + 2x for small x, which gives us 1 + 2*(0.002333) = 1.004666.

So, (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ≈ 1.004666.

Wait, but when I compute 1.002333 / 0.997667, I get approximately 1.004666.

So, (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ≈ 1.004666.

So,

( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )^2 ≈ (1.004666)^2.

What's 1.004666 squared?

Let me compute 1.004666 * 1.004666.

1*1=1.

1 * 0.004666 = 0.004666.

0.004666 * 1 = 0.004666.

0.004666 * 0.004666 ≈ 0.00002177556.

Adding all the terms: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.

So,

= 1 + 2*(0.004666) + (0.004666)^2.

= 1 + 0.009332 + 0.00002177556.

≈ 1.0093537756.

So approximately 1.009354.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (1.009354) ≈ 2.25 * 1.009354.

Let me compute that.

2.25 * 1.009354.

= 2.25 * (1 + 0.009354) 

= 2.25 *1 + 2.25 *0.009354

= 2.25 + (2.25 *0.009354)

Compute 2.25 * 0.009354.

2 * 0.009354 = 0.018708.

0.25 * 0.009354 = 0.0023385.

Total: 0.018708 + 0.0023385 = 0.0210465.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 + 0.0210465 ≈ 2.2710465.

Approximately 2.271.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, 2.27 is close to option B) 2.32, but not exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should do a more precise calculation of (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) and then square it.

Let me compute v/c more accurately. v is 700 km/s, so 700,000 m/s. c is 299792 km/s, which is 299792 * 1000 m/s = 299792000 m/s.

So v/c = 700,000 / 299,792,000 ≈ 700e3 / 3e8 ≈ 0.0023333333.

But more accurately, 700,000 ÷ 299,792,000 = 700 / 299,792 ≈ 0.0023375757.

Wait, 299792 * 0.0023375757 = ?

Wait, 299792 * 0.002 = 599.584.

299792 * 0.0003375757 ≈ let's see, 0.0003 is 89.9376 ≈ 89.9376.

0.0000375757 *299792 ≈ approx 11.258.

So total: 599.584 + 89.9376 = 689.5216 + 11.258 ≈ 700.7796. Hmm, but I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me just use v/c ≈ 700,000 / 3e8 = 700/(3*1e5) ) = 700/(300000) = 7/(3000) = 0.0023333333.

So, v/c ≈ 0.00233333.

So, 1 + v/c = 1.002333333.

1 - v/c = 0.9976666667.

So, (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) = (1.002333333)/(0.997666667) ≈ let me compute this accurately.

Compute 1.002333333 / 0.997666667.

Let me do the division.

Let me compute 1.002333333 ÷ 0.997666667.

Let me write this as (1.002333333) / (0.997666667) = ?

I'll use cross multiplication: let x = 0.997666667 * y = 1.002333333.

y = (1.002333333)/(0.997666667).

Let me compute y:

0.997666667 * y = 1.002333333.

So, y = 1.002333333 / 0.997666667.

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

Compute 1.002333333 ÷ 0.997666667.

Let me compute 0.997666667 * 1.0047 = ?

0.997666667 *1 = 0.997666667.

0.997666667 *0.0047 ≈ 0.004688.

So total is 0.997666667 + 0.004688 ≈ 1.002354667, which is slightly higher than 1.002333333.

So, 0.997666667 * 1.004666 ≈ 1.002354667.

But we have 0.997666667 * y = 1.002333333.

So y = (1.002333333) / 0.997666667 = approximately 1.004666.

Wait, but the product 0.997666667 * 1.004666 is 1.002354667, which is a bit higher than 1.002333333. Let me compute the exact value.

Let me compute 0.997666667 * y = 1.002333333.

So y = 1.002333333 / 0.997666667.

Let me compute this using decimals:

Compute 1.002333333 ÷ 0.997666667.

Let me approximate this as 1.004666.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute:

(1.002333333) / (0.997666667) = (1 + 0.002333333) / (1 - 0.002333333)

= [1 + x]/[1 - x] where x=0.002333333.

Which is approximately 1 + 2x + 2x² (using binomial expansion up to x²).

So,

1 + 2x + 2x² = 1 + 2*(0.002333333) + 2*(0.002333333)^2.

Compute each term:

2x = 0.004666666.

2x² = 2*(0.002333333)^2 = 2*(5.44444e-6) )= 1.088888e-5 ≈ 0.00001088888.

So,

Total ≈ 1 + 0.004666666 + 0.00001088888 ≈ 1.004677555.

So,

(1 + x)/(1 - x) ≈ 1.004677555.

So,

[ (1 + x)/(1 -x) ]^2 = (1.004677555)^2.

Let me compute that.

1.004677555^2:

= 1 + 2*(0.004677555) + (0.004677555)^2.

= 1 + 0.00935511 + 0.000021872.

≈ 1.009376982.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009376982.

What's 2.25 * 1.009376982?

Let me compute 2.25 * 1.009377.

= 2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.009377 = 0.02108175.

Total: 2.25 + 0.02108175 = 2.27108175.

So about 2.271.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, 2.271 is between 2.25 and 2.32. The closest option is B) ~2.32, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I messed up the luminosity formula. Because the problem says the stars radiate as black bodies, but does the Doppler shift affect the observed luminosity? Or is the luminosity an intrinsic property?

Wait, no, the luminosity is the intrinsic power output, so it's not affected by the Doppler shift. So the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength but not the luminosity. So the calculation I did earlier should be correct.

Wait, but the problem says, the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So I think my calculation is correct, leading to a factor of around 2.27, which isn't exactly any of the options. The options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, C) 2.35, D) 2.23.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximating (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) as 1.004666, but use more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to use exact fractions.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) without approximating v/c as 0.002333333.

But v is 700 km/s, so v/c is 700e3 / 299792e3 = 700 / 299792 ≈ 0.0023375757.

So,

(1 + 0.0023375757) / (1 - 0.0023375757) = (1.0023375757) / (0.9976624243).

Compute this division more accurately.

Let me compute 1.0023375757 / 0.9976624243.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1,000,000 to get rid of decimals.

= 1,002,337.5757 / 997,662.4243.

Compute this division.

Let me compute how many times 997,662.4243 fits into 1,002,337.5757.

It's approximately 1.00468 times.

Wait, because 997,662.4243 * 1.00468 ≈ ?

Well, 997,662.4243 * 1 = 997,662.4243.

0.00468 * 997,662.4243 ≈ 4,662.9498.

Adding together: 997,662.4243 + 4,662.9498 ≈ 1,002,325.3741.

Which is very close to 1,002,337.5757. The difference is about 12.2016.

So,

1.00468 + (12.2016 / 997,662.4243) ≈ 1.00468 + 0.00001223 ≈ 1.00469223.

So,

(1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ≈ 1.00469223.

So,

[ (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ]^2 = (1.00469223)^2.

Compute this:

= (1 + 0.00469223)^2 = 1^2 + 2*(1)*(0.00469223) + (0.00469223)^2.

= 1 + 0.00938446 + (approx 0.00002199).

= 1.00940645.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00940645 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00940645.

Compute 2.25 * 1.00940645.

= 2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.00940645 ≈ 0.0211645.

Total ≈ 2.25 + 0.0211645 ≈ 2.2711645.

Hmm, so about 2.27116, which is about 2.271.

But the options don't have 2.27. The closest higher option is B) 2.32, but that's quite a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider that the luminosity depends on the fourth power of temperature. So let's re-express the ratio again.

We have:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1^2 = 2.25 R2^2.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1^4)/(T2^4).

We found that (T1/T2)^2 = (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) from earlier.

Because,

(T1 / T2)^2 = (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c).

So,

(T1 / T2) = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ).

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 = [ (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ]^2.

Which is what we used earlier.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ]^2.

Which we calculated as approximately 2.271.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength in the rest frame, not the observed frame. Wait, no, the problem states: "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed wavelengths are the same.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the apparent temperature. Because the observed wavelength is the same, but the intrinsic peak wavelengths are different because of their velocities.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. Let me model their black body radiation.

The peak wavelength λ_peak for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_peak = b / T.

But when the star is moving, the observed λ_peak is Doppler shifted.

So, if Star_1 is at rest, its observed λ_peak1 = λ_rest1.

Star_2 is moving with velocity v, so its observed λ_peak2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ), but since Star_2 is moving towards us, v_r is positive.

Wait, no. Wait, the Doppler shift formula for the observed wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is λ_obs = λ_source * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

So, λ_obs = λ_source * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

So, for Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

Given that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

But λ_rest is given by λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

Square both sides:

1/(T1^2) = (1/(T2^2)) * ( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

Rearranged:

(T2^2)/(T1^2) = (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c).

Taking square roots:

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ).

Wait, that's the same as before. So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )^{-1} = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ).

Wait, no, because when you take reciprocal, (a/b) becomes (b/a).

So,

(T2/T1)^2 = (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c).

So, T2/T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ).

Which means,

T1/T2 = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

Wait, but that's different from what I had earlier. Did I make a mistake before?

Wait, earlier I had:

From λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which became,

( b/T1 ) = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T2/T1 = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is the reciprocal of what I had earlier. So that changes things.

Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. So the correct relation is T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which implies that T2 < T1 because (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) is less than 1.

So,

(T2/T1) = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is,

(T2/T1)^2 = (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c)

So, returning to the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

But from above, (T1/T2) = 1 / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

= sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ]^2

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ]^2

Which is the same expression I used earlier. So the calculation should be the same.

Wait, so perhaps I didn't make a mistake there. So the ratio is approximately 2.271.

Looking back at the options, the closest is B) 2.32.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let me compute (1 + v/c) and (1 - v/c) using v = 700,000 m/s, c = 299792458 m/s.

v/c = 700,000 / 299,792,458 ≈ 700,000 / 3e8 = 0.0023333333.

Wait, 700,000 / 299,792,458 = approximately 0.0023375757.

So,

(1 + v/c) = 1.0023375757.

(1 - v/c) = 0.9976624243.

So,

(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) = 1.0023375757 / 0.9976624243 ≈ 1.004688.

So,

[ (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ]^2 ≈ (1.004688)^2.

Compute that:

1.004688 * 1.004688.

I can compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 1.004688^2.

= (1 + 0.004688)^2.

= 1^2 + 2*(1)*(0.004688) + (0.004688)^2.

= 1 + 0.009376 + 0.000021967.

= 1.009397967.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009397967 ≈ 2.25 * 1.009397967.

Compute 2.25 * 1.009397967.

= 2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.009397967 ≈ 0.021145425.

So,

Total L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 + 0.021145425 ≈ 2.271145425.

So about 2.271.

Wait, but none of the options are exactly that. The options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm. 2.271 is closest to 2.27, which isn't an option. But perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [ (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ] more accurately.

Let me compute (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) = (1.0023375757) / (0.9976624243).

Calculating this precisely:

1.0023375757 ÷ 0.9976624243 = ?

Using a calculator approach:

Let me compute it as 1.0023375757 ÷ 0.9976624243.

Let me set it up as division:

Divide 1.0023375757 by 0.9976624243.

Let me write this as 1.0023375757 / 0.9976624243 = ?

I can approximate this using long division.

Alternatively, use a calculator approximation.

Alternatively, using a calculator, 1.0023375757 / 0.9976624243 ≈ 1.0046875.

Wait, 0.9976624243 * 1.0046875 = ?

Compute 0.9976624243 * 1 = 0.9976624243.

0.9976624243 * 0.0046875.

0.0046875 is 3/640, which is 0.0046875.

Compute 0.9976624243 * 0.0046875.

= 0.0046875 * 0.9976624243.

≈ 0.0046875 * 1 = 0.0046875, but since 0.9976624243 is slightly less than 1, the product is 0.0046875 - (0.0046875 * 0.0023375757).

Compute 0.0046875 * 0.0023375757 ≈ 0.00001095.

So, 0.0046875 - 0.00001095 ≈ 0.00467655.

So, 0.9976624243 * 1.0046875 ≈ 0.9976624243 + 0.00467655 ≈ 1.0023389743.

Which is very close to 1.0023375757. So, the division gives approximately 1.0046875.

So, [ (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ] = 1.0046875.

So,

[ (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ]^2 = (1.0046875)^2.

Compute this exactly:

1.0046875^2 = (1 + 0.0046875)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0046875 + (0.0046875)^2.

= 1 + 0.009375 + 0.00002197265625.

= 1 + 0.009375 = 1.009375 + 0.00002197265625 = 1.00939697265625.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00939697265625 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00939697265625.

Compute 2.25 * 1.00939697265625.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.00939697265625 ≈ 0.02114513671875.

Adding together: 2.25 + 0.02114513671875 ≈ 2.27114513671875.

So, approximately 2.271145.

Looking at the options again, the closest is B) 2.32, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but not the intrinsic luminosity. But no, the luminosity is the intrinsic property, so the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps the observed flux is different, but the question is about luminosity, which is an intrinsic property.

So, the luminosity ratio is 2.271, which is approximately 2.27. But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the initial setup again.

We have two stars, same observed peak wavelength. But due to Doppler shift, their intrinsic temperatures are different.

We derived that L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ]^2.

So, with v=700 km/s, which is 0.0023375757c.

So, [ (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ] = 1.0046875.

Squared, that's 1.00939697.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00939697 ≈ 2.271.

Which is approximately 2.27 times.

Looking at the options, A is 2.25, D is 2.23, so 2.27 is between them.

But perhaps the problem expects to neglect the Doppler effect, but that can't be because the problem gives the velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler effect.

Wait another thought: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but the problem states to consider the stars as black bodies. So, perhaps the observed flux F is given by F = L / (4πd²), but that's distance-dependent and not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but the problem is only considering the luminosity ratio, which is independent of distance.

So, I think I'm confident in the calculation leading to approximately 2.27, but it's not one of the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to choose the closest option, which would be B) 2.32, but that's not close.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximations.

Let me compute (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) exactly.

v =700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

c = 2.99792e8 m/s.

v/c = 7e5 / 2.99792e8 = 7e5 / 2.99792e8 = 7/(299.792) ≈ 0.023375757.

Wait, wait, no.

Wait, 7e5 is 700,000 m/s.

So, 700,000 ÷ 299,792,458 ≈ 0.0023375757.

Yes, that's correct.

So, (1 + 0.0023375757)/(1 - 0.0023375757) = 1.0023375757 / 0.9976624243.

As previously, this is approximately 1.0046875.

So, [ (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ]^2 = (1.0046875)^2 = 1.00939697.

So, 2.25 * 1.00939697 = 2.27114513671875.

So, approximately 2.2711.

Looking at the options again, the closest is not present. But the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm. So none of the options match 2.27. Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) using precise numbers.

Compute (1 + v/c) = 1.0023375757.

(1 - v/c) = 0.9976624243.

1.0023375757 ÷ 0.9976624243 = ?

Let me compute it using long division.

Dividing 1.0023375757 by 0.9976624243.

Set it up as:

0.9976624243 | 1.0023375757

We can approximate this as 1.0046875, as before.

But perhaps a better way is to compute it precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be around 2.25, but considering the Doppler shift, it's a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me re-express the problem.

Alternative approach:

Since both stars appear to have the same observed peak wavelength, but their intrinsic temperatures are different due to Doppler shift.

The observed peak wavelength λ_obs is the same for both stars.

For Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Given that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Square both sides:

1/(T1^2) = (1/(T2^2)) * ( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T2^2 / T1^2 = (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)

So,

(T2/T1) = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Hmm, but that leads to T2 > T1, which conflicts with earlier conclusion. Wait, no.

Wait, (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) is greater than 1, so sqrt of that is greater than 1. So T2 = T1 * sqrt(...) > T1. So T2 is larger than T1.

Which means T1 < T2.

Wait, but that's not possible because Star_2 is moving towards us, making its observed wavelength shorter, implying higher temperature. So if T2 is higher than T1, that makes sense because Star_2 must be hotter to have the same observed peak wavelength.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the observed peak wavelength is same, so their temperatures would be same, but Doppler effect shifts the observed wavelength.

Wait, no. If Star_2 is moving towards us, it's blueshifted, so its observed peak wavelength is shorter than its rest wavelength. But if the observed peak wavelength is same as Star_1's rest wavelength, then Star_2's rest wavelength must be longer, meaning T2 < T1.

Wait, this is conflicting.

Wait, no. Let me think.

Star_1 is at rest, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 = b/T1.

Star_2 is moving towards us, so λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) = λ_rest2 * (1 - v/(2c)), approximately.

Given that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But λ_rest is b/T, so:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Square both sides,

1/T1^2 = (1/T2^2) * ( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T2^2 = T1^2 * ( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which implies T2 > T1.

So, Star_2 has higher intrinsic temperature than Star_1.

But then, when calculating luminosity,

L = 4π R^2 σ T^4,

so L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

R1 = 1.5 R2,

so,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / ( R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * ( (T1 / T2) )^4

But,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 = [ (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ]^2

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ]^2

Wait, this is different from before! Earlier I thought it was [ (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ]^2, but now it's the reciprocal.

Oh, I must have made a mistake earlier.

So, the correct expression is:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ]^2

Because (T1/T2)^4 is [ (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ]^2.

So, I think I must have messed up the earlier steps, leading to an incorrect conclusion.

Let me correct this.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 - v/c )/(1 + v/c) ]^2

So, using v/c = 0.0023375757.

(1 - v/c) = 0.9976624243.

(1 + v/c) = 1.0023375757.

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = 0.9976624243 / 1.0023375757 ≈ 0.99535.

Wait, 0.9976624243 ÷ 1.0023375757.

Let me compute this.

0.9976624243 / 1.0023375757.

Let me compute this as:

≈ 0.9976624243 / 1.0023375757 ≈ 0.99535.

Because 1.0023375757 * 0.99535 = approx 1.0023375757 * 0.99535 ≈ 0.9976624243.

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ≈ 0.99535.

So,

[ (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ]^2 ≈ (0.99535)^2 ≈ 0.99072.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99072 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.228, which is close to option D) 2.23.

So, the correct ratio is approximately 2.23.

Wait, this makes more sense. So where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the relation between T1 and T2. Initially, I thought T1 was larger, but in reality, T2 is larger, leading to a lower ratio of T1/T2, which makes the luminosity ratio lower than 1 when considering T^4.

So the correct approach is:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ]^2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99072 ≈ 2.228, which rounds to approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we start by analyzing the given information:

1. **Key Parameters**:
   - Radius of Star_1: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
   - Mass of Star_1: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \) (not directly relevant for blackbody luminosity)
   - Radial velocity of Star_1: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Radial velocity of Star_2: \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Observed peak wavelengths of both stars are the same: \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)

2. **Blackbody Luminosity**:
   The luminosity of a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]
   Thus, the luminosity ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
   \]

3. **Temperature Ratio**:
   The observed peak wavelength of a blackbody is related to its temperature by Wien's law:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
   \]
   Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), the intrinsic wavelengths must satisfy:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
   \]
   Using \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = b / T \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant:
   \[
   \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2 = \frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}
   \]

4. **Substitute \( v/c \)**:
   With \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 299,792 \, \text{km/s} \):
   \[
   \frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{299,792} \approx 0.0023375757
   \]
   Compute:
   \[
   \frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c} = \frac{1 - 0.0023375757}{1 + 0.0023375757} = \frac{0.9976624243}{1.0023375757} \approx 0.99535
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2 = 0.99535
   \]
   \[
   \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^{-4} = \left(\frac{1}{0.99535}\right)^2 \approx 1.009397
   \]

5. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   Substituting into the luminosity formula:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 1.009397 \approx 2.271
   \]

6. **Final Adjustment**:
   Upon re-evaluating the Doppler shift and temperature ratio, the correct expression for the luminosity ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}\right)^2
   \]
   Using \( \frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c} \approx 0.99535 \):
   \[
   \left(\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}\right)^2 \approx 0.99072
   \]
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99072 \approx 2.228
   \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2. The closest option is:

**Answer: D**
