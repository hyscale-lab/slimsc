Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

First, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators suppressed by some high energy scale, like the Planck scale. These operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries they respect.

Wait, symmetries... Symmetries in physics are crucial because they dictate the form of the interactions. So, in a theory, the operators must respect the underlying symmetries of the theory. So, which symmetries are part of SMEFT?

I remember that the Standard Model has certain fundamental symmetries. The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames. So, any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because the SM does. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Poincare symmetry is a bit trickier. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. I think that the SM also respects Poincare symmetry. But in SMEFT, do the higher-dimensional operators necessarily respect Poincare? Or do they just need to respect Lorentz? Because higher-dimensional operators could have terms that don't respect translations? Wait, no. Because SMEFT is built as a low-energy effective theory, and the operators are constructed to be renormalizable or just consistent in terms of symmetries. I think that SMEFT operators must be Poincare invariant because the SM is. So option 2 (Poincare) is also a symmetry that must be respected.

Wait, but wait a second. Operators in SMEFT are constructed in a way that they're invariant under the same symmetries as the SM. So the SM has Poincare symmetry. SMEFT, being an effective theory built upon SM, should also respect Poincare. So both 1 and 2 are required.

What about CP and CPT symmetries? The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT can include operators that violate CP, meaning that the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So CP (option 3) isn't a must. But what about CPT?

CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. It states that the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal is a symmetry. The SM respects CPT symmetry. So any theory derived from the SM should respect CPT. Therefore, operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (option 4). So option 4 is a must.

So putting it all together: must all operators respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Do they have to respect CP (3)? No, because the operators can have terms that break CP, as the SM itself allows for CP violation.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. Let me check the options: option C is 1,2,4. Option D includes 1,3,4 which would be Lorentz, CP, and CPT. Wait, but if CP isn't required, then option C is correct.

Wait, but I thought that in SMEFT, operators are organized into classes that respect certain symmetries, but the operators themselves can have terms that violate some of these. So, which of these symmetries are the operators required to respect. Let me think again.

In SMEFT, the operators are classified based on their dimension and the symmetries they have. The structure of the operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM, but beyond that, individual operators can have certain symmetry properties.

Wait, the SM has the gauge symmetries, Lorentz symmetry, and CPT symmetry. So in SMEFT, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (they can't violate it) because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Similarly, any operator must respect the gauge symmetries of the SM. But for other symmetries, like CPT, the SM respects it, so SMEFT must too. Because any operator that violates CPT would not be part of the SM's effective theory.

Wait, but wait. The CPT symmetry is more of a fundamental QFT symmetry. So in any QFT, including SMEFT, operators must be CPT-invariant. Because if you have an operator that changes under CPT, then the theory wouldn't be unitary or would violate some fundamental principles. So yes, SMEFT must respect CPT.

But about Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Since SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory in a Minkowski spacetime, all operators must be Poincare-invariant. So options 1 and 2 must be respected.

So the correct required symmetries are 1,2,4. So the answer should be option C: 1,2,4.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the symmetries of the theory and their implications:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it generalizes the Standard Model (SM), which respects Lorentz symmetry. All operators in SMEFT must therefore respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and spacetime translations. Since SMEFT is formulated in Minkowski spacetime and inherits the symmetries of the SM, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM allows for CP violation, as seen in the CKM matrix. Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry, as CP violation can be incorporated into the theory.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and the SM respects it. Since SMEFT is derived from the SM, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily required, as the theory allows for CP violation.
