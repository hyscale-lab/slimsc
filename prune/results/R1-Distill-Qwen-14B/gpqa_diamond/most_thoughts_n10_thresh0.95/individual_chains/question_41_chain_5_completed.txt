Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Alright, the setup is that there's a light beam propagating through a glass with a refractive index n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. And the options are given as A to D.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Right, so in the glass, the speed would be 1/n if c is taken as 1. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the glass. Because the glass is moving, maybe we need to consider some sort of relativistic addition here.

Wait, no. Because the medium itself is moving, the speed of light in that medium as observed in the lab frame might be different. Because when the medium is moving, the light's speed isn't simply 1/n anymore. Oh, right, this is one of those cases where you have to account for the motion of the medium relative to the observer.

I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium as observed in a different frame depends on the velocity of the medium. So maybe I should apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, the formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c² ), but wait, that's for when you have a velocity u in the original frame, and the frame is moving at speed v relative to the original. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting it mixed up. Let me think again.

In this case, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So, from the lab frame, the glass is moving. The light in the glass, from the glass's frame, has a speed of v_light = c/n, so 1/n when c=1.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the medium is moving. So according to the lab, what is the speed of the light? I think I need to perform a Lorentz transformation here, but I might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as the medium (glass) moving through the lab frame at velocity v. The light is moving through this medium, so the light's velocity in the lab frame would be the velocity of the medium plus the velocity of light in the medium relative to the medium.

Wait, but that's the non-relativistic approach. Hmm. Because at high velocities, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition. Because v is likely not negligible compared to c, but wait, in this problem, c is taken as 1, and v is a velocity, but I don't know if it's small. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic formula.

Wait, let me clarify the problem. The light beam is moving through the glass. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light's velocity is u = c/n (since v_light_medium = c/n). Now, we need to find the velocity of the light as observed in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. Wait, no, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the lab is the rest frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer.

Wait, so the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, from the glass's frame, the light's speed is u = c/n. Now, we need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. Wait, but if the lab is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass, then to find the observed speed, we need to perform a Lorentz transformation.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's think: in the glass's frame, the light's velocity is u = 1/n (since c=1). The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab's frame. So the lab sees the light's velocity as u', which is how much?

Wait, I think the formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), but since c is 1 here, it's u' = (u + v)/(1 + u*v).

Wait, but wait, in this case, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, which is 1/n. Then, the lab frame sees the light moving at u' = (u + v)/(1 + u*v).

So substituting u: u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (1 + n v)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So u' = [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, that's interesting. So the speed is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). So that's the same as what I got.

Option B is 1, but that would only be if the medium wasn't moving, which isn't the case here.

Option C is (1 +n v)/(n - v), which would flip the denominator if the glass is moving in the opposite direction. But in our case, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, so the denominator is n + v.

Option D is (1 -n v)/(n +v), which doesn't make sense because the numerator could be negative if v is large enough, which would imply a negative speed, which isn't the case here.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we consider the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, relative to the laboratory frame.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \) (as given), this simplifies to:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + u v}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches the derived result.
- **Option B**: \( 1 \) is incorrect, as it does not account for the motion of the glass or the refractive index.
- **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) is incorrect, as it assumes the glass is moving in the opposite direction, which is not the case.
- **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) is incorrect, as it introduces a negative numerator for large \( v \), which is unphysical.

The correct answer is **Option A**.
