Okay, so I've got this physics question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me think. I remember that neutrinos are produced in nuclear reactions in the Sun, particularly in the proton-proton chain. Oh wait, the question is talking about the pp-III branch stopping. Wait, what's the pp-III branch again?

I think the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. The pp-I branch is the initial part, then pp-II and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves reactions where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus, producing helium-4 and two protons. But wait, how does that affect neutrino production?

Neutrinos are produced mainly in the decay steps of these reactions. The pp-I and pp-II branches produce neutrinos too, but pp-III might be a significant source. So if the pp-III branch stops, that would reduce the number of neutrinos coming from that process. But the question says all other reactions remain the same, so pp-I and pp-II are still going on.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the flux in each band is affected when pp-III stops.

Wait, what neutrinos are emitted in the pp-III branch versus the other branches? I think that the pp-III process emits electron neutrinos, but the energy of those neutrinos depends on the specific reactions. 

In the pp-III branch, a key reaction is He-3 + p → He-4 + e+ + ν_e. The neutrino here is an electron neutrino, and its energy would be determined by the reaction. So, in that reaction, the neutrino energy is about 1.4 MeV? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me think. The reaction produces He-4, so the mass difference would give the neutrino energy. The mass of He-3 is about 3 atomic mass units, a proton is about 1, He-4 is 4. So the mass difference is (3 + 1) - 4 = 0. So maybe the neutrino would have a high energy? Or wait, maybe the neutrino energy comes from the kinetic energy of the products. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look up the typical neutrino energies from the different branches. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I remember that the main neutrinos from pp-III are around 1.4 MeV. So in this case, if the pp-III branch stops, the neutrinos in the higher energy range (like 1 MeV and above) would decrease.

So the two bands are 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). So the higher band is 0.8-0.9 MeV. If the pp-III branch was producing neutrinos around 1.4 MeV, which is higher than both bands, then stopping pp-III wouldn't directly affect these bands. Wait, that can't be right because the flux is in these lower ranges.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the neutrino energies wrong. Let me think about the individual reactions. 

In the pp-I branch, the first step is two protons fusing into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. The neutrino energy here is about 0.3-0.4 MeV, I think. Then, in the pp-II, another reaction occurs, perhaps emitting another neutrino with similar energy. So the main neutrinos from the pp-I and pp-II would be in the lower energy ranges.

The pp-III branch, on the other hand, I think emits neutrinos with higher energies. So if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos would drop, but the lower ones (from pp-I and pp-II) remain. 

Wait, but the question is about a situation where the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at the speed of light, they take about 8 minutes to reach Earth, so any changes in the Sun's core would be felt on Earth after that time delay. So, the flux we measure now would reflect the state of the Sun's core 8.5 minutes ago.

So, before the pp-III branch stopped, neutrinos from all branches were reaching Earth. Now, only pp-I and pp-II contribute.

So, the neutrino flux in the two bands would depend on which bands the neutrinos from each branch fall into.

If the pp-III neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, which is higher than both bands, then the flux in bands 700-800 and 800-900 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV) would not be affected by the stopping of pp-III, because those neutrinos are lower energy. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are not as high as 1.4 MeV. Let me get this straight. The reaction in pp-III is:

He-3 + p → He-4 + e+ + ν_e.

The mass of He-3 is about 3 u, proton is 1 u. He-4 is 4 u. So the mass difference is (3 +1) =4, He-4 is 4, so the difference is zero. Therefore, the Q-value (the energy released) is zero? That can't be right. Wait, but in reality, the kinetic energy of the protons allows the reaction to proceed. The Q-value would take into account the kinetic energy, so the neutrino energy would be determined by the energy of the products.

I think in this reaction, the neutrino energy is around 1.4 MeV. So if that's the case, then these neutrinos would have higher energy than both bands, which are up to 0.9 MeV. So stopping the pp-III branch wouldn't affect the flux in these lower bands. 

But wait, the question is about the ratio of the fluxes between two bands. If pp-III stopped, but pp-I and pp-II are still running, then the flux in each band depends on the contributions from these branches.

If the neutrinos from pp-I and pp-II are in the lower energy ranges, then the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) would be influenced by how much of their neutrinos fall into these bands.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from pp-I and pp-II have lower energies, like around 0.3-0.5 MeV. So they would fall into the 0.3-0.5 MeV range, which is below 700 keV. So the 700-800 keV band would have some neutrinos, perhaps, but the 800-900 would have very few.

Wait, no. If the neutrinos from pp-I and pp-II are around 0.3 MeV, then the 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) is higher than that. So the majority of the neutrinos in the lower bands would be from pp-III. Wait, but if pp-III stopped, then the 0.7-0.8 MeV band would have much less flux.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. If pp-III produces higher energy neutrinos (like 1.4 MeV), then pp-I and II produce lower energy (like 0.3-0.5 MeV). So the bands 700-800 and 800-900 keV are around 0.7-0.9 MeV. So neutrinos in these bands must come from pp-III, because pp-I and II don't emit in that range.

But wait, the neutrinos from pp-III are 1.4 MeV, which is higher than both bands. So if the pp-III stopped, then the neutrinos in both 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands would be zero, because they're produced only by pp-III? Or am I getting the energies wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken about the energies. Maybe the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are not as high as 1.4 MeV. Let me think about the specific reactions.

In the pp-III branch, the reaction is He-3 + p → He-4 + e+ + ν_e. The Q-value for this reaction is (sum of rest masses of reactants) minus (sum of rest masses of products). The masses are He-3 (3 u), p (1 u), He-4 (4 u), e+ (0.00054858 u), and ν_e (which is negligible as it's a lepton). So the reactants sum to 4 u, products sum to 4 + 0.00054858 ≈ 4.00054858 u. So the Q-value is (4 u - 4.00054858 u) which is negative, but that can't happen. Oh wait, but in reality, the kinetic energy of the particles allows the reaction to proceed. So the Q-value is the kinetic energy involved.

But perhaps the neutrino energy in this reaction is about 0.5 MeV or so. Wait, I think I'm getting confused because I might have mixed up the neutrino energies from different reactions.

Alternatively, maybe the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have lower energies. Let me think again: the reaction in pp-III produces a neutrino, and the energy of that neutrino would depend on the specifics. Some sources say that the neutrinos from the proton-proton chain are in the ~0.3 MeV range, but the exact distribution depends on the branch.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. The question is about the flux ratio of two bands when the pp-III branch stops. So, normally, the flux is a mix of contributions from different branches. If pp-III stops, how does that affect each band?

Assume that the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy bands than the ones we're considering (700-800 and 800-900 keV). Then stopping pp-III would reduce the flux in higher bands but not affect these two. But if the pp-III neutrinos are in the 700-800 keV range, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 1 more than band 2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact energies. Another approach: the main source of neutrinos in the Sun is the pp-1 and pp-2 branches, which produce lower energy neutrinos. The pp-3 branch contributes a smaller fraction but emits higher energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, the high-energy neutrinos (above, say, 1 MeV) would drop, but the lower ones would remain the same.

So the two bands are 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). If the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energies, then these two bands are dominated by the lower-energy neutrinos from pp-1 and 2.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the flux in both bands would be unaffected (since pp-III contributes to higher energies), so the ratio would be roughly the same, making the answer C) 1.

But I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute a significant part of the flux in the higher of these two bands.

Wait, another angle: the solar neutrino spectrum. From what I remember, the majority of solar neutrinos are from the pp-1 and pp-2 branches, which emit lower-energy neutrinos (like around 0.3-0.5 MeV). The pp-3 branch contributes a smaller number but higher energy neutrinos.

So if the pp-3 branch stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like above 1 MeV) would drop, but the lower energies (like 0.7-0.9 MeV) would remain largely unaffected because they're from pp-1 and 2.

Wait, but if the neutrinos from pp-1 and 2 are around 0.5 MeV, then the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are higher than that. So the neutrinos in these bands would come from pp-3. So if pp-3 stops, the flux in both bands would drop to near zero. But that can't be right because the question says that all other reactions remain as they were, so pp-1 and 2 are still producing neutrinos. Wait, but if pp-1 and 2's neutrinos are below 0.7 MeV, then the bands in question would have negligible contribution from pp-1 and 2. So if pp-3 is stopped, the flux in these bands would drop.

Wait, no. If the neutrinos from pp-1 and 2 are around 0.3-0.5 MeV, then the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands would have most of their flux coming from pp-3. So if pp-3 stops, the flux in both bands would drop to almost zero, but I don't think any of the answer options suggest a zero ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I have the neutrino energies wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-1 and pp-2 neutrinos have a broader energy distribution, including some in the higher keV range. For example, if pp-1 neutrinos are around 0.4 MeV, but some could have higher energies, perhaps up to 0.6 MeV. Then the 700-800 keV band would have a small contribution from pp-1, but the main contribution would be from pp-3.

Wait, but if pp-3 stopped, the flux in the higher bands (like 1 MeV) would drop, but the lower bands (like 0.7-0.8 MeV) would have a mix. If the flux in band 1 is from pp-1 and some pp-3, while band 2 is mostly from pp-3, then stopping pp-3 would reduce band 1 and band 2, but perhaps the ratio would change.

But I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should think about the typical neutrino flux spectrum. From what I remember, the solar neutrino flux peaks around 0.3-0.5 MeV and then has a tail extending to higher energies. The higher energies (like 1 MeV) are a much smaller component. So the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands would have some neutrinos, but the majority would be due to the pp-3 branch.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux in band1 to band2. If both bands are dominated by pp-3, then if pp-3 stops, both fluxes drop, but perhaps the ratio remains the same as before if the pp-3 contributes similarly to both bands. But if pp-3 neutrinos have a certain energy distribution, the ratio might change.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have higher energy than both bands, so stopping pp-III doesn't affect the two bands. Then the flux in these bands is only from pp-I and II, which would have the same ratio as before.

Wait, but the neutrinos from pp-I and II have lower energies, so the bands in question (0.7-0.9 MeV) would have negligible contributions. So the
