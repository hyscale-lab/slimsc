Okay, so I've got this question here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things because eccentricity might complicate the transit probability.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's interesting. So more massive but same radius—maybe they're different types? Like, if a higher mass star has the same radius as a lower mass one, perhaps the higher mass one is younger or hasn't expanded yet? Not sure if that matters here, though.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting. So I need to figure out which planet has a higher transit probability.

Wait, what determines the transit probability? I think the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the inclination of the orbit. But since both are already detected via RV, their orbits are edge-on enough that RV detects them. Wait, no—RV detects velocity changes regardless of the inclination, but for transit, the orbit needs to be almost edge-on. So the probability is based on the alignment.

I remember that the probability P that a planet transits its star is given by P = (R_p / a)^2 * (something else?), or maybe it's (R_p / a) multiplied by another factor. Alternatively, another way to think about it is the ratio of the planet's orbital size compared to the star's size. Wait, let me think again.

The transit probability is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital radius, but actually, it's more like (R_* / a) * something else. Oh wait, maybe it's P = (R_p + R_*)^2 / (a (1 + sqrt(1 - (R_p + R_*)² / a²) )) ) No, that might be getting too complicated.

Alternatively, I think the approximate formula for the transit probability is (R_p / a) * (something). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall.

From what I remember, the transit probability is roughly (R_* + R_p)^2 / a², but that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps it's (R_p / a) multiplied by some function involving the star's radius. Alternatively, it's the ratio of the area of the planet to the area of the star, but that's not exactly right either because it depends on the orientation.

Wait, another approach: the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is approximately (R_* / a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that term is 1. So the probability depends on R_* / a.

Wait, no, that's not entirely right. Let me think again. The transit probability P is given by (R_* / a) * (some function). Or maybe the formula is P = (R_* / a) * (1/(something else))).

Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is approximately (R_p + R_*) / a * (1 / (some factor)), but perhaps the exact formula isn't necessary if I can get the ratio right.

Wait, I found in my notes that the transit probability for a circular orbit is approximately (R_* + R_p) / a. But since R_p << R_*, this simplifies to R_* / a. So P ≈ R_* / a.

Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. For a circular orbit, the probability is roughly (R_* / a), but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability is (R_* + R_p)^2 / a², but that doesn't make sense because if a is much larger than R_*, then the probability would be small, which is correct. But R_p is much smaller than R_*, so perhaps the formula is (R_*)^2 / a² multiplied by some factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = (π (R_p + R_*)^2) / (a^2 (1 + cos i)), but that's getting complicated. Or another approach: the transit probability is the area of the star divided by the area of the sphere of radius a, times some factor. Or maybe the probability is (R_*/a)^2 times something.

Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital radius, but that's a linear term, not a squared one. Hmmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the disk of the star. The planet has to pass in front of the star. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned so that this happens is related to the ratio of the size of the star to the orbital distance. For a circular orbit, the probability is (R_*) / (a) multiplied by some function of the impact parameter.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by (R_* + R_p) / a * (1 / (some function of the inclination)), but I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the ratio of the transit probabilities between the two planets.

Let me denote:

For Planet_1: star mass M1 = 2 M2, but radius R1 = R2, since both host stars have same radii.

Planet_1's orbital period is P1 = P2 /3.

We can find the semi-major axis a for each planet using Kepler's third law. Since the stars have same radius but different masses, their a will be different.

Kepler's third law is (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M + m) / (4π^2). Assuming m (planet mass) is negligible compared to M (star mass), so a^3 ∝ M * P².

So for Planet_1:

a1^3 = (G * M1) / (4π²) * (P1)^2.

Similarly for Planet_2:

a2^3 = (G * M2) / (4π²) * (P2)^2.

We can take the ratio a1/a2.

Let me write M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 /3.

So,

a1^3 / a2^3 = ( M1 / M2 ) * ( P1^2 / P2^2 )

Which is (2) * ( (P2/3)^2 / P2^2 ) ) = 2 * (1/9) )= 2/9.

So a1/a2 = cube root(2/9) ≈ (0.222)^1/3 ≈ 0.606.

Wait, 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.606 because 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Now, transit probability depends on R_* / a for each planet.

Since R1 = R2 = R, the transit probability for each planet is proportional to R / a.

So, P1 ∝ R/a1 and P2 ∝ R/a2.

The ratio P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

We found a1/a2 ≈ 0.606, so P1/P2 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, that would mean the probability is higher for Planet_1. So the researchers should observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7, which is higher. So probably C is correct.

Wait, but wait—I'm assuming that the transit probability is proportional to R/a. Is that correct?

Alternatively, I think I might have confused the formula. Let me check.

The transit probability (P) is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits the star. For a circular orbit, the probability is given by:

P = (R_* + R_p) / a,

where R_p is the planet's radius, R_* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis.

But since R_p is much smaller than R_*, this simplifies to approximately R_* / a.

So yes, P is proportional to R_* / a.

So, back to our calculation.

Since R_* is the same for both stars (given in the question), the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis.

Thus, the planet with the smaller a has a higher transit probability.

Since Planet_1 is closer to its star (a1 is smaller than a2), its transit probability is higher.

From earlier, a1 is 0.606 a2, so P1 = (R/a1) = (R/(0.606 a2)) = 1.65 (R/a2).

Which is the same as P1 = 1.65 P2.

Therefore, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. So the researchers should observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Which matches our calculation.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. For a circular orbit, the transit probability \( P \) is approximately proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets have the same \( R_* \), the transit probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \): the smaller \( a \), the higher the transit probability.

### Step 1: Kepler's Third Law
Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M \cdot P^2 \), where \( M \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet, we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes \( a_1 \) (for Planet_1) and \( a_2 \) (for Planet_2). Given:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star),
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's),

we find:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]
Taking the cube root:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{9}} \approx 0.606.
\]

### Step 2: Transit Probability
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since \( R_* \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of the transit probabilities \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}.
\]
Substituting \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 0.606 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
