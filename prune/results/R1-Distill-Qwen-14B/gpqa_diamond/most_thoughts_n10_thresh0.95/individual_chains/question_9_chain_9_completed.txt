Okay, so I've got this question about molecules and their symmetry, specifically C3H symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives me four options: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, and two other compounds with long names. The options are labeled A to D, with each option being one of these molecules. I need to find which one has C3h symmetry.

Wait, what's C3h symmetry? I remember that symmetry in molecules refers to the different types of symmetry elements they possess. C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. Let me recall: Cn refers to a rotation axis of order n, and H refers to a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h would mean there's a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Oh wait, or maybe it's a combination of a rotation and a reflection. Alternatively, maybe it's the same as the D3h point group. Wait, no, C3h is a point group, right? So the C3h point group has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Or is it a three-fold rotation and a σh (horizontal) reflection?

Alternatively, another approach: C3h symmetry implies that the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees around an axis and also has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to that axis (horizontal). So the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane.

Let me look at each option.

Option A: triphenyleno...trifuran...hexaone. That's a mouthful. I'm not familiar with the structure, but the name suggests a fused ring system, maybe with multiple substituents. It's probably a larger molecule with some symmetry.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran...hexaone. Again, a complex name. Benzo suggests a benzene ring fused with other rings, perhaps. The trifuran part indicates three furan rings? Or maybe a tricyclic system.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has a certain structure. Borate esters usually have a boron atom connected to oxygen, which is connected to the isopropyl groups. Triisopropyl borate would have three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Wait, is that structure symmetric? Each isopropyl group is the same, so the molecule should be symmetric. But what kind of symmetry?

Triisopropyl borate is [B(OiPr)3], where iPr is isopropyl. So the structure is a central boron atom with three identical isopropyl groups. Since each isopropyl is the same, the molecule should have a trigonal planar geometry around boron. So that would mean a three-fold rotation axis, right? Because you can rotate the molecule 120 degrees and it looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, the boron is in the center, and each isopropyl group is symmetric. So if you imagine looking down the boron, the three isopropyl groups are arranged like a trigonal planar. So if you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. Now, does it have a mirror plane? If you have a plane that passes through the boron and maybe one of the isopropyl groups, that would be a vertical plane. But for C3h symmetry, you need a horizontal mirror plane. Oh, wait, a horizontal plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis. So for a horizontal mirror plane, if the rotation axis is like the C3 axis, the mirror plane would be perpendicular to it.

Wait, in triisopropyl borate, is there a plane that can reflect the molecule onto itself that's horizontal? Hmm. Wait, the molecule is planar around the boron, so perhaps there's a plane that goes through the boron and each isopropyl's central carbon? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's not that symmetric.

Alternatively, triisopropyl borate may have C3v symmetry instead. C3v would mean a three-fold rotation and vertical mirror planes. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the other options.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, I think. It's a norbornane derivative, right? The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, with a bridge. Wait, no—quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. So it's a bridge structure. How symmetric is quinuclidine? I remember that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis of symmetry. Because if you look at it, it's like a triangular prism. Each bridge is similar. So rotating 120 degrees would bring the molecule into itself. But does it have a mirror plane?

Wait, quinuclidine's structure: it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Each bridge is two carbons. So if you imagine looking down the central axis, which connects the three bridgeheads. So rotating 120 degrees would cycle the three bridges. But does it have a plane of symmetry? Let's think: in the molecule, each bridge is identical. So perhaps a plane that bisects the molecule and includes one bridge and the opposite bridge's position. Hmm, maybe it has a plane perpendicular to the three-fold axis, which would be vertical. So that would be a C3v symmetry, not C3h.

Wait, but C3h symmetry requires a horizontal mirror plane. So if the three-fold axis is, say, vertical, then the mirror plane would be horizontal. Does quinuclidine have such a plane? If you look at the molecule, when you rotate it 120 degrees, but also reflect it across a horizontal plane, would it look the same?

Alternatively, maybe not. Because in quinuclidine, the molecule is symmetric upon rotation, but perhaps not upon reflection through a horizontal plane. So maybe it's C3v symmetry, which is different from C3h.

So back to option C: triisopropyl borate. That is a trigonal planar around boron. So each isopropyl group is the same. So if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees around the boron, it looks the same. But does it have a mirror plane?

Alternatively, consider the molecule in the plane of the boron: each isopropyl is arranged symmetrically. So perhaps in this case, the molecule has a three-fold rotation (C3) and also a horizontal mirror plane. So for C3h symmetry.

Wait, but is the mirror plane horizontal? The boron is in the center, and each isopropyl is arranged around it. So if the rotation is around the boron (like the C3 axis), then the mirror plane would be perpendicular to that axis. So if the C3 axis is vertical, then the mirror plane would be vertical as well, making it a C3v symmetry. Or if the C3 axis is horizontal, then the mirror plane would be horizontal.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused about the orientation. Let me think of the structure. Triisopropyl borate has the boron in the center, with three isopropyl groups attached. Each isopropyl is a CH(CH3)2 group. So arranged symmetrically around boron.

So imagine looking at the boron from the top. The three isopropyl groups are pointing in three directions, 120 degrees apart. The molecule is flat in the plane of the boron. So any rotation around the boron's axis (which would be perpendicular to the plane) would cycle the isopropyl groups. If the axis is vertical, then a horizontal mirror plane would be in the plane of the boron.

Wait, that might make sense. So the plane of the boron and the surrounding isopropyl groups is a horizontal plane. So a mirror plane that is horizontal would reflect the molecule onto itself. So if you look at the molecule, flipping it along the horizontal plane would leave it unchanged. Because the isopropyl groups are symmetric in that plane.

So triisopropyl borate would have a C3 axis (vertical) and a horizontal mirror plane (the plane of the boron and the isopropyl groups). So that would make it C3h symmetry.

Wait, but C3h is a point group. The point group of a molecule depends on the combination of symmetry elements. So if the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, which together make up the C3h group.

So then, triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry. So option C is the answer?

Alternatively, let me think about the other options.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

The name suggests a fused system. Benzo is a benzene ring, and the rest seems like three furan rings fused in some way. The numbering indicates that perhaps the benzene is fused to three furan rings, creating a complex structure. But I'm not sure about the symmetry here. Maybe it's a planar molecule with a center of symmetry or some other symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule with a higher degree of symmetry, but I'm not certain.

Option A: triphenyleno...trifuran...hexaone. Again, a complex name, perhaps a tricyclic system with three phenyl groups attached. But unless it's highly symmetric, it's less likely to have C3h symmetry.

So maybe the options are between C and D.

Wait, what about quinuclidine? Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. So the molecule has three bridges, each consisting of two carbons. It's a very symmetric molecule.

The symmetry of quinuclidine: It has a three-fold rotational axis. If you look at the molecule along the three-fold axis (the axis that goes through the three bridgeheads), rotating 120 degrees will cycle the three bridges. So it has a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Or a vertical one?

Imagine the molecule: each bridge is identical, so reflecting across a plane that includes the rotation axis and one bridge (a vertical plane) would leave the molecule looking the same. So that would be a vertical mirror plane, making the symmetry C3v, not C3h.

So in that case, quinuclidine would have C3v symmetry, not C3h.

So going back, triisopropyl borate (option C) would have a C3 axis (vertical) and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h.

Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Because when you have three identical groups around a central atom, the mirror planes would be vertical, not horizontal.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again about the structure. The boron is in the center, and three isopropyl groups are attached. The molecule lies in a plane (the plane of the boron and the OR groups). So maybe the plane itself is a mirror plane. If the mirror plane is the plane that contains the boron and the isopropyl groups, then it's a horizontal plane. Because the boron is above the plane of the paper, for example, and the mirror plane would be along that plane.

Wait, no. If the boron is in the center and the isopropyl groups are arranged around it in a trigonal planar geometry, the plane where the boron and the points where the isopropyl groups attach would be a horizontal mirror plane. Or wait, maybe not. The mirror plane would bisect the molecule, perhaps vertically. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane but has vertical mirror planes. So C3v symmetry. Because each mirror plane would pass through the boron and one of the isopropyl groups.

In that case, triisopropyl borate would have C3v symmetry, not C3h.

But I thought earlier that the plane of the molecule (the plane where the boron and the attached oxygens are) could be a horizontal mirror plane. But perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about other examples. For instance, benzene has D6h symmetry, which includes multiple mirror planes. But for C3h symmetry, perhaps a simpler example is formaldehyde. Wait, no, formaldehyde is C2v. Wait, maybe propeller-like structures?

Wait, another approach: the C3h point group consists of a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So any molecule with C3h would have that combination. So if triisopropyl borate has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, then yes.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another way to think: the C3h group is one of the point groups. It's a subgroup of D3h, I think, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine, which has C3 symmetry but not a horizontal mirror plane, so C3v.

Wait, but the question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. So if triisopropyl borate has both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it's C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the mirror plane. The horizontal mirror plane would require that when you reflect the molecule across that plane, it looks the same. So in triisopropyl borate, if you imagine a horizontal plane cutting through the boron and the centers of the isopropyl groups, then reflecting would leave the molecule unchanged.

Wait, but the isopropyl groups are arranged around the boron. So if you reflect across that horizontal plane, each isopropyl group would have to be symmetric across that plane. But wait, each isopropyl group is a CH(CH3)2 group. If the mirror plane is cutting through the central carbon of the isopropyl group, then each isopropyl would look the same after reflection. Because each isopropyl is symmetrical. So maybe yes.

So triisopropyl borate would have a C3 axis (vertical, through the boron) and a horizontal mirror plane (the plane through the boron and the central carbons of the isopropyl groups), making it C3h.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option C: triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A) triphenyleno... (probably not)

B) benzo... (not sure)

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine (probably C3v)

So I think option C is correct.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the symmetry elements required for this point group: a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Each option is evaluated based on its structure and symmetry.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple fused rings. While it may have some symmetry due to the fused system, it does not exhibit the required combination of a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it does not have **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule also features a fused ring system, likely involving a benzene ring and three furan rings. The symmetry of this system is insufficient to meet the criteria for **C₃h symmetry**, as it lacks both a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups arranged in a trigonal planar geometry. This arrangement provides a **C₃ axis** (rotational symmetry of 120°). Additionally, the molecule has a **horizontal mirror plane** that passes through the boron atom and the central carbons of the isopropyl groups, reflecting the molecule onto itself. This combination satisfies the requirements for **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure with three identical bridges. It has a **C₃ axis** due to the rotational symmetry of 120°. However, its symmetry plane is vertical (perpendicular to the C₃ axis), making it **C₃v symmetry**, not **C₃h symmetry**.

### Conclusion  
Among the options, only **triisopropyl borate** exhibits the required **C₃h symmetry**, as it combines a three-fold rotational axis with a horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: C**
