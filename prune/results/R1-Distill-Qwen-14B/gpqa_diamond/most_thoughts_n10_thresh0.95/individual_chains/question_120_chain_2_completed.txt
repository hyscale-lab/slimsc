Alright, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about the distribution of stars in the sky based on their parallax. Okay, let's think through this step by step.

So the question is: If stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx? The options are A to D, each with different power laws.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance; specifically, plx (in arcseconds) is approximately 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, meaning as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Let's think about how many stars would be in a given range of parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, their number should depend on the volume they occupy. But how does that translate into parallax ranges?

Wait, volume in terms of distance. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a shell between distance d and d + dd depends on the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4πd² dd multiplied by the number density of stars.

But since we're considering parallax, which is 1/d, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx. Let me let plx = p. Then d = 1/p. So, substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/p)² dd. But wait, how does dd relate to dp? Let's see: since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. Hmm, I need to be careful with the differentials here.

Wait, if plx p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, solving for dd, we get dd = -d² dp. But since we're dealing with positive ranges, maybe the negative sign just indicates direction, so we can take the absolute value. So, dd = d² dp.

Putting it back into the volume: 4π d² dd = 4π d² (d² dp) )= 4π d^4 dp. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no—wait, wait. Let me redo that.

The volume element (dV) is 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell at radius d with thickness dd is surface area (4πd²) times thickness (dd). So, dV = 4π d² dd.

Now, expressing d in terms of p: d = 1/p. So, substituting, dV =4π (1/p)^2 * dd.

But we need to express this in terms of dp, which is the change in parallax. From p = 1/d, differentiating both sides, dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = - d² dp. Since we're considering small increments, the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but for the magnitude, we can ignore the negative. So, dd = d² dp.

Substituting into dV: dV =4π (1/p²) * (d² dp) ). But d is 1/p, so d² is (1/p)^2. So:

dV =4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp )= 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the volume element in terms of p is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But the number of stars in a volume element is the volume multiplied by the number density (n), which is stars per unit volume. Since stars are uniformly distributed, n is constant.

So the number of stars, dn, in a shell with parallax between p and p+dp is dn = n * dV = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So, the number per unit dp is (dn)/(dp) = 4π n (1/p^4).

Wait, but the question is phrased as the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, for a small unit change in p, the number is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number density in p-space is ~ 1/p^4.

But wait, let me think again. The options are presented as how the number changes with plx. So, if the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4, that would mean as plx increases (p gets larger), the number decreases rapidly.

Looking at the options:

A) ~1/plx^4

B) ~1/plx^2

C) ~1/plx

D) ~1/plx^3.

So according to this, the correct option would be A, 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait another thought. Does this make sense? Because higher parallax (p) means closer stars. So, if p increases, the number of stars per unit p should increase or decrease?

Wait, stars with higher parallax (closer) are more dense in p. Hmm, because for a given small change in p, closer stars are more numerous. Wait, no. Let me think: for a given change in p, say from p to p + delta_p, how does the number of stars relate to p.

Wait, from the calculation, the number of stars per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. So as p increases (moving to more distant stars), the number per unit p goes down. But wait, in reality, for a given p, more stars are at lower p (closer). So, the number per unit p should decrease as p increases, which matches the 1/p^4 behavior.

So option A is ~1/p^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me think if I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me recheck the substitution steps.

dV =4π d² dd.

Expressed in terms of p: d =1/p. So dd = d² dp.

So substituting, dV =4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp )=4π (1/p^4) dp.

So yes, that's correct.

Thus, the number of stars per unit p (i.e., per unit of parallax) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely related to distance \( d \), such that \( p = 1/d \). The number of stars in a given range of parallax depends on the volume of the spherical shell at that distance, which is proportional to \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \). 

Expressing \( d \) in terms of \( p \) (\( d = 1/p \)) and substituting into the volume element, we get:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 \, dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \, dd.
\]

To relate \( dd \) to \( dp \), we use the relation \( dp = -\frac{1}{d^2} \, dd \), which gives \( dd = d^2 \, dp \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \), we find:

\[
dd = \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \, dp.
\]

Substituting this back into the volume element:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \, dp = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} \, dp.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to \( dV \), so the number of stars per unit range of \( p \) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). This means that as \( p \) increases (corresponding to more distant stars), the number of stars per unit \( p \) decreases rapidly.

Among the options provided:

- **A) \( \sim 1/p^4 \):** Matches the derived result.
- **B) \( \sim 1/p^2 \):** Incorrect, as it does not match the \( 1/p^4 \) dependence.
- **C) \( \sim 1/p \):** Incorrect, as it underestimates the rate of decrease.
- **D) \( \sim 1/p^3 \):** Incorrect, as it does not match the derived power law.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
