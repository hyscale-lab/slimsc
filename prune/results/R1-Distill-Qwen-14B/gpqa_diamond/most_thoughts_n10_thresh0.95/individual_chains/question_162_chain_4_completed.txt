Okay, so I have this question about a pseudosphere and its area. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that the metric describes the geometry of the spacetime, and in this case, it seems to be a 2-dimensional spacetime because there are only dx and dy terms.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. In 2D, it's like a hyperbolic plane. The metric given might be representing that.

So, I need to find the area of this pseudosphere with radius 2. But wait, what's the formula for the area of a pseudosphere? I think regular spheres have area 4πr², but pseudospheres are different because of the negative curvature.

Wait, but wait, pseudospheres are non-compact, which means they have infinite area. Or is that only for certain models? Like, the hyperbolic plane has infinite area. But wait, maybe in this specific metric, the radius is r=2, which might affect that. Hmm.

Let me think about the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up. That suggests that the coordinate system is valid only when x² + y² <4, right? So that's a circle of radius 2. Wait, so maybe this is a model of hyperbolic space, like the Poincaré disk model, which has radius 2 here. Because in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is (4/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), but here, it's written in terms of x and y, so perhaps x² + y² = r², which would be similar.

In the Poincaré disk model, the area element is given by (4/(4 - r²)^2) r dr dθ. Wait, I remember that the area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite. Because even though the model is finite in radius, the area element integrates to infinity as you approach the boundary. So integrating over the entire disk would give an infinite area.

So for the pseudosphere (which is the 2D hyperbolic space), the area is infinite. So among the options, option D is +infty. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, what's the radius in this context? Oh, maybe the curvature radius. I think the radius in the pseudosphere is related to the curvature. The pseudosphere has a constant negative curvature, and the radius is related as r = 1/|k|, where k is the Gaussian curvature.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature K of a hyperbolic plane is negative. For the Poincaré disk model, the curvature is K = -1/(r^2), where r is the model's radius. So if our model has a radius of 2, then K = -1/(2^2) = -1/4. But the radius of the pseudosphere (the term we're asked about) would be related to the absolute value of 1/K, right? So 1/|K| would be 4, but the question says r=2. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is for a pseudosphere with radius 2, so the curvature would be K = -1/(2^2) = -1/4. But regardless, the area would still be infinite because hyperbolic space is unbounded.

So, the area of the pseudosphere (the entire hyperbolic plane) is infinite. Therefore, the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{(4 - x^2 - y^2)}(dx^2 + dy^2)
\]

describes a 2-dimensional spacetime. The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in 2D, it corresponds to the hyperbolic plane. The metric resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, where the coordinate system is valid only within a disk of radius 2 (since the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) becomes singular at \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \)).

In the Poincaré disk model, the area element is proportional to \( \frac{1}{(4 - r^2)^2} r \, dr \, d\theta \), where \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Integrating this area element over the entire disk reveals that the total area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite. This is because the area element diverges as \( r \) approaches the boundary of the disk (\( r \to 2 \)).

Thus, the pseudosphere, representing the hyperbolic plane, has an infinite area. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D) \( +\infty \)**.
