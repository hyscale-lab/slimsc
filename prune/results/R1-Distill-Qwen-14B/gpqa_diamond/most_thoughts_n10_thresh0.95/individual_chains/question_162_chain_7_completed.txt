Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that denominator looks like 4 - (x² + y²), which reminds me of the equation of a sphere. Because x² + y² + z² = r² for a sphere, but here it's 4, so radius 2 maybe? Since 4 is 2 squared. So maybe this is a 2-sphere with radius 2. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like a saddle shape, while a sphere has positive curvature.

Wait, wait. The metric given is in terms of 2D coordinates, x and y. So this is a 2-dimensional metric, meaning we're looking at a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space. Oh wait, no, the metric is for a 2-dimensional spacetime, perhaps? Or maybe it's the induced metric on some surface.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The metric ds² is given in terms of dx and dy, so it's a 2-dimensional metric. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps this metric describes a pseudosphere.

Wait, but pseudospheres are surfaces with negative Gaussian curvature. Let me recall the metric for a pseudosphere. A standard parametrization for a pseudosphere uses hyperbolic functions. The metric for a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is usually something like ds² = dr² + (a² cosh²(r/a))² dθ², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe in isometric coordinates, the metric can look different.

Wait, another approach: the given metric is for a surface, perhaps in polar coordinates. Let me try to convert it into polar coordinates because x and y are Cartesian. Let me set x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. Then, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So substituting that into the metric, we get:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²)

So the metric in polar coordinates is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ².

Wait a second, this looks similar to the metric of a surface with a specific curvature. Let me think about the form. In polar coordinates, the metric for a surface of revolution is generally ds² = g_rr dr² + g_θθ dθ², where g_rr = a(r) and g_θθ = b(r)². For a surface of constant curvature, like a sphere or a pseudosphere, the metric would have a specific form.

Wait, for a sphere of radius a in polar coordinates, the metric is ds² = a² (dr²/(a² - r²)²) + (a² sin²(r/a)) dθ²). Hmm, that doesn't look exactly like what we have. Let me see: our metric after substitution is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ².

Let me factor out 32/(4 - r²) to get:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²)

Wait, the term in the parentheses is dr² + r² dθ², which is the standard metric in polar coordinates for flat space. But here it's scaled by 32/(4 - r²). So perhaps this is a space with variable curvature?

But I'm not sure about that. Let me think about the area. The area of a surface is given by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric over the coordinates. For a 2D metric, the area element dA is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dθ dr. Wait, no, the area element is sqrt(det g) dθ dr, which for a diagonal metric is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dθ dr.

So in our case, g_rr is 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ is [32 r²/(4 - r²)]. So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

So the area element dA is sqrt( (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^4 )) dr dθ. Wait, wait a minute. Let me compute that correctly.

Wait, determinant is g_rr * g_θθ = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

So the square root of the determinant is sqrt( (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) = (32 r)/(4 - r²).

Wait, no, because sqrt( (32)^2 ) is 32, sqrt(r²) is r, and sqrt( (4 - r²)^2 ) is (4 - r²). So yes, sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) = (32 r)/(4 - r²).

So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

But wait, what are the limits of integration? The metric is only defined where the denominator is positive, so 4 - r² > 0 → r² <4 → r < 2. So r goes from 0 to 2, right?

So the area would be the integral from r=0 to r=2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral.

First, the θ integral is straightforward: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 2π * ∫0 to 2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32/(u)] * (-du/2).

Wait, because r dr = - du/2 → dr = (- du)/(2 r), but since we have r dr, it's better to substitute.

Wait, let me rewrite ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr as 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

With substitution u =4 - r²,

du = -2 r dr → -(du/2) = r dr.

So,

32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ [ (1/u) ] ( - du/2 )

So this becomes 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du = -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

But the limits: when r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So the integral is from u=4 to u=0.

So ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) (-du/2) when substituting.

Wait, perhaps I should adjust the limits accordingly. Because when r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the integral becomes ∫ from 4 to 0 of [32/(u)] * (-du/2) ?

Wait, perhaps better to do the substitution and flip the limits.

So,

∫_{r=0}^{2} [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫_{u=4}^{0} [1/u] * (-du/2)

Wait, yeah. Because u =4 -r²: when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So,

32 * ∫_{u=4}^{0} [1/u] * (-du/2) → 32 * ∫_{u=4}^{0} [1/u] * (-du/2) → 32 * (1/2) ∫_{u=0}^{4} (1/u) du.

Because the negative sign flips the limits from 4 to 0 to 0 to 4.

So that becomes 16 ∫_{0}^{4} (1/u) du.

Wait, but the integral of 1/u is ln|u| + C. So,

16 [ ln(u) ] from 0 to 4.

But ln(4) is okay, but ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral becomes 16 ( ln(4) - (-∞) ) → 16 * ( ln(4) + ∞ ) → which is infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.

Hmm, but wait, the pseudosphere is a finite area, isn't it? Or is it? I thought the pseudosphere has finite area. But maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me double-check.

Wait, the substitution was:

u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

The integral becomes:

32 ∫ [r dr / (4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2 ) / u ] = -16 ∫ (du/u )

Evaluated from u=4 to u=0.

So,

-16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0 → -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → -∞ - ln(4) = -∞.

Multiply by -16: (-16)( -∞ - ln(4) ) → 16 ( ∞ + ln(4) ), which is ∞.

So the integral is divergent. So the area would be infinite.

Wait, but I thought a pseudosphere has finite area. Oh wait, perhaps not. Or maybe the given metric doesn't represent a pseudosphere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Gaussian curvature. If the metric is conformally flat, perhaps it's a sphere or a pseudosphere.

The given metric is conformally flat because it's a multiple of the flat metric. Because ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dx² + dy²) = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²).

Wait, the conformal factor is λ² = 32/(4 - r²).

The Gaussian curvature K of a conformally flat metric in 2D is given by:

K = - (1/(2 λ²)) [ ( ∂² ln λ² ) / ∂θ² + ( ∂² ln λ² ) / ∂r² ]

Wait, perhaps I can compute K to see if it's negative (which would indicate a pseudosphere) or positive (sphere).

Let me compute ln λ² = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

So, ln λ² = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

Compute the derivatives:

d(ln λ²)/dr = [ 0 - ( (-2 r) / (4 - r²) ) ] → 2 r/(4 - r²).

Second derivative:

d² (ln λ²)/dr² = [ (2 (4 - r²) ) - 2 r ( -2 r ) ] / (4 - r²)^2

Wait, applying the quotient rule:

Numerator: 2(4 - r²) + (2 r)(2 r) → 2(4 - r² + 2 r² ) → 2(4 + r² )

Denominator: (4 - r²)^2.

So,

d² (ln λ²)/dr² = [2 (4 + r²) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Similarly, d² (ln λ²)/dθ² is zero because ln λ² doesn't depend on θ.

So,

K = - (1/(2 λ²)) [ 0 + [2 (4 + r²)]/(4 - r²)^2 ].

λ² is 32/(4 - r²), so 1/(2 λ²) = (4 - r²)/(64).

So,

K = - [ (4 - r²)/(64) ] * [ 2 (4 + r²) ] / (4 - r²)^2 )

Simplify:

K = - [ (4 - r²) * 2 (4 + r²) ) ] / [64 (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The 4 - r² in numerator and denominator cancels one term.

So,

K = - [ 2 (4 + r²) ] / [64 (4 - r²) )

Simplify 2/64 to 1/32:

K = - (4 + r²) / [32 (4 - r²) ]

Hmm, so K is negative for r² <4, because denominator is positive, numerator is positive, and the negative sign makes K negative. So the Gaussian curvature is negative everywhere, which is consistent with a pseudosphere.

But earlier when calculating the area, I found it to be infinite. But I thought a pseudosphere has finite area. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the metric given is not a standard pseudosphere. Or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the area.

Wait, another thought: the metric is defined for r <2. But when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the conformal factor blow up. So as r approaches 2, the area element (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ becomes very large. So the integral near r=2 might diverge, leading the total area to be infinite.

Wait, but a pseudosphere has finite area. So perhaps this isn't a regular pseudosphere. Or maybe the question is about a different kind of surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question. Because the area is divergent, the area is infinite, so the answer would be D) +infty.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the given metric is of a sphere, but with a different radius. Let me think again.

Wait, when I computed K, the Gaussian curvature is negative, which suggests a hyperbolic surface. So it's a surface of negative curvature, which would be a pseudosphere.

But if the area is infinite, then the answer would be D.

But earlier I thought the pseudosphere has finite area. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me think: the tractricoid, which is a pseudosphere, is a surface of revolution, and it has finite area. Because when you revolve a tractrix, which approaches a straight line asymptotically, the surface area converges.

Wait, so why is the area here infinite? Because the metric might not correspond to a standard tractricoid, but a different kind of surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a sphere. Let me think about the given metric again.

Wait, ds² = [32/(4 - x² -y²)] (dx² + dy²). If I set x² + y² = r², then denominator is 4 - r². So the surface is only defined for r <2. So it's a 2D surface embedded in 3D space? Or is it a 2D spacetime? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given metric isn't that of a sphere but another shape. But regardless, when calculating the area, it seems to be infinite.

Wait, another approach: the given metric is similar to the metric of a 2-sphere in isothermal coordinates. Isothermal coordinates have the property that the metric is conformally flat, ds² = λ²(dx² + dy²), where λ is a function. For the 2-sphere, λ would be a function that makes the Gaussian curvature positive.

In our case, the Gaussian curvature K is negative, which makes it a hyperbolic surface. So the given metric describes a hyperbolic plane or part of it. But the hyperbolic plane has infinite area, which would agree with the integral result.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a finite area surface. So perhaps the given metric doesn't represent a pseudosphere but a different kind of surface.

Alternatively, maybe I missed something in the calculation. Let me re-express the area integral.

Wait, area is ∫∫ sqrt( g_rr g_θθ - (g_rθ)^2 ) dr dθ. Since the metric is diagonal (g_rθ=0), sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) is just the product.

So,

Area = ∫0^{2π} ∫0^2 [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)]^{1/2} dr dθ ?

Wait no, wait. Wait, I think I confused the area element earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, no, because the metric is ds²= g_rr dr² + g_θθ dθ². So the area element is sqrt( g_rr g_θθ ) dr dθ.

Which in our case is sqrt(32/(4 - r²) * 32 r²/(4 - r²) )

= sqrt( (32^2 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 )

= (32 r) / (4 - r² )

Wait, same as before. So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Integrate over r from 0 to 2 and θ from 0 to 2π.

So,

A = 2π ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Hmm, same as before.

But let me compute this integral again.

Let me compute I = ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me use substitution u = 4 - r², du = -2 r dr → ( - du )/ 2 = r dr.

So,

I = 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ [ (1/u) ( - du/2 ) ] from u=4 to u=0.

Which is,

I = 32 * (-1/2) ∫_{4}^{0} (1/u) du → 32 * (-1/2) [ ln u ]_{4}^0.

Which becomes,

I = -16 [ ln 0 - ln4 ] → -16 ( (-infty) - ln4 ) → -16 (-infty) → infinity.

So the integral diverges to infinity. So the area is infinite.

But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. If the pseudosphere's area is finite, but according to this calculation, it's infinite. So perhaps the given metric is not that of a pseudosphere, but the question says it's a pseudosphere. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is finite due to some other consideration. Wait, maybe the metric is in a different coordinate system where the area doesn't blow up. Or perhaps the metric is for a compact surface.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given metric is on the entire plane, but the area is infinite because the surface extends infinitely. But a pseudosphere is a finite surface. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the area of the entire pseudosphere, which is finite, but the metric given doesn't correspond to a compact surface. So that might mean that the area is infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, and the area is zero because it's considering a line or something else. But no, the options also have 4π(x² + y²) etc., which don't make much sense, but 0 and infinity are possibilities.

So, given that our calculation for the area leads to infinity, the answer must be D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

This is a 2-dimensional metric, and the question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute the area, we first convert the metric into polar coordinates by substituting \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \), which gives:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left( dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 \right).
\]

The area element in polar coordinates is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta}} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \( g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \) and \( g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} \). The determinant of the metric is:

\[
g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The area is then computed by integrating \( dA \) over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator \( 4 - r^2 \) ensures that the metric is valid for \( r < 2 \). Therefore, the limits of integration are \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 2 \) and \( \theta = 0 \) to \( \theta = 2\pi \). The total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The \( \theta \)-integration is straightforward:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the \( r \)-integration, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2} \). When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \), and when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{u} \) is \( \ln|u| \), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 16 \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

Since \( \ln 0 \to -\infty \), the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite. This suggests that the given metric does not describe a standard pseudosphere, which has finite area. Instead, the surface described by the metric has infinite area.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
