Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and some compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to figure out what reagent A and catalyst B are from the given options.

Wait, I remember that when you have a cyclic amine like pyrrolidine reacting with something under acidic conditions, it's probably some kind of alkylation or maybe an aldol-like addition. Oh wait, wait, wait. Another possibility is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation but that's usually with aromatic rings.

Wait, the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached. The cyclohexylidene suggests an ene group or something with a ring. Oh, cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexene group attached via a double bond. Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group with a double bond, like a cyclohexene substituent.

So, looking back, the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. When it reacts with compound A under acid catalysis, it forms this new product. So what's the likely reaction here?

3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring. The product has an additional substituent where a cyclohexene ring is connected via a methylene group. So maybe it's an alkylation where a new carbon chain is added, but with a ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's an enamine formation.

Wait, another angle: the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is a methylene group attached to a cyclohexene ring. So, the structure would be a pyrrolidine ring with a CH2 group attached, and that CH2 is connected to a cyclohexene (so maybe a cyclohexenylmethyl group).

So, how does that form? Let me think about possible reactions.

An acid-catalyzed reaction of amines with carbonyl compounds could lead to imine formation, but that's more about ketones or aldehydes. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition or some kind of alkylation.

Wait, the product seems to have a cyclohexene ring, which is a cyclic alkene. So perhaps compound A is a carbonyl compound that upon reaction forms an imine or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a form of the Mannich reaction, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's an example of pinacol rearrangement, but that's more about vicinal diols.

Wait, another thought: if compound A is an aldehyde, like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then in the presence of an acid catalyst, the amine might undergo some kind of addition.

Wait, but 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine. So, when a secondary amine reacts with an aldehyde under acidic conditions, what happens? Maybe it forms an imine? But wait, imine formation typically involves a primary amine and a carbonyl group. Secondary amines form enamines, I think.

Oh right! Enamine formation. Enamines are formed when a secondary amine reacts with a ketone or aldehyde. The process involves two steps: first, the amine acts as a base to deprotonate the carbonyl, forming a hemiaminal. Then, under acidic conditions, the hemiaminal loses water to form the iminium ion, which can then tautomerize to form the enamine.

Wait, but in this case, the product has a cyclohexene ring attached. So maybe compound A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me think: if the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde with a cyclohexyl group), then when it reacts with the amine, perhaps it forms an enamine that has a cyclohexenyl group.

Wait, but how does the cyclohexene form? Oh, because when an aldehyde (RCHO) reacts with a secondary amine, after forming the enamine, the structure would have a double bond. So, maybe the aldehyde then undergoes elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, let me think through the enamine mechanism. Let's say the amine is 3-methylpyrrolidine. It reacts with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO-C6H11). The first step is the formation of the iminium ion. Then, the proton on the adjacent carbon is abstracted, leading to the formation of the enamine. But wait, in this case, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl), which suggests that the cyclohexene is attached to the pyrrolidine via a methylene group.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into an enamine, which upon deprotonation forms a double bond, giving the cyclohexene ring.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't enamine formation. Another possibility is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Wait, but pyrrolidine isn't aromatic, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't apply here.

Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition of the amine to a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the structure of the product again. The substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. That group would be -CH2-C6H10, but with a double bond in the cyclohexene ring. So maybe the cyclohexene is formed via elimination.

Another approach: the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is on the pyrrolidine's nitrogen. I think the pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The substituent is a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexene.

Wait, but when a secondary amine reacts with an aldehyde under acid catalysis, you typically form an enamine. The enamine would have a double bond adjacent to the nitrogen. Let me think about enamine structure. Enamines are compounds with a conjugated double bond between the carbon and nitrogen, like R2N-CH2-CH2-CH2... Wait, no, more accurately, the general structure is R2N–CH2–CH2–, but with a double bond. So when an aldehyde reacts, perhaps the enamine has a double bond adjacent to the N.

Wait, but in this case, the product's substituent is a cyclohexene attached via a methylene group. So maybe the enamine formation leads to the cyclohexene being part of the structure.

Wait, another possibility: the compound A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So when this reacts with 3-methylpyrrolidine under acid catalysis, it forms an enamine. The enamine would have the structure where the aldehyde's carbonyl becomes a double bond. So the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO-C6H11-) would form an enamine where the aldehyde group becomes a methylene group attached to the pyrrolidine, and the cyclohexene is part of the same structure.

Wait, maybe the cyclohexane ring is part of the enamine structure. So, when the aldehyde reacts with the amine, perhaps the aldehyde's carbonyl gets converted into a double bond, so the cyclohexyl group is attached via a double bond.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the product. The substituent is cyclohexylidene methyl, so it's a methylene group attached to a cyclohexene. So the structure would be CH2-C6H10 (but with double bond in the cyclohexene). So the enamine would have that structure attached to the pyrrolidine.

So, if the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then reacting with the amine would form an enamine with the structure R-N-CH2-Cyclohexene. But wait, how would that happen?

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is converted into an imine, but since it's a secondary amine, it forms an enamine. The enamine formation typically involves the amine attacking the carbonyl, then losing water to form the double bond.

Wait, so thinking of the enamine mechanism: the aldehyde (RCHO) reacts with the amine (RNH2) in acid. First, the amine deprotonates the aldehyde, forming a hemiaminal (RCH(OH)NR2), then under acid conditions, it loses a water molecule to form the enamine (RCH=NR2).

Wait, but in the product, the substituent is R-CH2-C6H10, which is a methylene group attached to a cyclohexene. Hmm, perhaps the cyclohexane ring comes from the aldehyde's R group.

Wait, if the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO-C6H11), then when it forms the enamine, the structure would be (C6H11)CH=N-R, where R is the pyrrolidine group. Wait, but the product is cyclohexylidene methyl attached to the pyrrolidine, so perhaps the enamine's structure is such that the cyclohexene is part of the substituent.

Wait, maybe the cyclohexylidene comes from the aldehyde's R group. So, when the enamine forms, the R group becomes part of the double bond. Let me visualize: the aldehyde is CH2(C6H11)CHO. No, wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is just (cyclohexyl)methanal: O=CH-CH2-C6H11? No, wait, no. No, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is O=CH- attached to a cyclohexane ring, so structure is O=CH-C6H11. So, when it forms the enamine with 3-methylpyrrolidine, the structure would be CH2-C6H11 connected via a double bond to the N of pyrrolidine.

Wait, no. The enamine would have the structure (pyrrolidine)-N-CH2-C6H11, but with a double bond between N and CH2? Or between CH2 and C6H11?

Actually, in the enamine, the structure is R2N-CH2-CH2-... but with a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Enamine structure: when an aldehyde (RCHO) reacts with a secondary amine (R2NH), the product is RCH=N-R2. So in this case, R is cyclohexylmethyl (from cyclohexanecarbaldehyde: R = C6H11CH2?), no, wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is (cyclohexyl)carbaldehyde, so the aldehyde is attached directly to the cyclohexane. So R is C6H11.

So the enamine would be (C6H11)CH=N-pyrrolidine. But the product in the question is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine.

Wait, that doesn't seem to match. Unless the enamine rearranges or the cyclohexane part forms a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine isn't the right approach. Let me think of another reaction.

Wait, another possibility is a Claisen or aldol condensation. But I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a Robinson annulation, but that's more about forming rings through conjugate additions and aldol reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Strecker synthesis, but that's for amino acids.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the options. The options are:

A) A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH
B) A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid
C) A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid
D) A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH

So the options for compound A are either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane. The catalysts are TsOH or acetic acid.

TsOH is p-toluenesulfonic acid, a strong acid catalyst, often used in acid-catalyzed reactions like esterifications, alkylation, etc.

So, if A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then the reaction would involve the aldehyde and the amine. If A is vinylcyclohexane, then it's an alkene.

Wait, if A is vinylcyclohexane, which is C6H11-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, perhaps. So if we have a vinyl group, then the reaction could be a conjugate addition or some kind of cyclopropanation, but not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the reagent is vinylcyclohexane, and the catalyst is acid, perhaps it's a [2+1] cycloaddition. But under acidic conditions, I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be an alkylation via carbocation.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is a methylene group connected to a cyclohexene. So perhaps compound A is something that can form a carbocation, and the amine acts as a nucleophile.

Wait, if A is vinylcyclohexane, perhaps under acid conditions, it could form a carbocation. For example, vinylcyclohexane could undergo ionization to form a carbocation adjacent to the double bond, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but vinylcyclohexane might not form a stable carbocation easily. Alternatively, if A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which under acid could form an enol, which might undergo some conjugate addition.

Alternatively, considering the product, the addition of a cyclohexenylmethyl group to the amine suggests that the cyclohexene part is being formed via elimination. So maybe the amine reacts with a carbonyl, then the carbonyl is converted into a double bond.

Wait, going back to the enamine idea. Enamines are formed from secondary amines and ketones or aldehydes. The enamine has the structure R2N-CH2-CH2-... but with a double bond. So if the starting aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, the enamine would have the cyclohexyl group attached to the CH2 group adjacent to the N.

So the product would be something like pyrrolidine with a CH2-C6H11 group attached, but with a double bond between the N and the CH2?

Wait, no, the enamine structure is R2N-CH2-CH2-... but in this case, the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so R would be cyclohexyl. Then, the enamine would be (3-methylpyrrolidine)N-CH2-C6H11. But wait, that's not a double bond. Oh, but in the enamine, the structure is R2N-CH2-CH2-... but the double bond is between N and CH2. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl. The general structure is R2N-CH2-CH2-..., but the enamine itself is a conjugated system with a double bond between the N and the adjacent carbon. So for example, the enamine would have the structure R2N-CH2-CH2-... but with a double bond between N and CH2, making it R2NC=CH2.

Wait, but in the product, the substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. So the structure would look like:

pyrrolidine-N-CH2-C6H10 (with a double bond in the cyclohexene).

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via a different mechanism. Maybe the aldehyde forms a Schiff base, but with a secondary amine, which would be an enamine.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a Strecker synthesis, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an example of a conjugate addition. For example, the amine could add to a carbonyl compound conjugated with a double bond, leading to a new carbon-nitrogen bond.

Wait, if compound A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then under acidic conditions, maybe it forms an enol, and the amine adds to the alpha position, leading to a new carbon-nitrogen bond.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the options. Option A and B have cyclohexanecarbaldehyde as A, while C and D have vinylcyclohexane.

If I think about the catalysts, TsOH is a strong acid, while acetic acid is a weaker acid. So maybe the reaction requires a strong acid catalyst.

Wait, the product has a cyclohexene ring, which suggests that elimination has occurred. So perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed elimination after some kind of addition.

So, if 3-methylpyrrolidine reacts with an aldehyde, under acid, perhaps the aldehyde gets added to the amine to form a hemiaminal, which then dehydrates to form an enamine, which could then eliminate to form a double bond.

Wait, but the enamine itself has a double bond. So perhaps the product is the enamine, which would have a double bond between the N and the adjacent carbon. So in the product, the substituent would be a double bond adjacent to N, making the structure have a double bond there.

But the product's substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl, which is a double bond in the cyclohexene, not between N and the substituent.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reagents.

Option A and B have cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So assuming that's correct, then the catalyst is TsOH or acetic acid.

Which catalyst is more likely for enamine formation? Enamine formation typically requires an acid catalyst, yes. The usual conditions are using an acid, like HCl or AcOH, but sometimes stronger acids like TsOH are used.

So if the reaction is enamine formation, then both options A and B are possible, but TsOH is a stronger acid. Alternatively, acetic acid is commonly used in enamine formation.

Wait, another thought: the enamine formation can involve two steps. The first is the formation of the iminium ion, which is typically done under acidic conditions. So TsOH would provide strong acid conditions, which might be necessary for the reaction to proceed efficiently.

Alternatively, acetic acid is a mild acid and might not be strong enough, but I'm not certain.

Now, considering the product structure, it's 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is a methylene group attached to a cyclohexene.

In enamine formation, the product would have the structure R2N-CH2-CH2-..., but with a double bond between N and the first CH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of it wrong. Let me draw it mentally.

The enamine structure would be pyrrolidine with a CH2 group attached, and that CH2 is connected to a cyclohexene. So, the substituent is CH2-C6H10, where C6H10 is a cyclohexene ring.

So the enamine would be formed by the aldehyde reacting with the amine, leading to the structure where the aldehyde's carbonyl becomes a double bond in the substituent.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled, but perhaps the correct reagents are cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and TsOH.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the catalyst is either TsOH or acetic acid.

Which catalyst is used for enamine formation? I think enamine formation usually uses a strong acid like H2SO4 or HCl. But TsOH is a strong acid as well, and acetic acid is weaker.

So, using TsOH as the catalyst (option A) would make sense for this reaction. So the reagent A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the catalyst B is TsOH, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a different kind of alkylation. But considering all the options, I think the correct answer is option A or B.

Wait, another angle: if the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine, that substituent is a methylene (CH2) group attached to a cyclohexene. So, the cyclohexene must have been formed via elimination. So perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition followed by elimination.

Wait, when an aldehyde reacts with an amine, perhaps the amine adds to the aldehyde, forming a hemiaminal, which then loses a water molecule to form an iminium ion, and then further reaction forms the double bond.

So, the product would have a double bond in the substituent, which matches the product's structure.

So, yes, the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the catalyst is TsOH.

So the correct option is A: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH.


The reaction involves 3-methylpyrrolidine reacting with compound A under acid-catalyzed conditions to form 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The product's structure indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) attached to a cyclohexene ring, suggesting the formation of an enamine. Enamine formation typically occurs when a secondary amine reacts with a carbonyl compound (such as an aldehyde or ketone) under acidic conditions. The mechanism involves two steps: (1) the amine reacts with the aldehyde to form a hemiaminal, and (2) under acidic conditions, the hemiaminal loses water to form the enamine, which contains a conjugated double bond.

Given the options, compound A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, as it provides the aldehyde group necessary for enamine formation. The cyclohexene ring in the product is consistent with the elimination of water from the hemiaminal intermediate, forming a double bond in the substituent.

The catalyst must be strong enough to facilitate the reaction. While acetic acid is a mild acid, TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a stronger acid and is more commonly used for enamine formation. Therefore, the suitable reagent and catalyst combination is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (A) and TsOH (B).

Critical analysis of the options:
- **Option A**: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH. This combination is suitable for enamine formation due to the strong acid catalyst.
- **Option B**: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = Acetic acid. While acetic acid can act as a catalyst, it is less effective than TsOH for this reaction.
- **Option C**: A = vinylcyclohexane, B = Acetic acid. Vinylcyclohexane is not a carbonyl compound and cannot form an enamine with the amine.
- **Option D**: A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH. Similar to Option C, vinylcyclohexane is not suitable for enamine formation.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where cyclohexanecarbaldehyde reacts with 3-methylpyrrolidine under TsOH catalysis to form the desired enamine product.

Answer: A
