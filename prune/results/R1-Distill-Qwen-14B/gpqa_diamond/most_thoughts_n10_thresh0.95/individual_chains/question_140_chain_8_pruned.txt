Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to understand what's going on.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases gas W and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. I remember that melting points can help identify substances—like water freezes at 273 K, so maybe B is something similar but a bit different.

The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That makes me think of a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. For example, something like H2O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the molecule because each O has 8 and each H has 1, but wait, no, that sums to 8 protons for O and 2 for H, but the total would be 10 protons in the molecule, and for neutrons, O has 8, so the total might be 8 + 1 (for each H if they're protium) but that doesn't add up. Hmm, maybe another molecule.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the gas W. The molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, for each molecule, if it's a molecule like CO2, that's 22 protons and 22 neutrons? Wait, no, because CO2 is two oxygen atoms and one carbon. Let's count: Carbon has 6 protons, each O has 8. So total protons in CO2 is 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons: Carbon typically has 6 (since C-12 is the common isotope), and each O has 8. So 6 + 8*2 = 22 neutrons. Oh wait, so CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in its molecule. Oh, that's a possibility. So gas W is CO2? Because each molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. But wait, 22 protons and 22 neutrons in the entire molecule. So that could be the case.

Alternatively, another possibility is H2O. Let's see: H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So H2O has 2(1) +8 =10 protons. Neutrons: Each H is 0 (if protium), and O has 8. So 8. So 10 protons and 8 neutrons. Doesn't match. So CO2 is better for that.

So W could be CO2. But wait, another option is CH4. Let's see: CH4 has 6 (C) +4(1) =10 protons. Neutrons: C is 6, each H is 0. So 6 + 0 =6. So 10 vs 6; nope. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the gas is something like NH3. Let's see: Nitrogen has 7 protons, H has 1. So 7 +3(1) =10 protons. Neutrons: N has 7, H has 0. So 7. 10 vs 7 no. Not matching.

Wait, maybe I should think of a molecule where the total protons equal the total neutrons. So, for example, if the molecule is something like NO. Let's see: N has 7 protons, O has 8. So 15 protons. Neutrons: N is 7 (if it's N-14), O is 8 (O-16). So 7 +8 =15 neutrons. So NO has 15 protons and 15 neutrons. So that's a possibility. So W is NO?

But wait, I thought the reaction is between X and Y. If X is a heavier isotope-containing substance, maybe it's something like a halogen. Wait, because halogens have many isotopes. So perhaps X is something like NaCl, but more likely, maybe it's a heavier isotope in something else.

Wait, the problem states that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y. What liquids react violently with certain substances? For example, metals reacting with acids, but if Y is water, maybe X is something reactive like potassium or sodium. But they react violently with water, releasing H2 gas. But earlier I thought W was CO2, but in the case of a metal reacting with water, W would be H2. So that might not fit.

Wait, but in the problem statement, W's molecule must have the same number of protons and neutrons. So what if W is H2? Let's see: each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So molecule H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't match the condition of same number. So not H2.

So perhaps I should think about other possibilities. Let's think about another reaction. If Y is an acid, maybe X is a carbonate or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem also mentions that the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. And the melting point of B is about 277 K. So what has a melting point around there? Water freezes at 273 K, so if B's melting point is 277 K, that's about 4 degrees Celsius. Wait, melting point is the temperature where it turns from solid to liquid. So B is a solid at 277 K, or maybe it's a liquid at that temperature.

Wait, water's melting point is 273 K, so B's melting point is a bit higher. What compound has a higher melting point than water? Maybe something like NaCl or another ionic compound. Because ionic compounds usually have high melting points.

Wait, when G is heated, it releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into B and CO2. For example, heating calcium carbonate gives CaO and CO2. So if Y is an acid, perhaps X is a carbonate. Wait, but X incorporates a heavier isotope, which might be, say, calcium-40 or something. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, the product of the reaction between a certain keto acid and X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So if X is something like NaOH, and the keto acid is like acetic acid, the product would be sodium acetate, which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. Hmm, but I think this requires more thought.

Alternatively, if X is something like Na2CO3 (sodium carbonate), and it reacts with a keto acid, say, H2SO4 (but that's not a keto acid), wait, no, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid. So when Na2CO3 reacts with acetoacetic acid, perhaps the product would be something like sodium acetoacetate. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, but the product contains 2 oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is something like Na2CO3 · something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate, but I'm getting stuck here.

Let me go back to the reaction. X reacts with liquid Y, releasing W and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, B is released. B's melting point is about 277 K, which is close to 4°C. That's just a bit above the melting point of water. Hmm.

Wait, if B is something like NaOH, but no, NaOH is a solid at room temp. Alternatively, maybe B is something like NaCl, but NaCl's melting point is much higher, around 1460 K. So that's not matching.

Wait, what about B being NaNO3? Sodium nitrate's melting point is around 360 K, which is higher than 277. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. Another thought: if B is a carbonate, but I'm not getting it. Alternatively, maybe B is something like sodium oxide, but that's a solid with a high melting point.

Wait, another angle: the gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of another molecule. Maybe CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons, as I thought earlier. So if W is CO2, then the reaction between X and Y could be producing carbonate precipitate and CO2 gas. So perhaps Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate. For example, X could be sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacting with an acid Y (like H2SO4), producing CO2 gas, and a sodium sulfate precipitate? Wait, no, sodium sulfate is soluble in water. Or maybe Y is a different acid.

Wait, but if X is Na2CO3, and Y is an acid, like HCl, then the reaction would be Na2CO3 + 2HCl → 2NaCl + H2O + CO2↑. So the precipitate would not form, since NaCl and H2O are soluble. Hmm, unless Y is something else.

Wait, maybe Y is not an acid but another substance. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate, and Y is a strong acid. But then the precipitate G would likely be a salt. For instance, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl, then the reaction would produce CaCl2, H2O, and CO2. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a hydroxide. If X is NaOH and Y is a strong acid, maybe sulfuric acid, but again, I'm not getting a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else. Let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. Maybe G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into B and CO2. For example, if G is Na2CO3·10H2O, heating would remove water and perhaps leave Na2CO3 (but that doesn't make sense). Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, another approach: the melting point of B is close to 277 K. That's approximately 4°C. What substance is solid at 4°C and melts around that temperature? Well, water freezes at 0°C, but if B is a solid with a higher melting point, maybe it's something like a different form of ice, but that's the same as water. Wait, maybe it's not a pure substance. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a metal or a salt that's a solid with a melting point close to 4°C. For example, something like sodium acetate has a melting point around 270 K, but I'm not exactly sure. Let's look it up mentally. Wait, sodium acetate's melting point is about 450 K, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is a different form of water, like ice. But I thought water's melting point is 273 K, so 277 is a bit higher. Wait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps B is something else.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps B is a diatomic molecule. Let's think of a diatomic gas with a melting point close to 277 K. Wait, no, because diatomic gases are typically gases at room temperature. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid at that temperature.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the elements in X. The problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is a compound with at least two elements, one of which has a heavier isotope.

Also, the problem says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps when X reacts with a keto acid, the product is a salt with the anion from the keto acid. For example, if X is NaOH, and the keto acid is acetic acid (CH3COOH), then the product would be sodium acetate (CH3COONa), which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate group. Wait, but sodium acetate is CH3COO-Na+, so each acetate has two oxygen atoms in the COO- part. So that fits: the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is NaOH.

Wait, if X is NaOH, and it's reacting with a keto acid, then the product would be the corresponding salt. So for example, X is NaOH, the product is the sodium salt of the keto acid, which would have two oxygen atoms in the anion. Hmm, that makes sense.

So if X is NaOH, then let's see what happens when it reacts with liquid Y. NaOH is a strong base; if Y is an acid, the reaction would produce a salt, water, and maybe gas. Wait, but the problem says that when X reacts with Y, a gas W is released and precipitate G forms.

Wait, NaOH reacting with an acid wouldn't form a precipitate because NaOH is soluble. Unless Y is a different kind of liquid. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another substance, like a carbonate or something else.

Wait, another thought: If X is NaOH and Y is a salt solution that isn't very soluble. For example, if Y is a solution of magnesium sulfate, but that's soluble. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe Y is a salt that reacts with NaOH to form a precipitate. For instance, if Y is a solution of a metal chloride that forms an insoluble hydroxide. Let's say Y is FeCl3. Then, NaOH would react with FeCl3 to form Fe(OH)3 precipitate. But Fe(OH)3 is a precipitate, and the reaction would release... Hmm, I don't think any gas is released in that case. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate, but NaOH and CO3^2- would form Na2CO3, which is soluble. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. Let's say X is CaCO3. Then Y could be HCl, and the reaction would produce CaCl2 (soluble), H2O, and CO2 gas. But then the precipitate would be none, because all products are soluble. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a metal hydroxide. For example, if Y is Fe(OH)3, and X is NaOH. No, that wouldn't react violently. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think of X as a halogen. For example, Cl2 is a heavy element, but I'm not sure. Wait, Cl2 is a diatomic gas, but that doesn't fit the reaction with a liquid to produce a precipitate.

Wait, another approach: the problem says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, if the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, and X is NaOH, the product would be sodium acetoacetate. The formula of acetoacetic acid is CH3COCH2COOH. When it reacts with NaOH, it would produce CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+ and water. The sodium acetoacetate would have two oxygen atoms in the acetate group, perhaps. Wait, the acetate group has two oxygen atoms, so the product would have two O atoms. So that fits.

So X is NaOH, perhaps. Then, when NaOH reacts with an acid, say H2SO4, but that's a strong acid. Wait, but NaOH and H2SO4 would react to form Na2SO4, H2O, but no gas is released. Alternatively, if Y is a weak acid, perhaps. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, another thought: when X reacts with liquid Y, it releases gas W and precipitate G. So perhaps Y is a carbonate. For example, if X is HCl (but HCl is a liquid?), but I'm not sure. Wait, HCl is a gas at room temperature, but maybe Y is a solution of a carbonate.

Wait, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution, and X is HCl. Then, the reaction would produce CO2 gas, H2O, and a precipitate? Wait, no, if Y is Na2CO3 solution and X is HCl, then the reaction would be 2HCl + Na2CO3 → 2NaCl + H2O + CO2↑. But sodium chloride is soluble, so no precipitate. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe Y is a nitrate or another salt. Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide, which would react with X (like H2SO4) to produce H2S gas and a sulfate precipitate. For example, if Y is FeS, and X is H2SO4, then FeS + H2SO4 → FeSO4 + H2S↑. But FeSO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, if Y is BaCO3, and X is HCl, the reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and BaCl2. BaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a chloride, and X is AgNO3. Then, the reaction would produce AgCl precipitate and nitric acid. But gas W would be something like HNO3, which is a liquid. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the elements in X. If X is NaOH, then the elements are Na and O and H. But the problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps one of the atoms in X is a heavier isotope. For example, Na has isotopes like Na-23 (most common), Na-24, Na-25. So maybe X is NaOH with some heavier Na isotopes.

Now, looking back at the question about the cumulative atomic masses. The question asks for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Wait, no, it says the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. Wait, but X is a compound, so it's made of multiple elements. So the lightest and heaviest elements in X. For example, if X is NaOH, the elements present are Na (atomic number 11), O (8), and H (1). So the lightest is H (1), the heaviest is Na (23). So their atomic masses sum to approximately 1 + 23 = 24. But looking at the options, B is 25. Hmm, but maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, but the problem says that if there are multiple instances of an element, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed. So
