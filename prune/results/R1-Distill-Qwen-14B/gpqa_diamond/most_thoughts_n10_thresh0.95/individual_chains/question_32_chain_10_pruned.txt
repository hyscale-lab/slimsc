Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking what energy the RHIC should have so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we need to use the relativistic equations. So the first thing I should do is figure out the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass number A is 6, so the mass would be approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, but wait, protons and neutrons have slightly different masses. Oh, right, a neutron is a bit heavier than a proton. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 941 MeV/c². But wait, maybe for an approximate calculation, I can just use the average or maybe the exact value for a nucleon. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to get the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the exact rest mass of Li-6. Let's think: Li has atomic number 3, so Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately... I think it's about 6.013 atomic mass units (u). Because each proton is about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So let me compute that.

So protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u.
Neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u.
Total for nucleons: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u. But wait, that's just adding them. But the actual isotope mass might be a little less because binding energy. Oh wait, but the problem probably assumes the mass is just 6 u, but maybe I should check the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 u. Wait, I think the actual mass is 6.015097 u. Well, I can look it up, but since I can't, I'll proceed with that value. So 6.015097 u.

So the rest mass energy is m*c². 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.015097 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u = let me calculate that. 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, 0.015097 * 931.5 ≈ 14.04 MeV. So total is approximately 5603.04 MeV, which is about 5.603 GeV.

Wait, wait, that's the rest mass energy. So m*c² is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Now, the problem is about the kinetic energy. Because in colliders, the energy is usually the kinetic energy, but wait, no, wait. Wait, when the question says "the energy of the RHIC", I think it refers to the total energy, which includes both the rest mass and kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they refer to the kinetic energy. Hmm, but in the case of heavy ions, I think it's more likely that the total energy (including rest mass) is given. Or perhaps they are considering the kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy (gamma*m*c²) and the kinetic energy (K = (gamma -1)*m*c²). So if the question is about the total energy, then E would be gamma * m*c². But if it's the kinetic energy, then it would be (gamma -1)*m*c².

So the question is, what is the energy of the RHIC? I think RHIC accelerates heavy ions to a certain kinetic energy. Wait, but sometimes the energy is stated as the total energy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c". So I think the energy should be the kinetic energy given to each ion. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy, which would be gamma*m*c².

Hmm, but in this problem, perhaps we can work it out either way. Let's proceed.

First, let's find gamma for v = 0.96c.

The formula for gamma (γ) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 (because 0.28^2 is 0.0784).

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Hmm, let me calculate it more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, because 0.28*0.28=0.0784.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, if the energy E is gamma * m*c², and m*c² is approximately 5.603 GeV, then E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV ≈ let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.603 = ?

Let me compute 3.5 * 5.603 = 19.6105, and 0.0714 *5.603≈0.401. So total is ~20.0115 GeV.

But wait, wait. Let me compute exactly:

3.5714 * 5.603 GeV.

Compute 3.5714 *5 = 17.857
3.5714 *0.603 = ?

0.6 *3.5714 = 2.14284
0.003 *3.5714=0.0107142
So total 2.14284 + 0.0107142 ≈ 2.15355
Adding to 17.857 gives 17.857 +2.15355=20.01055 GeV.

So around 20.01 GeV.

Wait, but that's the total energy. But the question is about the energy of the RHIC. Do they mean the kinetic energy or the total energy?

Wait, in high-energy physics, when they refer to the energy of a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy per beam particle. Or sometimes they give the total energy. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, for example, the LHC's energy is given as the total proton energy, which includes the rest mass. But protons are almost massless, so it's approximately the kinetic energy. For heavy ions, the rest mass is significant, so it's more accurate to give the total energy.

Wait, but the problem states "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c". So perhaps it's the kinetic energy. Because the kinetic energy is what relates to the acceleration and the energy imparted.

So if I need to calculate the kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) * m c².

So gamma is about 3.5714, so gamma-1 is 2.5714.

So K = 2.5714 * 5.603 GeV ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.5714 *5 = 12.857, 2.5714 *0.603 ≈ 1.550.

Total ≈ 12.857 +1.550 =14.407 GeV.

Hmm, but this brings up a problem because the options don't have a 14 GeV option. Let me look: the options are A) 18.475 GeV, B) 23.069 GeV, C) 20.132 GeV, D) 21.419 GeV. So the options are in the 18-23 GeV range.

So if I'm calculating the total energy, I get around 20 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV). But my initial calculation was 20.01 GeV, but perhaps the precise mass gives a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should not approximate the mass. Let's get a more precise value for the mass of Li-6.

So, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.015097 u. Let's confirm that. So 6.015097 u is the mass of Li-6.

So m*c² = 6.015097 u * 931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.015097 * 931.5 MeV = let's compute 0.01 * 931.5=9.315, 0.005097 *931.5= approx 4.736. So 9.315 +4.736 =14.051 MeV.

So total m*c² = 5589 +14.051 = 5603.051 MeV, which is 5.603051 GeV.

So the precise value is 5.603051 GeV.

So then, gamma is 3.57142857.

So E_total = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.603051 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.603051.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.603051=16.809153.

0.57142857 *5.603051.

Let me compute 0.5*5.603051=2.8015255.

0.07142857*5.603051.

0.07 *5.603051=0.39221357.

0.00142857 *5.603051≈approx 0.008.

So 0.39221357 +0.008=0.40021357.

So 0.57142857 *5.603051 ≈2.8015255 +0.40021357=3.201739.

So total E is 16.809153 +3.201739 =20.010892 GeV.

So approximately 20.01089 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

The closest is option C:20.132 GeV. But wait, my calculation gives 20.01089 GeV. So why is option C 20.132? Maybe I made a mistake in approximations.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of gamma is more precise. Let me calculate gamma again.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )

=1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps the exact calculation would give a more precise gamma. Let me compute 0.96 squared exactly.

0.96^2 = (96/100)^2= (24/25)^2=576/625=0.9216.

So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 1/0.28=35/10=3.5.

Wait, wait a minute, wait. 0.28 is 7/25. 1/0.28 =25/7= approx 3.57142857.

Wait, so 25/7 is exactly 3.57142857... So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I need to see if the mass of the Li-6 is more accurately calculated. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about whether the energy is total or kinetic.

Wait, if the question is about the kinetic energy, then K = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

gamma -1 =2.57142857.

So K =2.57142857 *5.603051 GeV.

Let me compute that.

2.57142857 *5.603051.

Compute 2 *5.603051=11.206102.

0.57142857 *5.603051.

Hmm, 0.57142857 is 4/7 approximately. Let me compute 4/7 *5.603051.

5.603051 *4 =22.412204.

Divide by 7: 22.412204 /7≈3.201743.

So K=11.206102 +3.201743=14.407845 GeV.

But this is about 14.4 GeV, which doesn't match any of the options.

So perhaps the question is referring to the total energy (gamma *m c²).

Which would be around 20.01 GeV. So the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy between the calculation and the option? Maybe I made a miscalculation in the mass.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact mass of Li-6. Let me think, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.015097 u.

So m*c² is 6.015097 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.015097 *931.5 = compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.005097 *931.5= 931.5 *0.005 is 4.6575, plus 0.000097 *931.5≈0.09036.

So 4.6575 +0.09036 =4.74786.

So 9.315 +4.74786 =14.06286 MeV.

So total m*c² is 5589 +14.06286 =5603.06286 MeV =5.60306286 GeV.

So E_total = gamma * m c^2 =3.57142857 *5.60306286 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.60306286.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.60306286
