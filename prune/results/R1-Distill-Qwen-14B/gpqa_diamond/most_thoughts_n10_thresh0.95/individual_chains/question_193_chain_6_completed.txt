Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. The options are various powers of r, like r cubed, r to the fifth, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So if plx is small, the distance is large, and vice versa.

Wait, the problem says the number of stars varies with 1/(plx)^5, which I can write as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, that's the derivative of N with respect to distance. Because per unit distance, it's the rate of change. So I need to find dN/dr.

Since N ∝ d^5, that means N = k*d^5, where k is some constant. So taking the derivative of N with respect to d gives dN/dr = 5k*d^4. So the change in number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but the options are in terms of r, which I think is the same as d here. Oh, right, the question says 'per unit range of distance, r'. So the rate is proportional to r^4.

Looking back at the options, option C is r^4. So I think the answer is C.

Wait a second, did I get the substitution right? Let me double-check. Parallax plx = 1/d, so 1/plx = d. Then 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. Oh wait, that's correct. So N is proportional to d^5, which would mean the derivative is 5d^4. So the number of stars increases with distance to the fifth power, but the rate of change (per unit distance) is proportional to d^4. Therefore, the answer is C.


The question states that the number of stars in a region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)) in parsecs (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \)), substituting this relationship gives \( N \propto d^5 \). 

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \). If \( N = k \cdot d^5 \) (where \( k \) is a constant), then:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} = 5k \cdot d^4.
\]

This shows that the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance is proportional to \( d^4 \). Since the question uses \( r \) to represent distance, the rate of change is proportional to \( r^4 \). 

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( r^3 \)**  
**B) ~ \( r^5 \)**  
**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**  
**D) ~ \( r^2 \)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
