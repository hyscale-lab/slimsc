Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the allowed decay modes of this boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV, and the interaction Lagrangian is provided. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand the Lagrangian. The interaction term is given by L(y) = -λf Ȳ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. Oh right, typically, the interaction term would involve the field X coupling to fermions. So, the term might be something like λ X ψ ψ, meaning that the boson X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair.

So the interaction Lagrangian is likely L_int = -λ X(y) ψ̄_f(y) ψ_f(y). This would imply that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decay products depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions it couples to.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for X to decay into a fermion pair, the sum of the masses of the fermion and antifermion must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Also, the fermions must be lighter than X/2 each because each would have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, but I'm not sure which fermions are involved. The Lagrangian uses ψ_f, so f is the fermion type. Does this mean X can couple to any fermion? Or is it specific to certain fermions?

Assuming that the coupling is to all possible fermions, but perhaps limited by their masses. So which fermions have masses less than 3 GeV (since X is 6 GeV and each fermion would take at most half the mass)?

Let me list the known fermion masses. I think the up, down, strange, and charm quarks are in the range of a few GeV. The bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV, top is much heavier (~173 GeV), tau is about 1.78 GeV, and electrons are much lighter.

Wait, let me get the approximate masses:

- Up quark: ~2 MeV (so < 3 GeV)
- Down quark: ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I'm mixing. Let me correct that. No, wait, the masses are as follows:

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get the masses right. The current quark masses (in MeV/c²):

- Up: ~2.2
- Down: ~4.7
- Strange: ~95
- Charm: ~1270 (1.27 GeV)
- Bottom: ~4130 (4.13 GeV)
- Top: ~173000 (173 GeV)
- Electron: ~0.511 MeV
- Tau: ~1777 MeV (1.777 GeV)
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV

Wait, so for fermions to be produced, their mass must be less than 3 GeV each. Because X is 6 GeV, so 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV → m_fermion ≤3 GeV.

But wait, the fermions' masses can't exceed half the X mass. So for a fermion pair, each must be less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So looking at the fermion masses:

- Electron: 0.511 MeV → definitely allowed.
- Muon: ~105 MeV → allowed.
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV → allowed, since 1.777 < 3 GeV.
- Quarks:
   - Up: 2 MeV → allowed.
   - Down: ~5 MeV → allowed.
   - Strange: ~100 MeV → allowed.
   - Charm: 1.27 GeV → allowed (since 1.27 <3 GeV)
   - Bottom: 4.13 GeV → 4.13 >3 → not allowed. So b quarks can't be produced because each would need more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar, because 2*4.13=8.26 GeV >6 GeV. X's mass is 6 GeV, so it can't produce a pair of bottom quarks.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. The X is a boson, so when it decays, the total energy available is its rest mass. So when X decays into two particles, the sum of their rest masses must be ≤ X's mass. But for a fermion-antifermion pair, each has mass m, so 2m ≤ M_X. So m ≤ M_X /2.

So for each fermion:

If m_fermion ≤3 GeV, then allowed.

So let's list which fermions have m ≤3 GeV.

Electron: yes.

Muon: yes.

Tau: 1.777 GeV <3 → yes.

Quarks:

Up: 2 MeV → yes.

Down: 5 MeV → yes.

Strange: ~100 MeV → yes.

Charm: 1.27 GeV → yes.

Bottom: 4.13 GeV → no.

Top: way higher, no.

So fermions allowed are: up, down, strange, charm, electron, muon, tau.

So the possible decay channels are X → f f-bar for each allowed f.

So X can decay into:

uū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e−, μ+ μ−, τ+ τ−.

So looking at the options, which one includes these?

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−.

But wait, b is excluded because 4.13 >3 GeV. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Yes, this includes all allowed fermions except for t, which is too heavy.

Option C: X→ c c̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Wait, t is 173 GeV, way too heavy. So C includes t, which isn't allowed. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Again, includes b which is not allowed, so D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, looking back at the options:

Option B is X→ c c̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Which includes all the allowed fermion pairs except for the top, which isn't present. So option B is correct.

Wait, but the quarks are all considered as possible decay products, including c, s, u, d. So that's correct.

Wait, but in the options, looking at option B, it includes c, s, u, d for quarks, and all the leptons except top quark and tau is included.

So the correct decay options would be all the fermion pairs except for b, t, and any others heavier than 3 GeV.

Wait, but the X is a boson of 6 GeV. So in the given options, let's check each option.

Option B includes c, s, u, d quarks, mu, e, tau. So all allowed.

So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but wait, looking back at the problem statement, the interaction is given by a specific Lagrangian. The problem states the interaction term as L(y) = -λ f Ȳ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps that's a typo, but perhaps the interaction is that X couples to all fermions. So all the fermions that are light enough can be decay products.

So yes, the answer should include all the allowed fermion pairs: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So the correct option is B.


The interaction Lagrangian provided indicates that the boson \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, allowing \( X \) to decay into such pairs. The mass of \( X \) is 6 GeV, so for a decay into a fermion-antifermion pair (\( f\bar{f} \)), the mass of the fermion (\( m_f \)) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This constraint determines which fermions are kinematically allowed as decay products.

The approximate masses of known fermions are as follows:

- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( \sim 5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( \sim 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, far too heavy)
- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
- **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)

Thus, the kinematically allowed decay products of \( X \) are \( u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^- \). The decays \( b\bar{b} \) and \( t\bar{t} \) are excluded because their masses are too large.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay modes of \( X \).

Answer: B
