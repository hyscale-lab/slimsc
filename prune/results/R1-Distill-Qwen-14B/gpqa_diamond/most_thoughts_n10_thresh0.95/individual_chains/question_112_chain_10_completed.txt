--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I remember that the z-projection is related to the spin-up and spin-down states, typically denoted as |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are orthonormal.

The first task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds a bit like an anti-diagonal matrix. Let me think about what this operator looks like.

Let me write out the matrix. For a two-dimensional system (since we're dealing with up and down), the operator A would have elements:
- A_11 = 0, A_12 = ħ/2
- A_21 = ħ/2, A_22 = 0
So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Oh wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) times sigma_x.

Now, the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the spin states in the x-direction. The standard eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>) and (1/sqrt(2))(|up> - |down>), respectively. So to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

But wait, no. Wait, the operator A's eigenstates are what's being measured. So the measurement would project the state |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A, and the square of the amplitude would give the probability.

So first, I need to normalize |alpha>. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>, but I need to find the actual state, which requires normalizing it. The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Calculating the norm:

Coefficient of |up> is (1+i), so its magnitude squared is |1+i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) = 2.

Coefficient of |down> is (2−i), magnitude squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1 =5.

So the total norm is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. The eigenstates |+x> and |−x> are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

So I need to express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, probably. Let me write that:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>

Substituting the expressions for |+x> and |−x>:

|alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

Grouping terms:

= (c_+/sqrt(2) + c_-/sqrt(2)) |up> + (c_+/sqrt(2) − c_-/sqrt(2)) |down>

But we also have |alpha> expressed as [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2−i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So equating coefficients:

Coefficient of |up>:
(c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)

Coefficient of |down>:
(c_+ − c_-)/sqrt(2) = (2−i)/sqrt(7)

So I have two equations:

1) (c_+ + c_-) = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
2) (c_+ − c_-) = (2−i) * sqrt(2/7)

Let me write these as:

Equation (1): c_+ + c_- = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)

Equation (2): c_+ − c_- = (2−i) * sqrt(2/7)

Now, I can solve these two equations for c_+ and c_-.

Adding equation (1) and (2):

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] * sqrt(2/7 )
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)

So c_+ = 3/2 * sqrt(2/7) = (3 * sqrt(2)) )/( 2 * sqrt(7) )

Similarly, subtracting equation (2) from (1):

2 c_- = [ (1+i) − (2−i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7 )

So c_- = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/(7)) / 2

Wait, but to find the probabilities, I don't really need to compute c_+ and c_-, because the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

But maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A, then find the squared magnitude.

Let me try that. The eigenstates |+x> and |−x> are orthonormal. So the probability P_+x is |⟨+x | alpha ⟩ |², and similarly for P_-x.

Compute ⟨+x | alpha⟩:

⟨+x| is (⟨up| + ⟨down|)/sqrt(2)

So inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ ⟨up| + ⟨down| ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ]

= (1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) + (2−i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) + (2−i) ]

Simplify numerator: (1+2) + (i -i) → 3 + 0i → 3.

So ⟨+x | alpha⟩ = 3/(sqrt(14))

Therefore, the probability P_+x is (3)^2 / (14) = 9/14.

Similarly, compute ⟨−x | alpha⟩:

⟨−x| = (⟨up| − ⟨down| ) / sqrt(2)

So inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [⟨up| − ⟨down| ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= (1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) - (2−i) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) - (2−i) ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1-2) + (i +i) ) ]
= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (-1) + 2i ]

So the inner product is ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14 )

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6429 and 5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the calculation again. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, when I calculated ⟨−x | alpha⟩, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2−i) ] / sqrt(7) → ( (1+i) - (2 -i) ) = (1-2) + (i +i) )= -1 +2i.

Yes. So the squared magnitude is (-1 + 2i)(-1 - 2i) / (14) → (1 +4 )=5 → 5/14.

So P_+x is 9/14 ≈0.643, and P_-x is 5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first two probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to 9/14 and 5/14. Because 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571. So that would be the first part.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The expectation value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨alpha | A | alpha⟩.

But since A has matrix elements as given, perhaps it's easier to calculate using the operator expression. Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, we can use that.

Because A = (ħ/2) sigma_x.

So the expectation value of A is (ħ/2) ⟨alpha | sigma_x | alpha⟩.

We can compute ⟨sigma_x⟩ for the state |alpha⟩.

Another approach is to write the state in the |+x⟩ and |−x⟩ basis.

Because |+x⟩ and |−x⟩ are the eigenstates of sigma_x, with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.

So in the |+x⟩, |−x⟩ basis, the state |alpha⟩ can be written as c_+ |+x⟩ + c_- |−x⟩.

Then, the expectation value ⟨sigma_x⟩ is ( |c_+|^2 *1 ) + ( |c_-|^2 * (-1) )?

Wait, no. Because sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+x⟩ and |−x⟩ respectively. So the expectation value is |c_+|^2 *1 + |c_-|^2 * (-1).

But wait, let me think again. Because if |+x> is an eigenstate of sigma_x with eigenvalue +1, then ⟨+x| sigma_x |+x⟩ = +1. Same for |−x> with eigenvalue -1.

But the state is a combination: |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>.

So ⟨sigma_x⟩ = ⟨alpha | sigma_x | alpha⟩ 

= |c_+|^2 * 1 + |c_-|^2 * (-1) + cross terms? Wait, no, because when you expand, the cross terms would involve terms like c_+ c_-^* ⟨+x | sigma_x | -x⟩, and similarly for c_- c_+^* ⟨-x | sigma_x | +x⟩.

Wait, but sigma_x is Hermitian, so ⟨+x | sigma_x | -x⟩ would be ⟨-x | sigma_x | +x⟩^*.

Wait, let's compute sigma_x in the |+x>, |−x> basis. Since sigma_x |+x> = |−x>, because |+x> is an eigenstate. Wait, no, wait. Wait, sigma_x applied to |+x> is |+x>, because sigma_x |+x> = +1 |+x>.

Wait, no—no, wait, I think I'm getting confused. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> with eigenvalue +1 and |−x> with eigenvalue -1. Therefore, sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, and sigma_x |−x> = -|−x>.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Let me clarify. The Pauli X matrix, which is sigma_x, has eigenvalues +1 and -1. The eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>. So sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, sigma_x |−x> = -|−x>.

Wait, that can't be right. Because sigma_x is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when sigma_x acts on |+x>, it gives +1 times |+x>, and on |−x> gives -1 times |−x>.

Wait, but then, in that case, the matrix representation of sigma_x in the |+x>, |−x> basis is diagonal: [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Therefore, when computing ⟨sigma_x⟩, which is c_+ c_+^* (1) + c_- c_-^* (-1) + cross terms.

Wait, but wait, no. Because sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, so if I have sigma_x applied to | alpha ⟩, which is c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>, then sigma_x |alpha> = c_+ (1) |+x> + c_- (-1) |−x>.

Then, the inner product ⟨alpha | sigma_x | alpha ⟩ is:

= (c_+^* ⟨+x| + c_-^* ⟨−x| ) ( c_+ |+x> + c_- (-1) |−x> )

= |c_+|^2 (1) + c_+^* c_- (-1) ⟨+x|−x> + c_-^* c_+ (1) ⟨−x|+x> + |c_-|^2 ( (-1)^2 )

But since |+x> and |−x> are orthonormal, the cross terms are zero. So it's |c_+|^2 *1 + |c_-|^2 *1.

Wait, but that's not correct because sigma_x |−x> is -|−x>, so when you apply sigma_x to |−x>, you get -|−x>, so the inner product would have |c_-|^2 * (-1)^2 (since (-1)^2 is 1), but wait, I think I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨sigma_x⟩ as the expectation value.

Wait, I can compute this using the coefficients I found earlier.

We have |c_+|² = (3^2)/(14) )=9/14, and |c_-|^2 =5/14.

So ⟨sigma_x⟩ = |c_+|² *1 + |c_-|^2 * (-1) ?

Wait, but earlier I thought that sigma_x |+x> = +|+x> and sigma_x |−x> = -|−x>, so the expectation value would be |c_+|² *1 + |c_-|² * (-1).

Wait, but in that case, ⟨sigma_x⟩= (9/14)(1) + (5/14)(-1) )= (9 -5)/14 = 4/14 = 2/7.

So ⟨sigma_x⟩ = 2/7. Therefore, ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2) * (2/7 ) = ħ /7.

Wait, that's one of the options. Let's see the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7 → that's 9/14≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.643 and 0.357. So 0.64 and 0.36 are close, but not exact. Let me check if 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643, and 5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but the third part is the average value. So according to my calculation, the average value is ħ/7, which is option A's third value.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which rounds to 0.643. The option says 0.64, which is close. Similarly, 5/14 is about 0.357, so 0.36 is close. So that's option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option D says 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't match.

Option B has 0.54 and 0.46, which doesn't match.

Option C: 0.28 and 0.72, which also doesn't.

So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average is ħ/7.

Wait, but wait a moment. Did I compute the average correctly? Because I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recompute the expectation value of sigma_x.

We have |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x> as:

|alpha> = (3/sqrt(14)) |+x> + ( (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) ) |−x>.

Wait, no, earlier we had:

c_+ = (3 sqrt(2) )/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, no, perhaps that approach complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value directly using the original state.

Let me compute ⟨alpha | A | alpha⟩.

A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal.

So, A = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

The state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Expressed as a column vector, it's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The expectation value is the conjugate transpose of this vector multiplied by A, multiplied by the vector.

So, compute alpha† A alpha.

Let me compute this:

Compute alpha† A alpha = [ (1−i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Multiplying A with the vector:

A * [a, b]^T = [ (0*a + (ħ/2)*b ), ( (ħ/2)*a + 0*b ) ]^T = [ (ħ/2 b ), (ħ/2 a ) ]

So,

A * alpha = [ (ħ/2 * (2−i)/sqrt(7) ), (ħ/2 * (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Now, multiply alpha† with this:

[ (1−i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2 (2−i)/sqrt(7) ), (ħ/2 (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= (1−i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2 (2−i)/sqrt(7)) ) + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2 (1+i)/sqrt(7) )

= ħ/(2 *7) [ (1−i)(2−i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]

Compute each term:

(1−i)(2−i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) −i*2 + i^2 → 2 −i −2i + (-1) → (2-1) −3i → 1 −3i.

(2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 + i*i → 2 +2i +i + (−1) → (2−1) +3i → 1 +3i.

Adding these two: (1−3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So, the expectation value is ħ/(14) * 2 = ħ/(7).

Which matches the earlier calculation. So the average value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.643 and 5/14 ≈0.357, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So option A gives probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if I perhaps miscalculated the probabilities. Because in the earlier part, I found that the inner product for |+x> was 3/sqrt(14), so the probability is 9/14, which is 0.642857, so 0.64. The other probability is 5/14, about 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places. So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which matches.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are orthonormal. To normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \), we calculate the norm of the coefficients:

- The magnitude squared of \( 1+i \) is \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \).
- The magnitude squared of \( 2-i \) is \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \).

The total norm is \( \sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7} \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), which are orthonormal.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we calculate the inner products \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \) and \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \), and then compute the squared magnitudes.

1. **Inner product \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \):**

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | + \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} (3) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability \( P_{+x} \) is:

\[
P_{+x} = \left| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}.
\]

2. **Inner product \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \):**

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | - \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} (-1 + 2i).
\]

The probability \( P_{-x} \) is:

\[
P_{-x} = \left| \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + (2)^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are:

\[
P_{+x} = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P_{-x} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

To find the average value of \( A \), we compute \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), we calculate \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) for \( |\alpha\rangle \). Using the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), the expectation value is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = |c_{+}|^2 (1) + |c_{-}|^2 (-1),
\]

where \( |c_{+}|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |c_{-}|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \). Substituting:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{9}{14} (1) + \frac{5}{14} (-1) = \frac{9 - 5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus, the average value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the probabilities \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \) are close approximations of \( \frac{9}{14} \) and \( \frac{5}{14} \), respectively, and the average value \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \) matches option A.

**Answer: A**
