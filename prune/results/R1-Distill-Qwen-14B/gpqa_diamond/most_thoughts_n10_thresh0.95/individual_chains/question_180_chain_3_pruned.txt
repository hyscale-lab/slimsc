--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but let's try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, which probably means we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. So it's an isolated system, so energy considerations should be about potential energy.

Wait, the system is isolated, so no work is being done by the outside, and energy should be conserved. But the question is about the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, minimum energy... I think that relates to the potential energy. Because in electrostatics, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are arranged in a way that's most stable. But wait, some charges are constrained to be at a fixed distance from point P, and one is fixed there.

Let me read the problem again. 12 of the charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P. The 13th is fixed at P. So, point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from P, which is where the 13th charge is.

Wait, but all the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, but they're identical and have charge 2e each. So, the setup is like a central charge with 12 others orbiting or arranged symmetrically around it, each at 2 meters away.

I'm trying to picture this. The 13th charge is at P, and the other 12 are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, centered at P. Since they're identical charges, they should repel each other. But they're constrained to stay at that distance, so each of the 12 is fixed on the surface of this sphere, but their positions relative to each other might be arranged in a way that minimizes the total potential energy.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the entire system. So I need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the system. Since the system is isolated and the charges are fixed in their positions (except their arrangement on the sphere), the potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

Wait, but the system has 13 charges. So I need to calculate the potential between each pair of charges and sum them all up. But wait, that would be a lot of terms. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is just the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the central charge at P, plus the potential energy between all the pairs of the 12 charges.

Wait, yes. Because each pair contributes to the potential energy. So the total potential energy U is the sum of U between the 13th charge (fixed at P) and each of the 12 charges, plus the sum of U between each pair of the 12 charges.

So U_total = U13_with_12 + U_12_pairs.

Let's compute each part.

First, the charge of each particle is 2e. So each charge is 2 * elementary charge. e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, so each charge is 3.204e-19 C.

But wait, when calculating potential energy, I need to know the sign of the charges. Since all are 2e, and assuming they're positive (like protons), each will repel. So the potential energy will be positive for each pair.

But I'm not sure if that matters because the question is about the minimum energy. Hmm.

Wait, the potential energy for each pair is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1*q2) / r.

So for the pairs involving the 13th charge: There are 12 pairs. Each with charge 2e, so U13_with_12 is 12 * [k*(2e)*(2e) / (2m)].

Wait, but wait. The distance r for each of these pairs is 2 meters. Because each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from P.

The Coulomb constant k is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

So let's compute that:

U13_with_12 = 12 * (k * (2e)^2) / (2m).

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e², so that's 12 * (k * 4e²) / (2m) = 12 * (4 k e²) / (2m) = (12 *4)/(2) * (k e²)/(m) = 24 * (k e²)/(2m) ?

Wait, wait, no, let me recalculate.

Wait, 12 charges, each at distance 2m from the 13th. Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (4e² k) / (2m) ) = 2 e² k / m.

So for 12 such pairs, U13_with_12 = 12 * (2 e² k)/(2m) )? Wait, no. Wait, no, 12 * [ (2e)*(2e) / (2m) ] * k. So each term is k*(4e²)/(2m) = 2e² k/m. So 12 of them would be 12 * 2 e² k / m = 24 e² k / m.

Wait, but wait, e is 1.6e-19 C. e squared is (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So let me compute that. But perhaps I should get all the terms in terms of known constants.

Now, the second part is the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges on the sphere. Since each of these 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, but they are arranged on the sphere. So each charge is at a distance of 2m from P, but the distance between any two of the 12 charges depends on their positions. Since the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their arrangement isn't specified. So the positions of the 12 charges on the sphere will influence the potential energy between them. To minimize the total potential energy, the charges should be arranged in a way that minimizes the repulsion between them. But wait, for identical repelling charges, the most stable configuration is when they are as far apart as possible. For a sphere, that would be a regular dodecahedron arrangement, but perhaps the calculation is easier by considering all pairs are at the same distance from each other? Wait, no, unless they are placed on a regular icosahedron or something, but perhaps for the sake of simplicity, the problem assumes that the 12 charges are equally spaced on the sphere, so each pair is at the same distance from each other. Or perhaps the problem is considering only the central charge and the 12 others, but not the interactions between the 12. But I don't think that's the case because the problem is about the minimum energy, which would require considering all interactions.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged symmetrically and each pair is equally distant from each other, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are placed on the surface of the sphere in such a way that the distance between any two is the same. But that's only possible if they're arranged in a regular polyhedron with 12 vertices, but I'm not sure what that would be. Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies the calculation by treating each pair of the 12 as being at a fixed distance, but I don't have enough information. Maybe the problem expects me to calculate the potential between each pair of the 12 charges, each being at a distance of 2m apart, but that doesn't make sense because two points on a sphere of radius 2m won't be 2m apart unless the angle is 90 degrees or something. Wait, the distance between two points on a sphere can be found using the law of cosines. So if two points are on a sphere of radius r, the distance d between them is d = sqrt(r² + r² - 2 r² cosθ), where θ is the angle between them as viewed from the center. So for r=2m, and θ let's say 180 degrees (opposite ends), d would be 4m. But for adjacent points, θ would be smaller, so d would be less than 4m.

But wait, maybe the problem is considering that all the 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosagon (12-gon) on the equator of the sphere. So each adjacent pair is separated by an angle of 30 degrees (360/12=30). So the distance between adjacent charges would be d = sqrt( (2)^2 + (2)^2 - 2*(2)(2)*cos(30°) ) = sqrt(4 +4 -8*(sqrt(3)/2)) ) = sqrt(8 - 4*sqrt(3)).

So sqrt(8-4*1.732) = sqrt(8-6.928)=sqrt(1.072)≈1.035 meters.

Wait, but that's just the distance between adjacent charges. The problem is that each pair of the 12 contributes a potential energy term, so I have to sum all their interactions. That seems complicated. But perhaps the problem is making an assumption to simplify this, maybe that all the 12 charges are so arranged that each is at the same distance from every other, which would be impossible except in a regular simplex, but for 12 points on a sphere, that's not possible. So maybe the problem is not considering the interactions between the 12 charges, but that would be incorrect because that's part of the potential energy.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement: "the minimum energy of this system." So I'm being asked to find the minimum possible potential energy of the system, which would be the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of charges.

So, for 13 charges, how many unique pairs are there? Let's see: 13 choose 2 = (13*12)/2 = 78 pairs.

So each of these 78 pairs contributes a potential energy term. So the total potential energy U is the sum of all these terms.

But calculating all 78 terms sounds tedious. Is there a smarter way? Perhaps by grouping the terms.

Let me think: the 13th charge is at P, so it forms 12 pairs with the other charges. Then, the other 12 charges form C(12,2) = 66 pairs among themselves.

So U_total = U_13_with_12 + U_12_among_themselves.

Let's compute each part.

First, U_13_with_12: Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, so the distance between the 13th and each of the 12 is 2m. So each of these pairs contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (4 e² k)/(2m) ) = 2 e² k / m.

So for 12 pairs, U_13_with_12 = 12 * (2 e² k) / (2m) ?

Wait, wait, the formula is U = k * (q1 q2) / r.

So for each pair between 13th and others:

q1 = 2e, q2 = 2e, r=2m.

So each such U is (k * (2e)(2e)) / (2m) ) = (4 k e²) / (2m) ) = 2 k e² / m.

Since there are 12 such pairs, U_13_with_12 = 12 * (2 k e² / m) ) = 24 k e² / m.

Now, the second part is the potential energy between the 12 charges. Each of these charges is at 2m from P, but the distance between any two charges varies. So I can't just multiply by a fixed number, because each pair is at a different distance. But wait, the problem statement says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. But it doesn't specify their mutual distances. Hmm, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere is such that their mutual potential energy is minimized. Wait, no, wait: the potential energy between like charges is repulsive, so to minimize the potential energy, the charges should be placed as far apart as possible. That would mean arranging them in a way that each is as far as possible from all others. For a sphere, the most symmetrical arrangement would be a regular icosahedron or something, but perhaps in this problem, it's assumed that all the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at the same distance from each other, but that's only possible in some regular polyhedron. Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies by assuming that the mutual distances are the same. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking only about the potential energy between the central charge and the others, and ignores the potential energy between the 12 charges, but that doesn't make sense because the problem asks for the minimum energy which includes all interactions.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy between the 12 charges can be treated as a point where each pair is at a certain fixed distance, but I don't have enough information. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that the mutual interactions of the 12 charges are zero, but that's not possible.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is making an assumption that the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2m from each other. Wait, that's impossible because if you have 12 points on a sphere of radius 2m, the maximum distance between any two points is 4m (diametrically opposite), but you can't have all 12 pairs at 2m apart. Because for a sphere of radius r, the maximum possible distance is 2r. So perhaps the problem is using an approximation where the distance between each of the 12 charges is 2m, but that's incorrect because for a sphere, the maximum is 4m, but if you have 12 points, the average distance between them would be less than 4m.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from point P, but doesn't specify their mutual distances. So perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the mutual distances are to be considered as 2m as well. But that doesn't make sense because two points on a sphere of radius 2m can't be 2m apart unless at a certain angle. Wait, let's calculate that.

The distance between two points on a sphere of radius r is d = 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them as viewed from the center. So if d = 2m, and r=2m, then 2m = 2*(2m) sin(theta/2) → 1 = 2 sin(theta/2) → sin(theta/2)=0.5 → theta/2 = 30 degrees → theta=60 degrees. So the angle between each pair would be 60 degrees. But can 12 points be placed on a sphere such that each pair is separated by 60 degrees? That's impossible because the maximum number of equidistant points on a sphere is limited. For example, the vertices of a regular tetrahedron are at 109.47 degrees, but for 12 points, it's more complicated. I think it's not possible to have 12 points all separated by 60 degrees on a sphere. So perhaps the problem isn't considering the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, but that would be an error because the problem asks for the total potential energy.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero. That can't be right, but maybe the problem is designed that way. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are negligible compared to the interactions with the central charge, but I don't think so because the problem is about minimum energy, which would require considering all interactions.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, they are in the order of 1e-26 J. Let me compute the potential energy from the central charge and the 12 others first, and see what that gives.

So, U_13_with_12 = 12 * (k * (2e)^2 ) / 2m = 12 * (k *4e²)/(2m) = 24 k e²/(2m) = 12 k e²/m.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me redo it.

Each pair between 13th and another charge:

U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) ) = (4 k e²) / (2m) ) = 2 k e² / m.

So for 12 pairs, it's 12 * 2 k e² / m = 24 k e² / m.

Now, the other part is the potential energy between the 12 charges.

Each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the distance between any two on the sphere is variable, but we can't compute each individual pair's contribution without knowing the exact arrangement. Hmm.

But wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the potential energy between the 12 charges is zero. No, that can't be right because like charges would repel and have a positive potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy is not considered, but that would be incorrect. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the other term. Let's compute U_13_with_12 first.

Let me plug in the numbers.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

m = 2 meters.

So compute U_13_with_12:

24 * k * e² / m.

Compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

So:

24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 / 2.

Wait, m is 2 meters, so denominator is 2.

24 * 8.988e9 = let me compute 24 *8.988e9.

24 *8 = 192, 24 *0.988e9=24 *9.88e8= approx 23.712e8.

Total: 192e9 +23.712e8 = 2.15712e9.

So 2.15712e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

2.15712e9 * 2.566e-38 = (2.15712 *2.566) * 1e-29.

2.15712 *2.566 ≈ 5.548.

So 5.548e-29.

Divide by 2: 5.548e-29 /2 = 2.774e-29.

So U_13_with_12 ≈ 2.774e-29 J.

But wait, that's just the potential energy from the central charge and the 12 others. Now, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges?

Each of the 12 charges is 2e, so the potential energy between any two is U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between them.

But without knowing r_ij for each pair, I can't compute this exactly. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 others, and not the potential energy between the 12 themselves. Because the answer options are all very small numbers, and the number I just calculated is 2.77e-29 J, but the options are in the 1e-26 range. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me recompute U_13_with_12.

U_13_with_12 = 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)].

Which is 12 * [k *4e² / (2m)] = 12 * [2k e²/m] ].

So 12 * 2 =24, so U_13_with_12 =24 * [k e²/m].

Now, plugging the numbers:

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C²,

e²=(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 C²,

m=2 m.

So:

24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 / 2.

Wait, denominator is m=2, so dividing by 2.

Wait, 24 *8.988e9 = 24 *8.988e9 = 215712e6 = 2.15712e11.

Wait, 8.988e9 is 8,988,000,000.

24 *8,988,000,000 = let me compute:

8,988,000,000 * 20 = 179,760,000,000.

8,988,000,000 *4=35,952,000,000.

Total = 215,712,000,000 = 2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38:

2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute 2.15712 * 2.566 = approx 5.548.

So 5.548e-27.

Divide by 2 (since m=2, denominator is 2):

5.548e-27 /2 = 2.774e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 2.77e-27 J. But that's not matching any of the options. The options are:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Hmm, my calculation gave 2.77e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27) but not exactly. But I ignored the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. So perhaps if I include that, the total U would be higher.

Wait, but the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges would add to the total. Since all are positive, each pair contributes a positive potential energy. So the total U would be higher than 2.77e-27 J. But the options are higher than that. Let's see, option B is 2.82e-26, which is about 10 times higher than my U_13_with_12.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, U_13_with_12 = 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)].

So that's 12 * [k *4e²/(2m)] = 12 * (2k e²/m) = 24 k e²/m.

k=8.988e9, e²=2.566e-38, m=2.

So 24 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) / 2.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

First, compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 *1e-38.

Multiplying these gives (8.988 *2.566) * 1e(9-38) )= approx (23.0) * 1e-29 = 2.3e-28.

Then, 24 * (2.3e-28) /2.

So 24 * 2.3e-28 = 55.2e-28 = 5.52e-27.

Then, divide by 2 → 2.76e-27 J.

So that's 2.76e-27 J for the central charge part.

Now, what about the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges?

Each of the 12 charges has 2e, and each pair is separated by some distance r_ij.

But without knowing the arrangement, it's impossible to compute each term. However, maybe the problem makes an assumption that the mutual potential energy is zero or minimal, which could mean that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are as large as possible, thus minimizing the potential energy. Wait, no, because like charges repel, so to minimize the potential energy (which is positive), you want them as far apart as possible, which would minimize each individual U_ij. But I'm not sure how to model that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the central charge's contribution, but in this case, the options are larger than my initial calculation, so perhaps the mutual part is significant.

Wait, but let's think: the potential energy between two charges on the sphere of radius 2m could be approximated if they are all equally spaced. Let's say they form a regular icosagon on the equator, each separated by 30 degrees. Then, the distance between adjacent charges would be d = 2 * 2m * sin(15°) → because theta is 30°, so half the angle is 15°. So d ≈ 4m * 0.2588 ≈ 1.035 m.

So for adjacent pairs, the distance is about 1.035 m. Then, the potential energy U for each adjacent pair is k*(2e)^2/(1.035 m) = (4 k e²) / 1.035 m.

But wait, m is 2 meters? Wait, no: the distance is 1.035 meters, and each charge is 2e, so U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(1.035) = 4k e²/(1.035).

But there are 12 such adjacent pairs, but that's only for nearest neighbors. However, in reality, each pair contributes, so perhaps the average distance is more than 2m. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using an approximation that the mutual potential energy is zero, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual potential energy is equal to the potential energy from the central charge. Let me see: If U_13_with_12 is 2.76e-27 J, and if the mutual U_12 is about the same magnitude, then the total could be around 5.5e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem ignores the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, which would make the total U = 2.76e-27 J. But none of the options match that exactly.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B is 2.822e-26 J. That's about 10 times larger than my U_13_with_12.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute U_13_with_12 again.

U_13_with_12 = 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

So that's 12 * [ (8.988e9) * (4*(1.602e-19)^2) ] / (2 * 2).

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

Compute 4*(1.602e-19)^2:

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.026e-37.

Then, k=8.988e9.

Multiply by 1.026e-37: 8.988e9 * 1.026e-
