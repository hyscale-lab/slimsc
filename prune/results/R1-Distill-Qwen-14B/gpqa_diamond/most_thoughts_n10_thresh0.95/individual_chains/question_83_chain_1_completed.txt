Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titrations and pH calculations. Let me take it step by step.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, let's understand the situation. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, you get different pH points based on how much base has been added.

So, the initial solution is a diluted acetic acid. Since we're adding equal volumes of acetic acid and water, the concentration should change. Let me calculate the new concentration after dilution.

The initial volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. The number of moles of acetic acid is Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let's find the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol (from earlier). Since NaOH reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio (because acetic acid is CH3COOH and NaOH is a strong base), the moles of NaOH needed will also be 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but wait, the problem says to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

But wait, I need to think about the initial solution before any NaOH is added. It's 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when we add some NaOH, it converts some of the acetic acid into its conjugate base, acetate.

First, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration. That means 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. Since equivalence is at 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait, how does that translate into moles of NaOH added? Because the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so moles added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. When we add 0.00025 mol of NaOH, it will react with acetic acid. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O

So moles of CH3COOH will decrease by 0.00025 mol, and moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) will increase by 0.00025 mol.

So initial moles after dilution: CH3COOH = 0.001 mol, CH3COO^- = 0.

After adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH:

CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

CH3COO^-: 0 + 0.00025 = 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is given by the formula pKa = -log(Ka). Given Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa ≈ 4.736.

Wait, let me calculate that. Ka = 1.85 ×10^-5. So log(1.85) is about 0.267. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which seems close. But let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, let's compute [A^-]/[HA] more accurately.

0.00025 / 0.0425 = approx 0.005882 M.

0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.

So the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) is indeed about -0.477.

So the pH is approximately 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is about 4.25. So looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, which is close. So that's a candidate.

Now, moving on to the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate.

Wait, but equivalence point pH for a weak acid titrated with a strong base is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. Because the solution at equivalence is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. When all the acetic acid is neutralized, you have acetate ions in solution. Since acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, it will react with water to form OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

So, the solution at equivalence is a solution of sodium acetate. Let me calculate the concentration.

At equivalence, the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, same as the initial acetic acid. The total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (10 cm³) → 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion (A^-) will hydrolyze in water:

A^- + H2O ↔ HA + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb is 5.405e-10. Now, the concentration is 0.02 M.

The expression for Kb is [HA][OH^-] / [A^-] = Kb.

Assuming that x is the [OH^-] produced, and x is small compared to initial concentration (0.02 M), so we can approximate:

x² / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10 → x² ≈ 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x² ≈ 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is approximately 3.288e-6 M. Then, pOH is -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485. So pH is 14 - 5.485 ≈ 8.515, which is approximately 8.52.

So at equivalence, the pH is around 8.52. Looking back at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second value. So the pH at equivalence is about 8.52.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations for the equivalence point.

Another thought: when we reach the equivalence point, the solution is made of sodium acetate, which dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze as I described, but perhaps I should consider the exact calculation without approximation.

Let me set up the equation more accurately.

The hydrolysis equation:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10, as before.

The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.

So, Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x² ≈ 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 3.288e-6, as before.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6, pOH is about 5.485, pH is about 8.515, which rounds to 8.52.

So the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52.

Putting it together, the pH at 25% titration is around 4.25, and at equivalence, it's around 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that fits.

Wait, but wait another thought. Did I calculate the 25% correctly? Because sometimes in titration problems, 25% of the titrant added refers to the volume, not the moles.

Wait, yes, because the volume of titrant added is 25% of the equivalence volume. So in this case, the equivalence volume is 10 cm³ (as calculated earlier), so 25% is 2.5 cm³, which is correct.

So the moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol, which is correct.

Another thing: when we added 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, the concentration became 0.025 M, which I think is correct.

So the buffer is correct, leading to a pH of about 4.25, which is option A, with 4.26 as the first value.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the dilution isn't the only part. Let me recheck the initial molarity.

Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol of acetic acid. Adding 20 cm³ of water (0.02 L) brings the total to 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So the initial concentration is correct.

Another possibility: Maybe I should have considered the exact dilution, but I think that's correct.

So, the pH at 25% is around 4.25, equivalence point is 8.52.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → correct.

Option D: 4.57;6.92 → lower pH at equivalence, which can't be right since equivalence is basic.

So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but another thought. Maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because the acetate is a weak base, so the pH should be above 7. The value I got of ~8.52 aligns with that.

So I think option A is the correct choice.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. The equivalence point volume is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH required} = \text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the equivalence point volume is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Concentration}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of this volume is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]

where \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(K_a)\) and \(K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5}\):

\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73.
\]

Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right).
\]

The ratio is:

\[
\frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.3333,
\]

and:

\[
\log(0.3333) \approx -0.477.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 \approx 4.25.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ion. The moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \(K_b\) for acetate ion is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \(x\) be the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) produced. The expression for \(K_b\) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \(K_b\) is very small, \(x \ll 0.02\), so:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 5.405 \times 10^{-10} = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The \([\text{OH}^-]\) is \(3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}\), so the pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.485.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.485 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
