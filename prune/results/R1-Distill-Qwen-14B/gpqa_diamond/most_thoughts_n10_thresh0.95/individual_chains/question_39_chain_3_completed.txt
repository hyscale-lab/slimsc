Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup: there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So, no particles were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, okay, so the wave function is given, and the fact that the particles are only found between 1 and 3 suggests that the wave function must be zero outside this region. Wait, but the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh, but wait, the wave function in quantum mechanics is usually a complex function, right? So the real and imaginary parts are both there. But for the particle to be found between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be non-zero only in that interval.

Wait, or maybe the wave function must have zero probability outside that interval. The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So the wave function's absolute value squared should be zero outside x=1 to x=3. That would mean the wave function itself must be zero outside that region. So, for x <1 and x>3, the wave function is zero.

Looking at the given wave function: (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a complex function. Wait, but if the wave function is zero outside x=1 to 3, then for x <1 and x>3, the function must be zero. Let's check. For x<1, 1+x is less than 2, so sqrt(1+x) is a real number. So a/sqrt(1+x) is a real number, and then subtracting 0.5i. So the function would be a real part and an imaginary part.

Wait, but if the wave function is zero in the regions x<1 and x>3, then the wave function itself must be zero there. So when x<1, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), but the imaginary part is -0.5i. How can (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i be zero? That would require both the real and imaginary parts to be zero. So a/sqrt(1+x) = 0 and -0.5 = 0, which can't happen. That doesn't make sense. So wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given as a function that's zero outside 1 to 3. So maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i multiplied by a step function that is 1 between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But the problem states that the wave function is described as that expression in the region where the particle exists. So perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe that's only valid between 1 and 3, and zero outside. So when x is less than 1 or greater than 3, the wave function is zero. So how can that be? Because the function (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i is only real if a is such that it's zero outside. Wait, but that would require the whole expression to be zero for x outside 1-3. But that's not possible because, say, at x=0, 1+x=1, so sqrt(1+x)=1, so a/1 =a. The expression is a -0.5i. For this to be zero, a must be zero and 0.5i must be zero, which isn't possible. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait another thought: perhaps the wave function is non-zero only in the interval x=1 to x=3. So the given expression is valid only in that region, and the wave function is zero elsewhere. But the problem statement says that the wave function is described as that expression in the part of space where it can exist. So maybe the function is non-zero only in 1<x<3, but the given expression is valid in that region. So we need to find 'a' such that the wave function is normalized, meaning that the integral of |psi|^2 from 1 to 3 is 1.

Because in quantum mechanics, the total probability must be 1. So perhaps that's the approach. So we'll integrate the squared magnitude of the wave function from 1 to 3, set it equal to 1, and solve for 'a'.

The wave function is psi(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let's compute |psi|^2.

|psi(x)|^2 = [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) )^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

Because when you square a complex number, (a + ib)^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 2iab, but the square of the absolute value is a^2 + b^2.

Wait, no, more accurately, |psi(x)|² is (Re(psi))² + (Im(psi))². So for psi = A + iB, |psi|² = A² + B².

So here, A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is -0.5. So B squared is (0.5)^2=0.25.

So |psi(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

We need to integrate this from 1 to 3 and set it equal to 1.

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

So let's compute each part.

First, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), but wait, ln(3+1) is ln(4), and ln(1+1) is ln(2). So ln4 - ln2 = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So that part is a² ln 2.

The second integral is the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3, which is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln2 = 1 -0.5 =0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln2.

Compute ln2: approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

So a^2 = 0.721, so a = sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to this value.

Wait, let me check the exact calculation.

ln2 is approximately 0.69314718056.

0.5 / 0.69314718056 = let's compute this.

0.5 divided by 0.69314718056.

Well, 0.5/0.6931 is approximately 0.7213.

So a² is 0.7213.

a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Which is about 0.85. So the correct option is B) 0.85.

Wait, but let me recheck the integrals to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Integral of (a^2)/(1+x) from 1 to 3.

Yes, substitution u=1+x, du=dx. When x=1, u=2; x=3, u=4.

Integral from 2 to4 of a²/u du = a² (ln4 - ln2) = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln2. Correct.

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5. Correct.

Sum the two: a² ln2 + 0.5 =1.

a² ln2 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln2 ≈ 0.7213.

a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, so 0.85 is the closest option.


To determine the value of \( a \), we analyze the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) and use the normalization condition for quantum mechanical wave functions. The total probability of finding the particle must equal 1, which requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). Substituting this into the integral:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Split the integral into two parts:

1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \):  
   Using the substitution \( u = 1+x \), \( du = dx \), the limits change from \( x=1 \) (\( u=2 \)) to \( x=3 \) (\( u=4 \)).  
   The integral becomes:  
   \[
   a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_{2}^{4} = a^2 (\ln(4) - \ln(2)) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx \):  
   This is straightforward:  
   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding the two results and setting the total equal to 1:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Simplify for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \).
