Okay, I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to find the correct answer. Let me think through it step by step.

So, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states.

Wait, I should recall what the standard basis states look like in terms of density matrices. The |0> state is a pure state, and its density matrix is |0><0|, which in matrix form is a diagonal matrix with 1 at the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 1 at (1,1).

But wait, the given ρ is an average of these two. So each term is multiplied by 1/2. So, when I add them together, each diagonal element becomes (1/2 + 1/2) = 1. Wait, no, because each term is |0><0| which is [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1><1| which is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplied by 1/2 gives [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2.

Wait, but density matrices are also related to Bloch vectors. Oh right, for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can rewrite the given ρ in that form, I can find r.

Let me write down the given ρ again: ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I think |0><0| is the same as (I + σ_z)/2, because σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So (I + σ_z)/2 would be [[ (1+1)/2, 0], [0, (1-1)/2]] → [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is (I - σ_z)/2, which would be [[0,0],[0,1]]. 

Wait, so |0><0| = (I + σ_z)/2 and |1><1| = (I - σ_z)/2. Therefore, when I add them, |0><0| + |1><1| equals (I + σ_z)/2 + (I - σ_z)/2 = (2I)/2 = I. So the given ρ is (1/2)(I). So ρ is (I)/2.

Wait, but the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So comparing, our ρ is (I)/2. That means (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. So I + r·σ must equal I. So r·σ must be zero. 

Which Pauli matrices are involved here? The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. For this to be zero, each component of r must be zero. So r_x = 0, r_y=0, r_z=0. Thus, the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which is the origin.

Wait, but what does that mean? The density matrix (I/2) represents the completely mixed state. Because when the state is a maximally mixed state, it's at the center of the Bloch sphere. So the Bloch vector is the origin, which is r=(0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|).
\]

This can be rewritten in terms of the Pauli matrices. Recall that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), we observe that it is an equal mixture of the states \( |0\rangle \langle 0| \) and \( |1\rangle \langle 1| \), which corresponds to the completely mixed state. This state can be written as \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix.

Comparing this with the general form \( \rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2} \), it is clear that \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). This implies that all components of \( \mathbf{r} \) must be zero: \( r_x = 0 \), \( r_y = 0 \), and \( r_z = 0 \). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

The correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is thus \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).

Answer: C
