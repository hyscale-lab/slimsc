Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's think it through.

The question is about the possible decay products of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure if I need to look at that closely. The mass of X is 6 GeV, which is important because that determines what particles it can decay into.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, not sure if that's relevant for decay though. Maybe it's more about the interaction terms. The decay would depend on the couplings, but without knowing λ, maybe it's more about the possible fermions allowed.

But the main point is kinematical: what fermions can X decay into, given its mass. So the decay products must each have a mass less than half of X's mass, because each product would get at least half (if the other is at rest). Oh wait, wait, that's for two-body decay. For X → f f-bar, each f must have a mass less than M_X / 2.

So X's mass is 6 GeV. Let me list the possible fermions and their masses.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But top quark is way too heavy. The top is about 173 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks. So top is out.

What about the other quarks? Let's see their masses.

Up and down: around a few MeV, negligible compared to GeV. So yes, they can be decay products.

Strange quark: about 100 MeV, so much less than 3 GeV (since 6 GeV /2 is 3 GeV). So yes, strange is allowed.

Charm quark: about 1.5 GeV. Again, 1.5 < 3 GeV, so allowed.

Bottom quark: around 4.5 GeV. Wait, 4.5 is less than 3 GeV? No, 4.5 is more than 3. So bottom quark mass is too high. So X cannot decay into b quarks. So any option including b or anti-b is out.

Wait, but wait! Wait, the mass of the bottom quark is about 4.1-4.7 GeV, depending on the source. So 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, each b quark would need to be less than 3 GeV. But bottom is about 4.5, so no, can't decay into b quarks. So any option that includes b b-bar is invalid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b b-bar, so that's not allowed. So A is out.

Option B: no b b-bar, so possible. Let me check what else.

The fermions in B are c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, what about other leptons? The tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV, so allowed. E is even lighter. So B includes taus, which is okay.

What about the muon? Muon is about 0.1 GeV, so allowed. So B includes mu and e, which are okay.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. Wait, but top quark is in C. So X can't decay into top quarks because top is too heavy, so C is out.

Option D: includes b, which we said isn't allowed, so D is out.

Wait, let me double-check. So X can decay into any fermions where each has mass m_f < 3 GeV.

So possible fermions are up, down, strange, charm, muon, tau, electron.

Wait, what about the muon and tau leptons? They are allowed, as their masses are lower.

So in the decay products, the allowed would be any combination where each pair has a mass less than 3 GeV.

So for quarks: u, d, s, c are allowed, but not b or t.

Leptons: e, mu, tau are allowed.

Wait, but what about the charged leptons in decay? So for each decay channel, X would decay into a lepton and its antiparticle, like e+ e- or mu+ mu- or tau+ tau-.

So the allowed decay channels are for the quarks (u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar) and the leptons (tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-).

So looking back at the options.

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. Oh wait, looking at the options, let me check.

Option B's decay modes are c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's allowed.

Wait, but what about the charged pions or other mesons? No, because the question is about fermions, not mesons. The Lagrangian involves ψ_f, which are fermionic fields.

So the decay must produce a fermion and its antiparticle. So the options list each as a pair.

So, the allowed decays would be to any of these fermions: u, d, s, c, mu, tau, e.

Wait, but the problem is about the kinematical decay, so any fermion pair where each has a mass less than 3 GeV.

So the possible decay products are any of these fermion pairs.

So looking at the options, which one includes all possible pairs except those with b and t.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Wait, but option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option B: all those, including tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

So the answer is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The decay products must satisfy the condition that the mass of each fermion is less than \( M_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This ensures that the decay is energetically allowed.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass of the boson \( X \):** \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Therefore, each decay product must have a mass \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Fermion masses:**
   - **Quarks:** 
     - Up (\( u \)) and down (\( d \)) quarks: \( \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \), well below \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so allowed.
     - Strange (\( s \)) quark: \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
     - Charm (\( c \)) quark: \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
     - Bottom (\( b \)) quark: \( \sim 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so not allowed.
     - Top (\( t \)) quark: \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), far exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so not allowed.
   - **Leptons:**
     - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
     - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 105 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
     - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.

3. **Decay channels:**
   - The boson \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair (\( f \bar{f} \)) where the fermion mass \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This includes:
     - \( u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \).

4. **Eliminating options:**
   - **Option A:** Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since the bottom quark mass exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Rejected.**
   - **Option B:** Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Accepted.**
   - **Option C:** Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since the top quark mass is far greater than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Rejected.**
   - **Option D:** Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Rejected.**

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), corresponding to **Option B**.
