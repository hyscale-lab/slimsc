Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, resulting in product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, okay. Let me take each step one by one.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's quite a rigid molecule. Heating dibromoadamantane with KOH... Oh, that sounds like a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so it could cause an E2 elimination, removing two HBr molecules. So, maybe the product is an adamantane with two double bonds? Wait, or perhaps it's a single double bond?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. When KOH is used, it's likely to deprotonate and eliminate. But since it's a dihalide, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to a diene? Or maybe an allene?

Wait, elimination reactions of vicinal dihalides (where the two halogens are on adjacent carbons) typically form alkenes. But in this case, the dihalide is 1,3 positions. So maybe it's a conjugated diene? Because with two eliminations, each removing a Br and a H, leading to two double bonds.

Wait, but if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, then elimination would form a double bond between 1-2 and 3-4, perhaps, creating a conjugated diene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single elimination but forming a ring structure. Hmm, I'm not fully sure, but let me think about the NMR data.

The NMR for product 1 is given: 4.79 (2H), which is a doublet maybe? But the integration is 2H. Then 2.41-2.23 (10H), that's a lot, probably the adamantane's bridgehead hydrogens. Then 1.94 (2H). Also, the IR shows an absorbance at 1720 cm-1 which is around where esters or ketones absorb. Wait, but if product 1 is formed by elimination, maybe it's an alkene. But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, maybe it's an epoxide? Because epoxide rings have C-O bonds which show up around 1700-1800 cm-1. Alternatively, maybe a ketone or an ester.

Wait, but elimination would form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps I was wrong, and KOH is causing a different reaction. Maybe it's a substitution? No, KOH as a base, more likely elimination. But maybe the reaction isn't elimination but some kind of nucleophilic substitution. Wait, in adamantane, the structure is so rigid that substitution might be difficult. Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Maybe it's a diol that's formed, but how? KOH would cause elimination, not substitution. Oh wait, maybe each Br is on adjacent carbons, but in adamantane, the structure is such that the 1 and 3 positions are not adjacent. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so each carbon is connected in a way where each has two bridgehead carbons. So 1 and 3 are on the same face but not adjacent. Hmm, perhaps elimination isn't possible, but maybe a substitution occurs. Wait, but with KOH, substitution would require a good leaving group, which Br is. So perhaps it's a substitution, but with KOH, which is a base, so maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product. The IR has a peak around 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide? Because when you have two adjacent bromines, elimination can form an epoxide. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane, if elimination occurs, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons... Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two Brs are on adjacent bridgehead carbons. Let me think about adamantane's structure. Adamantane has a structure like a diamond, with each bridgehead carbon connected to two others. If the Brs are on 1 and 3, perhaps in positions that are not adjacent. So elimination might not form an epoxide but a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming two double bonds. But that's a bit unclear.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a region where CH2 groups attached to oxygen might appear, like in an epoxide. Because in epoxides, the protons are usually between 3-5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe a diol, but with two OH groups, but the NMR doesn't show broad peaks, which would be expected for OH protons. Wait, but the NMR data doesn't show any broad peaks, so perhaps it's not a diol.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. But then the NMR would have a peak around 2.1 ppm for the carbonyl adjacent CH2 groups. But the 4.79 ppm is more like an ether or an epoxide.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product is an alkene. But then the IR would show a peak around 1640 for C=C. 1720 is more likely a carbonyl. So maybe elimination doesn't form an alkene but a ketone? That doesn't make sense because elimination typically forms alkenes, not ketones.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a formation of a ketone via some elimination and rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that involves esters. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Oh wait, wait! If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, but in a rigid structure. Vicinal dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, perhaps elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but that would have IR peaks for C=C, not a carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the IR. 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, ester, aldehyde, or maybe an acid chloride (but less likely here). So perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, considering the structure of adamantane. If two HBr are eliminated, maybe from adjacent bridgehead carbons, forming a carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a keto group. But how?

Wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure. If two Brs are removed, perhaps it leads to the formation of a bridge with a carbonyl group. For example, maybe the two bridgehead carbons, each losing a Br and a H, form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that's more about carbocation shifts. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening ozonolysis, but no, that's in a later step.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other data. The NMR has a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an OCH2 group, like in an ether or epoxide. So maybe the product is an epoxide. So the reaction would be the formation of an epoxide via elimination.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane – could it form an epoxide? Epoxides are formed typically from vicinal dihalides. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide where the two Brs are on carbons that are not adjacent. So perhaps it's a 1,3-dibromocyclohexane analog, but in adamantane.

Wait, in a cyclohexane, 1,3-dibromide is not vicinal, so elimination would not form an epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not a simple elimination but a more complex process. Alternatively, maybe the product isn't an epoxide but a ketone. Let me think: if KOH is used, perhaps it's a base-induced elimination, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a substitution, but with two eliminations leading to a carbonyl. Like a double elimination with loss of two HBr, forming a carbonyl group. For example, perhaps each Br is replaced by a base, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So in adamantane, the four bridgehead carbons are each connected to three other bridgeheads. So 1 and 3 are not adjacent but are across from each other. So perhaps eliminating two HBr molecules from 1 and 3 would form a conjugated diene, but that's not related to a carbonyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider the possibilities for product 1. The IR suggests a carbonyl. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 (2H), which could be a CH2 next to an oxygen. So maybe it's an epoxide. But how?

Wait, perhaps the product is not an epoxide but a ketone. Let me think about the NMR. A triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester. But in a ketone, the adjacent CH2 would be around 2.1 ppm, which is covered in the 2.41-2.23 region, which is 10H. So that's probably the bridgehead Hs.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. The IR at 1720 cm-1 would fit a ketone. So how would that form? If the two Brs are eliminated, perhaps forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a geminal dihalide. Oh wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not a geminal dihalide. So if it's not geminal, then elimination would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to move forward and see if the next steps can help.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 is an aromatic compound, but adamantane isn't aromatic. Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, then maybe product 2 is some kind of acylation product. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide ring-opening.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Let's assume that. Then heating with aluminum isopropoxide could lead to acid-catalyzed ring opening. Epoxides under acidic conditions typically open via nucleophilic attack. But what's the nucleophile here? In presence of Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it acts as a Lewis acid, generating carbocations. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but again, adamantane isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. But I thought the NMR didn't show broad peaks.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diepoxide, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone. So when product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a strong Lewis acid, perhaps it's involved in some kind of acylation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diethyl ether derivative, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Ozonolysis of a diene would break it into smaller fragments. But if product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis is typically done on alkenes to form ozonides, which upon workup form carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it.

But let me think, product 3 is formed after ozonolysis and dimethylsulfide. So perhaps product 3 is a diacid or a diketone or a combination.

But wait, the first step's product (product 1) is a light yellow solid, probably a more strained or oxidized compound.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Then product 2 is a more substituted ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Then, product 2 might be a diol, but that doesn't seem to fit the next step.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diepoxide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is adamantane-1,3-diol. But then, the NMR would have broad OH peaks, which aren't mentioned. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm going about this wrong. Let me try to think of each step more systematically.

1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

KOH is a strong base, so likely elimination. For vicinal dihalides, elimination forms alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not a vicinal dihalide, so elimination might not form an alkene but perhaps something else.

Wait, wait. Maybe it's a 1,3-dibromo structure in a way that allows for two E2 eliminations, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. How?

Wait, perhaps each Br is eliminated with a H from adjacent carbons, leading to a double bond. But 1 and 3 are not adjacent, so eliminating Br from 1 and H from 2, and Br from 3 and H from 4 would form two double bonds, making a conjugated diene. So product 1 would be 1,3-diene adamantane. The IR in that case would show C=C peaks around 1640 cm-1, not 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the product is an epoxide. But for that, the two Brs should be on adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe the structure is such that 1 and 3 are adjacent? I'm not sure about the structure of adamantane.

Wait, I think I need to look up the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four bridgehead carbons, each connected to three others. So positions 1 and 3 would be on opposite bridgeheads, but not adjacent. So elimination from 1 and 3 wouldn't form an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Another possibility is that KOH is causing a substitution, but in adamantane, substitution is difficult due to the structure. So perhaps it's not substitution.

Wait, another angle: the IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1 is a strong, possibly sharp peak. That's typical of a carbonyl group without much conjugation. So perhaps it's a ketone.

So maybe product 1 is a ketone. How would that form? If the two Brs are eliminated, perhaps as HBr, and the two carbons that were attached to Br form a carbonyl group.

Wait, elimination usually forms double bonds, but if the structure is such that eliminating two HBr leads to a carbonyl group, that would require a specific arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated dienone. But that's stretching it.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) must be something like two protons attached to oxygen. So maybe an ether or an epoxide. Let me think: in an epoxide, the protons are typically around 3-4 ppm. But if the epoxide is in a strained ring, the chemical shift could be upfield or downfield.

Alternatively, if it's an ether, like OCH2CH2O, but that would be a symmetric structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a diketone. Then the carbonyl groups would cause the IR peak. But where would the 4.79 ppm come from? Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a geminal diol, but that's more likely if it's a substitution. Wait, but substitution would require a good nucleophile. KOH is a base, so more likely elimination.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on to the next steps and see if that helps.

Product 1 is heated with excess Al(OiPr)3, which is a strong Lewis acid. Al(OiPr)3 is used in Friedel-Crafts acylation, but adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, it's used in other acylation reactions or as a catalyst for certain eliminations or additions.

Alternatively, product 1 might be an epoxide. So heating with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid, could protonate the epoxide oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then, perhaps an acid-catalyzed ring-opening occurs. But without a clear nucleophile, what's the product?

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. So when treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, a diol under acidic conditions can form a ketone via keto-enol tautomerism if possible.

Wait, but adamantane isn't very flexible, so forming a carbonyl might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide. Then, treatment with Al(OiPr)3 might induce some ring-opening, perhaps forming an alcohol or another structure.

Hmm.

Then, product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. So, perhaps product 1 was a diene and product 2 is a triene or something with a longer conjugated system. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene. Then, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it could undergo some reaction, but I'm not sure what would happen. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is some kind of more substituted ketone.

Wait, maybe I should think about ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a double bond would break it into two carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would create carbonyl groups in product 3.

But then, the 1H NMR of product 3 would show peaks corresponding to the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So in product 3, after ozonolysis, which forms carbonyl groups, perhaps the structure has some CH2 groups next to carbonyls.

Wait, considering the structure of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be the one closest to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Now, about the coupling pattern. The most deshielded hydrogen would be split based on neighboring Hs.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure. Suppose product 3 is a diketone or has two carbonyl groups. The Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded. If each of those Hs is next to a CH2 group, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2, then the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a structure where the Hs are adjacent to two different sets of neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets or some other multiplet.

Wait, let me try to reconstruct the possible structures.

Product 1: Let's assume it's an epoxide. So structure would have an oxygen in a three-membered ring. Then, product 2 is formed by ring-opening with Al(OiPr)3. Maybe it's a diol? But then, product 2 would have OH groups, which in the next step, ozonolysis would be in an aqueous solution, but with DMS added afterward. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, product 2 could have a double bond if product 1's epoxide is opened to form a diol, which then rearranges to form a double bond upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 could have an additional double bond, perhaps via some elimination.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think about a known reaction pathway.

Another approach: The initial reaction is with KOH, leading to an IR peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an OCH2 group. So maybe product 1 is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide.

Wait, an epoxide's OCH2 would have protons around 3.5-4.5 ppm. So 4.79 is a bit on the higher end but possible for an epoxide in a strained ring.

If product 1 is an epoxide, then product 2 would be the result of acid-catalyzed ring-opening. But without a clear nucleophile, perhaps it's just protonated and remains as is. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, when an epoxide is treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, it can cause ring-opening via a carbocation intermediate. But without a solvent or a nucleophile, maybe nothing happens. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a more substituted epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is some kind of enol ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a double bond, which would explain the ozonolysis step.

Wait, let's think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of product 2, which has a double bond, would break it into two carbonyl groups, so product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The Hs adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded and appear downfield.

In the NMR of
