--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using something called Bragg's law, but wait, no, Bragg's law is more about diffraction. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance is related to the unit cell dimensions and the Miller indices.

Wait, the crystal structure here is rhombohedral. A rhombohedral crystal has all edges equal but all angles are the same and not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. So it's a special kind of crystal system.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Hmm, wait, in a rhombohedral structure, if it's a primitive lattice, the interatomic distance would be the same as the lattice parameter a, right? Because each atom is at a corner, so the distance between adjacent atoms is a. So a = 10 Angstrom here.

The problem is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

Wait, is that right? Because for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, the formula is a bit more complicated than the cubic case. Oh wait, no, in the cubic system, the angles are all 90 degrees, so the formula simplifies. But for rhombohedral, which has angles not 90 degrees, this extended formula applies.

Wait, but I'm mixing up some formulas. Let me think again. I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles between them is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h a/(a)^2)² + (k b/(b)^2)² + (l c/(c)^2)² - ... ) ) 

Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of reciprocal vectors. Alternatively, I recall that the general formula for d-spacing in a crystal with lattice vectors a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ is:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c²) - (2hk cos γ)/(a b) - (2hl cos β)/(a c) - (2lk cos α)/(b c))

Wait, but in this case, it's a rhombohedral crystal, so a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So substituting, the denominator becomes:

h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2lk cos γ, all divided by a².

So the formula for d becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2lk cos γ )

Because a = b = c, and all angles are the same.

So for the (111) plane, h = 1, k = 1, l = 1.

Plugging in the numbers:

Numerator is a, which is 10 Angstrom.

Denominator is sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1)(1) cos 30 - 2*(1)(1) cos 30 - 2*(1)(1) cos 30 )

Simplify inside the square root:

3 - 2 [ cos 30 + cos 30 + cos 30 ]

Wait, wait, let me count the terms. The terms are:

1+1+1 =3.

Then the cross terms:

-2 (1*1 cos 30) for hk, which is 1*1. Similarly for hl and lk.

So each of the three cross terms is -2 * (1)(1) * cos 30°, and there are three of them.

So the expression becomes:

3 - 2*(1) * cos 30° - 2*(1) * cos 30° - 2*(1) * cos 30° 

Which is 3 - 6 * cos 30°.

Wait, cos 30° is √3/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 = approximately 5.196.

So 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the square root of a negative number would be imaginary. That doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake?

Oh wait, maybe I messed up the signs. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

The formula for the denominator is:

h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ 

Yes, that's correct. So substituting h=k=l=1, α=β=γ=30°, we get:

1 +1 +1 - 2*1*1*cos30 - 2*1*1*cos30 - 2*1*1*cos30.

Wait, 3 - 2*(3) * cos30°.

Which is 3 - 6*(√3/2) = 3 - 3√3.

Wait, √3 is approximately 1.732, so 3√3 is about 5.196.

So 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative. That can't be right because it's under the square root.

Hmm. That suggests I've made a mistake in applying the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the angles. Wait, in the formula, α is the angle between the a and b vectors, β between a and c, and γ between b and c. So when all angles are 30°, perhaps that's a different setup.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the angles are all equal, but perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal.

Another approach: the general formula when a = b = c is:

d² = 1/( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) / (a²)

Wait, wait, no, let me think again. For a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But in a rhombohedral system, with a = b = c, and angles between axes as α, the formula becomes:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Ah, so I think I messed up the formula earlier. The cross terms are 2*(hk + hl + kl) multiplied by cos α, and subtracted.

So in the case of (111), the denominator becomes:

1 + 1 +1 - 2(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) cos 30°

Which is 3 - 2*(3)* (√3/2 )

Simplify:

3 - 3 *√3.

Wait, 2*(3) is 6, multiplied by cos30 which is √3/2. So 6*(√3/2) is 3√3.

So denominator is 3 - 3√3.

But √3 is approximately 1.732, so 3√3 ≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196 = -2.196. Oh wait, that's negative again. That can't be right because you can't have a negative under the square root.

Hmm, wait, this can't be possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another source: The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system when a = b = c is indeed d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But in this case, with α = 30°, and h=k=l=1, that gives:

3 - 2*(3) * (√3/2) = 3 - 3√3 ≈ 3 -5.196 ≈-2.196

Which is negative. That suggests that the (111) planes don't exist in a rhombohedral system with α=30°, which doesn't make sense. But wait, in reality, rhombohedral systems can have such planes, so perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the formula. Another possible formula for d in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (1 + cos α ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the structure factor approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for a rhombohedral crystal is:

d² = (a²) / [ h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ]

But in our case, α = β = γ =30°, and a =10.

So for (111), the denominator is:

1 +1 +1 - 2*1*1*cos30 - 2*1*1*cos30 - 2*1*1*cos30.

So that's 3 - 6 * (√3/2 )= 3 -3√3 ≈3-5.196≈-2.196

Again, same problem. Negative inside the square root.

Wait, maybe I have the angles wrong. Perhaps the angles are not between a and b, etc. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, but perhaps in the formula they are the angles between the axes, so when you're applying the formula, the angles are set correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in a rhombohedral structure with all angles less than 60°, the (111) planes are too close or something else. But I think the main issue is that the denominator is negative, which suggests that perhaps no such planes exist, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula from a reliable source.

Wait, according to my notes, the general formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system when a=b=c is:

d^2 = 1/( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/a^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α / a^2 )

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But in our case, this gives a negative value, which is impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the formula uses the angles in a different way, maybe between the reciprocal lattice vectors? Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 180 - 30 = 150 degrees. Because sometimes in crystallography, the angles are measured as the angles in the lattice, but sometimes the supplementary angles are used.

Wait, if the angles are 30 degrees, but in the formula they're supposed to be 180-30=150 degrees, then cos(150) is -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

So let's try substituting cos α = cos 150°, which is -√3/2.

So denominator becomes:

3 - 2*(3) * (-√3/2 )

Which is 3 - ( -3√3 )

So 3 +3√3 ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So the square root of 8.196 is about 2.864.

So d = 10 / 2.864 ≈3.49 Angstroms? But that's not matching any of the options given.

The options are all around 9 Angstroms. So that's not right.

Wait, this suggests that perhaps the formula should use the angle 60 degrees, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I've got the formula wrong. Let me think of another approach.

Another approach: The interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - hk (1 + cos α) - hl (1 + cos β) - kl (1 + cos γ) )

Wait, I'm not sure about this. It's getting a bit messy.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d² = (a²) / [ (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) (1 + cos α) ]

In that case, for (111), h=k=l=1.

So denominator is 3 - (3) * (1 + cos30° )

cos30≈0.866, so 1 +0.866=1.866.

So denominator is 3 -3 *1.866 = 3 -5.598≈-2.598.

Again negative. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d² = a² / [ (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) ( 1 - cos α ) ]

Wait, trying that.

Denominator for (111) would be 3 -3*(1 - 0.866) = 3 -3*(0.134)=3 -0.402=2.598.

So sqrt(2.598) is about 1.61, so d=10/1.61≈6.21 Angstroms. Still not matching the options.

Wait, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I should think differently.

Perhaps I should use the volume approach. The volume of the unit cell is a^3 / (6 √2 ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the volume formula for a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos α + cos² α ), or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that in a rhombohedral system with a = b = c and angles α, the volume V is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos α + 3 cos² α/2 ).

But I'm not sure how that helps with the interplanar distance.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance can also be found using the relation:

d = |F| / (h² +k² + l² + ... )

Wait, no, that's the structure factor. Not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the following formula for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system:

d = a / sqrt( (1 +1 +1) - 2(1 +1 +1) cos α )

Wait, that's similar to what I did before.

So d =10 / sqrt(3 -6 cos30 )

But cos30 is ~0.866, so 3-6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196.

Negative again. So that's impossible. So perhaps this (111) reflection doesn't exist, but the problem states that it does, so I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using the cosines as negative values because the angles are 180-30=150 degrees. So let's recalculate with cos(150°)= -√3/2.

So denominator becomes:

3 -6*( -√3/2 )=3 +3√3≈3 +5.196≈8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= ~2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are all around 9 Angstroms, so this can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is the unit cell. Maybe the interatomic distance is not the same as 'a'. Because in a rhombohedral structure with angles not 90 degrees, the interatomic distance might not be the same as 'a' if it's not a simple cubic structure.

Wait, the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', so in that case, a=10.

But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is different. Or perhaps it's an atomic radius, but that complicates things.

Wait, maybe I should think of the rhombohedral structure as a distortion of the cubic. Let's consider that when a = 10 Angstrom.

Wait, but even if I proceed with that, the calculation gives a negative denominator, which is impossible. So perhaps the given problem has some error, but more likely, I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I've got the formula wrong. Let me look it up.

Okay, after some thinking, I recall that the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system when a=b=c is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

So, for (111):

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cos α )

Given α=30°, cos30=√3/2≈0.866.

So denominator is sqrt(3 -6*(0.866)) = sqrt(3 -5.196) = sqrt(-2.196).

Wait, that's impossible. So that suggests that the (111) planes are not possible in this crystal structure, but the question says they are, which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the reciprocal lattice formula. Or perhaps the angles are measured differently.

Wait, I think the confusion is arising because in some sources, the formula uses 180-α as the angle, especially when α is the angle between the lattice vectors in the unit cell.

So if α is 30°, but in the formula it's 180-30=150°, cos(150)= -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

So the denominator becomes:

3 -6*(-0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= ~2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But again, this doesn't match any of the options. The options are all around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps instead of (111), the question is referring to a different plane. But the question clearly states (111).

Another approach: Maybe the formula I'm using is for a hexagonal system, not rhombohedral. No, I think rhombohedral uses that formula.

Wait, perhaps the lattice is face-centered or body-centered, so a is different. But the problem says 'interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom', which suggests it's a simple cubic structure, but in a rhombohedral form.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is for cubic systems, but adjusted for rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The volume of the unit cell for a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos α + 3 cos² α )

So a=10, α=30°.

So cos α = √3/2 ≈0.866, cos^2 α=0.75.

So volume V= 10^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(0.866) +3*(0.75) )

Compute inside the square root:

1 -2.598 +2.25= (1 +2.25) -2.598=3.25-2.598=0.652.

So V=1000 * sqrt(0.652)=1000 * ~0.807=807.05 Angstrom^3.

But I'm not sure how that helps me find the interplanar distance.

Wait, the Miller indices (111) correspond to the plane's intercepts. The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes.

Another thought: Perhaps the interplanar distance is a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) )^{-1/2} when angles are 90°, but since the angles are 30°, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should find the reciprocal of the plane's normal vector. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the rhombohedral lattice as a cube that has been stretched or skewed.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d_{hkl} can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( [ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ) / (a^2) ] - 2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α ) / (a^2) )

Which simplifies to:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos γ - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos α )

Given that in this case, a=10, and α=β=γ=30°, and h=k=l=1.

So denominator is 3 - 6 cos30°.

Wait, that's the same as before, leading to a negative value.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula for rhombohedral is different. Let me think again.

Upon some reflection, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Because the system is cubic in a, b, c. So substituting:

3 - 2*(3)* (√3/2 ) = 3 - 3√3 ≈3-5.196≈-2.196.

Negative again. So that's impossible.

Wait, but if the angles are 150°, cos(150)= -√3/2.

So substituting cos α = -√3/2, denominator is:

3 - 6*(-√3/2 )=3 +3√3≈3+5.196=8.196.

So denominator sqrt(8.196)= ~2.864.

d=10/2.864≈3.49 Angstrom.

But again, the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way the angles are defined. Maybe the formula uses something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the plane's normal vector approach. The unit cell vectors are a, b, c with angles between them. The plane (111) has a normal vector n = a + b + c.

The interplanar distance is the magnitude of the projection of the vector from one lattice point to the next along the normal direction, divided by the magnitude of n.

Wait, but that's complicated. Let me think.

The formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = | (a × b) · c | / ( |a × b| |c| cos θ )

Wait, perhaps not. Another approach: The reciprocal lattice vectors are used to find the d-spacing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of reciprocal vectors. The reciprocal vectors are given by:

b1 = ( (2π/a) ) (sin γ sin β ... )

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should find a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between the interplanar distance and the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V is a^3 / (6√2) for a cubic close-packed structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another formula I found: For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar spacing is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - hk (1 + cos α) - hl (1 + cos β) - kl (1 + cos γ) )

So substituting, for (111):

d = 10 / sqrt(3 -3*(1 +√3/2 ) )

Because each of the hk, hl, kl terms is 1, and each cos is √3/2.

So denominator term inside sqrt:

3 -3*(1 + √3/2 ) =3 -3*( (2 +√3)/2 )=3 - [ (6 +3√3)/2 ]

= (6/2 - (6 +3√3)/2 )= (6 -6 -3√3)/2 = (-3√3)/2.

So sqrt of a negative number again. Hmm.

This suggests that perhaps the given (111) plane doesn't exist, but the problem says it does, so I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the correct formula for rhombohedral is:

d^2 = (a^2) / [ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ) - (hk + hl + kl) (2 - 2 cos α ) ]

Let me try that.

Denominator for (111) is 3 - 3*(2 - 2*(√3/2 )) =3 -3*(2 -√3 )

=3 -6 +3√3 = (-3) +3√3 ≈ -3 +5.196≈2.196.

So sqrt(2.196)= ~1.482.

d=10 /1.482≈6.74 Angstrom.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d^2 = (a^2) / [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 ) - 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos α ) ]

So substituting:

Denominator= 3 - 2*3*(1 - 0.866) =3 -6*(0.134)=3 -0.804=2.196.

Same as before, sqrt=1.482, d≈6.74.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should compute the reciprocal:

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2)/a^2 - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma)/(a^2) )

Which is same as:

d= a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 - 2(hk cos α + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

Which brings me back to the initial problem. With α=30°, the denominator is 3-6*(√3/2 )=3-3√3≈-2.196.

Which is impossible.

Hmm. Another thought: Perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms in the crystal. In a rhombohedral structure, this might not be the same as 'a' because of the angles.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', but in a rhombohedral structure, especially with angles less than 90°, the distance between adjacent atoms could be different.

Wait, perhaps the 'a' in the formula is not the same as the interatomic distance. For example, in a face-centered cubic (which is a special case of cubic), the interatomic distance is a√2/2, but that's a cubic case.

Alternatively, perhaps in the rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance is a*sqrt( something ), considering the angles.

Wait, but the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in this case, 'a' is not 10 Angstrom. Wait, no, because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', so a=10.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed with a=10 and plug into the formula, even if it gives a negative denominator.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me compute the denominator again.

Denominator = h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ

With h=k=l=1, α=β=gamma=30°.

So,

=1 +1 +1 - 2*(1)(1) cos30 -2*(1)(1) cos30 -2*(1)(1) cos30.

=3 -6 * (√3/2 )

=3 -3√3.

√3≈1.732, so 3√3≈5.196.

Thus,

denominator =3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative, so d would be imaginary, which isn't possible. Hence, the (111) plane doesn't exist in this structure? But the problem asks for it, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as the Miller indices in a different way. Or perhaps, the angles are in a different configuration.

Wait, maybe the formula is inverted. Maybe the denominator is the sum of squares minus the cross terms multiplied by 2 cos(180 - alpha), which would be 2 cos (150°) = 2*(-√3/2) = -√3.

So denominator becomes:

3 - 6*(-√3/2 )=3 +3√3 ≈3+5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= ~2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But again, not matching any options.

Wait, the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think.

Another possibility: Perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos gamma )

But that would be adding the cross terms, which would be different.

For (111):

denominator =3 +6*(√3/2 )=3 +3√3≈8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the supplementary angle, so cos(180-30)=cos150=-√3/2.

So denominator becomes 3 -6*(-√3/2 )=3+3√3≈8.196.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a sqrt( )) / something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using vectors.

The interplanar distance can be found by considering the vectors. The plane (111) has normal vector n = a + b + c.

The distance between two adjacent planes is the distance between two points along the normal direction, divided by the magnitude of n.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the vectors a, b, c have different relations. Let me define the vectors.

Let me represent the vectors as:

a = [a, 0, 0]

b = [b_x, b_y, 0 ]

c = [c_x, c_y, c_z ]

But perhaps it's easier to work with the reciprocal vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the dot product.

The distance between two points in the (111) plane is given by the formula:

d = | (a × b) · c | / ( |a × b| |c| cos θ )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the unit cell vectors as:

a = [10, 0, 0]

b = [10 cos 30, 10 sin 30, 0 ]

c = [10 cos 30, (10 sin 30) cos 30, 10 sin 30 sin 30 ]

So, compute the vectors:

cos30=√3/2≈0.866, sin30=0.5.

So,

a = [10, 0, 0]

b = [10*0.866, 10*0.5, 0 ] = [8.66,5,0]

c = [10*0.866, (10*0.5)*0.866, (10*0.5)*0.5 ]

=> c = [8.66,4.33,2.5]

Now, the (111) plane has the normal vector n = a + b + c.

n = [10 +8.66 +8.66, 0 +5 +4.33, 0 +0 +2.5 ]

Wait, no, a is [10,0,0], b is [8.66,5,0], c is [8.66,4.33,2.5].

So n = a + b + c = [10 +8.66 +8.66, 0 +5 +4.33, 0 +0 +2.5 ]

Compute each component:

x: 10 +8.66 +8.66 =27.32

y: 0 +5 +4.33=9.33

z: 0 + 0 +2.5=2.5

So n = [27.32,9.33,2.5 ]

The magnitude of n is sqrt(27.32^2 +9.33^2 +2.5^2 )

Compute each term:

27.32^2 ≈746.27

9.33^2≈87.05

2.5^2=6.25

Total≈746.27 +87.05 +6.25= 840.57.

sqrt(840.57)=~29.0.

So |n|=29.

The plane equation is n·r = d, where r is any point on the plane. The distance between two adjacent planes (i.e., interplanar distance) is the spacing between planes, which is |d'| / |n|, where d' is the intercept.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The interplanar distance can be found as | (a + b + c) · (a + b + c) |^(1/2) divided by something.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is (1/|n|), but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should look for an alternative formula.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d for the (hkl) plane in a rhombohedral system is given by:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos gamma)/(a²)

Which is the same as:

d² = 1/( [h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos gamma ] / a² )

So,

d= a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos gamma )

Which brings me back to the same formula as before, leading to a negative denominator.

So perhaps, given all that, the problem is designed with a different approach. Maybe the interatomic distance is not 'a' but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal, so d = 1 / sqrt(...). But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the volume approach. The volume V of the unit cell is a^3 / (sqrt(1 - 3 cos α + 3 cos^2 α )) )

For a=10, α=30°, cos α=√3/2.

So,

V = 10^3 / sqrt(1 -3*(√3/2 ) +3*(3/4) )

Compute denominator inside sqrt:

1 - (3√3)/2 + 9/4.

Convert to fractions with denominator 4:

4/4 - (3√3 *2)/4 +9/4 = [4 - 6√3 +9 ] /4 = (13 -6√3)/4.

So,

V=1000 / sqrt( (13 -6√3)/4 ) =1000 / [ sqrt(13-6√3)/2 ] = 2000 / sqrt(13 -6√3 )

Compute sqrt(13 -6√3):

√3≈1.732, 6√3≈10.392.

13 -10.392 ≈2.608.

sqrt(2.608)= ~1.615.

So V≈2000 /1.615 ≈1239. Angstrom^3.

But I'm not sure how this helps find the interplanar distance.

Wait, the interplanar distance can be found using the relation:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl
