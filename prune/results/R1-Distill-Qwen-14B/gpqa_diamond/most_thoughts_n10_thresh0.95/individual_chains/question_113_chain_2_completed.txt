--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that an unknown compound was prepared, and they've done some characterization using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to determine the chemical formula from the given options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Let me break down each piece of information one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak in that region usually indicates O-H stretching. Broad because it's not a single, sharp peak—like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, if it's a very broad peak, could it be a carboxylic acid? Because those O-H stretches are really broad.

Then, there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. The 1700 is a strong peak, which I think corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, so maybe that's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester? Or perhaps an amide? Wait, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not amide. So maybe an ester or a ketone with some conjugation.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond somewhere. So maybe an alkene is present.

Then, the mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I need to think about what fragments give that. Common fragments with m/z 45 include maybe a ketene ion (like from acetone?), but wait, 45 is also the molecular ion for methyl isocyanate, but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, some fragment like CH3CO+ (which is 43?), wait no, 43 is CH2=CH+? Or maybe the fragment is a CH3CH2O+ group? Wait, 45 could also be the CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) ion—no, wait, molecular weight of acetaldehyde is 44. Hmmm.

Wait, the molecular ion at m/z=45 could be the fragment from the compound. Let me think of possible fragments. If the compound has a carbonyl group, maybe the loss of a part of the molecule would leave a fragment. For example, in esters, sometimes the ester group can break down, like losing the R-O- part to leave the acylium ion.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is something like an ester with an ethylene group. Let me think about possible structures. Since the options are all six carbons, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but I'm not sure.

Let me try to think of the options. The options are all C6H something O or O2.

Let me list the degrees of unsaturation for each option, because that might help.

Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

Option A: C6H12O2. So C=6, H=12.

Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees: (14-10)/2= 2. So two degrees: maybe a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. (2*6+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. (14-12)/2=1. So one degree.

So the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. So either alcohol, carboxylic acid, maybe an ester (but the ester's O-H is usually not that broad as in the acid). Wait, esters don't have O-H; that would be an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the broad peak is O-H, maybe it's an alcohol. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have a very broad O-H. But if it's an ester, I don't think it has an O-H. So maybe it's either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

But wait, the FTIR also shows peaks at 1700 and 1650. A carboxylic acid has a broad O-H around 2500-3300 cm^-1, but the peak here is at 3000. Also, a carboxylic acid has a strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1 for the carbonyl. So perhaps that's consistent.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So the molecule has both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Wait, the 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl. The 1650 might be an adjacent group, maybe a conjugated double bond or another carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl with conjugation, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

So putting this together: possible that the compound is an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. Or maybe an ester with a conjugated double bond.

But wait, the options don't have a formula with two O's and a double bond. Let me check the options again.

Option A: C6H12O2 → possible, for example, methyl cyclopropane something? Not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2 → which would have two degrees of unsaturation. So, perhaps a ring plus a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl.

Wait, let's think about possible structures.

If the compound has a carbonyl and a double bond, then the degrees of unsaturation would account for two (each double bond or ring counts as one). So, the O-H would be another group.

Wait, but the O-H in an alcohol would require an O in the formula. So let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, options B and D have only one O. So if the O-H is present, that implies an O is in the molecule. So for each option with O, let's see.

Option B: C6H10O → so maybe a cyclic ether with a double bond? But O-H would require an alcohol group, so an -OH.

Option D: C6H12O → so perhaps a diol with a double bond? Or an alcohol with a ring.

But wait, the IR has a broad O-H, so the compound is likely to have an -OH group. So the formula must include O.

Looking at the options, all except one have O. So, for example, option B is C6H10O, which could be an aromatic ring but that would explain the vinyl hydrogens.

Wait, but FTIR shows a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So the compound must have a carbonyl group.

So the options with O2 (options A and C) have two oxygen atoms. So perhaps one is from the carbonyl (like a ketone or ester) and the other from the O-H group.

So, if the compound has a carbonyl group (like an ester or ketone) and an -OH group, then the formula would have two O's.

So O is in the formula. So options A and C are O2, which might fit.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a peak at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is often an ester or ketone. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

So, perhaps the compound is something like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, which would have the structure RCO-O-R', with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

In that scenario, the structure would have a conjugated double bond, which would explain the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR. So the 1H NMR would show peaks for the vinyl hydrogens (like around 5-6 ppm), perhaps as a doublet or triplet.

Now, the mass spec fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. If the ester group breaks off, for example, the ester group (like R-O-CO-) could split, leaving a fragment that's perhaps the acyl part. Alternatively, the molecule could lose a part of the chain.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2CH2COO..., but perhaps in the case of an ester, the fragment could be the acylium ion.

Wait, the acylium ion has a formula of R-CO+ which would have a mass of (R's mass + 26). Wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, the fragment could be CH3CO+ (which is 43), but that's not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is from an ethyl group plus something. Let me think. Another approach is to calculate the molecular weight of each option and see what the possible fragments could be.

Wait, the molecular formulas are:

A) C6H12O2 → molecular weight is 6*12 +12 +32 = 72 +12 +32=116.

But wait, wait, molecular weight of C6H12O2 is (6×12)+(12×1)+(2×16) =72+12+32=116.

Similarly, option C is C6H10O2 → (6×12)+(10×1)+(2×16)=72+10+32=114.

So the molecular weight is either 116 or 114, depending on the option.

Wait, if the molecular ion is at 114 or 116, but the fragment is at 45, which is much lower. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from the loss of a larger group. Let me think about what could lose a group to leave a fragment of 45.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from a smaller part of the molecule. For example, a methyl group attached to something else.

Wait, another approach: the m/z=45 is a common fragment. Let's think about the possible structures that would produce a fragment of 45.

45 is the molecular weight of CH3CHO (acetaldehyde, 44?), wait: CH3CHO is C2H4O. Let's calculate: C=12×2=24, H=4, O=16. 24+4+16=44. So that's 44, so perhaps that's not it.

Hmm, m/z=45 could be a fragment that includes a CH2 group. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O fragment, but that's 30. Alternatively, maybe a COOCH2 group? Not sure.

Wait, another common fragment is the toluene (C7H8) ion, but that's bigger. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH2)2O, but that's 44.

Wait, perhaps it's the loss of a larger group, like an ethyl group (C2H5, which is 29), leaving a fragment with a higher mass? Hmm, not directly helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a carbonyl group. For example, a ketone group (CO) would have a mass of 28, but that doesn't help.

Wait, another approach: maybe the fragment is from the breaking of an ester group. Let's think about an ester like R-O-CO-R'. If the molecule breaks at the ester oxygen, perhaps you get a fragment that's R-O- and another that's CO-R'. The R-O- part could have a certain mass, but the CO-R' part would be higher.

Wait, perhaps the other way around: the ester group could break after the carbonyl, so you get a CO-O-R' fragment and an R group. If R is CH2CH2 or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a lactone, a cyclic ester. So the molecule could break at the ester linkage, releasing a fragment.

Wait, another thought: the mass 45. Let's think about possible functional groups. 45 is the mass of (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. The molecular weight of acetone is 58 (C3H6O), so that doesn't fit. Wait, no, wait: the molecular ion would be higher, but perhaps a fragment could be (CH3)2C=O+.

Wait, molecular weight of (CH3)2C=O is 58, so that's not 45.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, like CH3CO+. Wait, that's 43. Because (12*2 + 1*4 +16) =24+4+16=44? Wait, wait, CH3CO+ would be (CH3)2C=O+, right? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, CH3CO+ would be C2H3O+ which is 43 (12*2 +3 +16=24+3+16=43). So m/z=43, not 45. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's the fragment CH2CH2O, but that's 44. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of a propyl group or something. Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula must be one of the options. Let's think about each option and see what structures are possible, then see which would match the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So this could be a ring plus a double bond or one ring and one double bond, but wait, 1 degree is either a ring or a double bond. So perhaps a six-membered ring with an ester group or something.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 2. Could be two double bonds, a ring and a double bond, or two rings.

Given that the FTIR shows a conjugated carbonyl (1700 and 1650), perhaps the structure has a double bond conjugated to the carbonyl, which would account for the 1650 peak. So maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

Let me think about the structure for option C: C6H10O2. If it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, the structure might be something like CH2=CHCO-O-R, but wait, the carbons would add up. Let me count: for CH2=CHCO-O-R, R is probably a two-carbon group to make six carbons in total. So, CH2=CHCO-O-CH2CH2? Wait, that would be 5 carbons for the acid part and one for the ester, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic structure like a cyclic ester (lactone), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec. The fragment at 45 suggests loss of a larger group. Let's think of the molecular formula as C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 6*12 +10 + 32=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be at m/z=114. Now, if the molecule breaks down, perhaps by losing a fragment of, say, 114-45=69. So the molecule could split into two parts, one being 45 and the other 69. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around.

Alternatively, maybe it's the cleavage of a bond that produces a fragment of 45. For example, if the molecule is an ester, perhaps the ester group breaks, producing an acylium ion. For example, if the ester is R-O-CO-R', then upon cleavage, it could form R-O- and CO-R' as fragments. The CO-R' part would have a molecular weight of CO plus R', but that might add up to more than 45.

Wait, considering the molecular formula for option C: C6H10O2. Let's think of a possible structure with an ester group and a conjugated double bond.

Suppose the structure is something like CH2=CHCO-O-R, where R is CH2CH2 (but that would make 3 carbons from the acid and 2 from R, totaling 5. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe R is CH2CH3, making the acid part CH2=CHCOO and R as CH2CH3, so the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Let's count the carbons: 3 in acid (CH2=CHCOO), 2 in ester (CH2CH3)—wait, that's 5 carbons total. But the formula is C6, so maybe another carbon somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2, but that's 3 (from CH2CH2COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) = 5 again. Not enough. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester. For a six-carbon compound, a cyclic ester would have five carbons in the ring plus the ester oxygen. Wait, no, cyclic esters (lactones) have the ester functional group within a ring. For example, a five-membered ring would have four carbons in the chain. Let's see: for a six-membered ring, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentene with an ester group. Hmm, not sure.

Another approach: the IR shows a broad O-H peak, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then the 1700 peak would be the carboxylic acid carbonyl. But in that case, the compound would have a carboxylic acid group and perhaps a double bond elsewhere.

So, if it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would have one O from the -COOH group. But wait, the options with O2 are A and C, so if the compound is a carboxylic acid, it would require another O, maybe from an ester or something else. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, another thought: the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl. So maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So the structure would have a double bond next to the ester carbonyl.

In that case, the ester would be like CH2=CHCOO-R. For C6H10O2, let's see: the acid part is CH2=CHCOO- (3 carbons), and R is CH2CH2 (but that would make 5 carbons total, so perhaps not). Alternatively, R could be CH2CH3, making a 5-carbon molecule, but the formula is C6. Hmm.

Wait, maybe R is CH2CH2O, but that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a five-membered ring with an ester and a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like methyl vinyl ester, but with a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps it's a six-carbon molecule with a conjugated double bond and an ester group. Let's see, for option C: C6H10O2.

The structure could be an ester where the acid part has a conjugated double bond. For example, the acid part could be pentenoic acid, and the ester is formed with methanol, but that would add another O. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ester, like a five-membered ring with a double bond adjacent to the ester.

But perhaps I'm getting too stuck on the structure. Let me think about the mass spec again.

The fragment at m/z=45. Let me think: 45 corresponds to what? Let's calculate possible groups. For example, if the fragment is (CH2)2O, that's 44 (12*2 +2*2 +16=24+4+16=44). Close to 45 but not exactly. Or maybe (CH3)2O, which is 31.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a ketene ion (O=C=O), but that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3 group attached to something else.

Wait, 45 could be the mass of a CH2CH2O group. No, that's 44. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from an acylium ion, like (CH2)2CO+, which would be (24 +12 +16) =52. No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a butyraldehyde (CH3CH2CH2CHO) ion, but that's molecular weight 72, which is higher than 45.

Hmm, maybe it's a CH2=CH-O- group. Wait, that's 44 (12*2 + 4 +16=24+4+16=44). Still not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group with some oxygen. CH3-O- would have a mass of 31 (12 + 16 + 1=29? No, wait CH3O is 12*3 +16 +1 =36+16+1=53? No, that's not right. Wait, methyl group (CH3) is 15, O is 16, so CH3-O- would be 31 (15 +16=31).

Wait, perhaps the fragment is CH2O, which is formaldehyde. That's 30. No.

Alternatively, maybe a COCH2 group. COCH2 would be 43 (12+16 +12 +2=42? Wait, maybe I'm not getting this right.

Wait, let's think differently. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and the mass is 114, then a fragment of 45 would mean the other part is 114-45=69. So what's 69? 69 could be a fragment like C4H9O or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule loses a larger group, such as a propyl group (C3H7, which is 57), leaving 114-57=57. Hmm, but that's not 45.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fragment is a result of a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in mass spectrometry of ketones or esters. The McLafferty rearrangement can produce a fragment at m/z=45 for certain structures.

Wait, the McLafferty rearrangement typically occurs in ketones with an allyl group. The rearrangement leads to the formation of a gamma,delta-unsaturated ketene, which can break into fragments. The fragment would have a CH2 group attached to the carbonyl, so maybe that's where the 45 comes from.

Wait, for example, if the structure is a ketone with an adjacent double bond, like CH2=C(CH2)CO something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's think of a specific example. If the molecule is something like hex-3-en-2-one (but that would have the structure CH2=C(H)COCH2CH2CH3), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's get back to the options. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. Based on the IR, which shows a broad O-H (probably an alcohol or carboxylic acid), and a conjugated carbonyl.

If the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would have two O's (from -COOH), so O2. So that would be options A or C.

But wait, carboxylic acids have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm^-1, which is very broad. The FTIR in the question shows a peak at 3000 cm^-1, which could fit.

Now, considering the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are in a double bond. So the compound has both a carboxylic acid group and a double bond.

So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOOH (but that's only three carbons; we need six). So perhaps a longer chain, like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. But then the formula would be C6H10O2.

Wait, let me check: CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH.

The formula would be C6H10O2. Because:

CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH → 6 carbons.

Hydrogens: each CH2 has 2 H, each CH has 1. Let's count:

The structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH.

Breaking it down:

CH2=CH-: 4 H (each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond reduces the H count. Wait, no: for CH2=CH-, each has one H. So CH2=CH- has 2 H's.

Then each CH2 group has 2 H's. So:

CH2=CH- (2 H), CH2 (2 H), CH2 (2 H), and COOH has an H on the OH. Wait, but the COOH is at the end. Let me count:

The structure: 

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH.

So:

CH2=CH- has 2 H's (each CH2 and CH).

Wait, no: CH2=CH-: the first CH2 has 2 H, the CH (in CH2=CH-) has 1 H.

So CH2=CH- has 3 H's.

Then CH2 (after that): 2 H.

Then another CH2: 2 H.

Then COOH: which is -COOH, so the H on the OH is part of the O-H, but that's separate from the aliphatic H's.

Wait, but the NMR would show the vinyl H's (the CH2=CH- part), which are split into a triplet or another pattern depending on neighboring groups.

So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2.

Does this structure match the options? Option C is C6H10O2.

But wait, let's check the molecular formula. CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH:

Carbon: 6 (correct).

Hydrogen: CH2=CH- (3 H) + CH2 (2 H) + CH2 (2 H) + COOH (2 H in COOH, but wait, the COOH has H only on the OH and the adjacent H from the CH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the H count wrong. Let me think again.

The structure:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH.

Each CH2 group:

- CH2=CH-: the CH2 has 2 H, the CH (in CH2=CH-) has 1 H.

Wait, no: CH2=CH- is CH2-CH2 double bond. Each CH2 in a double bond has two Hs. Wait, no, no. Wait, CH2=CH- is an ethylene group: each CH2 in the double bond has one H each. So the structure is CH2=CH- ... So each double-bonded CH has one H.

So CH2=CH- has 2 H (each on the CH2 and CH).

Then, each CH2 group:

After that, the CH2-CH2-COOH:

Each CH2 has 2 H.

So:

- CH2=CH- : 2 H.

- CH2: 2 H.

- CH2: 2 H.

- COOH: the H is on the COOH, but the aliphatic chain ends with CH2-COOH, so that CH2 would have 2 H.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it:

The structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH.

So:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH.

So, each CH2 in the chain:

1. CH2=CH-: the first CH2 has 2 H, the second (double bond) has 1 H.

Wait, no, in CH2=CH-, the first CH2 is CH2 and the next is CH, each with 2 and 1 H, respectively. So total for CH2=CH- is 3 H.

Then, each CH2 group:

- The next CH2 (third C): 2 H.

- The next CH2 (fourth C): 2 H.

- The fifth C is the COOH, which is a -COOH group attached to the fourth CH2.

So, the fifth C is COOH, which is attached to the fourth CH2 as CH2-COOH.

The COOH group has an H on the -OH.

So for the aliphatic H's (excluding the OH in COOH):

CH2=CH-: 3 H.

Each CH2 after that: 2 H each.

So:

3 (CH2=CH-) + 2 (third C) + 2 (fourth C) + 2 (fifth C CH2) → 3+2+2+2=9 H.

Plus the OH H in COOH, making 10 H in total.

So the formula is C6H10O2, which matches option C.

Now, let's check the mass spec. If the molecule is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH, what fragment would give m/z=45?

Well, when the molecule breaks, perhaps it loses the COOH group as a fragment. Wait, but COOH is 46 (12+16*2 +1=45? Wait, molecular formula of COOH is CHO2, which is 45 (12 +16*2 +1= 45?), wait: COOH is -COOH, which is C=O-OH. Wait, the molecular formula for COOH as a group is C1H2O2, which would have a mass of 45 (12 + 2 + 32=46? Wait, 12 + (2*1) + (16*2)=12+2+32=46. Hmm, but the fragment is at 45, not 46.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the loss of the COOH group, leaving a CH2=CHCH2CH2 group, which would have a molecular weight of (4*12) + (8*1) =48 +8=56. That doesn't match 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks in another way. For example, the McLafferty rearrangement in ketones can produce a fragment. In our case, though, the compound is a carboxylic acid, not a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be from the cleavage of the C-O bond in the ester, but wait, this is a carboxylic acid, not an ester.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I need to think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the loss of a propyl group (C3H7, which is 57) from C6H10O2 (114), leaving 114-57=57. Not 45. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula of the fragment. For a fragment of m/z=45, the possible formula could be C3H7O. Because 3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=59. No, that's 59. Alternatively, C2H5O: 24 +5 +16=45. Yes! C2H5O would have a molecular weight of 2*12 +5*1 +16=24+5+16=45.

So a fragment with the formula C2H5O would have m/z=45.

What structures give a C2H5O fragment?

Perhaps a vinyl group attached to an oxygen. Wait, C2H5O could be CH2CH2O, but that's more like C2H4O (44). Hmmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is CH2CH2O+ (which is 44). No, that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's CH3CHO (acetaldehyde), which is C2H4O. Molecular weight is 44, but the peak is at 45. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is CH2=CHO+ (which is 45). Because CH2=CHO+ would be C2H3O+, which is 12*2 +3 +16=24+3+16=43. Wait, that's 43, not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-OH+? That would be C2H4O+ which is 44. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's a different structure. Let me think about the possible cleavage points.

In the case of a carboxylic acid, perhaps the molecule breaks at the ester linkage, but this is a carboxylic acid, not an ester.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks near the double bond. For example, cleavage between the double bond and the rest of the molecule. But I'm not sure how that would leave a C2H5O fragment.

Wait, if the molecule is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH, perhaps it breaks after the double bond, leaving CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH → CH2=CHCH2CH2-COOH. If it breaks between the CH2 and COOH, the fragment would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- and COOH. The COOH is 45 (as discussed earlier), but wait, COOH is 45? No, COOH is (COOH's formula is CHO2, which is 45 (12 + 16*2 +1=45? Wait, 12 for C, 2 O's (16*2=32), and one H. So 12+32+1=45. So the fragment would be COOH, which is m/z=45. Oh! That makes sense.

So if the molecule breaks off the COOH group, the COOH would have a mass of 45. So the fragment at m/z=45 is the COOH group. But wait, in the COOH group, the H is attached. So the mass would be 45.

So that fits: the fragment is the COOH group.

So putting this all together.

The FTIR shows O-H (broad peak), so it's a carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1700 (carbonyl of COOH) and 1650 (maybe conjugated double bond). The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the molecule has a double bond. The mass spec shows a fragment at 45, which is the COOH group.

The formula that matches this is C6H10O2, which is option C.


The unknown compound was characterized using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid. Additional strong peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system, such as an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR spectrum indicates the presence of vinyl hydrogens, confirming the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrometry data shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which corresponds to the molecular weight of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **C₆H₁₂O₂**: This formula has one degree of unsaturation. A carboxylic acid group would account for the O-H and C=O peaks, but the absence of a double bond makes it inconsistent with the vinyl hydrogens observed in the NMR spectrum.

2. **C₆H₁₀O**: This formula has two degrees of unsaturation. While it could include a carboxylic acid group, it lacks the second oxygen required for the carbonyl group, making it inconsistent with the IR data.

3. **C₆H₁₀O₂**: This formula has two degrees of unsaturation. It can accommodate both a carboxylic acid group (explaining the broad O-H peak and the C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹) and a conjugated double bond (explaining the peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR spectrum). The fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponds to the -COOH group, which aligns with this formula.

4. **C₆H₁₂O**: This formula has one degree of unsaturation. Similar to C₆H₁₂O₂, it could include a carboxylic acid group but lacks the second oxygen for the carbonyl group, making it inconsistent with the IR data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it explains all the spectral data: the broad O-H peak, the carbonyl peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, the conjugated system indicated by the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak, the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR spectrum, and the fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponding to the -COOH group.
