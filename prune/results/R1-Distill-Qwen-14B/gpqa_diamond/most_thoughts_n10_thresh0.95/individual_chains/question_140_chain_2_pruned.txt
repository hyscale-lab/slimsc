Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it. We have to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, I'll try to identify what each substance might be.

The reaction of X with Y produces a gas W. Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. One that comes to mind is CO2, but wait, CO2 has 22 neutrons (C is 12, O is 16 each; C has 6 protons, each O has 8, so total protons 6+8*2=22. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 16 (each O has 8 neutrons, so 2*8=16) → total neutrons 22. Oh wait, that's same as protons. So W could be CO2. Alternatively, maybe H2O? H2O has 2 H (1 proton each) and one O (8). So total protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: O has 8, H has 1 each. So 8 +2 =10. So H2O could also fit. Wait, but W is a gas released, so CO2 is a gas, H2O is a liquid at room temp. So maybe W is CO2.

But wait, another thought: another possible gas is H2. H2 has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So protons: 2, neutrons: 0. Not equal. So that's not it. Another gas maybe O2? O2 has 16 each. Protons: 8 *2 =16. Neutrons: 8 *2=16. Oh, yes, that also fits. So O2 is another possibility.

Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule, so each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So in O2, total protons would be 16, neutrons 16. So same count. So gas W could be O2. But then, why would the reaction produce O2? Let's think.

The reaction is between X and Y, a liquid. What if Y is water? Then X reacting with water to produce O2? But that's more about electrolysis, but maybe in some other reaction. Alternatively, if Y is something else, like an acid perhaps.

Wait, but the precipitate G forms. Then when heated, it releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What has a melting point around there? Maybe NaOH? Wait, no, NaOH has a much lower melting point. Or maybe something like ammonium chloride, which decomposes around 340 K. Hmm, perhaps B is sodium hydroxide? Wait, no, sodium hydroxide is solid at room temp, but maybe it's another compound.

Wait, another approach: think about the product of X with a keto acid having two oxygen atoms. Let's see, a keto acid is like something with a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. For example, maybe something like acetone reacts with X. But I think I'm getting off track.

Wait, let's think about X. It's a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, maybe something like THF, but that's a solvent. Wait, another possibility: maybe X is sodium or potassium metal, which reacts with water to produce H2 gas. But if X is Na, then gas W would be H2. Let's check: H2 has protons 2, neutrons 0. Not equal, so that's out.

Wait, but if X is a heavier isotope-containing substance. So perhaps X is something like Li6 or something. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the reaction releasing gas W and forming a precipitate. Maybe it's a double displacement reaction. Like if X is a metal and Y is an acid. For example, Mg reacting with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2 gas. But then W would be H2, which doesn't fit our condition. So that's not right.

Wait, another approach: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If G is something like a carbonate, heating would release CO2 and form something else. But if B is a solid with a melting point near 277 K, what is that? Let me think about the melting points. 277 K is about 4°C. So maybe B is NaOH? Or perhaps it's another compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps W is CO2. So the reaction produces CO2 gas. So X reacts with Y (maybe a carbonate) to produce CO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe W is carbon monoxide, but CO has 14 amu. Let's see, protons: C has 6, O has 8, so 14. Neutrons: C has 6 (if it's C-12), O has 8 (O-16). So 6 +8 =14. So same number. So CO could be W.

Wait, but the reaction between X and Y producing CO would imply a reaction like metal and carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe W is CH4? No, CH4's protons are 6 (C=6? No, wait. C has 6 protons, each H has 1. So 6 + 4*1 =10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 (if C-12), each H has 0. So 6 neutrons. Not equal. So no.

Wait, going back to the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate, which upon heating releases CO2 and forms a metal oxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicarbonate. But if G is a carbonate, heating may not release much. Hmm.

Wait, maybe G is a hydroxide. Like if X is a metal, Y is an acid, producing a salt and water. Then, if the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. But then, when heated, perhaps it decomposes. For example, maybe G is Na2CO3, which upon heating doesn't change much, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if G is a sulfide precipitate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about what B is. B's melting point is near 277 K. That's roughly 4°C. Wait, maybe B is ammonium chloride? No, the melting point is around 340 K. Wait, another thought: maybe B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate melts at a lower temperature. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the precipitate G, upon heating, could release B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. But then, the metal oxide would be B. So if B's melting point is near 4°C, what's a solid with that melting point? Wait, maybe it's not the metal oxide. Alternatively, perhaps G is something else.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate is a hydroxide. For example, if X is NaOH and Y is a salt that reacts to form a precipitate which is a metal hydroxide. But when heated, the hydroxide would decompose. Wait, but heating NaOH wouldn't change much, I think.

Alternatively, maybe G is a sulfide, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the keto acid part. The product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's say X is NaOH. Then, if a keto acid (like something with a ketone and carboxylic acid group) reacts with NaOH, perhaps it's a saponification reaction, producing a carboxylate salt. The product would have more oxygen perhaps. Wait, but the product would have how many oxygens? For example, if the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, reacting with NaOH could produce the sodium salt, which would have more oxygen. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, the product of the reaction contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So maybe the product is something like H2O2, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diethyl ether or something else, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like Li or Na, which when reacts with a keto acid would deprotonate it, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is to figure out what X is. The question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X contains a heavier isotope, perhaps like Cl-35 instead of Cl-35? No, wait, Cl usually has 35 and 37. Or maybe something else, like O-18 instead of O-16.

Wait, but X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its analog. Hmm. Common reagents in organic chemistry include NaOH, KOH, LiAlH4, etc. Wait, but X's analog is used as a reagent. Maybe X is something like NaOH, but with a heavier isotope.

Wait, but the product of a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. Let's say X is NaOH. Then, the product could be the sodium salt of the keto acid. For example, if the keto acid is something like CH3COCH2COOH (succinic acid?), reacting with NaOH would produce a sodium salt. But the product would have more oxygen, not two. Hmm. Maybe I'm not on the right track.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G when heated releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Let's think of substances that melt around that temperature. Water freezes at 273 K (0°C). So 277 K is about 4°C. So maybe B is something that's solid at that temperature but starts to melt. Or perhaps B is a substance with a low melting point, like paraffin or something else. Alternatively, maybe B is a
