Okay, so I've got this question about solar neutrinos and the pp-III branch. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. And we need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So flux band1 over flux band2.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? Oh right, the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch is the initial step where two protons fuse to make deuterium, then helium-3. PP-II and PP-III are other steps, but I think the pp-III branch is the part where two helium-3 nuclei fuse into helium-4, right? So if that stops, it affects the production of certain neutrinos.

Solar neutrinos come mainly from two processes: the PP chain and the CNO cycle. The PP chain produces electron neutrinos, and a significant fraction comes from the decay of beryllium-7 in the so-called pep (proton-electron-proton) branch and the main pp branch. Wait, I think the main neutrino emission in the PP chain comes from two points: the PP-I step and the PP-III step.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The primary neutrinos in the Sun are from the PP chain. The main contribution comes from two processes in the PP cycle: the proton-proton I (pp-I) reaction and the proton-electron-proton (pep) reaction, but I might be mixing terms here. Oh wait, the pep reaction is a separate branch that actually contributes a small fraction of the neutrinos.

Wait, no, I think the main neutrino production in the pp chain is from the decay of beryllium-7, which is created when two protons and a helium-3 nucleus (probably) undergo the pp-I reaction. The Be-7 then absorbs another proton to form Li-7, which then undergoes beta decay to produce He-4 and emits a neutrino. So that's the main source of the 860 keV neutrinos, like the ones detected in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO).

The pp-III branch, on the other hand, I'm a bit less clear about. Oh wait, the pp chain has different branches, like the main pp-I branch (which produces Be-7) and then the pp-II and pp-III branches. The pp-III branch is where two He-3 nuclei (alpha particles) fuse to form He-4, right? So that's an important step in the fusion process.

If the pp-III branch stops, that probably affects the overall fusion rate because that's a crucial part of the chain. But how does that impact the neutrino flux?

Wait, neutrinos are emitted when a boron-8 (maybe?) decays into Be-8, which then emits a neutrino... Or maybe that's the CNO cycle. Alternatively, the main neutrinos come from the decay of Be-7, which comes from the pp-I process. So if the pp-III stops, perhaps the production of Be-7 is affected because the overall fusion process is altered.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the neutrino energies. The question is about neutrinos in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. These are both in the range of the neutrinos produced in the solar core.

Wait, the Be-7 decay produces neutrinos of around 860 keV, correct? So they would fall into the 800-900 keV band, which is band 2. If the pp-III stops, what happens to the production of these neutrinos?

Alternatively, if pp-III is stopped, maybe the production of He-4 is affected, which in turn affects the production of Be-7. Because Be-7 is made in the pp-I reactions, which are dependent on the availability of He-3. If the He-3 isn't being consumed by the pp-III reactions (since they've stopped), maybe the level of He-3 increases, which could affect the pp-I reactions?

Wait, but the pp-I reaction is where two protons collide to form a deuterium nucleus and a positron and a neutrino. So each pp-I reaction emits a neutrino. So the flux from these neutrinos would be in the lower energy range, maybe around 400 keV? Or wait, no. The neutrinos from pp-I are lower energy than those from Be-7 decay.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up the neutrino energies associated with different processes. Oh, but since I can't look it up, I'll try to remember.

The main neutrinos detected from the Sun are from the decay of Be-7, which has a high energy (~860 keV). But there's also the so-called 'pep' neutrinos, which are from the process where a proton captures a positron and a neutrino is emitted. These have lower energies, around 1.4 MeV? No, wait. Wait, maybe the pep neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV? Or perhaps I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, the pp-I neutrinos are lower energy, around 420 keV.

So band 1 is 700-800 keV, and band 2 is 800-900 keV. So band 2 would include the Be-7 neutrinos at ~860 keV. Band 1 is a bit lower, maybe in the range of the pp-I neutrinos.

So the question is, if the pp-III branch stops, how does it affect the production of each of these neutrinos.

If pp-III stops, maybe the production of Be-7 is affected, which would affect the high-energy neutrinos (band 2). Alternatively, if pp-III is part of the chain that produces He-4, stopping it might change the overall fusion rate, but perhaps the lower-energy neutrinos (from pp-I) are produced more or less independently.

Wait, the pp-III process is the fusion of two He-3 nuclei to form He-4. So if that stops, the He-3 can't be consumed as quickly, leading to a higher concentration of He-3 in the plasma. That might affect the rate of the pp-I reactions because He-3 is part of the plasma. Because the pp-I reaction is proton + proton -> deuterium + positron + neutrino, but the presence of He-3 could influence the plasma's properties, such as electron density, which affects the fusion rates.

Wait, but the dominant process in the Sun is the pp chain, with pp-I being the main contributor to neutrinos. So stopping pp-III might affect the overall fusion rate, but perhaps only the higher-energy neutrinos (from Be-7 decay) are affected, because their production is linked to the He-3 availability.

Alternatively, if pp-III stops, the production of He-4 is halted, which would mean that the fusion process can't continue as normal. But how quickly does that affect the production of Be-7?

Wait, the Be-7 is produced in the pp-I reactions. If pp-III is stopped, the He-3 can't fuse into He-4, so the He-3 abundance would increase. But pp-I reactions don't directly depend on He-3, except perhaps in affecting the overall plasma conditions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Be-7 abundance depends on the overall fusion rate. If the fusion stops, the internal pressure changes, but the neutrino production from Be-7 would be reduced.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stopped, but all other reactions remained as they were. So perhaps the production of Be-7 is not affected because the pp-I reactions are still happening. But why would the pp-III stopping affect the neutrino production?

Wait, maybe the neutrinos in band 2 (800-900 keV) are from the Be-7 decay, which is linked to the pp-III branch. Let me think again: the Be-7 is produced in the pp-I branch, right? So if the pp-III stops, the production of He-4 stops, which might affect the overall fusion, but how does that affect Be-7's decay?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III process is a major source of neutrinos in a certain energy range. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to think about the neutrino energies and their sources.

From the pp chain:

- The main neutrinos come from two sources: the pep reaction and the pp-I reaction, plus the decay of Be-7.

Wait, the pep reaction is a different branch. The pep reaction occurs when a proton captures an electron, producing a neutron (which quickly turns into a proton) and emits a neutrino. These pep neutrinos have higher energies, around 1.4 MeV. So they would fall into the higher energy band, say band 2.

Wait, but the band 2 is 800-900 keV, which is 0.8-0.9 MeV. So the pep neutrinos (1.4 MeV) would be in a higher band than either of these. So maybe they wouldn't be in either band.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-I reactions are in the 400 keV range, and the Be-7 decay is around 860 keV.

If that's the case, then band 1 (700-800 keV) would have some pp-I neutrinos, but the main contribution from band 2 (800-900 keV) would be the Be-7 neutrinos.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the Be-7? Since the Be-7 is produced in the pp-I reactions, which are still occurring, perhaps the pp-III stopping doesn't immediately affect Be-7 production.

Wait, but Be-7 is produced in the pp-I branch, but then it undergoes fusion with a proton via the pep reaction to form B-8, which then beta decays to Be-8 and emits a neutrino. Wait, no, I think Be-7 decays with a half-life of about 53 days. So if the production of Be-7 stopped, its abundance would decrease over time, but in this scenario, the pp-I reactions are still happening, so Be-7 is still being produced at the same rate.

But wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped, but other reactions are as before. So the pp-I reactions are still happening, so Be-7 is still being produced. So the flux of neutrinos from Be-7 decay (band 2) should remain the same.

But then, what about the flux in band 1?

Wait, band 1 is 700-800 keV. If the main neutrinos are from the pp-I reactions at around 400 keV, then maybe the 700-800 keV band doesn't have a significant contribution from the pp-I neutrinos. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the energies.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy of the neutrinos from the different reactions.

The pp-I reaction produces a neutrino with energy around 420 keV. So that would fall into band 1 (700-800 keV? No, 420 is lower than 700). So the pp-I neutrinos are in the lower band, perhaps in the 400 keV range, which doesn't fall into band 1 or 2.

The Be-7 decay neutrinos are around 860 keV, so in band 2 (800-900 keV). The pep reaction neutrinos are higher, around 1.4 MeV, which is outside both bands.

So if the pp-III process stops, but the pp-I and pep reactions continue, then the neutrino flux in band 2 (Be-7) should remain the same because Be-7 is still being produced as before.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2.

If the neutrinos in band 1 are from a different process, perhaps the pp-III stopping affects that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question is about the pp-III branch stopping, which may affect the overall fusion rate, but not directly the neutrino production from pp-I or pep.

Wait, but if the pp-III process stops, then the fusion of two He-3 into He-4 is halted. This would increase the concentration of He-3 in the Sun's core. But how does that affect the production of other neutrinos? Well, the pp-I reaction involves two protons, not He-3. So perhaps the production of pp-I neutrinos (420 keV) isn't directly affected.

But the question is about the ratio of flux in 700-800 keV (band1) to 800-900 keV (band2). So if band2 is Be-7 (860 keV), and band1 is another source.

Wait, maybe the 700-800 keV band is from some other neutrino process. What other sources of solar neutrinos are there?

I think the CNO cycle also produces neutrinos, but those are higher energy, around 15-20 MeV, so that's way outside the given bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the decay of boron-8, but I think those are lower energy. Wait, no, B-8 decays into Be-8 and emits a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is around 3.8 MeV, which is also higher than the bands given. So that's not relevant here.

Hmm, so the main source in these bands is Be-7 (860 keV) and the pp-I (420 keV) is lower than 700, so perhaps band1 (700-800) has less contribution. Wait, what about the Electron Capture on Boron-8?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. The pp-III process is He-3 + He-3 -> He-4 + 2 protons. So the fusion of He-3 into He-4.

If this process stops, the concentration of He-3 would increase. The He-3 concentration is part of the plasma, and higher He-3 would affect the fusion rates. But the pp-I process (H + H -> D + e+ + neutrino) doesn't directly depend on He-3, except that a higher He-3 concentration might change the overall density or other conditions, but I think the dominant effect is that the main fusion process is halted.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remained as they were. So perhaps the pp-I and other reactions continue as usual, but the pp-III stops.

Assuming that, the production of Be-7 would continue as before because it's from pp-I. So the flux in band2 (Be-7) would remain the same.

But what about band1? If band1 is 700-800 keV, and the main neutrino sources are at 420 and 860 keV, perhaps there's another source of neutrinos in that range.

Wait, maybe some of the neutrinos from the decay of other isotopes fall into that band. Alternatively, perhaps there's a contribution from the CNO cycle, but I thought that's higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the decay of Beryllium-7 and Boron-8 in the CNO cycle have lower energies. No, I think the CNO neutrinos are higher.

Alternatively, maybe the question is actually about the adiabatic vs. non-adiabatic changes. But no, the question is about the immediate stopping of the pp-III process. So neutrino production would change based on the sources affected.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III process is a major source of the 860 keV neutrinos. No, that's Be-7 decay, which is from the pp-I process.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III process produces its own neutrinos. Wait, when two He-3 nuclei fuse, they produce He-4, and perhaps some neutrinos. Wait, that's possible. I think that in the He-3 + He-3 fusion, a neutron is involved. Wait, the process is:

He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2 protons + energy. Wait, actually, the process is He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2 protons (they're actually He-3 and a neutron?), or wait, the reaction is: 2 He-3 → He-4 + 2 protons + a neutron? No, that's not quite right. Let me think: two He-3 nuclei (each has 2 protons and 1 neutron) fusing would have a total of 4 protons and 2 neutrons. So He-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So the reaction is:

He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2 protons.

Wait, but that would leave 4 protons and 2 neutrons → He-4 (2 protons, 2 neutrons) plus 2 protons. So that's correct.

But does that produce any neutrinos? I'm not sure. Because that's a fusion of two He-3 nuclei, which are charged, so perhaps the process doesn't involve beta decays. So maybe no neutrinos are emitted in the pp-III process.

So if the pp-III process stops, it doesn't directly affect the neutrino flux. So the main neutrino sources (pp-I and Be-7 decay) would continue as before.

Wait, but if the pp-III process is stopped, the fusion process is halted, which would cause the Sun's core to start contracting, increasing the density and temperature, which might increase the fusion rates elsewhere. But the question says all other reactions are as they were. So perhaps the fusion isn't affected beyond the pp-III process stopping.

Alternatively, the question is about the solar neutrino flux. The main neutrino flux comes from the pp-I process (420 keV) and the Be-7 decay (860 keV). So the flux in band1 (700-800) might be between these two. But without any source in that range, perhaps the flux is negligible.

Wait, but that can't be right because the question is giving options, so there must be a way to compute the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino flux in band1 is from the decay of some other isotope that is affected by the pp-III stopping.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the ratio of the fluxes from the two bands, where band1 is the lower one. If the pp-III process stops, perhaps the flux in band2 (which is the higher energy) is reduced, while the flux in band1 (which is from a different process) remains the same. Or vice versa.

But earlier I thought that the Be-7 neutrinos (band2) are still being produced as before because the pp-I reactions are ongoing. So the flux in band2 wouldn't change. What about the flux in band1? If band1 is from a process that is affected by the pp-III stopping, then the ratio could change.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about what the pp-III process affects. If the pp-III stops, then the fusion of He-3 into He-4 is stopped. He-3 can't fuse, so it accumulates. But He-3 is a product of the pp-I process. So perhaps the accumulation of He-3 would cause the pp-I process to slow down, because the concentration of He-3 might affect the reaction rates.

Wait, could that be the case? Because the pp-I reaction is H + H → D + e+ + neutrino. For this reaction, the rate depends on the concentration of protons (H). The presence of He-3 might influence the electron density, which affects the reaction rate. Or perhaps it doesn't, as the dominant factor is the proton density. If the He-3 concentration increases, maybe the overall plasma density increases, so the pp-I reaction rate increases.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-I reaction rate is not significantly affected by the presence of He-3, so the production of D and hence the pp-I neutrinos remains the same.

In that case, the flux in band1 (700-800) would be the same as before, while band2 (860 keV) is also the same. So the ratio would be approximately 1, which is option C.

But that doesn't seem to make sense because the question is asking about the ratio after the pp-III branch stops. So perhaps something is wrong with this reasoning.

Wait, another approach: the pp-III process is a major contributor to the Sun's energy output. If it stops, the total energy production would drop. But the question is about neutrino flux, which is a measure of the number of neutrinos per cm² per second. So neutrino flux depends on the number of reactions producing neutrinos.

If the pp-III process is a source of neutrinos, stopping it would reduce the flux. But earlier I thought that the pp-III process doesn't emit neutrinos because it's a fusion of He-3, which doesn't involve beta decay. So the neutrino flux from pp-III is zero? Or perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III process produces a small amount of neutrinos, but I'm not sure. If the pp-III process does produce neutrinos, their stopping would reduce the flux from that process, but since the question is about the ratio of two bands, perhaps band2 is mainly from pp-III.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the neutrino energies. Let me think again. The Be-7 decay produces 860 keV neutrinos. The pp-I reaction produces 420 keV. The pep reaction is higher, around 1.4 MeV. So the 700-800 keV band is in between. Is there any neutrino source in that range?

I think the neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band might be from a different process. Maybe from the decay of some other isotope. But I'm not sure which one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the relative production rates of the two bands. If the pp-III process stops, it affects the production of higher-energy neutrinos more than lower-energy ones.

Wait, if the pp-III process is stopped, the flux in band2 (800-900 keV) would drop, while band1 (700-800) remains the same. But if that's the case, the ratio (band1 / band2) would increase.

But what's the original flux ratio? Without the pp-III stopping, what's the flux? Let's say band2 is mainly from Be-7, which is produced in the pp-I process. So if the pp-III stopping doesn't affect Be-7 production, then band2 flux remains same, band1 (from pp-I) also same. So ratio is 1.

But that can't be the case because the question says the ratio would change. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III process is a major source of some neutrinos in band2. So stopping it reduces the flux in band2, but not in band1. So the ratio would increase.

Wait, but earlier I thought the pp-III process doesn't emit neutrinos. Unless in the pp-III process, a proton is converted into a neutron, emitting a neutrino. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band are from the CNO cycle. But as I thought earlier, the CNO neutrinos are much higher in energy.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the pp chain's contribution. The main neutrino sources are:

1. pp-I: 420 keV, large number of neutrinos, about 91% of the total solar neutrino flux.
2. pep: ~1.4 MeV, about 0.3%.
3. Be-7: ~860 keV, about 8%.

So the band2 (800-900) would include the Be-7 neutrinos (860). Band1 (700-800) is between 700 and 800, which doesn't include the 420 keV or 860 keV. So perhaps the band1 is a region with very few neutrinos.

Wait, but the question is about the flux in these bands after the pp-III process stops. So if the pp-III process is a source of neutrinos in band2, stopping it would reduce the flux in band2, increasing the ratio. But if it doesn't produce neutrinos, then the flux in band2 remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III process isn't a source of neutrinos. So the flux in band2 remains the same, and band1 is unaffected. So the ratio would be the same as before.

But without knowing the original ratio, perhaps the question expects us to know that the main neutrino flux is from the Be-7 decay. So if the pp-III process stops, the flux in band2 would drop, while band1 (if it's from a different process) remains the same. Thus, the ratio increases.

Wait, but if the pp-III process stops, the main fusion process might slow down. The total number of Be-7 produced depends on the fusion rate
