Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let's think this through. So, the researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time, so they want to observe the one more likely to transit. Both have been detected via the RV method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. 

Wait, transit probability... I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. Oh, right, the formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by some factor involving the orbital inclination. But wait, isn't the transit probability actually more about the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, I think the transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star from our point of view. The formula I'm vaguely recalling is that the geometric probability for a transit is (R_star / a), where 'a' is the semi-major axis (since the orbit is circular, a is the radius). So the probability is higher when the star is larger relative to the planet's distance. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The transit probability P is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a. But wait, no, that's the condition for a transit to occur. The actual probability depends on the relative sizes and the alignment. Alternatively, I think the probability is roughly (R_star / a)^2 times the probability that the orbital plane is aligned correctly. Wait, no, maybe the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2. Because the area over which the planet can transit is a circle of radius R_star, and the orbital plane is such that the planet's path in front of the star is a small area. So the probability might be (R_star / (a))Â² multiplied by some other factors. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I remember
