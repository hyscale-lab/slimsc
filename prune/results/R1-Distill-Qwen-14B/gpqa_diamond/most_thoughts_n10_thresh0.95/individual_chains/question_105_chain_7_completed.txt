Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure out what it's asking.

So, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun, with radius equal to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness as observed from Earth varies periodically. The question is saying that this situation could look similar to an exoplanet transiting the star. But the twist is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots do?

Hmm, I think I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude when it transits.

Wait, but the problem says "if the star was not covered by spots!", so I think we're comparing the signal caused by the spots to the signal a planet would cause. So, the brightness dip from a planet is when it blocks some light, while the spots cause a variation because their cooler regions come into view as the star rotates.

First, I need to find the relative change in brightness (the amplitude) caused by the spots. Then, find the planet radius that would cause the same change when it transits.

Let me think about the star's luminosity first. The total luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So for the star, L_total = 4π Rstar² σ (6000)^4.

But since the star has spots, part of its surface is at a lower temperature. The filling factor comes into play here. The filling factor (f) is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Here, f is 20%, or 0.2.

The spots are cooler: their temperature is 6000K - 1000K = 5000K.

So, the total luminosity when the spots are on the visible hemisphere would be a combination of the normal star and the spots.

Let me model this. Normally, without any spots, the star's luminosity is L = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4. But when spots are present, the luminosity depends on whether the spots are in the visible hemisphere or not.

Wait, but this star is being observed from Earth, and as it rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view and then goes away. So the observed luminosity changes as the spots rotate into and out of view.

But the question says that the photometric observations show periodic variations because of this rotation. The key point is the variation in brightness, so the change in flux.

When the star is viewed normally (without any spots in view), the flux is F0 = (σ Teff^4) (Rstar² / D²), where D is the distance to the star. But when the spots are visible, the flux changes.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fractional change in brightness (delta F / F0) when the spots are present.

The idea is that the spots cause the star to appear dimmer when they are on the visible side. So the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible (assuming the other hemisphere is normal), and the minimum is when all the spots are visible. Wait, no, actually, the spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, the total flux decreases.

Wait, but the question's scenario is that when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing the observed brightness to dip. So the variation is between the star's normal brightness and a lower brightness when spots are visible.

But I think to model this, I need to calculate the average brightness when the spots are visible and when they are not. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, we'd see a maximum brightness when the spot hemisphere is facing away, and a minimum when it's facing towards us.

Wait, but the star is being observed, and as it rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view. So the brightness variation would be periodic with the rotation period.

But the problem says that the observed brightness variation can be similar to an exoplanet transit. So, the change in brightness from the spots is similar to the change from a planet blocking part of the star's light.

So the question is, what planet radius would cause the same fractional change in brightness as the spots do.

Let me calculate the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots first.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 (Rstar^2) / D^2.

But when the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 * [ (1 - f) * (Teff^4) + f * (T_spot^4) ] / (Teff^4)

Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Because the spots cover a fraction f of the surface, and each part of the surface emits flux according to its temperature.

Wait, the star's total flux when part of it is at a lower temperature would be:

F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot,

where F_spot is the flux from each spot. Alternatively, more accurately, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted area and the spotted area.

So, the total flux when spots are present is:

F = (1 - f) * (σ Teff^4) * (Rstar^2) / D^2 + f * (σ T_spot^4) * (Rstar^2) / D^2

The F0 is (σ Teff^4) * (Rstar^2) / D^2.

So, F = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ]

So the fractional change in flux is (F - F0)/F0 = [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ] - 1 ] = [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) - 1 ]

Simplify: (F - F0)/F0 = -f [1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ]

So the fractional change is delta_F/F0 = -f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

But wait, when the spots are on the side we're viewing, the flux is lower, so the fractional change is negative. But the maximum and minimum brightness would happen as the spots rotate in and out of view.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view, causing the flux to drop, and when they move away, flux goes back to normal. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between F0 (no spots visible) and F (spots visible). But wait, when the entire spotted hemisphere is on the far side, the spots are not visible, so F = F0. The maximum dip occurs when all the spots are on the near side. The minimum flux is F_min = F when f fraction is spots on the near side.

Wait, but the maximum dip in brightness is when the maximum amount of spots is visible. Hmm, but the way the star is observed, since the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates so that the spot hemisphere is facing us, the entire spotted area is visible. So the maximum dip is when all the spots are visible.

Wait, maybe I should model the brightness variation as the star rotates.

Assuming the star is a sphere, when the spot hemisphere is fully visible, the flux is F = F0 (1 - f) (Teff^4) + f (T_spot^4) all divided by Teff^4.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the average flux when the spots are visible and when they are not.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and the minimum brightness.

Wait, when the star's spot hemisphere is facing away, the flux is F0. When it's facing towards us, the flux is F_min.

So the amplitude (the peak-to-peak variation) would be F0 - F_min.

But wait, the problem says that the brightness variation has an amplitude that would resemble an exoplanet. So the question is about the relative change in brightness. So the amplitude of the brightness change caused by the spots is equal to that caused by a planet transiting.

So, let me calculate the fractional change in flux due to the spots.

Using the formula I derived earlier:

delta_F/F0 = -f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Here, f=0.2, Teff=6000 K, T_spot=5000 K.

So compute (T_spot / Teff )^4 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Calculating 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. So 0.8333^4 is approx:

0.8333^2 = 0.6944, then square that to get 0.48225.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So delta_F/F0 = -0.2 * (1 - 0.48225 ) = -0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ -0.10355.

So the fractional change is about -10.355% when the spots are fully visible. But wait, that's the change from F0. So when the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - 0.10355) = 0.89645 F0.

Wait, but the brightness dip is 10.355% of F0. So the amplitude in brightness is this dip, the change from F0 to F when spots are present.

But wait, a planet transiting the star would block some light, leading to a dip in brightness. The fractional change would be (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2), because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the planet's radius.

So, the planet would cause a dip of delta_F_planet / F0 = - (Rp^2) / (Rstar^2).

So the amplitude is the same as the spot-induced amplitude.

So, we set (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) = 0.10355.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, sqrt(0.10355) is approximately 0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

But wait, let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate (5/6)^4 more accurately.

5/6 is 0.833333...

(5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.694444.

(5/6)^4 = (25/36)^2 = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 = 0.1035494.

So delta_F/F0 is about 10.355% dip.

So the planet's effect is to block (Rp/Rstar)^2 of the star's area, leading to the same dip, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ approximately 0.3217.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39^2 = 0.1521 → which is larger than 0.1035.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049, way too small.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121, which is less than 0.1035.

D) ~0.32 → 0.32^2 = 0.1024, which is very close to 0.1035.

So the correct answer should be option D, approximately 0.32.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I made a mistake in assuming the dip is 10.35%. Let me think again.

When the spots are on the far side, we see the star at full brightness. When they're on the near side, the brightness is lower.

But the maximum dip occurs when the spots are all facing us, so the dip is the maximum.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's brightness varies due to the rotation. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F0 - F_spots_visible) / F0.

Which is the same as the dip, which is 10.35%.

So when a planet transits, it causes a dip of (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) * F0. So the dip is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) * F0, so (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) = dip fraction, which is 0.1035.

So Rpl/Rstar is sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, so answer D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait, another thought: the star is filling its own disk, so when the planet transits, the area blocked is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But wait, the star has a radius equal to the sun. So Rstar is R_sun. So Rpl is 0.32 R_sun.

Wait, that's a very big planet. Jupiter's radius is about 0.1 R_sun. So 0.32 R_sun is larger than Jupiter. But some exoplanets are that big, I suppose.

But the question is about the relative radius, so the answer should be around 0.32.

Looking at the options, D is 0.32.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's dark spots, we analyze the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and compare it to the dip caused by a transiting planet.

### Key Parameters:
- **Star's effective temperature**: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
- **Spot temperature**: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)
- **Filling factor of spots**: \( f = 0.2 \)

### Step 1: Fractional Change in Brightness Due to Spots
The total flux from the star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
\[
F = \sigma T^4
\]
When spots are visible, the total flux is a weighted average of the flux from the unspotted and spotted regions:
\[
F_{\text{total}} = F_0 \left[ (1 - f) + f \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right]
\]
where \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \) is the flux without any spots. The fractional change in brightness is:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = -f \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225
\]
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = -0.2 \left( 1 - 0.48225 \right) = -0.2 \times 0.51775 \approx -0.10355
\]
Thus, the fractional change in brightness due to the spots is approximately \( -10.355\% \).

### Step 2: Brightness Variation Due to a Transiting Planet
When a planet transits the star, it blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = -\left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]
To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, we equate:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
\]
\[
\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3217
\]

### Step 3: Comparison with Options
The calculated value \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.32 \) matches closely with option **D** (\( \sim 0.32 \)).

### Conclusion
The radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spots is approximately \( 0.32 \) times the radius of the host star.
