--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again and break it down.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm. So, energy in electrostatic systems usually refers to the potential energy stored in the system due to the arrangement of charges. Since the system is isolated, I think we can ignore external fields and just calculate the potential energy between all pairs of charges.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the 12 charges are all at 2 meters away from P, which is where the 13th charge is. So, each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th one. But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Oh, right, because each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, but are they all at the same point? Probably not, but the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So maybe they're arranged in a spherical shell around P, each at a radius of 2 meters. But the exact positions beyond that might not matter because if they're all symmetrically placed, the potential energy between each pair can be considered.

Wait, but wait, when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, for all the charges, you calculate U for each pair and add them up.

So, let's think of the system as having two types of interactions: between the 13th charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges, and between each pair of the 12 charges.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed, so perhaps only the 12 charges are moving, but in this problem, their positions are fixed at 2 m from P. So, the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is fixed. And the potential energy between each pair of the 12 is also fixed, considering their mutual distances.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each is at 2 m from P, but what about the distance between them? If they're all on a sphere of radius 2 m, the distance between any two charges would depend on their positions. But perhaps because the system is isolated and we're looking for the minimum energy, the charges would arrange themselves to minimize the total potential energy. Oh, but wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so maybe their mutual distances are not fixed. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So, each of them is fixed in position at 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. Or perhaps they're all at the same point? No, that can't be because if they're all at the same point, the potential energy between them would be very high. So probably, they're arranged on a sphere, and each is at a distance of 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other vary. 

But wait, perhaps the exact positions aren't necessary because the problem might be making some assumption. Maybe it's treating the 12 charges as a point charge located at a distance of 2 m from P. Let's think: if all 12 charges are at the same point 2 m away from P, the potential energy would be higher, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are as small as possible, but I'm not sure. This is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and not considering the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. But that doesn't make sense because the 12 charges would contribute to each other's potential energy. So I think I need to include both contributions.

Wait, but wait: the system is isolated, so the total energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials. So for the 13th charge (q13) at P, each of the 12 charges (q1 to q12) located at 2 m away. So each pair (q13 and q_i) contributes U = k * q13 * q_i / r. Since all the q_i are at the same distance from q13, that's 12 times that same U.

Then, between each pair of the 12 charges, each pair (q_i, q_j) contributes U = k * q_i * q_j / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between them. But since the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances can vary, perhaps the minimum energy occurs when the mutual distances are as large as possible, but I'm not sure. Wait, no: the potential energy between two positive charges is positive when they're repelling, so to minimize the total energy, you'd want them as far apart as possible. But in this scenario, if they're all at 2 m from P, the maximum possible mutual distance would be when they're diametrically opposite on the sphere, so 4 m apart. But wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are fixed at 2 m from P, but their exact positions aren't fixedâ€”so perhaps the minimum energy would be achieved when the potential energy between the 12 charges is as negative as possible. Wait, no: wait, all the charges are positive because each is 2e, which is positive. So each pair of these 12 charges would repel, so their potential energy is positive. So to minimize the total energy, which is the sum of all these, you would arrange the 12 charges as far apart as possible, so that the individual pair potentials are as small as possible. But in reality, arranging them as far apart as possible on the sphere would minimize each of their mutual potentials, but since all are positive, the potential energy between each pair is positive, so the more they're spread out, the smaller each term is, leading to a lower total potential.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem is neglecting the potential energy between the 12 charges. Let me think: the problem says "What is the minimum energy of this system?" So maybe the 12 charges are fixed in place, so their mutual distances are fixed, which would make their potential energy a fixed value. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's assuming that the only potential energy is between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and not between the 12 themselves.

Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would create a very high potential energy between them. That seems unlikely, so perhaps the problem is considering only the potential between the 13th and the 12.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So P is where the 13th charge is. So the 12 are each at 2 m from P, but perhaps each is at a different point on the sphere of radius 2 m. So how are their mutual distances arranged? If all 12 are equally spaced on the sphere, each would be as far as possible from each other. So the potential energy between any two would be (k*(2e)^2)/r, where r is the distance between them.

But calculating the sum of all those potentials would require knowing each r. However, this seems complicated. Maybe the problem is simplifying by assuming that the mutual distances are much larger than 2 m, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential between the 13th charge and each of the 12, since the mutual potentials between the 12 are more complicated and perhaps the problem expects us to ignore them. That would make the calculation easier.

So perhaps the approach is to compute the potential energy between the fixed charge (13th) and each of the 12 charges, and ignore any potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but that can't be right, because if you have 12 positive charges at 2 m from a fixed positive charge, the potential energy between each pair of the 12 would be positive, contributing to the total energy. So including them would increase the total energy. But the question is about the minimum energy. So if the 12 charges are allowed to move to minimize their mutual potential energy, they might arrange themselves to minimize their own potential energy. But wait, since they're all positive, their mutual potential energy would be lower (less positive) if they are as close as possible. But that would make the potential energy higher than if they were spread out.

Wait, no, because for positive charges, the potential energy between two like charges is positive, and it increases with decreasing distance. So to minimize the total energy, you would want to arrange the 12 charges as far apart as possible, which would minimize each individual U_ij term.

But wait, since the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their exact positions aren't specified. So perhaps the mutual distances are fixed as well, meaning that their mutual potential energy is fixed. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is ignoring the potential energy between the 12 charges, which would simplify the calculation.

Wait, let me think about the possible options. The options are in the order of 1e-26 or 1e-27 J, which are very small numbers. Since the charges are 2e, which is a small charge, and the distances are 2 meters, the potential energies would be small.

So perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider only the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not the mutual potentials between the 12. That would make the calculation manageable.

So, each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the 13th is also 2e. So the potential between each pair is U = k * (2e) * (2e) / r, where r is 2 meters.

Wait, but wait: the 13th charge is fixed at P. Each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P. So the distance between the 13th and each of the 12 is 2 m.

So the potential energy for each such pair is U = (k * q13 * qi) / r = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2.

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy would be 12 * [k*(2e)^2 / 2 ].

So, let's compute this.

But wait, I should also remember that the potential energy between two charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. So each pair contributes to the total.

But wait, if the 12 charges are all at the same point, that would be a very high potential energy, but that's not the case. So perhaps the mutual potentials are being ignored, or the problem is only considering the 13th charge's potential with the 12.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential between the 12 charges is zero because they're identical? No, that doesn't make sense. They are all positive, so their mutual potential energy is positive, contributing to the total.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the 12 charges can arrange themselves in a way to minimize their mutual potential energy. Wait, but since they're all positive, arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize each individual U_ij term, thus lowering the total potential. But if they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, their mutual distances can't be more than 4 m (if they're opposite each other on the sphere), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is being considered as zero, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential between the 13th charge and the others, which would simplify the problem.

Let me proceed under that assumption, and see if the answer matches one of the options.

So, each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of U = k*(2e)^2 / 2.

Since there are 12 such charges, the total is 12 * U.

Let's compute this.

First, k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N mÂ²/CÂ².

e is the elementary charge, about 1.602 x 10^-19 C.

So, each U = (8.988e9) * (2e) * (2e) / 2.

Wait, no: wait, each U is k * q1 * q2 / r. q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, r is 2 m.

So U = (8.988e9) * (2e) * (2e) / 2.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

Compute (2e)*(2e) = 4eÂ².

Then, 4eÂ² / 2 = 2eÂ².

So U per pair is 8.988e9 * 2eÂ².

Wait, but wait: 2e is (2 * 1.6e-19 C), so (2e)^2 = (3.2e-19)^2 = 1.024e-37 CÂ².

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it numerically.

Let me compute each U:

k = 8.988e9 NÂ·mÂ²/CÂ².

(2e) = 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

So, U per pair = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19) * (3.204e-19) / 2 meters.

Wait, wait, r is 2 m, so denominator is 2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term:

(3.204e-19 C) * (3.204e-19 C) = (3.204)^2 * 1e-38 CÂ² = approx 10.265e-38 CÂ².

So U per pair = (8.988e9) * (10.265e-38) / 2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 10.265e-38 = 8.988 * 10.265 * 1e-29.

8.988 * 10 is about 89.88, so 8.988 * 10.265 is approximately 92.26 (but let's compute more accurately).

10.265 * 8.988:

10 *8.988=89.88,

0.265 *8.988 â‰ˆ 2.381,

Total â‰ˆ 92.261.

So 92.261e-29 = 9.2261e-28.

Then, divide by 2: 9.2261e-28 / 2 = 4.613e-28 J.

Each pair contributes 4.613e-28 J.

But wait, wait. No, that's not right. Let me compute that again.

Wait, U per pair is (k * q1 * q2) / r.

Wait, q1 = 2e, q2 = 2e. So that's (2e)(2e) =4 eÂ².

So U = k * 4 eÂ² / r.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it as:

k = 8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ²,

e = 1.602e-19 C,

r = 2 m.

So, U = (8.988e9) * (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute (2e)^2: (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = approx 10.265 * 1e-38 = 1.0265e-37 CÂ².

So U = (8.988e9) * (1.0265e-37) / 2.

Compute 8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37 = 8.988 * 1.0265 * 1e-28.

8.988 * 1.0265 â‰ˆ 9.226.

So that's 9.226e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.613e-28 J per pair.

Since there are 12 pairs, the total U is 12 * 4.613e-28 = 55.356e-28 J.

Wait, 55.356e-28 J is the same as 5.5356e-27 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, option B is 2.822e-26, option A is 5.645e-26.

Wait, 5.53e-27 is approximately 0.55e-26, which isn't matching any of the options. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the exponents. Let me recompute U per pair.

Wait, (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 is approximately 10.265, so 10.265e-38? No, wait: (1e-19)^2 is 1e-38, so it's 10.265e-38 = 1.0265e-37 CÂ².

So U = (8.988e9) * (1.0265e-37) / 2.

So 8.988e9 is 8.988 * 1e9.

Multiply by 1.0265e-37: 8.988 * 1.0265 = approx 9.226; 1e9 * 1e-37 = 1e-28.

So 9.226e-28. Divide by 2: 4.613e-28 J per pair.

12 pairs: 12 *4.613e-28 = 55.356e-28 = 5.5356e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J. That's not matching. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider that each pair between the 12 charges contributes as well. Because in the system, you have 12 charges each interacting with the 13th, and also each of the 12 charges interacting with each other.

So perhaps the total energy is the sum of the energy between the 13th and each of the 12, plus the energy between each pair of the 12.

So, we need to compute both components.

Let me compute each part.

First, the 13th charge and the 12: 12 pairs, each contributing U1 = k*(2e)^2 / 2.

Total U1 = 12 * U1 per pair = 12 * (k*(2e)^2 / 2).

Then, the 12 charges have C(12,2) pairs, each contributing U2 = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between the ith and jth charge.

Assuming the 12 charges are arranged in a way that the mutual distances are as large as possible to minimize the potential energy (since they're positive, the potential energy is positive, so to minimize the total energy, you want each U2 to be as small as possible, which would occur when each r_ij is as large as possible).

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is making an assumption that the mutual potential is negligible or perhaps they're arranged in a way where each pair is at a certain fixed distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual distances are much larger than 2 m, so that the potential energy between them is negligible. But that's probably not the case because 2 m is the fixed distance from P, but the mutual distance between two charges on the sphere could be up to 4 m (diametrically opposite), but that's a big assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the 13th charge and the 12, and not the mutual potential between the 12. But in that case, our earlier calculation of 5.53e-27 J isn't matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the computation of U.

k = 8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ².

(2e) = 3.204e-19 C.

U per pair (for 12 and 13th charge):

U1 = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2: 3.204^2 = 10.265; 10.265e-38 = 1.0265e-37 CÂ².

So,

U1 = (8.988e9) * (1.0265e-37) / 2.

Multiply 8.988e9 by 1.0265e-37:

8.988 * 1.0265 â‰ˆ 9.226,

1e9 * 1e-37 = 1e-28.

So, 9.226e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.613e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 4.613e-28 *12 = 55.356e-28 = 5.5356e-27 J.

So U1 is approximately 5.5356e-27 J.

Now, the mutual potential between the 12 charges: each pair contributes U2 = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

But what is r_ij?

Assuming the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, the maximum possible distance between any two is 4 m (diametrically opposite). The minimum possible distance would be very small, but in reality, they can't be closer than a certain point.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are much larger than 2 m, making their contributions negligible. Or, perhaps the mutual potential is zero, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is being considered as zero, but that's not correct. So I'm stuck.

Wait, let's consider the mutual potential. How many pairs are there? For 12 charges, it's C(12,2) = 66 pairs.

Each pair contributes U2 = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem is making the assumption that all mutual distances are 2 m, which is the same as the distance from P. But that's only possible if all 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron around P, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each pair is at a distance of 4 m, which would be the maximum possible on a sphere of radius 2 m.

Wait, but if all pairs are at 4 m, then each U2 would be (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 /4.

Let me compute that.

(3.204e-19)^2 = 1.0265e-37 CÂ².

So per pair,

U2 = (8.988e9) * 1.0265e-37 /4.

Calculate numerator: 8.988e9 *1.0265e-37 = 9.226e-28.

Divide by 4: 2.3065e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 66 pairs: 66 *2.3065e-28 = approximately 152e-28 = 1.52e-26 J.

So the mutual potential would be 1.52e-26 J.

Adding that to the U1 of 5.535e-27 J gives a total of about 1.52e-26 + 5.535e-27 = 2.0735e-26 J.

Wait, but none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are 2âˆš2 m, which is the edge length of a cube inscribed in the sphere. So r_ij = 2âˆš2 m.

Then, U2 per pair is (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / (2âˆš2).

Compute 2âˆš2 = approx 2.8284 m.

So,

U2 per pair = (8.988e9) * 1.0265e-37 / 2.8284.

Compute denominator: 2.8284.

So 8.988e9 *1.0265e-37 =9.226e-28.

Divide by 2.8284: 9.226e-28 /2.8284 â‰ˆ3.26e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 66 pairs: 66 *3.26e-28 = 215.16e-28 = 2.1516e-26 J.

Adding to U1 of 5.5356e-27 J gives approx 2.1516e-26 + 5.5356e-27 = 2.705e-26 J.

Looking back at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is close. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the U2 calculation. Let me see.

Wait, when r is 2âˆš2 m, which is 2.8284 m, then U2 per pair is (k*(2e)^2)/r.

Which is (8.988e9) * ( (3.204e-19)^2 ) / 2.8284.

So, let's compute that more accurately.

Compute (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2: as before, it's 9.226e-28.

Divide by 2.8284: 9.226e-28 /2.8284 â‰ˆ3.26e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 66: 66 *3.26e-28 = 215.16e-28 = 2.1516e-26 J.

So mutual U is 2.1516e-26, plus U1 of 5.5356e-27: total is 2.705e-26 J.

Which is closest to option B, 2.822e-26.

But wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the exact values.

Alternatively, maybe the mutual potential isn't being considered, and the problem is only considering the 13th charge's potential with the 12.

In that case, the energy would be 5.535e-27 J, which isn't matching any option except option C, which is 7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Let me recalculate U1 for one pair.

U1 = (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / 2.

Wait, e is 1.6e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = 4eÂ² = 4*(1.6e-19)^2 =4*(2.56e-38) = 1.024e-37 CÂ².

So,

U1 = (8.988e9) * (1.024e-37) / 2.

Compute 8.988e9 *1.024e-37 = 8.988 *1.024 * 1e-28.

8.988 *1.024 = let's compute: 8*1=8, 8*0.024=0.192; 0.988*1=0.988, 0.988 *0.024â‰ˆ0.0237. So adding up: 8 + 0.192 + 0.988 + 0.0237 â‰ˆ 9.2037.

So 9.2037e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.60185e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 pairs: 4.60185e-28 *12 =55.2222e-28 =5.5222e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 5.52e-27 J.

But none of the options match that. The options are A)5.645e-26, B)2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

So 5.52e-27 is closest to option C, which is 7.056e-27, but it's about 0.7e-26, which is larger than 5.5e-27.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check units and exponents.

Wait, 1e9 * 1e-37 = 1e-28? No, 1e9 * 1e-37 = 1e-28? Wait, 1e9 is 10^9, 1e-37 is 10^-37. Multiplying gives 10^(9-37) =1e-28. Correct.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the (2e)^2 term. Let me compute (2e)^2 again.

e=1.602e-19, so 2e=3.204e-19 C.

(3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = 10.265 *1e-38 =1.0265e-37 CÂ².

So correct.

Wait, then U per pair is (8.988e9) * (1.0265e-37) / 2 = (9.226e-28)/2 =4.613e-28 J.

12 *4.613e-28 =5.5356e-27 J.

So that's the total for 13th charge and the 12.

If the problem is only considering this, then the answer would be 5.5356e-27 J, which isn't any of the options.

Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering the mutual potential between the 12 charges as well.

Wait, let's compute the mutual potential between the 12 charges, assuming they're all at a distance of 2 meters from P, but arranging themselves in a regular icosahedron or something, but perhaps the mutual distance can be approximated as, say, 2 m as well. But that's not correct because they're on a sphere of radius 2 m, so their mutual distance can't all be 2 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is being considered as zero, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is being considered as a single term, such as treating the 12 charges as a single point charge located at 2 m from the 13th charge. But that approach is more applicable when the 12 charges are close together, which they aren't.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is being considered as the potential energy of a system where all 12 charges are at the same point, which would give a very high potential energy, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential is being ignored, and only the 13th charge's interactions are considered. But then the answer isn't matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is being considered, but in a way that each pair is at a distance of 2 m.

Wait, but that's not possible because the 12 charges are all at 2 m from P, so their mutual distances would vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential is negligible compared to the potential from the 13th charge, but that doesn't seem to be the case given the options.

Wait, let me think again. If the mutual potential between the 12 charges is the same as the potential between each and the 13th charge, perhaps the total would be larger.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 2 m from P, and the potential energy between any two of them is zero. But that's only possible if the charges are negative, which they aren't.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential between the 13th charge and the others, in which case the energy is 5.53e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the entire system's potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including the 13th charge with each of the 12, and all pairs among the 12.

So, including all possible pairs:

Total U = U_13 + U_12_12.

Where U_13 is the sum of potentials between the 13th and each of the 12, and U_12_12 is the sum between all pairs of the 12.

So, let's compute both terms.

First, U_13: 12 pairs, each with U = k*(2e)^2/2 m.

Which gives U_13 =12 * [k*(4eÂ²)/2] = 12 * [ (8.988e9) * (4*(1.6e-19)^2) ) /2 ].

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again.

U_13 =12 * [ (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / 2 ].

Which is 12 * [ (8.988e9) * (4 eÂ²) / 2 ].

Simplify:

4/2=2, so 12 * [8.988e9 * 2 eÂ² ].

Compute 8.988e9 * 2 =1.7976e10.

eÂ² = (1.6e-19)^2 =2.56e-38.

So,

1.7976e10 *2.56e-38 =1.7976 *2.56= approx 4.593, so 4.593e-28.

Multiply by 12: 4.593e-28 *12 =55.116e-28 =5.5116e-27 J.

Now, U_12_12: the sum of all pairs among the 12 charges.

Number of pairs: C(12,2)=66.

Each pair contributes U =k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

But r_ij is the distance between two charges on the sphere. Assuming they're equally spaced, perhaps r_ij is greater than 2 m. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that each r_ij is 2 m. But that's not correct, as they're on a sphere of radius 2 m, so the maximum possible r_ij is 4 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is being ignored, but that would give an answer not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is considered to be zero, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential is zero because the charges are arranged symmetrically around P, leading to their potentials canceling out. But that can't be right because potential energy is a scalar and doesn't cancel out that way.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential is being considered as zero because the problem states that the system is isolated, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is being considered as zero because the problem is only looking for the potential due to the 13th charge.

But then, the answer would be 5.5e-27 J, which is not an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think if I can find another approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential cancels out. But how? Since they're all positive, their mutual potential would be positive, adding to the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential is zero because the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so they form a spherical shell, and the potential inside a spherical shell due to charges on the shell is zero. But wait, that's for the electric field, not the potential energy. The electric potential inside a spherical shell is constant, but the potential energy of a charge inside is the potential times the charge, which would be a different consideration.

Wait, but in this problem, the 13th charge is at the center, so the potential energy due to the 12 charges on the shell would be the potential at P (which is the center) multiplied by the charge at P. The potential at P due to each of the 12 charges is k*(2e)/2 m. So each contributes k*(2e)/2, and the total potential at P is 12*(k*(2e)/2) )= 12k e.

Then, the potential energy of the 13th charge (which is 2e) at P is U = q * V = 2e * (12k e) )= 24 k eÂ².

Wait, but that's just the potential energy of the 13th charge in the field of the 12. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their position, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the total potential energy of the system is the sum of all pair potentials.

So, U = U_13 + U_12.

Where U_13 is the potential from 13th to each of 12, and U_12 is the potential between the 12.

So, let's compute U_13 as 12*(k*(2e)^2)/2.

Which is 12*(k*4eÂ²)/2 =12* (2 k eÂ²) =24 k eÂ².

Wait, perhaps that's a better way to compute it.

k=8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ²,

e=1.6e-19 C,

so,

24 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute (1.6e-19)^2 =2.56e-38.

So,

24 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38.

Compute step by step:

8.988e9 *2.56e-38 = (8.988 *2.56) * 1e-29.

8.988 *2.56 â‰ˆ 23.07.

So 23.07e-29 =2.307e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *2.307e-28=55.368e-28 =5.5368e-27 J.

So U_13=5.5368e-27 J.

Now, U_12 is the sum of potentials between all pairs of the 12 charges.

Each pair is (2e)^2 *k / r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem assumes that all mutual distances are 2 m, which is not possible because they're on a sphere, but perhaps it's an approximation.

If r_ij =2 m for all pairs, then each U_ij =k*(2e)^2 /2.

So, each U_ij= (8.988e9)*(4eÂ²)/(2) =8.988e9 *4*(1.6e-19)^2 /2.

Compute that:

(1.6e-19)^2 =2.56e-38,

4*2.56e-38=1.024e-37.

So,

U_ij = (8.988e9 *1.024e-37)/2 = (9.226e-28)/2=4.613e-28 J per pair.

Number of pairs:66.

So U_12=66 *4.613e-28 =3.045e-26 J.

Total U=5.5368e-27 +3.045e-26=3.6e-26 J.

Which is ~3.6e-26 J, but that's not any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 4 m, which is the maximum possible.

Then, U_ij =k*(2e)^2 /4.

Which is (8.988e9 *4eÂ²)/4.

=8.988e9 * (4eÂ²)/4 =8.988e9 *eÂ².

eÂ²=2.56e-38, so:

8.988e9 *2.56e-38=2.307e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 66:66 *2.307e-28=152.022e-28=1.52022e-26 J.

Total U=5.5368e-27 +1.52022e-26=2.0739e-26 J.

Which is approximately 2.07e-26 J, close to option B (2.822e-26) but not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is being ignored because the problem is only considering the 13th charge's interactions. But then, our initial U_13 is 5.5368e-27 J, which is not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again: option C is 7.056e-27, which is roughly twice our U_13 value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate U_13.

U_13 =12 * [k*(2e)^2 / 2 ].

Which is 12 * [ (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2 ].

Compute (3.204e-19)^2 =1.0265e-37 CÂ².

So,

U_13 =12 * [ (8.988e9 *1.0265e-37) / 2 ]

=12 * [ (9.226e-28) / 2 ]

=12 *4.613e-28 =5.5356e-27 J.

So that's 5.5356e-27 J.

But option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in Coulomb's constant. I used 8.988e9 N mÂ²/CÂ². Maybe it's better to use 9e9 for simplicity.

Let me try that.

k=9e9 N mÂ²/CÂ².

So,

U_13 =12 * [ (9e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2 ]

Compute (3.204e-19)^2=1.0265e-37.

So,

(9e9) *1.0265e-37 =9.2385e-28.

Divide by 2:4.61925e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.5431e-27 J.

Still around 5.5e-27 J.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 13th charge is fixed, so we don't consider its potential energy with the others, but that doesn't make sense because the problem states that it's part of the system.

Alternatively, perhaps the 13th charge is 2e, and the others are 2e as well, but perhaps I made a mistake in their charges.

Wait, the problem states each particle has charge 2e. So 13th charge is 2e, each of the others is 2e as well.

So, U per pair between 13th and each of the 12 is k*(2e)*(2e)/2 =k*(4eÂ²)/2=2k eÂ².

So,

U_13 =12 *2k eÂ²=24 k eÂ².

Which is where I was before.

So,

24 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute:

(1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

8.988e9 *2.56e-38=2.307e-28.

24 *2.307e-28=55.368e-28=5.5368e-27 J.

So, unless I'm missing a factor of 2, but I don't see where.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U_13.

Wait, the potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 /r.

So for the 13th charge (q13=2e) and each q_i (2e), U =k*(2e)(2e)/2 =k*(4eÂ²)/2=2k eÂ².

So, for each of the 12 charges, U is 2k eÂ².

So total U_13=12 *2k eÂ²=24 k eÂ².

Which is correct.

Now, 24 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute (1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

So,

24 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.56e-38 = (8.988 *2.56) *1e-29.

8.988 *2.56: let's compute 8 *2.56=20.48, 0.988 *2.56â‰ˆ2.529, totalâ‰ˆ20.48+2.529=23.009.

So 23.009e-29 =2.3009e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *2.3009e-28=55.2216e-28=5.52216e-27 J.

So, unless the problem is considering the mutual potential as well, but I can't see how that would lead to an option.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential is being considered as the same as U_13. So, U_12_12=U_13=5.53e-27 J.

But then the total U would be 5.53 +5.53=11.06e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is being considered as a negative value, but that would only make sense if the charges were opposite, which they aren't.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A)5.645 x10^-26

B)2.822 x10^-26

C)7.056 x10^-27

D)122.330.

So, the options B is about 2.8e-26, which is about 5 times larger than our U_13 value of ~5.5e-27.

Ah, wait a second. I think I know where I went wrong. I think I messed up the charge value. The problem says each particle has a charge of 2e. So, 2e is 2 times the elementary charge, but when I compute U, I have to use the actual value, which is 2e = 3.204e-19 C.

Wait, perhaps I should use the actual value correctly.

Wait, the potential energy between two charges q1 and q2 is U = k q1 q2 /r.

So, for the 13th charge (q13=2e) and each q_i=2e, U =k*(2e)*(2e)/(2).

So,

U = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19 C) * (3.204e-19 C) / 2 m.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2.

(3.204e-19)^2 = 1.0265e-37.

So,

8.988e9 *1.0265e-37 = 9.226e-28.

Divide by 2:4.613e-28 J.

Multiply by 12:5.5356e-27 J.

So that's correct.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is using e as the elementary charge, not 2e.

Wait, no, the problem says each charge is 2e.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (2e)^2. Let me check.

(2e)^2 =4 eÂ².

e is 1.602e-19 C, so 2e is 3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 =1.0265e-37 CÂ².

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since none of my calculations are matching the options, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem setup.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the 12 charges are all at the same point, so their mutual potential is (12 choose 2) * k*(2e)^2 / 0, which is infinite, but that's impossible, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero. But that's only possible if the charges are arranged symmetrically such that each charge's potential is canceled out by others, but with positive charges, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy due to the 13th charge and the 12 as the only contribution, which is 5.53e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using e as the charge, not 2e. Let me try that.

If each charge is e instead of 2e.

Then, U_13 =12 * [k * e^2 /2].

k=8.988e9,

e=1.6e-19,

so,

U_13=12 * [8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2 /2 ].

Compute (1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

So,

8.988e9 *2.56e-38 =2.307e-28.

Divide by 2:1.1535e-28.

Multiply by 12:13.842e-28=1.3842e-27 J.

But that's even smaller than before and not matching any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy in a different unit? No, the options are in joules.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy of the 12 charges as a single point charge located at 2 m from P, which would be treated as a single charge.

In that case, the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 would be U =k*(2e)*(12*2e)/2.

Because the 12 charges would be treated as a single charge of 24e located at 2 m.

So,

U =k*(2e)*(24e)/(2).

= k*48 eÂ² / 2 =24 k eÂ².

Which is the same as before: 24 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2 =5.536e-27 J.

So same result.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the potential energy using energy per coulomb formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the minimum energy is achieved when the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is as negative as possible. But since they're all positive, their mutual potential energy is positive, so arranging them as close as possible (which would increase the potential energy) would increase the total energy. But the problem is asking for the minimum energy, which would occur when the mutual potential energy is minimized, which would be when the charges are as far apart as possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero because the charges are arranged symmetrically, but that's not correct.

At this point, I'm stuck and can't find a way to get an answer matching the options. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the calculations I've done.

The U_13 is approximately5.5e-27 J, which isn't any option.

Wait, looking at option C:7.056e-27 J. Let me see if 5.53e-27 multiplied by something gives that.

7.056e-27 /5.53e-27 â‰ˆ1.276. Hmm, 1.276 is approximately âˆš(1.628), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential is U_12_12= U_13.

So total U=5.53e-27 +5.53e-27=1.106e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is being considered as three times U_13.

5.53e-27 *3=1.66e-26 J, which is close to option B (2.822e-26), but not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of pairs in U_12_12 is 66 and each contributes 4.613e-28 J.

So U_12_12=66 *4.613e-28 =3.045e-26 J.

Adding to U_13=5.53e-27 J, total is 3.045e-26 +5.53e-27=3.6e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the mutual potential between the 12 charges, but not the potential with the 13th charge.

But that would give U=3.045e-26 J, which is option B (2.822e-26) but still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is being considered as a negative value, but that would require the charges to be negative, which they aren't.

At this point, I think the correct approach is to calculate only the potential between the 13th charge and the 12, which gives 5.53e-27 J, but since that's not an option, the closest option is C)7.056e-27 J. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me compute 7.056e-27 /5.53e-27 â‰ˆ1.276.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 1.276, but why?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using e=1.6e-19 C, but I used 1.602e-19. Let me try that.

e=1.6e-19 C.

Then, (2e)^2= (3.2e-19)^2=1.024e-37.

So,

U_13=12 * [ (8.988e9) *1.024e-37 /2 ].

Compute 8.988e9 *1.024e-37 =9.226e-28.

Divide by 2:4.613e-28.

Multiply by12:5.5356e-27 J.

Same result.

Hmm.

Maybe the correct answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I can't see how to get there with the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Let me try that.

k=9e9.

U_13=12 * (9e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 ) /2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2=1.0265e-37.

So,

9e9 *1.0265e-37 =9.2385e-28.

Divide by2:4.61925e-28.

Multiply by12:5.5431e-27 J.

Still about the same.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 13th charge is fixed, so the potential energy is only due to the 12 charges and their mutual interactions, not involving the 13th.

But that doesn't make sense because the 13th is part of the system.

At this point, I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find a way to get any of the options. Perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I'm not sure.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total potential energy, which arises from two contributions: the potential energy between the 13th charge (fixed at point P) and each of the 12 charges, and the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

### Key Information:
- **Number of charges**: 13 identical particles, each with charge \( q = 2e \).
- **Distance of 12 charges from P**: \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).
- Coulomb's constant: \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{NÂ·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \).
- Elementary charge: \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \).

### Step 1: Potential Energy Between the 13th Charge and the 12 Charges
The potential energy between the 13th charge (\( q_{13} = 2e \)) and each of the 12 charges (\( q_i = 2e \)) is given by:
\[
U_{13} = k \cdot \frac{q_{13} \cdot q_i}{r}
\]
Substituting \( q_{13} = q_i = 2e \), \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \), and \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \):
\[
U_{13} = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot (2e)^2}{2}
\]
\[
(2e)^2 = (2 \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 1.0265 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{C}^2
\]
\[
U_{13} = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 1.0265 \times 10^{-37}}{2} = 4.613 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J per pair}
\]
Since there are 12 such pairs:
\[
U_{13, \text{total}} = 12 \cdot 4.613 \times 10^{-28} = 5.5356 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Potential Energy Between the 12 Charges Themselves
The 12 charges are constrained to stay at \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from point P, but their mutual distances (\( r_{ij} \)) are not explicitly given. Assuming the charges are arranged symmetrically on a sphere of radius \( 2 \, \text{m} \), the mutual distances would vary, but for simplicity, we assume each pair is separated by \( r_{ij} = 2 \, \text{m} \) (a simplification that may not be physically accurate but is used here for calculation).

The potential energy between any two charges (\( q_i \) and \( q_j \)) is:
\[
U_{ij} = k \cdot \frac{q_i \cdot q_j}{r_{ij}}
\]
Substituting \( q_i = q_j = 2e \), \( r_{ij} = 2 \, \text{m} \), and \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \):
\[
U_{ij} = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot (2e)^2}{2}
\]
\[
U_{ij} = 4.613 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J per pair}
\]
There are \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) pairs of charges:
\[
U_{12, \text{total}} = 66 \cdot 4.613 \times 10^{-28} = 3.045 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 3: Total Potential Energy
The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the contributions:
\[
U_{\text{total}} = U_{13, \text{total}} + U_{12, \text{total}}
\]
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 5.5356 \times 10^{-27} + 3.045 \times 10^{-26} = 3.6 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
The calculated total potential energy (\( 3.6 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **B) \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)**, which may account for approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is:
