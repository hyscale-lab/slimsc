Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when calculating relative speed, I think we have to consider their velocities from one frame of reference. Oh wait, relative speed in special relativity isn't just subtracting the speeds normally because of the relativistic effects. So I can't just do 0.6c minus 0.5c, that would be 0.1c, but I remember that's not how it works.

Right, the formula for adding velocities relativistically is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, but wait. Wait, wait, because both are moving in the same direction, so their relative speed would be the difference, but considering relativity. Oh right, so astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, the speed of B would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Let me calculate that. The numerator is (0.5 - 0.6)c = (-0.1)c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c) / 0.7. Wait, but speed is a magnitude, so the negative sign just indicates direction. So it's 0.1c /0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. That rounds to 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part.

Now for the total energy. The total energy of a relativistic object is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them together.

First astronaut (2m) at 0.6c: Gamma for him is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (3m) at 0.5c: Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So energy is approx 1.1547 *3m *c². Let me calculate that: 3 * 1.1547 ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². That seems to match. Option B has a lower energy but same relative speed. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, for the relative speed, when I did (0.5 - 0.6)/(1 - 0.3) I got -0.1/0.7, which is -0.1428c. The negative means direction, but speed is positive, so 0.14c, which matches option C and D. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

The energies: let me recalculate them more accurately.

First astronaut: v = 0.6c. Beta is 0.6. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25 exactly. So energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. Beta is 0.5. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.154700539. So 3m * 1.154700539 c² is 3 * 1.1547 = approximately 3.4641 m c². Adding 2.5 gives 5.9641 m c², which is about 5.96 mc², so option C.

Looking back at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So that's the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (astronaut A) and \( v = 0.5c \) (astronaut B). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.14c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the speed is positive. Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96mc^2 \)**
