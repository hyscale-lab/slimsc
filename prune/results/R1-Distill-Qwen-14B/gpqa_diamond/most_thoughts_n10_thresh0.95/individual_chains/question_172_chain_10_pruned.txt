Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where photosynthesis happens, but wait, no, that's plants. Oh right, the photosphere is the visible outer part of a star, right? And the question is about iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, star_1 and star_2.

The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, so the excitation here refers to the energy state they're in. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. That number seems familiar—maybe related to thermal energy or something like that.

The question asks which equation correctly relates the effective temperatures T1 and T2 of the stars, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). LTE means that in each small region, the gas behaves according to the laws of thermodynamics, so the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution applies, I think.

So, how do the excitation levels relate to temperature? Oh, right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Let's call the lower energy level E1 and the excited level E2, so ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. The ratio of the populations is given: n2/n1 = 2, since star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So, does that mean the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2? Or maybe the excitation is twice as much in terms of energy? Hmm.

Wait, the question states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, I think that means the population in the excited state is higher, n2/n1 = 2 for star_1 compared to star_2. But wait, let's think again: when it says "twice as excited", it's probably the number of atoms in that higher energy level. So for star_1, the population n_i is twice that of star_2 in the same energy level. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps more accurately, the ratio of n2 to n1 for star 1 is 2, and for star 2, it's 1. Because star 2 has lower excitation.

Wait, the problem states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, for the same energy level, n2 (excited) in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, for star_1, n1_excited / n1_lower = 2, and for star_2, n2_excited / n2_lower = 1? Or wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the ratio is n2 (excited)/n1 (excited) = 2. No, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify.

Wait, the statement is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, perhaps the population in the higher energy level (excited state) for star_1 is twice that for star_2. So, (n2_high / n2_low) for star_1 is 2, and the same ratio for star_2 is 1. Or maybe the relative excitation in each star is different.

Wait, maybe each star has its own ratio. Let me think: for star_1, the ratio of the excited level to the ground level (or lower) is 2, and for star_2, it's 1. So, for each star, we can apply the Boltzmann equation.

So for star_1:
n1_high / n1_low = (g_high/g_low) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
We don't know g_high and g_low, but maybe they are same for both stars. Alternatively, if the same transition is happening, perhaps the statistical weights are the same for both stars, so g_high/g_low is the same for both.

Wait, but the problem says it's the same specific energy level, so same ΔE for both. So, perhaps both stars have the same g_high and g_low. Let's assume that.

So, the ratio for star_1 is (n1_high / n1_low) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * (g_high/g_low) ) = 2.

Similarly, for star_2, (n2_high / n2_low) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) * (g_high/g_low) ) = 1.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as many as in star_2. So maybe (n1_high)/(n1_low) = 2, and (n2_high)/(n2_low) = 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the excitation is higher in star_1, so the ratio is 2 in star_1 and 1 in star_2. So, taking the ratio of these two equations:

(n1_high / n1_low) / (n2_high / n2_low) ) = (exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) / (exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which is (2) / (1) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Wait, wait. Let me compute that.

Let me define:

For star_1: (n_high / n_low) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * (g_high/g_low) ) = 2.

For star_2: (n_high / n_low) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) * (g_high/g_low) ) = 1.

Divide these two equations:

[ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * (g_high/g_low) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) * (g_high/g_low) ) ] = 2/1

The (g_high/g_low) terms cancel out. So, exp( (-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) ) ) = 2.

That's exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ) = 2.

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

So, (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2).

Wait, let me rearrange 1/T2 - 1/T1.

That's (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, substituting back into the equation:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but what do we know about ΔE? It's given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is Boltzmann's constant, which is 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, yes. Because Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K. So ΔE is equal to k * T_diff, where T_diff is the temperature difference that causes that energy change.

Wait, but in the equation we have ΔE = 1.
