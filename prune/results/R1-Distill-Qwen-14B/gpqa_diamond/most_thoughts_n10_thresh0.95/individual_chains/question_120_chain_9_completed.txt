Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Parallax is a measure of distance; the greater the parallax (in arcseconds), the closer the star is to us. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, the smaller the parallax, the farther away the star is. Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is at 1 parsec distance, another with 0.5 parsec parallax is twice as far, right?

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed—does that mean their density is uniform? Or their number per unit volume is the same throughout space? Oh, right, in an expanding sense, if density is uniform, the number of stars in a given volume would depend on the size of that volume.

So the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like d(plx)) as plx increases or decreases.

Wait, so I need to find how N, the number of stars, depends on plx. Let's think in terms of distance. Parallax plx is related to distance d by plx = 1/d (in parsecs). So plx is inversely proportional to d.

If I consider a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell is 4πd² dr. Because it's a spherical shell, volume is surface area (4πd²) multiplied by dr.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. So N ∝ d² dr.

But since the question is about the number per unit parallax, let's express this in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Also, dr is the change in distance, but I need to relate it to a change in parallax. Let's see: if d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) d plx. Because differentiating d = 1/plx gives dd = -1/plx² d plx. The negative is because as plx increases, d decreases.

Wait, but I'm interested in the number of stars per unit plx range, so let's think in terms of plx. So the number of stars in a range of plx from plx to plx + d(plx) would be N = n * 4π d² * dr, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But since d = 1/plx, d² is 1/plx². And dr is the change in distance for a given change in plx. From earlier, dr = (-1/plx²) d plx. Hmm, but I'm taking the absolute value for the range, so I can drop the negative sign.

So substituting, N = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, wait. Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's think about the number of stars per unit volume. n is stars per cubic parsec, say. So the number of stars in a shell of radius d and thickness dr is N = 4π d² dr * n.

Now, since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So d squared is 1/plx². And dr is the change in distance for a given change in plx. Let me compute dr in terms of d plx.

Differentiating d = 1/plx, so dd = -1/(plx^2) d plx. So dr is |dd| = (1/plx^2) d plx. So substituting back into N:

N = 4 π (1/plx²) * (d plx / plx² ) * n.

So that's N = 4 π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit d plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit range of plx is inversely proportional to plx^4.

Wait, but that would make the answer A) ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Because star density is uniform, so n is constant. So N per plx interval is 4 π n (1/plx^4) d plx. So the number per unit plx (d plx) is 4 π n / plx^4. So as plx increases (we're looking at stars further away, since plx decreases with distance), the number per unit plx interval drops as 1/plx^4.

But let me think about the options. The options are in terms of the number per unit plx. So the number N per unit plx would be ~ (1/plx^4). So option A is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another approach: consider that number density is uniform, so n = constant. The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr is n * 4π d² dr. So, the number per unit dr is proportional to d². Now, since d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx². So the number per dr is proportional to 1/(plx)^2.

But the question is about the number per unit plx. So we need to find N per d plx. So let me express dr in terms of d plx.

We have plx = 1/d. So, for a small change d plx, the change in d is dr = - (1/plx^2) d plx. The negative indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. So, the number of stars per d plx is (n * 4 π d² dr ) / (d plx). Substituting dr:

= (n *4π d^2 * ( -1/plx^2 d plx )) ) / (d plx )

Wait, but perhaps taking the absolute value, and rearranging:

N per d plx = (n *4 π d² * (1/plx^2) d plx )) / (d plx )

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

The number of stars in a d plx interval is N = n * 4 π d² dr.

But dr is the distance corresponding to d plx. From plx = 1/d, so when plx changes by d plx, the change in d is dr ≈ |dd| = (1/plx^2) d plx.

So substituting:

N = n *4 π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) d plx )

= n*4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number per d plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit interval of plx decreases as 1/plx^4, so the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars \( n \) is constant.

Consider a thin spherical shell at a distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \). The volume of this shell is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \), and the number of stars in the shell is proportional to this volume: \( N \propto n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dr \).

Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we can express \( d^2 \) as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \). Additionally, the change in distance \( dr \) for a small change in parallax \( d(\text{plx}) \) is given by differentiating \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), yielding \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}) \). Taking the absolute value, \( dr = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}) \).

Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we find:

\[
N \propto n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot d(\text{plx}),
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \cdot d(\text{plx}).
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
