Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me read it again.

The first reaction is: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form a butanoic acid derivative.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed through nucleophilic substitution reactions. Butan-2-one is a ketone. So perhaps this is an example of the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right, cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide ions (CN-) in the presence of an acid catalyst. 

So the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A. NaCN provides the cyanide ion. The acid catalyst would protonate the carbonyl, making it a better electrophile. So A must be an acid, like H3O+ (which is a strong acid) or maybe something else like H2SO4. But looking at the options, the choices for A are H3O+, NaHSO3, etc.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Hmm, that's usually used in the sulfitation reaction, maybe for adding across carbonyl groups. But in the case of forming a cyanohydrin, the catalyst is typically an acid like H2SO4 or H3O+. So in the first reaction, A is probably H3O+.

Looking at the options, the options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have NaHSO3. So for the first part, the correct A is H3O+.

Moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I think nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical reagents for oxidizing nitriles to carboxylic acids are strong oxidizing agents. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other oxidizing agents like H2O2 with certain catalysts. Alternatively, in acidic conditions with HgSO4 as a catalyst, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids when using strong oxidizing agents.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the reagents. The question says that reagent B is used along with H2O. So maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. Nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions. Oh right, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using H2O and a strong acid like HCl, H2SO4, or maybe even H3O+.

Wait, the second reaction is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile becoming a 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile is turning into a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid typically requires strong acid and heat. For example, H2SO4 as a catalyst and H2O. Or, perhaps using HCl as the acid.

Looking at the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So which acid would work better here?

I remember that in nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid, the conditions are acidic. For example, using concentrated H2SO4 and heating with water. Alternatively, sometimes a catalyst like HgSO4 is used with H2SO4.

Wait, but in another scenario, using HCl might be sufficient. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses H3O+ as the acid. But in the options, the second reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, in the options, for the second reaction, reagent B is either HCl or another acid. Let's think about each possibility.

CH3COOH is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid. Would the hydrolysis require a strong acid?

I think for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, especially when it's an acidic hydrolysis, it's typically done with a strong acid like H2SO4. But HCl could also work, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses another approach.

Wait, but the product is a hydroxybutanoic acid. So the hydroxy group is still present. So the reaction is only converting the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid without affecting the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the starting material has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile. So maybe the reaction is under conditions that don't dehydrate the hydroxyl group.

So, for the second reaction: reagent B plus H2O. Let's think about possible reagents.

Option A for B is HCl. Option B is CH3COOH. So which of these would facilitate the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid?

I recall that the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done using a strong acid like HCl with H2O and heat. The reaction is often done under reflux conditions.

Alternatively, the reaction could be using H2SO4 as the acid, but that's not one of the options for B. But in our options, the B reagents are HCl or AcOH.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is not a direct hydrolysis but involves some other mechanism. Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, so nitrile → acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is using an oxidizing agent. For example, KMnO4 under acidic conditions. But in that case, the reagent would be a strong oxidizing agent and H+.

Wait, the second reagent is B, which is used with H2O. So if B is HCl, then it's HCl and H2O. That would be an acidic environment. Similarly, if B is CH3COOH, that's a weak acid.

But I'm trying to remember: to hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids, which conditions are needed. I think the hydrolysis to carboxylic acid usually requires either strong acid (like HCl) and heat or a base followed by acid workup. Alternatively, using HgSO4 as a catalyst in acidic conditions.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines is done under basic conditions (like with NH3), but for acids, it's acidic. So if the reagent is HCl, that would provide the acidic environment. So perhaps option A, where B is HCl.

Wait, but let me think about the options again. For the second reaction, which reagent B is appropriate.

Looking at the options:

Option A: B is HCl.

Option C: B is HCl.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for the second reaction, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

So if in the second reaction, the reagent is HCl, then it's likely the correct choice because HCl would provide the acidic conditions needed for the hydrolysis.

Wait, but wait another thought. How about the first reaction? If A is H3O+ in the first step, that makes sense for the cyanohydrin formation. So that would point to options A or B.

In the second reaction, if B is HCl, that would be option A or C.

But if the first reaction uses A as H3O+, and the second uses B as HCl, then that would be option A.

But wait, another thing to consider. The first reaction produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is a cyanohydrin. Wait, but in the first reaction, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN in H3O+ would form a cyanohydrin. So that's correct.

In the second reaction, 2-hydroxybutanenitrile (maybe it's not exactly that, but the point is the nitrile is converting to a carboxylic acid. So, nitrile to acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is an oxidation. Wait, but oxidation of nitriles can lead to different products. For example, under strong oxidizing conditions, nitriles can go all the way to carboxylic acids. So, perhaps using an oxidizing agent in an acidic medium.

Wait, but the options don't have oxidizing agents like KMnO4. So perhaps the second reaction is hydrolysis.

So, with that, I think that for the second reaction, the reagent would be HCl (a strong acid) and H2O. So that would be option A where B is HCl.

But looking at the options, option A is A = H3O+, B=HCl.

So that would imply that in the first reaction, H3O+ is the catalyst, and in the second, HCl is the acid.

Wait, but I remember that in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, sometimes concentrated sulfuric acid is used as a catalyst along with water and heat. But HCl as a reagent may not be the same as H2SO4.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses a different method. Another way to make carboxylic acids from nitriles is via the Stephen reduction, but that's for making aldehydes, I think. No, wait, that's for making ketones, using a different approach.

Wait, maybe the second reaction is not about the nitrile but about another group. No, the product is a butanoic acid, so the nitrile must be converted to a carboxylic acid.

Another thought: perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis under basic conditions followed by acidification. But the options don't have bases. So reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, perhaps CH3COOH might not be strong enough. So for the hydrolysis, a strong acid like HCl would be needed, making option A the correct choice.

Wait, but let me think again about the first reaction. If A is H3O+, that's correct for the cyanohydrin. So if the first part uses H3O+, then the first part is correct in options A and B.

But then, the second part: if B is HCl, that would help in the hydrolysis. So the correct option would be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol, like in the starting material, maybe the conditions affect the hydroxyl group. But I think the hydroxyl group would remain as is because the reaction is only targeting the nitrile.

So, putting it all together, A is H3O+ for the first reaction, and B is HCl for the second. That's option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a suitable acid catalyst, as it provides the necessary acidic environment for this reaction. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the presence of H₂O. This is a hydrolysis reaction, which typically requires acidic conditions. HCl is a strong acid and provides the necessary acidic environment for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. CH₃COOH, being a weak acid, is less effective for this reaction. Thus, B = HCl.

Combining these results, the correct option is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
