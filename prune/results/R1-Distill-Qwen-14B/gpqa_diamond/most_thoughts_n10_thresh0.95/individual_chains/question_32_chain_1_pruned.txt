Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I think I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Li means Lithium. Lithium typically has 3 protons since its atomic number is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Lithium-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately... I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass number, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact value. Maybe I can approximate it using the molar mass?

Wait, the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is (6 g/mol) divided by Avogadro's number, right? Avogadro's number is about 6.022e23 per mol. So 6 grams per mol divided by 6.022e23 gives the mass in grams. Let me calculate that. 6 / 6.022e23 is approximately 9.96e-24 grams. Wait, but actually, I think we can represent this in terms of atomic mass units (u). 1 u is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So, the mass of Li-6 in kg would be (6 u) * 1.6605e-27 kg/u. Let me compute that: 6 * 1.6605e-27 = 9.963e-27 kg. That's about 9.963e-27 kg.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, so we'll need to calculate the total energy, which is gamma times the rest energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute gamma first. v is 0.96c. So v² is (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². Then, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, yes. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 *0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28. What's 1 divided by 0.28? 1/0.28 is approximately 3.571428... So about 3.5714.

Then, the rest energy is mc². The mass is 9.963e-27 kg. Let me compute mc². c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So mc² = 9.963e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Calculating that: (3e8)^2 is 9e16. Multiply by 9.963e-27 kg: 9.963e-27 * 9e16 = 9.963 *9e-11 = 89.667e-11 = 8.9667e-10 J.

Wait, that's in joules. But we need to convert this to GeV because the options are in GeV.

I know that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, which is 1e9 *1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-10 J.

So, mc² is 8.9667e-10 J. To convert to GeV, divide by 1.602e-10 J/GeV.

So mc² = 8.9667e-10 / 1.602e-10 ≈ 5.6 GeV? Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 8.9667e-10 / 1.602e-10 = (8.9667 / 1.602) * (1e-10 / 1e-10) )= approximately 5.596 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of mc².

Wait, mc² = mass * c².

mass is 9.963e-27 kg.

c^2 is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So 9.963e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 9.963 *9 =89.667, times 1e-27+16=1e-11 → 89.667e-11 = 8.9667e-10 J. Yes, that's right.

Now, 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J. So 8.9667e-10 J / 1.602e-10 J/GeV = approx 5.597 GeV. So rest energy is about 5.597 GeV.

Then, the total energy is gamma times that. Gamma is about 3.5714.

So energy = 3.5714 *5.597 GeV.

Calculating that: 3.5714 *5 is 17.857, 3.5714 *0.597 = approx 2.13. So total is about 17.857 +2.13 =19.987 GeV. Hmm, but wait, let's compute it more accurately.

3.5714 *5.597:

Let's compute 3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.597: Let's compute 3.5714 *0.5 = 1.7857, 3.5714 *0.097= approx 0.346. So total is 1.7857 +0.346=2.1317.

So total is 17.857 +2.1317=20. (approx 20 GeV). But let's do a more precise multiplication.

Wait, 3.5714 *5.597:

Let me compute this step by step.

5.597 can be written as 5 +0.5 +0.097.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.5 =1.7857.

3.5714 *0.097: Let's compute 3.5714 *0.1=0.35714, subtract 3.5714 *0.003=0.0107142, so 0.35714 -0.0107142= 0.346426.

So adding all parts: 17.857 +1.7857=19.6427; 19.6427 +0.346426=19.9891 GeV.

So approximately 19.989 GeV, which is around 20 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option B is 23.069, option D is 21.419.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Because I assumed the mass of Li-6 is 6 u, but wait, the actual mass might not be exactly 6 u. Because the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy (mass defect). But wait, in this problem, do I need to use the exact mass of Li-6, or is it considered as (Z + N) u, where Z is protons and N is neutrons?

Because X is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A=6. So the mass of X is approximately 6 u. But actually, the exact mass of Li-6 is a little less than 6 u because of the mass defect. Hmm, but for this problem, maybe the assumption is to use A u for the mass. Because if we use the exact mass, the value might change a bit. But without exact data, perhaps the question expects us to use the mass as 6 u.

Wait, but then in my earlier calculation, using 6 u gives a rest energy of about 5.597 GeV. But wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is better represented in terms of the number of nucleons. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 1.0073 u (for proton) and 1.0089 u (for neutron). Wait, but in a nucleus, due to binding energy, the total mass is less than the sum of individual nucleon masses. So the mass of Li-6 would be less than 6 times the mass of a nucleon.

But perhaps the question expects us to use the mass as 6 u, ignoring the binding energy. Because otherwise, the exact mass might complicate the calculation, and without given data, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to use the mass as the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons, which would make the mass larger. But that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, but since I don't have exact data, perhaps the problem uses an approximate approach. So maybe the mass is taken as 6 u. Let me proceed with that for now.

So then, the rest energy is about 5.597 GeV, and the total energy is gamma times that, which is about 3.5714 *5.597 ≈20 GeV.

But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma. We had v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

(0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857...

Wait, but perhaps it's more accurate to use a calculator to compute 1/sqrt(0.0784). Let me see: 0.0784 is 784e-4, so sqrt(784) is 28. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.57142857...

So that's precise.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the product more accurately.

3.57142857 * 5.597.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.597.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.597.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.5 =1.785714285.

3.57142857 *0.097 = Let's compute 3.57142857 *0.09 =0.3214285713, and 3.57142857 *0.007=0.025. So total is 0.3214285713 +0.025=0.3464285713.

So 0.597 part is 1.785714285 +0.3464285713 =2.132142856.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.132142856 =19.9892857 GeV.

So that's about 19.989 GeV, which is approximately 20 GeV.

But the options don't have exactly 20. Option C is 20.132, which is higher. Hmmm. Why is that?

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the mass of the nucleus is incorrect. Let me think again about the mass of Li-6. I may have messed up the calculation earlier.

Wait, let's compute the mass more accurately. The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is needed for precise calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of a nucleon as about 0.938 GeV/c² each, since a proton or neutron has a rest mass energy of about 0.938 GeV.

Wait, but wait, each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of approximately 0.938 GeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons, the rest mass would be 6 *0.938 GeV =5.628 GeV. Hmm, that makes sense. Because earlier, using 6 u, I got about 5.597 GeV, which is close to 5.628 GeV.

Wait, so perhaps the rest energy is 5.628 GeV. Then, with gamma=3.5714, the total energy would be 3.5714 *5.628 ≈ let's compute that.

3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.628 = ?

Compute 3.5714 *0.6 =2.14284.

3.5714 *0.028=0.0999992.

Adding these: 2.14284 +0.0999992=2.2428392.

So total is 17.857 +2.2428392=20.0998392 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.100 GeV. Hmm, but the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So option C is 20.132, which is close. So perhaps my approximation is correct.

But wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is a bit less than 6 u, leading to a lower rest energy. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass in terms of the number of nucleons multiplied by 0.938 GeV.

Wait, 6 *0.938 GeV =5.628 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714, so 3.5714 *5.
