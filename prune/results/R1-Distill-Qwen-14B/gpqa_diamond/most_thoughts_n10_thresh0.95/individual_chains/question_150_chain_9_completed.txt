--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and it's reacted through a series of reagents. We need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, I should try to figure out what the original compound is based on the NMR data. Let me look at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm):
- 9.72 (t, 1H)
- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
- 6.27 (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 (d, 2H)

Hmm. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty high shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Wait, aldehyde protons usually are around 9-10 ppm and are deshielded. But wait, the splitting is a triplet; aldehyde protons are usually singlets because they don't have neighboring Hs. So maybe it's something else. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated aldehyde or maybe an enol tautomer, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating for 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring? Because the doublets suggest coupling with one neighboring proton. If each is a doublet, perhaps two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. Alternatively, maybe they're part of a substituted benzene ring, like para-substituted.

Then there's a peak at 6.27, broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchangeable protons, like -OH or something, but 2H? Maybe it's a diol or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton, but I'm not sure.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet for 2H. That's around the region for CH2 groups adjacent to something electronegative, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group, or part of an ether, or an acetate group? Or perhaps a CH2 next to a carbonyl?

Let me try to put this together. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the degrees of unsaturation can help. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, so (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= 10/2=5. So five degrees: that could be one ring and two double bonds, or a ring and a double bond plus a carbonyl, etc.

Let me think about possible structures. The presence of a high ppm peak (9.72) suggests maybe an aldehyde or a ketone, but aldehyde is more likely at higher ppm. But the splitting as a triplet is confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system, like an enol.

Wait, looking at the NMR again: the triplet at 9.72 ppm. If it's a triplet, that suggests it's coupling with two neighboring Hs. So maybe not an aldehyde. Maybe it's a vinylic proton adjacent to a CH2 group. Or perhaps a benzaldehyde with some substituents that cause coupling.

Alternatively, maybe the compound contains a nitro group or something else. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. The N could be part of a nitro group (NO2), but wait, the formula is C8H9NO, so it has one N and one O. So maybe it's an amine, amide, or something else.

Wait, the reagents they're using are first NaNO2 and HCl. That makes me think of diazotization, which is used for aryl amines. So the initial compound probably has a phenylamine group. Because diazotization occurs with primary aromatic amines under cold (0-5Â°C) conditions with NaNO2 and HCl.

So if the first reagent is NaNO2 + HCl, it's likely converting an amine to a diazonium salt. Then, the next reagent is H2O. So maybe a hydrolysis step, perhaps to form a phenol or something else.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have hydroxy groups, so that fits with hydrolysis of a diazonium salt.

Third reagent is aq KOH and heat. That sounds like a possible elimination or some kind of condensation reaction. Maybe a Robinson annulation or something else, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's a hydrolysis of a nitrile or ketene, but I'm not certain.

So the initial compound: molecular formula C8H9NO. So let's think about possible structures. Since there's a primary amine (as it gets diazotized), the structure likely has a benzene ring with an amino group attached.

Wait, the NMR doesn't show any peaks around 4-5 ppm, which is typical for NH protons. So maybe the amine is in a different form, like perhaps it's a secondary amine, but then it wouldn't react with NaNO2. Alternatively, the amine is part of a ring or something else, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a nitro group. But with NMR data, nitro groups can cause deshielding of adjacent protons, but I don't see any peaks that suggest that.

Wait, let me think again about the splitting. The triplet at 9.72 ppm. Let's imagine that the proton is next to a CH2 group. So, if the structure has a -CH2-CHO group, but the aldehyde's proton would be a triplet? Or perhaps the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system.

Alternatively, maybe the proton is part of an enol structure, where it's adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, in an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think: maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with some substituents, plus an amino group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets around 6.98 and 6.51. Those could be part of a para-substituted benzene ring. Maybe the substituent is an amino group, but then the H would be at a different shift. Alternatively, the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group like nitro, but that might cause more deshielding.

Wait, let me think of the peaks:

- 9.72 (t, 1H): perhaps a proton adjacent to a CH2 group.

- 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H): could be a para-substituted benzene where the substituent is an -OCH2CHO group or something.

Wait, another approach: Let's try to figure out the structure from the NMR.

Looking at the 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H. That's probably a CH2 next to an oxygen. Maybe a OCH2 group. So perhaps the structure has a group like OCH2-something.

The 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) could be a diol, but broad suggests exchange. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of the possible structure. Maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents. Let's consider the NMR:

- The 9.72 H is a triplet, so it's coupled to two Hs. If it's an aldehyde, it's usually a singlet. So maybe it's not an aldehyde but another type of proton.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated enol, where the proton is adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The enol form would have a proton next to a double bond, which could couple with two Hs, making a triplet.

Wait, but in that case, the 9.72 ppm might be an aldehyde. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me consider the possible reactions.

The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which is a diazotization. So the starting compound must have a primary aromatic amine group. So the structure must have an -NH2 attached to a benzene ring.

After diazotization, the next reagent is H2O. Diazonium salts in water can undergo hydrolysis. For example, a diazonium chloride in aqueous acid can hydrolyze to form a phenol. So the -NH2 group is replaced by -OH.

Then, the third reagent is aqueous KOH with heat. That could be a hydrolysis of some kind, perhaps under basic conditions. Maybe it's a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but looking at the options, they all have aldehyde or ketone groups. So perhaps the initial structure has a carbonyl group.

Wait, the starting material has the formula C8H9NO. Let's calculate the molecular weight: 12*8 + 1*9 + 14 + 16 = 96 +9 +14+16= 135 g/mol.

If the starting material is an aromatic amine with a carbonyl group, perhaps a benzaldehyde derivative with an amino group.

Wait, another approach: Let's try to imagine the structure. The NMR shows four aromatic protons. So the benzene ring has two substituents, perhaps. Because each of the doublets (6.98 and 6.51) has 2H each, that could mean two substituents on the benzene ring.

Wait, but the integral is 2H for each of those peaks, which sums to 4H. So the benzene ring has four protons, which suggests two substituents para to each other. So each substituent would take up two positions, but that's not possible. Alternatively, each substituent is in a position that causes two sets of equivalent protons.

Alternatively, the benzene ring has two substituents, each in the para position relative to each other. For example, one substituent is at position 1 and another at position 3, but that would give more complex splitting. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, resulting in two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ortho to each other, but that would give a different splitting pattern.

Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with an amino group and another substituent. Let's say the amino group is at position 1, and another substituent is at position 4, making them para. Then, the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm could correspond to the two sets of aromatic protons.

But wait, the initial compound is reacted first with NaNO2 and HCl, which suggests the presence of an aromatic amine (NH2 group). After diazotization and hydrolysis, that NH2 becomes an OH group.

So the initial compound probably has a benzene ring with an amino group and another substituent. Let's think about that.

Let me imagine the structure: a benzene ring with an -NH2 group at position 1 and another substituent, say a CH2 group attached to something else. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Looking at the other NMR peaks: the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Maybe OCH2CHO, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the structure is a 4-aminobenzaldehyde derivative. Let's say the benzene ring has an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO group attached.

But then, the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but as a triplet. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(aminophenyl)but-3-enal. So the structure would be a benzene ring with an amino group at the para position, and a chain leading to an aldehyde group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with some substituents. But the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72, which doesn't fit an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the structure is 4-aminophenylpropenal or something similar. Let me think about the possible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-aminobenzyl aldehyde. So, the benzene ring has an -NH2 group and a CH2CHO group.

In that case, the aldehyde proton would be a triplet, coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That could explain the triplet at 9.72 ppm. The CH2 group would be at 3.66 ppm as a doublet, since each H on CH2 is next to the aldehyde and each other.

So the structure might look like this: Ph-CH2-CHO, where Ph is the benzene ring with an amino group in the para position.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the carbons: benzene (6 C), CH2 (2 C?), no, wait, in Ph-CH2-CHO, that's 6 (Ph) + 3 (CH2-CHO) = 9? No, wait, molecular formula of Ph-CH2-CHO would be C8H7NO. Because benzene is C6H5, then CH2-CHO is CH2CHO (which is -CH2-CHO, so 2 carbons plus the aldehyde carbon: 3 carbons. So total is 6 + 3 =9? Wait, no, the formula would be C6H5-CH2-CHO: that's C6 + 3 = 9 C? Wait no, the molecular formula is C8H9NO.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the reaction steps.

After diazotization (step 1), the -NH2 becomes a diazonium salt. Then, step 2 is H2O. So the diazonium salt undergoes hydrolysis to form a phenol. Then, step 3 is aqueous KOH and heat. So maybe a Robinson annulation or some kind of elimination.

Wait, but let me think: the initial structure is a primary aromatic amine. After diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes a phenol. Then, when treated with aqueous KOH and heat, perhaps it's a dehydration or some condensation reaction.

Wait, another possibility: after the diazonium salt is formed, heating with water could lead to ring expansion or some kind of substitution.

Alternatively, in the presence of strong base (KOH), perhaps an elimination occurs.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to think about the options provided.

Options:
A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal
B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal
C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal
D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal

Hmm. All options are aldehydes, except option C which is a butanal (aldehyde group at end). Options A and D have enal groups (alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehydes), option B is a but-2-enal, which is also conjugated.

Wait, the initial reaction steps. Maybe the starting compound is a benzaldehyde with an amino group, and after the reactions, the amino group becomes a hydroxyl, and some rearrangement happens.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with some substituents. But I'm not sure.

Let me consider each option and see what steps would lead to them.

Suppose the starting compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2 group attached. Then, upon treatment with NaNO2 and HCl, the amine becomes a diazonium salt. Then, hydrolysis would replace the amino group with a hydroxyl group. So we'd have 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Then, step 3 is aq. KOH and heat. What happens to benzaldehyde under those conditions? Maybe nothing, but perhaps if there are other groups, like a CH2 group, it could undergo some kind of elimination.

Alternatively, if the starting structure has a CH2CHO group attached to the benzene ring, the reactions could affect that part.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is 4-amino-3-butenal. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the initial compound is a phenyl-substituted enamine. But that might be more complicated.

Wait, going back to the NMR data. The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H suggests a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom. Maybe it's attached to an oxygen. So perhaps something like OCH2-CHO.

But the aldehyde's proton is a triplet. So if we have a structure like OCH2-CHO attached to a benzene ring with an amino group, then after the reactions, the amino becomes a hydroxyl.

Let me think of the structure:

PhNH2-CH2-CHO â after NaNO2/HCl â PhN2+ Cl^- â hydrolysis â PhOH-CH2-CHO.

Wait, but that's not correct. The diazotization would replace the amino group with a diazonium group, which upon hydrolysis would become a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is 4-aminophenyl propenal. So, the benzene ring has an -NH2 group, and a propenal group (CH2=CHCHO) attached.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the NMR again.

The 9.72 ppm is a triplet, which suggests that the proton is adjacent to two equivalent protons. So perhaps it's a CH with two CH2 groups attached, but that doesn't quite make sense.

Wait, maybe the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde with a substituent that's causing coupling. For example, the structure could be something like:

Ph-CH2-C(CHO)=CH2

But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-aminobenzyl aldehyde, like Ph-CH2-CHO.

In that structure, the aldehyde proton (CHO) would be at ~9.72 ppm. It would be a triplet because it's adjacent to the CH2 group. The CH2 would be at 3.66 ppm as a doublet (since each H on CH2 is next to the other and next to the aldehyde).

The benzene ring would have an NH2 group. But wait, the NMR doesn't show any NH protons. So perhaps the NH2 is part of a more complex structure, or it's para-substituted and the protons are not visible due to symmetry or exchange.

Wait, but the NMR shows peaks at 6.98 and 6.51, each a doublet for 2H. If the benzene ring is para-substituted, the two protons on each adjacent carbon would be equivalent, leading to two doublets. That fits with a para-substituted benzene.

So the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but that would require four substituents to sum up? No, wait, the para substitution would have two substituents, each at opposite positions.

Wait, for example, substituents at positions 1 and 3 would not be para, but substituents at 1 and 4 would be meta. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the benzene has two substituents, each in the para positions relative to each other. So, substituents at positions 1 and 4? No, that's not possible for benzene with six positions. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so substituents at positions 1 and 4 are actually para to each other. So in that case, the remaining protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. These would be in two pairs of equivalent protons.

So, for a para-disubstituted benzene, each pair of equivalent protons would be a doublet if there's coupling between adjacent positions.

So, in the NMR, the 6.98 and 6.51 would correspond to the two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.

Now, considering the initial compound has an -NH2 group, which is in one of the substituents. So, the substituents on the benzene are -NH2 and another group.

The other group could be a -CH2CHO, as discussed earlier.

Putting it all together, the structure would be 4-aminobenzyl aldehyde: Ph-CH2-CHO, where Ph is the benzene ring with -NH2 at the para position.

But wait, the molecular formula would be C8H9NO. Let's check: benzene (6 C), CH2CHO adds 3 C? No, CH2CHO is CH2-CHO, which is 3 carbons (CH2, C, O), but wait, the molecular formula would be C6 (Ph) + 3 (CH2CHO) = 9 C? But the formula is C8H9NO. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CHO, but that doesn't add up to the correct formula.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2 group attached to another substituent, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2OCHO group, but that's making it more complex.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the possible products.

Looking at the options, all the products have two phenyl groups, except option D, which has one phenyl group. So perhaps the starting material has one phenyl group, and during the reaction steps, another phenyl is formed or linked.

Wait, but the starting material has the formula C8H9NO. Let's think: if it's an aromatic amine with a substituent that has a carbonyl group, then after the reactions, perhaps the substituent becomes a longer chain or a different functional group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting compound is 4-aminophenyl acetaldehyde. Structure would be Ph-CH2-CHO where Ph is 4-aminophenyl. So the formula would be C8H9NO: Ph is C6H5, then CH2CHO is 3 C (since CHO is one C). So 6 + 3 =9 C. Wait, no, the formula is C8, so that can't be. So maybe it's a shorter chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is OCH2CHO. Let me see: OCH2CHO would be O-CH2-CHO, which is 3 C. So the benzene ring plus OCH2CHO would give 6 + 3 =9 C. Again, formula is C8, so not matching.

Hmm. Maybe the substituent is a CH2CHO group, so the benzene ring (6 C) plus CH2CHO (3 C) gives 9 C, but our formula is C8. So perhaps it's a different substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CHO with a double bond. For example, CH2=CHCHO. That would be 4 C, so 6 +4=10 C. Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a carbonyl group. Like CH2-CO-something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group connected to the benzene ring. So structure like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. That would be 6 +4=10 C, which again doesn't match C8.

I'm getting stuck on the structure here. Let me think about the reaction steps again.

Reaction 1: NaNO2 and HCl â diazotization â forms a diazonium chloride.

Reaction 2: H2O â hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a phenol. So, the -NH2 becomes -OH.

Reaction 3: aq. KOH, heat â perhaps elimination or some kind of condensation.

If the starting material is a benzene ring with an amino group and a CH2CHO group, then after reaction 2, it becomes a phenol and CH2CHO group. Then, in reaction 3, under basic conditions, maybe the CH2CHO group undergoes some change.

Wait, KOH is a strong base. If the compound has a carbonyl group, perhaps it undergoes aldol condensation. But with what? If there's another carbonyl group, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2CHO group is oxidized or reduced, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: After the first two steps, the compound has a phenolic -OH group and a CH2CHO group. Then, in basic conditions, perhaps the CH2CHO group undergoes some elimination.

Wait, maybe the CH2CHO is transformed into a double bond. For example, if it's CH2CH2OCHO, elimination could form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2CHO group is converted into an enal (alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde) under basic conditions.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is 4-aminophenyl propanal. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO.

After reaction 2, we get 4-hydroxyphenyl propanal: Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO.

Then, in reaction 3, with KOH and heat, perhaps an elimination occurs to form a double bond between the two CH2 groups, leading to Ph-CH2-CH=CHO. Or perhaps between the CH2 and the aldehyde.

Wait, but that would require the right conditions for elimination. Maybe it's a dehydration, but propanal is not very prone to that. Alternatively, maybe it forms a conjugated enal.

Wait, but I'm not very confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is a secondary amine, but that wouldn't react with NaNO2.

Hmm. Another approach: Let's look at the options and see which one fits the NMR data after the reactions.

Option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH=CH-CHO, where Ph is 4-hydroxyphenyl. Wait, no, but the substituents would need to be arranged correctly.

Wait, but the final product's NMR would have peaks corresponding to the structure. Let me imagine the final product's NMR.

If the final product is an enal (alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde), the aldehyde proton would be around 9.7-10 ppm as a triplet if adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, but in an enal, the aldehyde is conjugated, so the proton would be downfield, maybe around 9.7 ppm as a triplet if coupled with two Hs on the adjacent carbon.

So in option D, 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal would have the structure Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO? Or Ph-CH2-CH=CH-CHO?

Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. So in option D, it's 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal, which would be:

Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH=CHO-CH2, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, but but-3-enal is:

CH2=CHCH2CHO.

But that's four carbons: the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the aldehyde is at C4? Wait, but but-3-enal would have the structure CH2CH2CH=CHO, but that's not possible. Wait, butenals have four carbons in the chain. So but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO, but that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, but-3-enal is CH2CH2CH2CHO with a double bond at position 3, but that's not possible because but is four carbons. So it must be CH2=CHCH2CHO, which is pent-3-enal. Maybe the option has a typo, but I'll go with the given.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH=CHO, which is 3-enal.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think about the steps again.

If the initial compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde (Ph-NH2-CHO), but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, another approach: the initial NMR has a triplet at 9.72 ppm, which could be an aldehyde's proton. So perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative. After the reactions, it becomes a phenolic aldehyde with some rearrangement.

Wait, but the reaction steps are diazotization, hydrolysis, then KOH and heat.

Another possibility: the starting material is a benzylamine derivative with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the initial structure is 4-aminophenyl acetaldehyde. Structure: Ph-CH2-CHO. Then, after reaction 1 and 2, it becomes Ph-OH-CH2-CHO. Then, in reaction 3, perhaps the CH2CHO is converted into a double bond, forming Ph-CH=CHO.

So the final product would be 4-hydroxyphenyl propenal or something similar.

But looking at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH=CH-CHO? That's five carbons, which doesn't fit C8H9NO.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me recount the NMR peaks again.

The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are each 2H, doublets. So that's a para-substituted benzene, with two sets of equivalent protons. So the substituent is in the para position, and each set of aromatic protons is a doublet.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That likely corresponds to a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. So perhaps the structure has a OCH2-CHO group attached to the benzene.

Putting it together, the initial structure is 4-aminophenyl OCH2CHO. But that would give a formula of C6H5NH2-O-CH2-CHO â C9H11NO2. Which doesn't match the given formula C8H9NO.

Hmm, perhaps it's a different substituent.

Wait, I'm clearly stuck. Let me think about what the reactions are doing.

Reaction 1: Diazotization â converts -NH2 to -N2+ which then becomes water to form -OH.

Reaction 2: H2O â hydrolysis to form phenol.

Reaction 3: KOH and heat â perhaps elimination.

So, the starting material has an amino group, which becomes a hydroxyl after step 2. Then, step 3 is under basic conditions, which might induce elimination if there's a suitable leaving group.

But in the starting material, perhaps there's a good leaving group next to the amino group. For example, a nitro group or a tosyl group. But the starting material's formula doesn't include any nitro groups (as it's C8H9NO, with one N and one O).

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenyl acetate. Structure: Ph-NH2-OAc. But that would have a higher molecular weight and more oxygens.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material has a methyl group adjacent to the amino group, which could undergo elimination.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

Option B is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. So that's a but-2-enal (CH2=CHCH2CHO) with two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups attached at positions 2 and 4.

Wait, but but-2-enal would have the double bond between C1 and C2, so the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. But that's four carbons. How would two phenyl groups attach to that?

Option B: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. So the structure would be:

Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO-Ph-O?

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH=CH-CHO-Ph.

Wait, but that would give a longer chain, and I'm not sure about the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH=CH-CHO with another Ph attached elsewhere.

But I'm getting confused.

Another thought: the initial compound after hydrolysis has a phenol group. Then, in the presence of KOH and heat, perhaps an aldol condensation occurs between two carbonyl groups, but I don't see where the second carbonyl would come from.

Wait, maybe the starting material has two amino groups, but that's unlikely since it's a primary amine.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a secondary amine, but NaNO2 typically reacts with primary amines.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a primary amine with a side chain that can form a ring upon elimination.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should conclude that option D is the correct answer, as it's a single phenyl group with an enal structure.

Wait, the initial NMR has 4 aromatic protons, suggesting two substituents on the benzene. So the starting material might have a benzene ring with two substituents: an amino group and another group that includes the rest of the molecule.

After the reactions, the amino group becomes a hydroxyl, and the other group is transformed into an enal.

So the final product would have a phenol group and an enal group. Looking at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So that's a but-3-enal (double bond between C3 and C4) with a 4-hydroxyphenyl group attached at position 4.

But wait, but-3-enal is CH2CH2CH2CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4? That's not possible because but is four carbons. So but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps the structure is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it CH2CH=CHCHO, which would be but-2-enal.

But regardless, if the final product has a phenol group and an enal, then option D could be the correct structure.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.


The compound has the molecular formula **C8H9NO**, and the NMR data provides key insights into its structure. The **9.72 ppm triplet (1H)** suggests a proton coupled to two equivalent protons, likely an aldehyde proton. The **6.98 ppm (d, 2H)** and **6.51 ppm (d, 2H)** indicate a para-substituted benzene ring, as the splitting pattern corresponds to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. The **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)** could represent exchangeable protons, possibly from a hydroxyl group. The **3.66 ppm (d, 2H)** suggests a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen.

The reaction sequence involves:
1. **NaNO2 + HCl**: This reagent is used for diazotization, indicating the presence of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) in the starting compound.
2. **H2O**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the -NH2 group with a -OH group, forming a phenol.
3. **aq. KOH, Heat**: Under basic conditions, elimination or rearrangement occurs, likely forming an enal (Î±,Î²-unsaturated aldehyde).

The final product must contain a phenol group and an enal structure. Among the options:

- **Option A (2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal)**: This structure does not match the NMR data, as it lacks the phenol group formed during hydrolysis.
- **Option B (2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal)**: This structure has two phenol groups, but the NMR data does not support the presence of two para-substituted benzene rings.
- **Option C (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal)**: This structure includes two phenol groups and a butanal, but the NMR data does not match the expected splitting patterns for such a compound.
- **Option D (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal)**: This structure features a single para-substituted benzene ring with a phenol group and an enal, consistent with the NMR data and the reaction sequence.

The reaction sequence converts the starting compound into an enal with a phenol group, matching the description of **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal**.
