Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the normalized eigenvector's elements from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that for spin-½ particles, the Pauli matrices are used. The operator P here seems to be the momentum operator or maybe the spin operator, but since it's for a muon, perhaps it's spin. But wait, the problem says it's a quantum mechanical operator, so perhaps P is the angular momentum operator, like L or S.

Wait, the components are given as Px, Py, Pz. Each is (ħ/2) times a matrix. For example, Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled. Pz is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix scaled. So P is a spin-½ operator, so the eigenvector would correspond to spin up or down along some direction.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means that the direction lies somewhere in the x-z plane, so the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ would be 0 or π, because in the x-z plane, the projection onto y is zero. Wait, no, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so φ could be anything, but maybe it's zero for simplicity? Or perhaps it doesn't matter because the eigenvector depends on the direction n.

Wait, the operator we're considering is P along direction n. So the operator is P · n hat, which is the sum of each component multiplied by the direction's components. So if n is in the x-z plane, n hat can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or wait, no. Wait, the standard spherical coordinates have n as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since the direction is in x-z, the y-component is zero. So cosφ = 1 or 0? Wait, no. If the direction is in x-z plane, then φ is either 0 or π, so cosφ = ±1, but sinφ = 0. So n hat would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if φ=0, or (-sinθ, 0, cosθ) if φ=π. But wait, is that correct? Let me think: the unit vector in spherical coordinates is given by (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). So if the direction is in the x-z plane, that implies that the y-component is zero. So sinθ sinφ must be zero. Which implies that either sinθ is zero (which would put us at the poles, along z) or sinφ is zero, which implies φ=0 or φ=π. So yes, n hat is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) for φ=0, or (-sinθ, 0, cosθ) for φ=π. But since the direction is arbitrary in x-z, the eigenvector would depend on θ and perhaps φ, but maybe the problem simplifies it by taking φ=0.

So the operator P along n would be P_n = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). Since n is in x-z, n_y=0, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each P component is (ħ/2) times their respective Pauli matrices. So P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, P_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z. So substituting:

P_n = (n_x (ħ/2) σ_x) + (n_z (ħ/2) σ_z) )

We can factor out ħ/2:

P_n = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z )

Now, since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Wait, no, because n is in x-z, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1? Wait, no, because n is a unit vector, so (n_x)^2 + (n_y)^2 + (n_z)^2 =1. But n_y=0, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ if φ=0. But perhaps more accurately, since n is in x-z, n_x = sinθ cosφ, and n_z = cosθ, but since φ is 0 or π, as discussed earlier.

But perhaps the exact values of n_x and n_z aren't needed because we can work with the operator in terms of n_x and n_z.

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, because the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2.

So, (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) |ψ> = (1) |ψ>

Because when we factor ħ/2, the equation becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + ...) |ψ> = (ħ/2)(+1) |ψ>, so the matrix part multiplied by |ψ> equals |ψ>.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So:

n_x σ_x = [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]
n_z σ_z = [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]

Adding them gives the matrix:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the matrix M is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

We have M |ψ> = |ψ>

So to find the eigenvector, we solve (M - I) |ψ> = 0

That is,

( [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ] ) * [a, b]^T = 0

Which gives equations:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0

We can take the first equation:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → equation (1)

From equation (1), let's express a in terms of b (or vice versa). Let's solve for a:

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ) ] b

Wait, but let's check if the two equations are consistent. Let me substitute a into equation (2):

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0 → substituting a from equation (1):

n_x [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ) b ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Factor out b:

[ -n_x^2/(n_z -1) ) + (-n_z -1) ] b = 0

Multiply numerator:

[ (-n_x^2) - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) ) ] / (n_z -1) ) b =0

The denominator is (n_z -1), and the numerator is:

-n_x^2 - (n_z^2 -1 )

But since n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1 (since they are components of a unit vector in x-z), n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.

Substituting:

-n_x^2 = - (1 -n_z^2)

So the numerator becomes:

- (1 -n_z^2 ) - (n_z^2 -1 ) = -1 +n_z^2 -n_z^2 +1 = 0.

So the equation is 0/(n_z -1) )=0, which holds. So the two equations are consistent, and the eigenvectors are determined by a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me recheck.

Wait, the matrix M is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Wait, actually, when we set M |ψ> = |ψ>, the equation is [ (n_z a + n_x b ), (n_x a - n_z b) ) ] = [ a, b ]

So the first component equation is n_z a +n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0

Second component equation: n_x a -n_z b = b → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0

Which is the same as before.

So from equation 1:

a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z - 1 )

Wait, let me write this as a = [n_x/(1 - n_z) ] b, because n_z -1 = -(1 -n_z), so it's the same as (n_x/(1 -n_z)) ) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [a, b]^T = [ (n_x/(1 -n_z)) b, b ]

We can factor out b: [n_x/(1-n_z) , 1 ]^T * b

So the eigenvector is proportional to (n_x/(1-n_z), 1 )

Wait, but let me check whether this makes sense when n_z is 1. Wait, if n_z is 1, then 1-n_z=0, which would cause a division by zero. But if n_z=1, that means the direction is along +z, so the operator is P_z.

In that case, P_z has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, and the eigenvectors are (1,0) for +ħ/2 and (0,1) for -ħ/2. So in this case, if n_z=1, the eigenvector is (1,0), which matches when we take n_x=0, so (0/(1-1), 1 ) → (0,1), but wait, that would be for the eigenvalue -1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Because when n_z =1, our direction is along +z, so the eigenvalue equation is P_z |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>

So M would be [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the equation is:

(1 a + 0 b, 0 a -1 b ) = (a, b )

Which leads to:

a = a (from 1a =a → no info)

- b = b → which implies b=0.

So the eigenvector is (a, 0), which is (1,0) after normalization. So when n_z=1, the expression I had earlier gives a= [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b. But n_x is zero, so a=0. So the vector would be (0, b), but that's the negative eigenvalue case. So perhaps I should take the other direction in terms of the eigenvalue.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvalue is +1, which would correspond to the +z direction. So when n_z=1, the eigenvector is (1,0), which would require that in our expression, a=1, b=0.

But according to a= [n_x/(1-n_z)] b, when n_z=1, denominator is zero, but n_x is zero, so 0/0, which is undefined. So perhaps that approach isn't suitable for n_z=1. Maybe I should consider another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvector by noting that for a spin-½ system, the eigenstates along an arbitrary direction n are given by:

|ψ> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) ]^T 

Wait, that's the standard spin-up state along direction (θ, φ). But since our direction is in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π, but perhaps for simplicity, it's 0, so the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

But wait, this would be the case for the eigenstate of S·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but how does that relate to the matrix M we have here? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the eigenvector as |ψ> = [a, b]^T, which when normalized, gives |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

The condition is (M - I)|ψ> =0, which gives the equations:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → equation (1)

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0 → equation (2)

From equation (1), let's express a in terms of b:

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

= [ n_x / (1 - n_z) ] b

Substituting into equation (2):

n_x [n_x/(1 -n_z) ) b ] + (-n_z -1) b =0

Multiply out:

[ n_x^2/(1 -n_z) ) + (-n_z -1) ] b = 0

Since b can't be zero (otherwise trivial solution), the term in brackets must be zero:

n_x^2/(1 -n_z) ) + (-n_z -1 ) =0

Multiply both sides by (1 -n_z):

n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z) )=0

Expanding the second term:

(-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z) = (-1)(n_z +1)(1 -n_z) )

Alternatively, compute it as:

(-n_z -1)(1 -n_z ) = (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z )

= -n_z + n_z^2 -1 + n_z

Simplify: (-n_z +n_z) cancels. So we have n_z^2 -1.

So the equation becomes:

n_x^2 + (n_z^2 -1) )=0 → n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 → which is true since n is a unit vector. So the condition holds, which means that equation (1) suffices to find the eigenvector.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [n_x/(1-n_z), 1 ]^T.

But wait, the components of the eigenvector are a and b. So the vector can be written as [n_x/(1 -n_z), 1 ] multiplied by some constant.

But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it. Let's compute the norm squared:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = |n_x|^2 / (1 -n_z)^2 + 1.

But wait, n_x^2 + n_z^2=1, so n_x^2=1 -n_z^2.

Substituting, the norm squared is (1-n_z^2)/(1 -n_z)^2 +1.

Simplify (1-n_z^2) = (1-n_z)(1+n_z), so:

( (1-n_z)(1+n_z) ) / (1-n_z)^2 ) +1 = (1+n_z)/(1-n_z) ) + 1.

Combine the terms:

[ (1 +n_z) + (1-n_z) ] / (1 -n_z) ) = [2 ]/(1 -n_z )

So the norm is sqrt(2/(1 -n_z )) )

Wait, but this seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of θ, since n is in the x-z plane.

As n is in x-z, let's set n_z = cosθ, and n_x = sinθ. Since for the +z direction, θ=0, and for -z, θ=π, and in x direction θ=π/2.

So substituting, n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ.

So the eigenvector components are:

a = [ sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ ) * b 

Wait, because a = [n_x/(1-n_z)] b = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b.

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) * b

Simplify: a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b → a = cot(θ/2) * b.

So the vector becomes:

[ a, b ] = [ cot(θ/2) b, b ]

Factor out b: [ cot(θ/2), 1 ] * b.

To normalize, compute the norm squared:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(θ/2)|^2 |b|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 [ cot²(θ/2) +1 ].

But cot²x +1 = csc²x, so |b| = 1/sin(θ/2), since |b|^2 csc²(θ/2) =1 → |b|=sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2) ] 

Simplify cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) = cos(θ/2).

So the normalized vector becomes [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, that's familiar. So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this.

Option B is (cosθ, e^{i phi} sinθ ), which looks like a spherical harmonic but for spin-1 perhaps, not spin-½.

Option D has square roots and factors of ħ, which I don't see in our result. Also, the eigenvectors are dimensionless, so any presence of ħ would be odd. So perhaps the options were written without considering that the eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the options are:

A) (√(2/3) ℏ, √(1/3) ℏ )

B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ )

C) (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) )

D) ( √(2/3) ℏ cos(θ/2), √(1/3) ℏ sin(θ/2) )

Wait, but in the options, A and D have factors of ℏ, which shouldn't be there because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So perhaps the problem statement may have a typo, but perhaps the operators are given in terms of ℏ, but the eigenvector doesn't contain ℏ.

So among the options, option C seems to fit our result. But wait, let me think again. The normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ], which is option C.

But wait, does this match the direction n in the x-z plane? Because if n is in x-z, then θ is measured from the z-axis, so the eigenvector should be in terms of θ. So option C is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: The eigenvector we found is for eigenvalue +1 (in the equation M |ψ> = |ψ>). So when you have P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, which is correct because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So the answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The goal is to determine the normalized eigenvector from the provided options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Operator Setup**:  
   The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} = \hbar/2 \cdot \vec{\sigma}$, where $\vec{\sigma}$ represents the Pauli matrices. The components are:
   - $P_x = \hbar/2 \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
   - $P_y = \hbar/2 \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
   - $P_z = \hbar/2 \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

   The operator along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z$, where $\hat{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$ is the unit vector along $\vec{n}$. Substituting the components of $\vec{P}$, the operator becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the equation simplifies to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   This gives the system of equations:
   \[
   (n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
   \]

3. **Solving for the Eigenvector**:  
   From the first equation, solve for $a$ in terms of $b$:
   \[
   a = \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} b.
   \]
   Substituting this into the second equation confirms consistency. The eigenvector can thus be written as:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} \propto \begin{bmatrix} \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Normalizing the eigenvector, the final normalized eigenvector is:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix},
   \]
   where $\theta$ is the polar angle of the direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Includes factors of $\hbar$, which are not part of the normalized eigenvector. Incorrect.  
   - **Option B**: Represents a general spherical harmonic form but does not match the spin-½ eigenvector structure. Incorrect.  
   - **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$. Correct.  
   - **Option D**: Includes factors of $\hbar$ and additional square roots, which are not consistent with the normalized eigenvector. Incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

Answer: C
