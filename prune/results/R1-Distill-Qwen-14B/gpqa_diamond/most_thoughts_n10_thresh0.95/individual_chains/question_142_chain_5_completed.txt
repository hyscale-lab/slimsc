Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that can't be the entire matrix, right? Because |0⟩ and |1⟩ are basis states for qubits. Let me write out what this matrix looks like.

Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix that has 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in (1,1). So adding those two matrices together would give a diagonal matrix with 1s in both (0,0) and (1,1) positions. But wait, when you multiply by 1/2, each of those becomes 1/2. So the density matrix ρ should be:

[ [0.5, 0],
  [0, 0.5] ]

Is that right? Yeah, because each term is multiplied by 1/2.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that density matrices can be represented as points in a 3-dimensional space, corresponding to the Bloch sphere. The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit is a 2x2 matrix, which can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components (x, y, z).

The Bloch vector representation is given by:

ρ = (I + r·σ) / 2,

where I is the identity matrix, σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z), which has to satisfy |r| ≤ 1.

So, let's set up the equation:

ρ = (I + r·σ) / 2.

Our given ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Let me write out I and the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], and the Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, r·σ is r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz.

Putting it together, (I + r·σ)/2 becomes:

(1/2) * [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
           [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ]

Comparing this to our given ρ, which is:

[[0.5, 0],
 [0, 0.5]]

So, when we compare the elements:

- The diagonal elements (0,0) and (1,1) of ρ must be 0.5 each.
Looking at the (0,0) component of (I + r·σ)/2, that's (1 + r_z)/2. This equals 0.5, so:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, the (1,1) component is (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5. Substituting r_z=0, we get (1-0)/2=0.5, which is correct.

Now, the off-diagonal terms. In ρ, both off-diagonals are 0. Let's look at the (0,1) element of (I + r·σ)/2. That's (r_x - i r_y)/2. And this must equal 0.

So,

(r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x - i r_y = 0.

This implies both real and imaginary parts are zero. So, r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.

So putting it all together, r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0. So the vector r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but wait a minute. The density matrix I have here is the maximally mixed state. That makes sense because it's a completely mixed state, which lies at the center of the Bloch sphere, so the Bloch vector is zero.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This corresponds to the matrix:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} 
0.5 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0.5 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Density matrices for single qubits can be represented as points in a 3-dimensional space using the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \), where the density matrix is expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

with \( I \) being the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) being the vector of Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} \) satisfying \( |\mathbf{r}| \leq 1 \).

Expanding \( \rho \) in terms of the Pauli matrices:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 
1 + z & x - i y \\ 
x + i y & 1 - z 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \( \rho \), we find:

1. The diagonal elements \( \rho_{00} = 0.5 \) and \( \rho_{11} = 0.5 \) imply:
   \[
   \frac{1 + z}{2} = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z = 0.
   \]

2. The off-diagonal elements \( \rho_{01} = 0 \) and \( \rho_{10} = 0 \) imply:
   \[
   \frac{x - i y}{2} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 0, \, y = 0.
   \]

Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to the maximally mixed state, located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \mathbf{r} = (1, 1, 0) \): Incorrect, as this does not match the derived Bloch vector.**

**B) \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 1) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a state along the \( z \)-axis, not the maximally mixed state.**

**C) \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \): Correct, as this matches the derived Bloch vector for the given density matrix.**

**D) \( \mathbf{r} = (1, 1, 1) \): Incorrect, as this does not match the derived Bloch vector.**

Answer: C
