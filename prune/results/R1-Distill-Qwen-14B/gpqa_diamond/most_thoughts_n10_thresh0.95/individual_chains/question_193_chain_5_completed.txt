Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by the parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, so number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax is related to distance, so maybe I can connect that to how the number of stars changes with distance.

Wait, parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance. Oh right, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So plx is in parsecs, I think. So if plx is small, the distance is large, and vice versa.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So we're looking for the relationship between N and r, where r is the distance.

So let's start by expressing N in terms of distance. Since N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5.

Let me compute that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 divided by that would be d^5. Because 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure.

Wait, 1/(plx)^5 is the same as (d)^5 because plx is 1/d. So N = k * (d)^5, where k is some constant.

But wait, the question isn't directly about N versus d. It's about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe I'm thinking about the differential here. Like, how does N change as r (distance) increases by a small amount.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the density of stars at a certain distance. Because if N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit volume would be different, but perhaps the question is considering a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If you imagine a small volume element at a distance d, with thickness dr, then the number of stars in that volume would depend on the density of stars multiplied by the volume. So the number of stars dN would be the density rho(d) multiplied by the volume element.

But wait, the problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, so N is proportional to d^5.

Wait a minute, but that's the total number of stars up to a certain distance, right? Or is it the density? Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume (density) is what's given. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Since plx is 1/d, then N = k * d^5.

But that would imply that as distance d increases, the number of stars goes up as d^5. But that doesn't make sense because stars are more dense in the galaxy's disk, so the farther you go, the fewer stars you'd expect. Wait, but perhaps this is a specific region, maybe where the density actually increases with distance? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the number of stars per unit distance, or per some other measure. Let me think about it. Wait, the problem says 'the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5'. So let's model this as N ∝ 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to d^5, because plx = 1/d.

So, if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases rapidly. But that seems counterintuitive because I would expect the number of stars to decrease with distance as we look farther away, but perhaps in this specific region, it's the opposite.

But the question isn't about N as a function of d, but how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance. So perhaps we're being asked about the derivative of N with respect to d.

Wait, so if N = k d^5, then dN/dr (the change in N with respect to r) is 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would go as d^4.

Wait, but the options are about how it changes with r. So for a given unit change in r (distance), how does the number change? If N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4. Looking at the options, option C is ~r^4.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The question says, 'how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?' So per unit r, how does the number change. So perhaps it's the derivative, the rate of change of N with respect to r.

Earlier, I thought that N is proportional to r^5, so dN/dr is 5 r^4, which would be option C. So the answer would be C) ~ r^4.

But wait, let me think again. Another approach: the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r with thickness dr is approximately the surface density (stars per unit area) multiplied by the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is 4π r² dr (since it's a thin spherical shell).

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that the region is a sphere. It's a specific region of the sky, which might imply a thin slice, not a spherical shell. Hmm, perhaps it's better to model it as a thin cylindrical shell or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the number of stars per unit area (surface density) varies with parallax as 1/plx^5.

Wait, that would make more sense. Because if you have a surface density (stars per square parsec) as sigma = k / plx^5, then substituting plx = 1/d gives sigma = k d^5.

Wait, but that would mean the surface density increases with distance as d^5, which seems odd because I would expect density to decrease with distance from the galactic plane. But perhaps this is a region where density increases with distance, maybe an annulus or something. But regardless, let's proceed.

If sigma, the surface density, is k d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness dr (in distance) would be sigma multiplied by the area of the shell. The area of the shell (in terms of distance) at distance r with thickness dr is 2π r dr multiplied by the solid angle. Wait, no, that's for a spherical shell. But since the problem is about a specific region of the sky, perhaps we're considering a column density, meaning that we're looking along our line of sight. So maybe the correct approach is to model it as a column density.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that N varies as 1/plx^5, and we need to find how N changes with distance.

Let me re-express N in terms of distance. Since plx = 1/d, N = k * d^5.

Wait, but if N is the total number of stars up to distance d, that would be N = k d^5. Then, the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) would be dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the change in the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., the rate at which stars appear as you go further) is proportional to d^4, so option C.

Alternatively, if N is the number of stars per unit volume, then the density rho is proportional to 1/plx^5 = d^5. But that seems unlikely because higher density would mean more stars in a given volume, but when you're looking at a region of the sky, perhaps the volume is considered as a function of distance.

Wait, perhaps I should model the number of stars in a small volume element. Let's say the volume element is a cylinder of length dr and radius R, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr. So the volume would be 4π r² dr (if it's a spherical shell), but again, the question is about a region in the sky, which is more like a thin slice, so maybe the volume is 2π r dr times the width of the region, but perhaps that's getting too detailed.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is the surface density sigma(r) multiplied by the area of the shell, which would be 2π r dr for a cylindrical shell, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, assuming sigma(r) is the number of stars per unit area, and sigma is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is d^5. Then, the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r with thickness dr in distance is sigma(r) * (2π r dr). So N_shell = k d^5 * 2π r dr.

Wait, but r is the distance, so r = d, so N_shell = 2π k d^6 dr.

Wait, that would make the number of stars in a thin shell proportional to d^6 times dr. So the rate of change of stars with distance, dN/dr, would be proportional to d^6. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A: r^3, B: r^5, C: r^4, D: r^2.

Hmm, that suggests I'm making a mistake in my approach. Let me try another way.

Perhaps the expression N ∝ 1/plx^5 is for the number per unit volume, not the total. So if rho is the number density (stars per cubic parsec), then rho = k / plx^5 = k (d)^5.

Then, the number of stars in a volume element dV at distance d would be rho * dV. If the volume element is a thin shell, dV is 4π d^2 dr. So N_shell = rho * dV = k d^5 * 4π d^2 dr = 4π k d^7 dr.

So the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to d^7, which isn't any of the options. This approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was better. Let me go back. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k / plx^5 = k d^5.

So N is the total number of stars up to distance d. Then, the number of stars between d and d+dr is dN = k [ (d+dr)^5 - d^5 ].

Expanding this using binomial approximation, (d+dr)^5 ≈ d^5 + 5 d^4 dr. So dN ≈ k (5 d^4 dr). So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is approximately 5 k d^4. So the change in number with distance is proportional to d^4, which is option C.

So the correct answer would be option C, ~r^4.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \), where \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \) (with \( d \) being the distance). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), the relationship becomes \( N \propto d^5 \). This implies that the total number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Starting with \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4.
\]

This shows that the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars in the region of the sky changes with distance as \( r^4 \).

The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
