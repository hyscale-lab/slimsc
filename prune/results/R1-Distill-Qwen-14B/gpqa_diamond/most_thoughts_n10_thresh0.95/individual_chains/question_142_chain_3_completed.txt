Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, not entirely sure what that means, but let's break it down.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed, meaning it's in a statistical mixture of pure states.

Wait, what's a density matrix for a pure state versus a mixed state? Oh right, a pure state has a density matrix that's a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and its trace is 1. A mixed state is a statistical mixture, so it's a convex combination of projectors. Here, ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Each of those terms is a projector, and they're being averaged with equal weights. So this is a mixed state with equal probability in |0⟩ and |1⟩. That makes sense; it's a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm not exactly clear on what that refers to. Maybe it's about the Bloch sphere representation. I remember that qubit states can be represented on a Bloch sphere, where pure states are points on the surface and mixed states are inside. But how does the density matrix tie into that?

The Bloch vector representation comes to mind. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) that determines the state's position. The length of r determines how mixed or pure the state is. For a pure state, r has length 1, and for a completely mixed state, r is zero.

Wait, in this case, our ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute this. Let me write out the matrix form. |0⟩ is [[1,0]^T, and |1⟩ is [[0,1]^T. So |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, ρ is (1/2)*I, since (1/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]] is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. So ρ is the maximally mixed state.

If I express this in terms of the Bloch vector, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's set them equal:

( I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2 = ( I ) / 2.

So, (I/2) + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2 = I/2. 

Subtracting I/2 from both sides gives (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2 = 0. Multiply both sides by 2, we get r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z = 0. Since σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices, which are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So for the sum r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z to equal zero matrix, each coefficient must be zero. That is:

r_x = 0
r_y = 0
r_z = 0

Wait, but wait a second. Because when you have a density matrix, it's often written in terms of the Bloch vector, which for a completely mixed state would have r = (0,0,0). Because the identity matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is the maximally uncertain state, represented at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

So the vector r is (0,0,0), which would correspond to option C. Let me double-check the options.

The options are:
A) r=(1,1,0)
B) r=(0,0,1)
C) r=(0,0,0)
D) r=(1,1,1)

So the correct answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To analyze its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch vector representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. The length of \(\mathbf{r}\) determines the purity of the state, with \(\|\mathbf{r}\| = 1\) for pure states and \(\|\mathbf{r}\| = 0\) for the maximally mixed state.

For the given \(\rho\), expanding the matrix shows that it is equivalent to \(\frac{I}{2}\), meaning the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must satisfy \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies \(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), and \(r_z = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided:
- **A)** \(r = (1, 1, 0)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B)** \(r = (0, 0, 1)\): Incorrect, as this represents a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not the maximally mixed state.
- **C)** \(r = (0, 0, 0)\): Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state.
- **D)** \(r = (1, 1, 1)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).
