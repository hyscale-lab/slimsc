Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M (that's 0.01 M), and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, okay, so I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β1 is for the first complex, probably [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)₂]^(2+), β3 is [Co(SCN)3]^3-, and β4 is [Co(SCN)4]^4- maybe? Wait, but the question mentions 'dithiocyanato' complexes, which would be Co with two SCN- ligands, so that would be β2, I think.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The dithiocyanato would be the complex with two SCN- ions. So that would correspond to the second complex, which has a stability constant β2=40.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I remember that different Co(II) complexes have different colors. The blue one is probably the [Co(SCN)₂]^(2+) complex, which is a deep blue color. So that's the β2 complex.

So the first step is to find the distribution of the different Co complexes in the solution. The distribution depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The idea is that the more stable a complex is (higher β), the more of it will form.

But wait, how do I calculate the fraction of each complex? I think I need to use the stability constants and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^- to find the fraction of each complex.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the formula:

f_n = (β_n * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n) / (sum over all m of (β_m * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^m) )

Wait, but wait: the formation of each complex is stepwise. So for each n (number of SCN- per Co^2+), the formation goes through each step. So the overall formation constant for each complex is the product of the stepwise constants up to that point. Wait, no. No, the β given are the overall stability constants, not stepwise. Or are they stepwise?

Wait, I think in this case the β values are the overall stability constants. Because stepwise formation constants would be different. Hmm. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Stability constants (also called formation constants) can be either overall or sequential (stepwise). In this case, I think the β values given are the overall constants. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2+n-), the stability constant βn is the overall constant, which is the product of the stepwise constants up to that n.

Wait, but in some cases, like for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2+n-), the overall βn is the product of the stepwise β1, β2, ..., βn. But I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each complex as a separate species. Let me think: the complexes are Co(SCN)_0: Co^2+ (n=0), Co(SCN)_1: [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), Co(SCN)_2: [Co(SCN)₂]^(2+) (n=2), Co(SCN)_3: [Co(SCN)_3]^3- (n=3), and Co(SCN)_4: [Co(SCN)_4]^4- (n=4).

Wait, but the problem states the stability constants as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]).

Similarly, β2 is [Co(SCN)₂^(2+)] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2). So each βn is the overall constant for that specific complex.

So the fraction of each species (n) is calculated by:

f_n = [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)_1] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4])

But each complex's concentration is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n / (denominator term)

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think.

The general expression for each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, no, that might not be right. Because each βn is independent. Wait, perhaps the correct expression is to write the fraction of each complex as:

f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum from m=0 to 4 of (βm [SCN^-]^m) )

Wait, because when you have [Co^2+] as the base, the fraction of each complex is the product of βn and [SCN^-]^n, divided by the sum of all such terms for each m. Because the total concentration of Co is the sum of all species, which can be written as [Co^2+] = [Co(SCN)_0], and [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [SCN^-]^n [Co^2+] / (β0 + β1 [SCN^-] + ... + β4 [SCN^-]^4 ), but β0 is 1 (since [Co^2+] = [Co(SCN)_0] = β0 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^0 * [SCN^-]^0, but β0 is 1).

So the fraction f_n is (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, that makes sense because β0 is 1, and the denominator is sum of βm [SCN^-]^m for m=0 to 4.

So for each complex n, the fraction is f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 βm [SCN^-]^m )

But wait, in this problem, the [Co^2+] is 0.01 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So [SCN^-] is not 1 M, which complicates things because the usual assumption is that [SCN^-] is much higher than [Co^2+], so that [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M.

But in this setup, the denominator is the sum over all the terms βm [SCN^-]^m, and for each m, [Co(SCN)_m] = βm [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^m / denominator.

Wait, but perhaps an alternative way is to model the distribution using the conditional formation constants. Hmm, but perhaps I can just compute each term in the denominator.

So let's compute each term for m=0 to m=4.

Given:

β0 = 1 (since [Co^2+] = [Co^2+] * β0 * [SCN^-]^0 )

m=0: β0 [SCN^-]^0 = 1 * 1 = 1.

m=1: β1 [SCN^-]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

m=2: β2 [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

m=3: β3 [SCN^-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063.

m=4: β4 [SCN^-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016.

Sum all these terms: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016.

Let me add them up step by step.

1 + 0.9 = 1.9.

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3.

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363.

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

Now, for each m, the term is βm [SCN^-]^m. So for the fraction of each complex, it's (βm [SCN^-]^m) / 2.3646.

Wait, but wait. Because [Co(SCN)_n] is given by βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n divided by the denominator.

Wait, but since [Co^2+] is given as 0.01 M, and the sum of all complexes is [Co^2+] = 0.01 M.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The fraction f_n is the concentration of each complex divided by the total concentration of Co. So:

f_n = [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co_total]

[Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)_1] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4}

But [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So [Co_total] = [Co^2+] (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Which is [Co^2+] multiplied by the denominator term we calculated earlier, 2.3646.

So the fraction f_n = [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co_total] = (βn [SCN^-]^n) / denominator.

So for each n, compute (βn [SCN^-]^n) / 2.3646, and that gives the fraction.

So now, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), so n=2.

So compute f_2 = (β2 [SCN^-]^2) / 2.3646.

β2 =40, [SCN^-]^2 = 0.1^2 = 0.01.

So numerator for f_2 is 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

Denominator is 2.3646.

f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1693, or 16.93%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that would be the answer?

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the given options are A) 42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So according to this, D is correct. But wait, I thought the dithiocyanato complex is the second one, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, which is β2=40, and that's what I used. So according to my calculation, f_2 is about 16.9%, so option D.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because in some cases, the first complex might be more predominant. Let me recheck the denominator sum.

Denominator:

m=0: 1

m=1:9 * 0.1=0.9 → sum
