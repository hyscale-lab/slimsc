Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's usually a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN... Oh wait, no, wait. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which can act as a nucleophile. But butan-2-one has a ketone group, which is a good electrophilic carbon. So the reaction is probably a ketone + cyanide ion, which would undergo nucleophilic addition.

Wait, but what kind of conditions are needed? Oh right, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group. So the product would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. The structure given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that: the molecule has a CH2CN group, and then a CH(OH)(CH3)2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN (or CN-) would form a cyanohydrin. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but in the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methyl. So the carbon chain would be: CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? Wait no, butanenitrile has four carbons in the main chain, with the nitrile group on the end. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So adding HCN would add to the carbonyl, so the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me count the carbons: the main chain would be 3 carbons (the original ketone has two CH3 groups on C2). So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Wait, but the question says butanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Oh wait, no. Let me count again. Butan-2-one is (CH3)CO(CH2CH3? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So the structure is:

O
||
C(CH3)2

Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the molecule would have a nitrile group attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl and the two methyl groups. So the formula would be C4H7NO. So the name would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the product in the question is butanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Oh wait, wait. Wait, butanenitrile has four carbons in the nitrile. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would have the nitrile on the fourth carbon. Wait, perhaps it's not a cyanohydrin but some other addition.

Wait, but maybe there's another possibility. Oh, wait, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation? No, that's when two different ketones or a ketone and an aldehyde undergo condensation. Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack leading to substitution, but that doesn't make much sense here.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the product has four carbons, with the nitrile group on C4, and the hydroxyl on C2. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)(CH3)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN. So if the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, the structure is CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN. So it's a four-carbon chain, with the nitrile on C4, the hydroxy and a methyl on C2.

Wait, how does that happen? Because butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So for the product to have four carbons, perhaps the nitrile group is added to a neighboring carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but that seems unlikely. Wait, another thought: maybe the NaCN is acting as a base, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a cyanide enolate? Or maybe it's a substitution via an intermediate. Wait, another possibility: the ketone could undergo a nucleophilic attack by CN- to form a cyanohydrin. So, butan-2-one plus NaCN in an acidic condition would form the cyanohydrin. Oh, right, because in the presence of an acid, the carbonyl oxygen becomes protonated, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So the reagent A would be an acid catalyst. So what options do we have? Looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Well, H3O+ is a strong acid. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction requires a strong acid. So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+? Let's see.

So in the first reaction, the conditions are acid-catalyzed addition of CN- to the ketone. So A is H3O+. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, and options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and reagent B (with H2O) gives 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, so nitrile to carboxylic acid. How does that happen? The common way is to treat nitriles with strong oxidizing agents. For example, using H2O with an acid catalyst and heat, or using something like KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

Wait, but the reagent B is used with H2O. So in the second reaction, we have B (H2O). So perhaps B is an acid catalyst.

Wait, the first step is nitrile to carboxylic acid. Wait, but nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. For this oxidation, common conditions are using KMnO4 under acidic and heated conditions. Alternatively, using H2O with some catalyst.

Wait, but in this case, the second reaction is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile turning into 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) is oxidized to COOH.

Hmm, but wait, the structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on the butane chain, and the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the benzyl group.

Oxidizing a nitrile to a carboxylic acid typically requires strong oxidizing agents. But in this case, the reaction is in aqueous conditions with reagent B.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's hydrolysis. Nitriles can undergo hydrolysis to form amides or carboxylic acids under specific conditions. For example, acidic hydrolysis of nitriles uses H2SO4 and H2O, possibly with heat, to produce carboxylic acids. Or under basic conditions, you get carboxylates.

But in this case, the product is the carboxylic acid, so it must be under acidic conditions. So the reagent B would be an acid catalyst.

Looking at the options, the possible B are HCl, CH3COOH, or others.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl or acetic acid. Let me think about which would be more likely.

In acidic hydrolysis of nitriles, the usual condition is concentrated sulfuric acid and water, maybe with heat. But in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is using a strong acid catalyst in water. So B would be HCl, because HCl is a strong acid. Alternatively, if it's a milder acid, maybe acetic acid would work, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reaction is:

CN → COOH

So the nitrile is being oxidized to carboxylic acid. Hmm, but that requires a strong oxidizing condition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis followed by oxidation. But in the options, the reagents are either HCl or acetic acid, which are acids but not oxidizing agents. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not oxidation but hydrolysis. Because nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under strong acidic conditions.

So in this case, the nitrile group is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid group. So, the reagent would be H2O plus an acid catalyst. So reagent B is probably an acid, like HCl or acetic acid.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl or CH3COOH.

Looking back at the options, let's see:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → So first reaction uses H3O+ as acid catalyst, second uses HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

So, for the first reaction, I think A should be H3O+.

Now, the second reaction: if we're using an acid catalyst, then HCl is a strong acid, but acetic acid is a weak acid. Which would be more effective for hydrolysis of nitriles.

Wait, another angle: the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition (cyanohydrin formation), which needs an acid catalyst. So for that, H3O+ is a strong acid, which would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic.

In the second reaction, the nitrile group is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, which requires strong acidic conditions. So perhaps the reagent B is HCl, providing the H+ in an aqueous solution.

Looking at the options, option A has B=HCl, so that's a possibility. Alternatively, option C has B=HCl but A=NaHSO3, which I don't think is right because I thought A should be H3O+.

So, putting it together:

First reaction: requires H3O+ (A is H3O+), so options A or B.

Second reaction: HCl (B is HCl), so option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but another consideration: can NaHSO3 be a catalyst for the first reaction? NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since it's a strong acid, HSO3- is a weaker acid, so in solution, it can donate a proton). So in aqueous solution, NaHSO3 can act as an acid. So in the first reaction, could it be that A is NaHSO3?

Wait, in that case, but for the cyanohydrin formation, the acid is necessary to protonate the carbonyl. So whether it's H3O+ or another acid like NaHSO3 might matter based on other factors, but perhaps both could be possible. But then, in the second reaction, the reagent would be either HCl or CH3COOH.

Alternatively, let's think about the conditions for the second reaction. If the second reaction is using HCl as the acid, then the reaction would proceed under strongly acidic conditions, which would facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

So the first reaction uses H3O+ (so A is H3O+) and the second uses HCl (so B is HCl), which matches option A.

Wait, but let me check: what about the possibility that reagent A in the first reaction is NaHSO3? The first reaction would require an acid, so NaHSO3 in H2O would provide H+ ions, but perhaps in a milder acid condition. Could that work?

Hmm, but I think that the cyanohydrin formation typically requires a strong acid. So perhaps H3O+ is more suitable. So option A's A is H3O+, which would be correct.

So the correct option would be A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a strong acid and is suitable for this purpose, while NaHSO₃, though acidic, is less commonly used for such reactions. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺ is the most appropriate choice for the first reaction.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This requires strong acidic conditions for hydrolysis. HCl is a strong acid and provides the necessary acidic environment for this transformation, making B = HCl the suitable choice for the second reaction.

Considering the options:
- Option A: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl — This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- Option B: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH — While A is correct, CH₃COOH is a weak acid and not ideal for the second reaction.
- Option C: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl — NaHSO₃ is less suitable for the first reaction, as it is not as strong an acid as H₃O⁺.
- Option D: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH — Both A and B are unsuitable for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
