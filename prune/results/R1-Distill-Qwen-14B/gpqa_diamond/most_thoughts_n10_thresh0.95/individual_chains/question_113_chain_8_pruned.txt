Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying in hydrogen and oxygen counts.

First, I'll start by going through each piece of data provided and try to interpret what they mean.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The question says there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak could mean either an alcohol (-OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually broader and around 2500-3300 cm^-1, which fits here. But sometimes alcohols can also show broad peaks, but they're usually a bit lower in wavenumber. Hmm, but both possibilities are there. 

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which typically indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower. That could be another carbonyl, but maybe conjugated. Alternatively, an aromatic ring with conjugation might absorb around there. Wait, but 1650 could also be an overtone or something else. Hmm. 

Wait, another thought: in IR, the 1700 is a strong peak, maybe a ketone or an ester. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Or it could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a C=C stretch. Wait no, C=C is usually around 1600-1650. So maybe that's it. So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond.

Now, let's look at the 1H NMR. The NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to the hydrogens attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have at least one double bond. That could be either from an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring, but if it's an aromatic ring, the NMR would show different patterns, perhaps a multiplet. But the mention of vinyl hydrogens specifically suggests an alkene, not an aromatic system.

Wait, but wait a second. If the compound has both a carbonyl and an alkene, perhaps it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Like an enone or an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would explain the 1700 and 1650 cm^-1 peaks. Because the conjugated double bond would lower the carbonyl's stretching frequency. So the 1700 would be the carbonyl (like a ketone or ester) and the 1650 would be the conjugated double bond (C=C). Alternatively, the 1650 could be another carbonyl but that's less likely. So maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

Moving on to the Mass Spectrometry data: a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, m/z 45 is a key mass. Let me think about what fragments could give that. 45 is the mass of a methyl group (15) plus maybe a CO group (28) but wait, 15+30=45? Wait, 15 (CH3) + 30 (CO, maybe as CH3CO+ or something else). Alternatively, 45 could be CH3COO+ (but that's 60). Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a CH2O group, but that's 30. Hmm, maybe the fragment is (CH3)2CO+? No, that would be 59 (since (CH3)2CO is (15*2) + 12 + 16 = 42? Wait, no. Let me calculate: (CH3)2CO is (2*(15) for CH3) + (12 for C) + (16 for O) = 30 +12 +16=58. So that's not 45.

Hmm, another approach. The molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So the molecular formulas are either six carbons with varying H and O.

The molecular weight for each:

- C6H12O: 6*12 +12*1 +16*1 =72+12+16=100 g/mol
- C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98
- C6H10O2: 72+10+32=114
- C6H12O2:72+12+32=116

So the mass spec has a fragment at 45, which is less than the molecular ion. Wait, but the molecular ion (M+) would be one of these, but the fragment is at 45. So 45 is a possible fragment. Let me think about what could give a fragment with m/z 45.

45 could be (CH2)2O, but that's 48? Wait, no: CH2OH would be 32 (but that's maybe not). Alternatively, (CH3)CO+ would be 45: CH3CO+ is 15 (CH3) + 28 (CO+) = 43? Hmm, not quite. Oh wait, maybe CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) has a fragment? Or maybe the fragment is a ketene ion or something else.

Wait, maybe the 45 comes from a (CH2)2O group. Wait, (CH2)2O is 2*(14) +16=44. Hmm, no. Alternatively, the 45 could be the fragment from a compound losing some groups. For example, if the molecular ion is 116 (C6H12O2), losing a fragment of 71 (like (C5H11O2-? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2O group. Let me think: CH2O is formaldehyde, which is 30. So 30 is not 45. Hmm... Wait, 45 is the same as the molecular weight of (CH3)2COH+? No, that's 45? Let me compute. (CH3)2COH: 2*(15) =30 +12 (C) +16 (O) +1 (H) = 59. No, that's too high.

Another thought: Maybe the fragment is CH2=CH-O-R losing some parts. Alternatively, perhaps it's a common fragment like CH2CH2O, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone group. Wait, another possible fragment is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91, so not 45.

Wait, what about an alpha cleavage in the Mass Spec. Let's think about the possible structures. If the compound has a carbonyl and an alkene, perhaps it's an ester with a double bond.

Wait, let's think about molecular formulas. The options are:

A) C6H12O2 → Degree of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X=0, N=0. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. But wait, that's only one, but if the compound has a carbonyl (which is a double bond) and an alkene (another double bond), that would be two degrees. So that doesn't fit. So this formula can't have two double bonds.

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Let's compute the degree of unsaturation correctly. The formula is CnHmOx. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2n +2 - m - x + (X if any) - (N if any))/2. Since O and X (halogens) don't contribute, but N would. So for C6H12O2:

DoU = (2*6 + 2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. Which could be a carbonyl group (which is a double bond, one DoU) and perhaps a ring? Or a double bond elsewhere. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond, so that's another DoU. So two DoU but the formula only allows for one. So this can't be. Therefore, option A is not possible.

Wait, that's an important point. Let me check all the options for their DoU:

Option B: C6H10O
DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2= 2. So two DoU. That could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc. But the IR has a carbonyl (one DoU) and a vinyl (another DoU). So two DoU would fit. So option B could be possible.

Option C: C6H10O2
DoU = (14 -10)/2=2. Same as above. So two DoU. Again, fits with a carbonyl and a double bond.

Option D: C6H12O
DoU= (14-12)/2=1. So only one DoU. But we have a carbonyl (DoU=1) and a double bond (another DoU). So that's two DoU, which doesn't fit. So D is out.

So options B and C are possible. Now, back to the NMR. The NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so an alkene is present. So the compound has a double bond and a carbonyl group. So the DoU would be 2 (if the carbonyl is one DoU and the double bond another). So options B and C have DoU=2, which fits.

So which one is it between B and C?

Looking back at the IR: We had peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a carbonyl, 1650 maybe the C=C. So the structure is likely an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, like an α,β-unsaturated ester or ketone.

But let's think about the mass spec. The fragment at 45 is key. Let's try to figure out what that could be.

If the compound has a carbonyl and an alkene, let's imagine it's something like an ester. Suppose the structure is something like CH2=CHCOO-R. Wait, but we have six carbons. Let me think of possible structures.

Wait, another approach. The possible molecular formulas with two DoU are B (C6H10O) and C (C6H10O2). Let's consider each.

Option B: C6H10O. The molecular formula could be something with a carbonyl (like an aldehyde or ketone) and a double bond. But an aldehyde would have a strong peak around 2800 and 2700 cm^-1 in IR, which the question doesn't mention. So maybe a ketone. But the IR shows a broad peak around 3000, which could be an alcohol. Wait, if it's a ketone and an alcohol, but that would require more than two DoU. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, but the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which could also be an alcohol. So if it's an alcohol (DoU 0) plus a carbonyl (DoU 1) plus a double bond (DoU 2), that would require three DoU, but the formula only allows two. So that's a problem.

Wait, let me compute DoU for option B: C6H10O is DoU=2. So if the structure includes a carbonyl (1 DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), that's two. But the IR has a broad peak which suggests an -OH group. So that would be an alcohol. So if the compound is an allyl alcohol, for example. Structure like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2OH. But that would have a primary alcohol, which would have a broad peak in IR. But in that case, the molecular formula would be C6H12O. Wait no, let's count. CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2OH would be C5H10O, I think. Wait, or if it's a longer chain with six carbons, maybe something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH2OH. That would be C6H12O, which is option D. But option D has DoU=1, which wouldn't have both the carbonyl and the double bond. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ether with a double bond and a carbonyl. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak at 3000 is not an alcohol but a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches, but they also have a carbonyl around 1700. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, then that would fit. But the formula would have two O's: COOH is O2. So that would point towards option C (C6H10O2). Let's think about that.

So for option C, C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, that's two DoU. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, that would be a six-carbon acid with a double bond. Molecular formula would be C6H10O2. Let's check: the formula would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, that's 6 carbons. The H count: each double bond (CH2=CH) has 4 H, the rest are each CH2. Let me count: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH.

CH2=CH (2 H on each CH2?), wait no: CH2=CH group is CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. So the structure would have:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH.

Wait, that's 6 carbons in total. The H's: 

CH2=CH has 2 H (on CH2) and 2 H (on CH, but wait no, in CH2=CH, it's CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Wait, no, the structure is CH2-CH2, but the first CH2 is actually CH2 with a double bond. So the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH.

So the H count: 

CH2=CH: each CH2 has 2 H, but the CH= part has 1 H. Wait, no, in CH2=CH, the CH2 (left) has 2 H, the CH (right) has 1 H. So CH2=CH has 3 H in that group. Then each subsequent CH2 adds 2 H each. 

Let me count:

CH2=CH (3 H) → next CH2 (2 H) → next CH2 (2 H) → next CH2 (2 H) → COOH (has 2 O, but no H in the COOH group except the O-H). Wait, the COOH group is -COOH, which has two O's and the H is part of the -OH. So the H count:

H on CH2=CH: 3

H on each of the next three CH2: 2 each → 3 * 2 =6

H on the COOH: the O-H is one H, but in the structure, the COOH is at the end. So those are 3 (CH2=CH) + 3*2 (CH2s) = 3+6 =9, plus the O-H H (1) → total 10. So molecular formula is C6H10O2. Which matches option C.

In that case, the IR would show a broad O-H (carboxylic acid) at ~3000, and the carbonyl at 1700 cm^-1. The 1650 could be the C=C in the alpha position to the carboxylic acid, so an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. But wait, in that structure, the double bond isn't conjugated with the carbonyl. Hmm, unless it's in a position where it is conjugated. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but if the structure was an ester, like CH2=CHCOO-R, but with six carbons. For example, maybe it's methyl acrylate or something similar. Let me think: methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But that's four carbons. To have six, perhaps it's something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2... No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an enol ester or another form. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

But going back to the mass spec. The fragment at 45 could be a CH3CO+ group. Let's calculate: the molecular ion for option C is 114. If the compound is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH, the molecular weight is 114 (since C6H10O2 → 6*12=72, 10 H=10, 32 O → 72+10+32=114). 

If it fragments, perhaps losing a part. For example, losing the COOH group as a fragment. Wait, no, the COOH group is at the end. Alternatively, the molecule could lose H2O. Let's see, if the molecule loses a water molecule (H2O), the remaining would have a mass of 114-18=96. But the fragment is at 45, not 96. 

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into two parts. Let me think about the possible structure again. Maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something with structure CH2=CHCOOR, where R is an ethyl group, making a six-carbon ester. Wait, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would be 2 (from CH2=CH) + 3 (from COO) +3 (from ethyl) = 8 carbons, which is too many. So that won't fit.

Alternative structure: Maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester, but that would require more DoU.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let me think about possible structures with a conjugated carbonyl and an alkene. Maybe it's something like benzene with substituents, but that would require more carbons for the ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is vinyl acetate. But vinyl acetate is CH3COOCH=CH2. That's four carbons, so not six.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with substituents. Let me imagine a six-carbon chain: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. No, that's 2 (from CH2=CH) +3 (from COO) +3 (from the ester R group) → 8 carbons again. Not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path. Let's think about the mass spec again. The fragment at m/z=45. What's a common fragment at 45? Well, 45 is the same as the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (acetone), but that's 58. Wait, no. Alternatively, it could be the fragment C3H7O+? Let me compute: C3H7O has (3*12)+(7*1)+(16)=36+7+16=59. That's not 45. Alternatively, C2H5CHO+? No, that's more.

Wait, another possibility. The fragment could be a ketene ion, which is a (RCO+) group. Let's see: if the molecule breaks after the carbonyl group, perhaps the fragment is something like (CH3)CO+.

Wait, (CH3)CO+ would be 15 (CH3) +28 (CO+) → 43. Close, but not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH2)2CO+. That would be (28) +12 (C) +16 (O) → 56? No.

Wait, 45 is 45. Let me think about possible neutral losses. Perhaps the fragment is the result of a McLafferty rearrangement, but I'm not sure how that would lead to 45.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a methyl ester group. For example, if the compound is an ester with a methyl group, then losing the methyl group (which is 15) would leave a fragment of M-15. If the molecular ion is 114, then 114-15=99, which isn't 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketone group. For example, if the molecule breaks to form a CH3CO+ fragment, which is 43, but that's not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. If the compound is a di-substituted ester, perhaps the fragment is a smaller ester. For example, if the molecule is broken into a smaller ester and another part. Let's say the molecular ion is 114. If it breaks into a 45 fragment and the rest (114-45=69). But I'm not sure what 69 would correspond to.

Wait, 45 could be the result of a loss of a group from the molecular ion. For example, if the compound loses a C3H7O group, the mass would be 45 → 45 = (3*12) + (7*1) + 16 → 36+7+16=59. Doesn't fit. Alternatively, losing a C2H5O group: 24+5+16=45. Yes! Wait, C2H5O is 24 (2*12) +5 (5 H) +16 O=45. So if the molecular ion (114) loses C2H5O (45), the remaining would be 114-45=69. But I'm not sure if that's a meaningful fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a C2H5O+ ion, but that would be 45.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's think about possible structures.

Suppose it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. For example, a gamma or delta lactone. Let's say a five-membered ring (gamma) or six-membered (delta). But in that case, the structure would have an ester group and a ring, which would account for two DoU. But I'm not sure about the IR and mass spec in that scenario.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2-... Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R, but with R being a three-carbon group. So CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's 2 (CH2=CH) +3 (COO) +3 (CH2CH2CH3)= 8 carbons. No, that's too many.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to focus on the mass spec. If the fragment is 45, which is 45 amu. Let me think about common fragments:

- CH3CO+ is 43.
- CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) would be 44 (CH3CHO has a molecular ion of 44).
Wait, 44 is m/z=44. The question says 45. So close, but not quite. Alternatively, CH3CH2O+ is 45 (since 15 (CH3) + 29 (CH2O) → no, wait: CH3CH2O+ is (15*2) +12 +16 → 30+12+16=58? No. Wait, no: CH3CH2O is 45 amu. Because CH3CH2O has 2 carbons (24) + 5 H (5) +16 O=24+5+16=45. So yes, that's a possible fragment.

So if the fragment is CH3CH2O+ (45), that suggests that the molecule has a CH3CH2O group. So the parent compound could be an ether (like an ethyl ether) or an ester where the oxygen is part of an ethyl group.

But wait, the IR has a carbonyl and a broad O-H. So if the compound is an ester, which would have a carbonyl, then the O-H could be from a carboxylic acid. So perhaps it's a diester or something else. Alternatively, if it's an ether, the O-H would come from an alcohol, but then we would need another carbonyl group.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to tie this all together.

The options are between B and C.

Option B: C6H10O → DoU 2. IR shows a broad O-H (maybe an alcohol) and a carbonyl. But the molecular formula would require another DoU for the alkene. Wait, but if it's an alcohol (DoU 0), plus a carbonyl (DoU 1), plus a double bond (DoU 2), that's three DoU, but the formula only allows two. So that doesn't fit. So option B is out.

Wait, that's a mistake. No, wait, option B is C6H10O. DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. So if the structure has a carbonyl (1 DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), that's two. But what about the broad O-H? That would require an -OH group, which would add another DoU. Wait, no. The presence of -OH doesn't add a DoU. Because an -OH is O-H, but it's not a ring or a double bond, so it doesn't contribute to the DoU. So the DoU is
