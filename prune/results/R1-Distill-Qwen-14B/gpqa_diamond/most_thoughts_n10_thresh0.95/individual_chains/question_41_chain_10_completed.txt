Okay, I've got this physics problem about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I remember that when objects move relative to each other, we have to consider the effects of relativity, but wait, isn't this a classical mechanics problem? Or does relativity come into play here because we're dealing with light, which is fast.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? But wait, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed? Because in classical mechanics, velocities add up linearly. But wait, when dealing with light, I think it's a bit different because of relativity. Oh wait, but since v is a constant velocity, perhaps it's non-relativistic? Or maybe the problem assumes a classical approach.

Wait, the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is v_light = 1/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So the observer in the lab is seeing the glass moving towards them, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer in the lab. Wait, no, the question says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, no, let me re-read that.

Wait no, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and the beam is going toward the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer. So the glass is moving towards the observer with velocity v, and the light is also moving towards the observer in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let's clarify the setup. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The light is propagating through the glass, which is moving towards the observer.

So, the lab frame is the observer's frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light inside the glass is moving in which direction? Same as the glass's direction, so towards the observer.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n (since c is 1, it's 1/n). Now, how do we get the speed in the lab frame?

In classical mechanics, velocities add vectorially. So the speed in the lab frame would be the speed of the light in the glass plus the speed of the glass. But wait, direction matters. Since both the glass and the light are moving in the same direction towards the observer, their velocities add.

Wait, no, wait. The glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light is moving through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, in the glass's frame, the light's speed is v_light = 1/n towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be v_light_lab = v_light_glass + v_glass, because both are moving in the same direction.

Wait, no. Wait, if the glass is moving towards the observer at v, then from the lab frame, the glass's velocity is +v (assuming towards observer is positive). The light's velocity in the glass's frame is also + (1/n). So in the lab frame, the light's velocity is the glass's velocity plus the light's velocity in the glass frame.

Wait, but wait, that would mean v_light_lab = v + (1/n). But wait, that can't be right because in a vacuum, light's speed is always c. But here, the glass is a medium, so light's speed is c/n.

Wait, but this is a bit conflicting with relativity, which states that the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But the problem says to take c=1. Hmm, maybe the problem is assuming a classical approach where velocities just add up, not considering the relativistic effects. Because in reality, according to relativity, the speed of light would still be c regardless of the glass's velocity.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether to use relativity or classical mechanics, but the fact that it's given as a multiple-choice with n and v suggests that it's a classical problem, perhaps using the Galilean addition of velocities.

So, in the glass's frame, the light's speed is v_light = c/n. So when the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light, the lab frame would see the light's speed as v_light_lab = v_light_glass + v_glass.

So that would be v_light_lab = (1/n) + v.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, none of them seem to match (1/n + v). Let's see the options:

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v)
Option B: 1
Option C: (1 +n v)/(n -v)
Option D: (1 -n v)/(n +v)

Hmm, none of these directly look like (1/n +v). Let me compute what (1/n + v) would be. If I factor 1/n:

1/n + v = (1 + n v )/n.

Wait, but that's (1 + n v)/n. Let me see the options. Oh, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). That's different. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the relative motion correctly. Or perhaps the problem is using relativistic velocity addition. Oh, because if the glass is moving, then the light's speed must still be c in the lab frame, but that's only if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. But wait, in reality, according to relativity, the speed of light in any medium is c, but when you have a medium moving, the light's speed doesn't change relative to the lab frame. But that would make the speed of light in the lab frame still 1, regardless of the glass's motion.

Wait, but that can't be right because the index of refraction would affect the speed. Hmm, no, wait. The index of refraction n is the ratio of c to the speed in the medium. So if the medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light, do we have to use relativistic velocity addition?

Let me think. Let's say in the glass's frame, the light's speed is v_light = c/n. Then, to find the lab frame's speed, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The relativistic formula is v' = (v + u)/(1 + vu/cÂ²). But wait, c is 1, so it's v' = (v + u)/(1 + v u).

Here, u is the velocity of the light in the glass frame, which is 1/n. So v' = (v + (1/n)) / (1 + v*(1/n)).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (v n +1)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So v' = [ (v n +1)/n ] / [ (n +v)/n ] = (v n +1)/(n +v)

Which is (1 +n v)/(n +v). Which is option A.

So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, in the problem, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer as well, same direction. So u is positive. Therefore, the formula applies.

So the speed of light in the lab frame is (1 +n v)/(n +v).

Looking at the options, option A is exactly this.

Wait, but if the glass were moving opposite to the light's direction, the formula would change, but in this case, they are moving in the same direction.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, which is propagating through the glass with an index of refraction \( n \). In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( v_{\text{light}} = \frac{1}{n} \), since the speed of light in a medium is \( \frac{c}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \).

To find the speed of light in the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v' = \frac{v + u}{1 + vu},
\]

where \( u \) is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame (\( u = \frac{1}{n} \)) and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), the formula becomes:

\[
v' = \frac{v + \frac{1}{n}}{1 + v \cdot \frac{1}{n}}.
\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator:

\[
v' = \frac{\frac{v n + 1}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{v n + 1}{n + v}.
\]

This matches the expression given in option A. The other options do not align with the relativistic velocity addition formula or the physical setup of the problem.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}.
\]
