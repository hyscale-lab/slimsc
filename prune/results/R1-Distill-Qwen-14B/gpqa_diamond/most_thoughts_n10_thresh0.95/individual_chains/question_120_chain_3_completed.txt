Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift of nearby stars against distant ones, right? The formula I remember is that parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d. Oh wait, that's right: d = 1/plx.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, if stars are uniformly distributed, their number density in space is constant. Let me think about how many stars there are in a given volume as a function of distance.

If the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell (4πd²) multiplied by dr, and the number density (n), which is constant. So N ~ n * 4πd² dr.

But the question is about parallax. Since plx p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So I need to express everything in terms of p.

Let me see. dr is the change in distance. But I need to find how many stars are in a given range of parallax, say from p to p + dp. So I need to relate dr to dp.

Since p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. Wait, wait, that's the derivative. So, dr = - (d²) dp. But since we're talking about a positive change in p, when d increases, p decreases, so perhaps I should be careful about the signs.

Wait, maybe I can express dr in terms of dp. So, d = 1/p → dr = - (1/p²) dp. The negative just indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But when considering a small dp (like a small range), the absolute value is what matters for the number of stars.

So, dr ≈ (1/p²) dp. Because when p increases, the distance decreases, so a small change in p corresponds to a change in distance proportional to 1/p².

Now, the number of stars in that thin shell at distance d is N = n * 4πd² dr. Substituting d=1/p, so d² = 1/p². And dr is (1/p²) dp, as I found earlier.

So N = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp.

Wait, let's compute that: 4π n * (1/p²) * (1/p²) ) dp → 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (like per dp) would be proportional to 1/p^4. So the number density in terms of parallax would decrease as p^4.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4? So the number decreases with plx^-4.

Looking at the options: option A is ~1/plx^4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check. Does the number of stars per unit parallax increase or decrease? Let me think about it.

At smaller parallaxes (which means larger distances), the number of stars per unit parallax should be lower. Because when you look further away, each unit of parallax corresponds to a larger volume of space, so fewer stars in that range.

Wait, no, another way: for a given parallax range, say from p to p+dp, how many stars are there? As p increases (distance decreases), the volume within that shell increases, so more stars. So for small p, like nearby stars, each unit of parallax has a lot of stars. But as p increases (distance increases), the number of stars per unit parallax would drop.

So the number per unit parallax decreases as p increases, which is the same as saying it's inversely proportional to p^4. So the number decreases as p gets larger.

So the correct option is A) ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is defined as \( p = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. For a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell (\( 4\pi d^2 \)) multiplied by \( dr \). Thus, the number of stars \( N \) is given by:

\[
N \propto n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \cdot dr,
\]

where \( n \) is the number density of stars.

To express this in terms of parallax \( p \), we use \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting these into the equation for \( N \), we get:

\[
N \propto n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
N \propto \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{p^4} \cdot dp.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). As \( p \) increases (i.e., as we look to greater distances), the number of stars per unit parallax decreases rapidly. This matches the behavior expected for a uniform distribution of stars.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
