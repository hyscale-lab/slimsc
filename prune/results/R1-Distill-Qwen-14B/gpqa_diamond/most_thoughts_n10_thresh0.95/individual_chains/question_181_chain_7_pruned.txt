Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me think this through.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes. The pp chain is one of the main ways the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium, right? And the pp branches—I think there are several, like pp-I, pp-II, pp-III. Each might produce different neutrino species.

Wait, right, the pp chain produces electron neutrinos (ν_e), mainly through the reactions that involve the decay of beryllium-7 or something like that. Oh wait, no, the main neutrinos from the pp chain are from the proton-proton fusion. Oh, wait, I'm a bit confused. The pp chain has different branches, but the neutrinos come from when a boron-8 nucleus decays, right? Or wait, maybe that's in the CNO cycle. Hmm.

Wait, no, the pp chain involves the fusion of protons into deuterium, then into helium-3, and then those helium-3 nuclei can either combine into helium-4 (the main pp-I branch) or go through other reactions, which are the pp-II and pp-III branches.

Wait, the pp-III branch—I think that's where three helium-3 nuclei fuse into a carbon-12 nucleus. Oh, but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, the pp-I branch is the main one where two He-3s make He-4, but the pp-II and pp-III involve more steps.

Wait, the pp-III branch might involve the production of Be-7, which then captures a proton to become B-8, which decays into two neutrinos. Oh, I'm getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think this through.

So, when the pp-III branch stops, what happens? The pp-III branch is probably responsible for a certain part of the neutrino production. So, neutrinos are produced in different parts of the Sun's core based on the dominant fusion processes.

The key here is that neutrinos have different energies based on the reactions that produce them. For example, the Beryllium decay in the pp chain produces 772 keV neutrinos. Wait, no, the neutrinos from the Beryllium decay are about 1.4 MeV, but wait that's not right. Or wait, the neutrinos from the decay of B-8 are lower energy, around 1.4 MeV each? Or maybe 0.77 MeV each, since each of the two neutrinos would get about 0.37 MeV each (since B-8 has a mass of about 8 u, and the energy released is about 14.07 MeV, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers).

Wait, no, actually, the main neutrino line from the Sun is the 772 keV line. So that's from the decay of B-8 into two neutrinos and Li-8, right? So each neutrino has about half the energy, so 386 keV each. But wait, I'm not sure about that.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. The pp chain produces a significant fraction of the Sun's neutrinos. The main neutrino lines are from the decay of B-8, which emits two ν_e's. Each of these neutrinos has an energy around 0.56 MeV or so? Or maybe 0.382 MeV each? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Or wait, each neutrino in that decay would have an energy of about 0.77 MeV? No, wait, B-8 is produced via Be-7 capturing a proton. Be-7 has a half-life of about 53 days, but I'm not sure how that affects this.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the neutrinos from the pp chain is around 0.77 MeV. So, that would fall into the band 700-800 keV (since 0.77 MeV is 770 keV). So band 1 is 700-800 keV and band 2 is 800-900 keV. So, if the neutrinos are around 770 keV, they fall into band 1.

But wait, this is under the assumption that the pp-III branch stopped. So, what's the pp-III's contribution to neutrino flux?

If the pp-III branch is stopped, what does that mean for the production of neutrinos? The pp-III branch probably contributes to the production of higher-energy neutrinos? Or maybe lower? I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think that the pp-III branch involves reactions that lead to higher-energy neutrinos. Or perhaps it's the main contributor to a certain energy range. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is a minor contributor, but it's the main one for a particular line.

Alternatively, perhaps stopping the pp-III branch would significantly reduce the number of neutrinos in a particular energy band.

Wait, the question is asking about the ratio of the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV) after pp-III stops. So, if pp-III was a major source of neutrinos in band 1 and not in band 2, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 1 relative to band 2.

But wait, I'm not certain about the energy distribution of neutrinos from the pp-III branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in a higher energy band than the main pp-I branch. So, if pp-III is stopped, then the flux in that higher band (band 2) would drop, while the lower band (band 1) remains mostly unchanged.

Wait, no. Let's think about the neutrinos from different sources. The main source is the pp chain, which produces neutrinos in the ~0.77 MeV range (so band 1). But there are other sources, like the CNO cycle, but the CNO neutrinos are lower energy, around 0.2-0.6 MeV, I think. So, if the pp-III branch stops, which part of the pp chain is affected?

Wait, the pp-III branch might be a minor contributor compared to the main pp-I branch. So, the main neutrino emission is from the main branch, and the pp-III contributes a smaller fraction. So, if pp-III stops, the overall neutrino flux would decrease, but perhaps the energy distribution would change.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between two specific bands. So, if the pp-III branch is the main source of neutrinos in band 2, and the main pp chain is the source for band 1, then stopping pp-III would reduce the flux in band 2 more than band 1.

In that case, the flux in band 1 would be similar, and band 2 would drop, leading to a higher ratio (flux band1 / band2) increasing.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the main source of neutrinos in band 1, and other processes contribute to band 2.

Wait, the main pp chain produces neutrinos around 770 keV, which is band 1 (700-800). The pp-III branch might produce higher-energy neutrinos, like around 800-900 keV (band 2). So if the pp-III branch stops, then the flux in band 2 would drop.

But in reality, the pp chain mainly produces 770 keV neutrinos. So maybe the pp-III branch isn't the main source for a different band. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a minor contributor to the neutrinos, so stopping it would decrease the overall flux, but the ratio would depend on how much each band relies on pp-III.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch doesn't produce any neutrinos, so stopping it wouldn't affect the neutrino flux. But that can't be right because the question states that the pp-III branch is stopped, implying that it was contributing to neutrino production.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes a line of neutrinos at a higher energy. So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would drop to almost zero, while band 1 remains as it was. Because previously, band 2's flux was significant due to pp-III, but now it's gone.

In that case, band 1's flux is the same as before, band 2's flux is much lower. So the ratio (band1 / band2) would be much higher.

But wait, the original fluxes. Normally, the majority of solar neutrinos are from the main pp chain in the 770 keV line. So, if the pp-III branch contributes neutrinos to band 2, which is a higher energy, then stopping it would mean that band 2's flux drops.

But if band 2 had a smaller flux to begin with, then the ratio band1/band2 could be large.

Wait, for example, suppose before stopping, band1 had 1000 neutrinos per cm²/s, and band2 had 100. So ratio is 10. If pp-III was the main source of band2, and it's stopped, band2's flux drops to, say, 10 (because other processes contribute a little), then the ratio becomes 100/10=10. So the ratio remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps pp-III is the only contributor to band2. So, without it, band2's flux becomes zero. But that's probably not the case, because other processes (like the CNO cycle) produce lower energy neutrinos, but maybe some other branches produce higher.

Wait, but the CNO neutrinos are lower energy, so they wouldn't contribute to band2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the main neutrino line is in band1, and the pp-III produces another line in band2. So, in that case, the flux in band1 is high, and band2 is lower. So when pp-III stops, the band2 flux goes away, but band1 is still there.

So, original band1 flux is, say, 1000, band2 is 100. Ratio is 10. After pp-III stops, band2 is 0. So the new ratio would be 1000/0, which is undefined, but in reality, the flux can't be zero. But perhaps the question is assuming that the pp-III was the main source of band2, and the rest is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch doesn't contribute to specific neutrino lines, but to the overall continuum. So, stopping it would reduce the overall neutrino flux, but the shape remains the same. So the ratio would stay the same, giving a flux ratio of 1.

Wait, but that's probably not the case, because the question is about specific bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is responsible for a neutrino line in band2. So, when it stops, that line disappears, but the main line in band1 remains. So band1's flux remains the same, and band2's flux drops to zero or almost zero.

But then, the ratio would be very high, like infinity. But since the options include 10, 1, etc., that can't be the case. So perhaps the ratio remains the same, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the pp-III branch produces. Let me try to recall. The pp-III branch involves the following: after the main pp-I branch where two He-3 nuclei combine to form He-4, the pp-III branch may involve capturing a He-3 onto a He-4 to form C-12. But wait, the neutrinos from the pp chain are from the decay of B-8. So, perhaps the pp-III branch doesn't directly contribute to neutrino emission, but it's part of the overall pp process.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a different path that leads to the same B-8 production. So, if the pp-III branch stops, the total production of B-8 (and thus the neutrinos) would decrease.

Wait, if pp-III was a significant contributor to B-8 production, then stopping it would reduce the overall neutrino flux. But how does that affect the flux in each band?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a minor contributor, so the stoppage would only slightly decrease the flux in band1. So the ratio between band1 and band2 would remain roughly the same, leading to an answer of about 1.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stops. So if the pp-III was producing a lot of neutrinos in band2, then stopping it would mean band2's flux drops, increasing the ratio.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach.

The main neutrino line is from the decay of B-8, which is about 770 keV. So that's in band1. So pp-III's contribution is perhaps in a higher energy band, so if it's stopped, that higher band's flux drops.

If pp-III produces neutrinos in band2, then without it, band2's flux would decrease, making the ratio
