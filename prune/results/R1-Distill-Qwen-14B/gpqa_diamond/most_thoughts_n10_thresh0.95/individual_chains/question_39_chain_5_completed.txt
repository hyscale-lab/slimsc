Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, right? Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

So the problem says we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So I need to find the value of 'a'.

Wait, okay, so each particle's wave function is given. But wait a second, the wave function usually has to satisfy certain conditions, like being normalizable. Oh right, because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = [ a / sqrt(1 + x) ] - 0.5 i. But wait, wait. Wait a minute. I'm a bit confused here. Because in quantum mechanics, the wave function is typically a complex function, but in this case, it's given as a sum of a real term and an imaginary term. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Or is the entire expression a single term? Wait, the way it's written, I think the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So that would imply ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i. Hmm, but that would be a complex wave function, which is okay because wave functions can be complex.

But wait, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function, right? So the probability is |ψ(x)|². So I need to calculate the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3, and set it equal to 1 because the total probability should be 1. Because the particle is only found between 1 and 3.

Wait, but wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So to find the probability density, I square the magnitude of ψ. So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, because the real and imaginary parts are squared and added. Wait, because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is the real part, so when squared, it's (a^2)/(1+x). The imaginary part is (-0.5i), so when squared, no, wait, no. Wait, the imaginary part is part of the complex number. So ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5)i. So the complex conjugate is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (-0.5)i. So the product ψ times ψ* would be [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because (Real part)^2 + (Imaginary part)^2.

So the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. Wait, because (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. The wave function is ψ = A + Bi, where A is real and B is real. Then |ψ|² is A² + B². So yeah, in this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x) and B is -0.5, so B squared is 0.25. So indeed, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that's the probability density. To find the normalization condition, I need to integrate this from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1. So the integral of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be square-integrable and normalized. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over all space must be 1. But in this problem, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, so maybe the wave function is zero outside this interval? Or perhaps the wave function is non-zero only in this region, so the integral is from 1 to 3.

Wait, so I should compute the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

So let's compute that integral. Let's break it into two parts: the integral of a²/(1+x) dx plus the integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

First integral: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3, we get ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the sum is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Hmm, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's probably the right answer.

Wait a second, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I miss any constants?

Wait, the wave function is given as [a/sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i. Hmm, but when I compute |ψ|², it's (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2, which is a²/(1+x) + 0.25. So that part is correct.

The integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx =1. That's correct. So the integrals I calculated look right.

So a² = (0.5) / ln(2), which is approximately 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. Square root of that is about 0.849, which is 0.85, so option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the square of the magnitude of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is confined to the region \( x \in [1, 3] \), the total probability must equal 1. Therefore, we integrate \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval and set it equal to 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

Breaking the integral into two parts:

1. **First term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx
   \]  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):  
   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding the two results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately **0.85**, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
