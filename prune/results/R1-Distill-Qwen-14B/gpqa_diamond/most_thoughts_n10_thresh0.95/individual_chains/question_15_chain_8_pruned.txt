Okay, so I have this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about transits and the factors that affect their probability.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the main factor is the size of the planet relative to its star, but wait, here we have information about masses and orbital periods. Oh, right, the probability also depends on the planet's orbital distance from the star. Because the farther away the planet is, the less likely it is that its orbital plane will align with our line of sight, causing a transit.

So the formula for the probability of a planet transiting is something like (R_p / a) / (R_s), where R_p is the planet's radius, a is the semi-major axis (orbital distance), and R_s is the star's radius. Wait, or is it the other way around? Or perhaps it's (R_s + R_p) over a? Actually, I think the transit probability (p) is given by the formula p = (R_p / a) / (R_s), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's p = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a), considering that a is the distance. Wait, I might be mixing this up.

Wait, another approach: The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to pass in front of the star from our perspective. The chance of this alignment depends on the ratio of the star's size to the distance of the planet's orbit. Specifically, the probability is proportional to the area of the star relative to the area of the planet's orbit, but more accurately, it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance (a), multiplied by some factor.

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is p = (R_s) / (a), where R_s is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis. Or wait, no, because the planet's size also matters. Oh right, actually, the probability is p = (R_p / a) / (R_s), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, it's p = (R_p + R_s) / a, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should think geometrically.

Imagine the star's disk has radius R_s. The planet's orbit has a radius a. The chance that the planet passes in front of the star is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbit. The area of the star is π R_s², and the area of the planet's orbit is π a². So the ratio is (R_s / a)². But that's the area-based probability. However, since the planet is much smaller than the star, R_p << R_s, maybe it's approximated as (R_s / a)². But wait, the planet has to pass in front, so the probability is proportional to (R_s + R_p)² / a². But R_p is much smaller than R_s, so it's roughly (R_s / a)^2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: The probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. So if the star's radius is R_s, its diameter is 2 R_s. The planet's orbital diameter is 2 a. So the probability is (2 R_s) / (2 a) ) = R_s / a. Wait, that would make the probability p = R_s / a.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the planet's orbit is a circle, and only a small part of that circle would cause a transit. The probability is the ratio of the star's apparent size as seen from the planet's position. So the probability is (R_s / a), but in some sources, it's (R_s / a) multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is given by p = (R_s + R_p) / a. But since R_p is much smaller than R_s, this approx
