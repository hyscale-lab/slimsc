Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of state vectors and operators. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The question says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, so first I might need to find the normalization factor. Oh wait, but the question says it's proportional, so perhaps I need to normalize it first before proceeding. Because probabilities depend on the state being normalized.

So, let's write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, but it's proportional, so I should compute the normalization factor. The normalization condition is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients. The coefficient for |up> is (1+i), so its magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. For |down>, the coefficient is (2 - i), so the magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), right? So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down> .

Next part of the question: Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator with matrix Aij. Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait, the operator matrix is given as Aij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So what does that look like for a 2x2 matrix? Let's think about the basis states |up> and |down> as the computational basis.

So the operator A has elements A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2, and A_11 = A_22 = 0. So the matrix for A would be:

[ 0     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0 ]

Wait, that's correct. So the operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal.

But wait, what are the eigenstates of this operator? Because the question is about measuring in the eigenbasis of A. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the probabilities would be the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

Alternatively, another approach: the eigenstates of A can be found by diagonalizing the matrix A. Let me try to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Let me compute its eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = 0.

So,

| -λ        ħ/2         |
| ħ/2       -λ         |

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ²/4) =0.

So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are λ = ħ/2 and λ = -ħ/2.

Now, let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

The matrix becomes:
[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   -ħ/2 ]

So the equations are:

- (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1,1]^T. But since the basis is |up> and |down>, which are orthogonal, the eigenvectors can be normalized. So the normalized eigenvectors for λ=ħ/2 would be (1/sqrt(2)) |up> + (1/sqrt(2)) |down>.

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

(A + (ħ/2) I ) |v> =0.

Matrix:
[ ħ/2    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    ħ/2 ]

The equations are (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2=0 → v1 + v2=0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1, -1]^T. Normalized, that's (1/sqrt(2)) |up> - (1/sqrt(2)) |down>.

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

Now, the state |alpha> is given in the |up>, |down> basis, so to find the coefficients of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, we can express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

So |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Let me compute c_+ and c_-.

c_+ is the inner product of |alpha> with |+>, and c_- is the inner product with |->.

Given that |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So,

c_+ = < + | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2)] [ <up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Which becomes [1/sqrt(2*7)] [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ].

Compute the numerator: (1+i) + (2 - i) = 3 +0i → 3.

So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, c_- = < - | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2)] [ <up| - <down| ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Which becomes [1/sqrt(2*7)] [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ].

Compute numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i → (-1 +2i).

So the magnitude squared of c_- is |c_-|^2 = ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / 14 → (1 +4)/14 →5/14.

Wait a second, but wait, perhaps the probabilities will be |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2. Because when you expand |alpha> in the eigenbasis, the coefficients determine the probabilities.

So, |c_+|^2 is (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈0.642857.

And |c_-|^2 is (sqrt( ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 )) )^2 / (14) → sqrt(5)^2 /14 →5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.642857, and 5/14 is about 0.357. So the probabilities are roughly 0.64 and 0.36. Wait, but let me compute it exactly.

9 divided by 14 is 0.642857... So approximately 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is roughly 0.36. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is hbar/7. Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, so perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculation of c_+. Because earlier, I think I might have made a mistake.

Wait, < + | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] multiplied by alpha.

So, [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * <up|up> * 1/sqrt(2) + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * <down|down> *1/sqrt(2).

Since <up|up> is 1 and <down|down> is 1, this gives [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Which is [3 ] / sqrt(14). So yes, c_+ is 3/sqrt(14), so |c_+|^2 is 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, c_- is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) → (1+i -2 +i) = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

So |c_-|^2 is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.64) and 5/14 (≈0.36). So the first part of the answer is 0.64 and 0.36. Now looking at the options, option A has these probabilities. Now the average value.

The average value of the operator A is <alpha| A |alpha> .

Alternatively, since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of A, the expectation value is |c_+|^2 * (ħ/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-ħ/2).

So that's (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5) * ħ/(2*14) ) ] → (4 ħ)/(28) → ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

So looking at the options, option A has average value hbar /7. So the option would be A: probabilities 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Wait, but wait, the options don't all have the same order. Let me check the options again.

Option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that's correct.

But wait, another approach: compute the expectation value by matrix multiplication.

The state |alpha> is a vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

So, let's compute each part.

The conjugate transpose of |alpha> is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So, compute A |alpha>:

A |alpha> = [ (0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ), ( (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ].

Which simplifies to:

[ ( (ħ/2)*(2 -i) ) / sqrt(7), ( (ħ/2)*(1+i) ) / sqrt(7) ) ]

Then, the expectation value is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by the above vector.

So,

(1-i)/sqrt(7) * [ (ħ/2)(2 −i) / sqrt(7) ] + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * [ (ħ/2)(1 +i) / sqrt(7) ]

Factor out (ħ/2) / 7:

[ (1-i)(2−i) + (2+i)(1+i) ] * (ħ/2) /7.

Compute each term:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i*2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 → 2 -3i -1 → 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i → 2 +2i +i +i² → 2 +3i -1 → 1+3i.

Sum the two terms: (1−3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So the expectation value is (2) * ( ħ/2 ) /7 → (2 * ħ/2 ) /7 → ħ/7.

Which matches the earlier calculation. So, the average is indeed ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A is:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron in a state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator with matrix representation A, where A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, and to find the average value of the operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- For (1+i), the magnitude squared is \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \).
- For (2-i), the magnitude squared is \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \).

The total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \). Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A is represented by the matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of A are found by solving the characteristic equation:
\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 = 0.
\]
This gives the eigenvalues \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

The corresponding eigenstates are:
- For \( \lambda = \frac{\hbar}{2} \): \( |+⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ + |down⟩) \),
- For \( \lambda = -\frac{\hbar}{2} \): \( |-⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ - |down⟩) \).

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in the eigenbasis of A
To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A, express |α⟩ as a linear combination of \( |+⟩ \) and \( |-⟩ \):
\[
|α⟩ = c_+ |+⟩ + c_- |-⟩.
\]
The coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) are the inner products:
\[
c_+ = ⟨+|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = ⟨-|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):
\[
|c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad
|c_-|^2 = \left(\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The average value of A is given by:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α| A |α⟩.
\]
Using the eigenbasis representation, the expectation value is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_-|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \( \hbar / 7 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \hbar / 7 \).**
