Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm... I remember from my astronomy class that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as observed from Earth when viewed from different points in the Earth's orbit. The formula I think is plx in arcseconds equals 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. That means if a star is farther away (d increases), plx decreases. Got it.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So they're asking about the density of stars as a function of parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, their actual density in space is uniform. But when we project that onto the sky, the number we observe depends on their distance.

Wait, the problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly means the same number per unit volume. So in 3D space, the number density is constant.

But when we observe them, their distribution as seen from Earth (in terms of parallax) isn't uniform because of how distance affects apparent brightness and visibility. Oh, but wait the question says "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." Wait, wait, no—wait, the question says to assume they're uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm. Wait, no, the question says, "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the question says: 'stars are uniformly distributed in the sky.' No, wait, perhaps I misread. Let me look again.

Wait, the first line says, "Assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." So, that might mean that in the 2D plane of the sky (celestial sphere), their density is uniform. But that can't be the case because the actual density in 3D would vary with distance. Hmm, no, wait, the question says they're uniformly distributed in the sky which could mean that their density per unit area on the celestial sphere is uniform. But that would complicate things because, in reality, more distant stars would be fainter, but the question is about the number per unit parallax.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming a uniform distribution in 3D space, not on the sky's surface. Oh wait, the first line says, "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." Oh wait, perhaps the 'sky' here refers to the 3D space around us. Because in reality, the sky refers to the celestial sphere, but in this context, maybe it's intended as the distribution in the universe.

Wait, sometimes in problems, when they say 'universe is filled with stars uniformly', it's an approximation for a uniform density in 3D space, regardless of direction. So for the sake of this problem, stars are uniformly distributed in all of space, without any particular direction being denser.

So, if stars are uniformly distributed in space (so the number density is constant, n), then the number we observe within a certain distance depends on the volume. But we're looking at the number per unit parallax. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So let me think in terms of distance.

Let’s denote plx as p. Then distance d = 1/p parsecs. Because p (in arcseconds) is equal to 1/d (in parsecs). So, p = 1/d.

Now, we want to find how the number of stars per unit p range (like dp) changes with p. So the number of stars between p and p+dp would depend on the volume of the spherical shell at distance d, multiplied by the number density.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is N = 4πd² * n * dr, where n is the number density. But here, we're looking at a shell in terms of parallax, so we need to express dr in terms of dp.

Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. Differentiating both sides, dr = -1/p² dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, the sign can be ignored for the purposes of counting stars.

So the number of stars in a dp range is N = 4π ( (1/p)^2 )^2 * n * ( -dp/(p^2) ) Wait, wait, no. Let me redo the steps.

Wait, wait, the volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π d² dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dr is N = n * 4π d² dr.

But here, we want N per unit p. So, we need to express d in terms of p, and dr in terms of dp.

d = 1/p.

dr = derivative of d with respect to p times dp. So dr = (-1/p²) dp.

So, substituting into N = n *4π d² dr:

N = n *4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp.

The negative sign indicates direction, but since we're considering the magnitude of the change, we can ignore it.

So, N = n *4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π n / p^4 dp.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the options are given as ~1/plx^something. So in this case, the number is proportional to 1/p^4. So that's option A: ~1/p^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because if the density is uniform, the number in a volume element is proportional to volume, which depends on d² dr. But when changing variables to p, the expression might change differently.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness dr. So when p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So d² becomes 1/p², and dr is (-1/p²) dp.

So the number N = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp * n.

Which is 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

So the number per unit parallax is N/(dp) = 4π n / p^4.

So as p increases (since p = 1/d, larger p means closer distance), the number of stars per unit p decreases as 1/p^4.

So the answer should be option A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we assume stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space, meaning the number density \( n \) is constant. Parallax \( p \) is inversely related to distance \( d \) as \( p = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is in parsecs. The goal is to find the number of stars per unit \( p \) range, \( dp \).

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is given by:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \cdot dr
\]

Since \( p = \frac{1}{d} \), we can express \( d \) as \( d = \frac{1}{p} \). Differentiating \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) with respect to \( p \) gives \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{p^2}\right) dp
\]

Ignoring the negative sign (as it indicates direction), the number of stars per unit \( p \) range is:

\[
\frac{N}{dp} = \frac{4\pi n}{p^4}
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). This corresponds to option A.
