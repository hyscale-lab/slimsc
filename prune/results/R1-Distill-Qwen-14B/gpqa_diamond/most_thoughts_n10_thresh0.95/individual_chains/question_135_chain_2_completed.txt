Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Let me try to understand what's going on. The question is about the decay of a boson X. The Lagrangian interaction is given, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Hmm, let me think. First, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not sure I got that right. Oh wait, maybe it's written as L = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). No, wait, maybe the actual interaction term is something like λ f f-bar X, which would imply that the boson X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So, when X decays, it can decay into a fermion and its antiparticle.

So the X boson can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair. But wait, there's a catch. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair produced in the decay must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into another particle pair, the mass of the parent must be at least the sum of the masses of the daughters.

So I need to look at the masses of the possible fermions. Let me list the known fermions and their masses (approximate):

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV (so negligible compared to 6 GeV)
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): around 1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks because 2*173 GeV is way over 6 GeV.
- For leptons:
  - Electron (e-): ~0.511 MeV
  - Muon (mu-): ~105.7 MeV
  - Tau (tau-): ~1.78 GeV
  - Neutrinos: their masses are negligible, so they can be ignored here.

So, considering each fermion pair:

- b quark: mass ~4.5 GeV. So for a pair, it's about 9 GeV. Wait, X has 6 GeV, so 9 GeV is larger than 6. So X can't decay into b b-bar. Wait wait, no, 4.5 GeV is the mass of the b quark. So each b is 4.5 GeV. So two would be 9 GeV. Which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So decay into b quark-antiquark is not allowed. So any options that include b b-bar are not possible.

Wait, but wait the options given. Let me look at the options.

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option C: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option D: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Hmm. So for option A, including b b-bar is impossible because 2*4.5=9>6 GeV. So option A is out.

Similarly, option D includes b b-bar, also impossible. So D is out.

That leaves options B and C. Let's check option C. It includes t t-bar. But the mass of a top quark is 173 GeV. So 2*173 = ~346 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into top quarks. So option C is out because it includes t t-bar.

So that leaves option B. Let's check the masses for each pair in option B.

- c c-bar: each c is 1.3 GeV, so 2.6 GeV total. 6 GeV is more than that. So allowed.
- s s-bar: 2*95 MeV = 0.19 GeV. Well within 6 GeV.
- u u-bar: 2*2 MeV = 0.004 GeV; allowed.
- d d-bar: 2*4.7 MeV = 0.0094 GeV; allowed.
- tau+ tau-: each tau is 1.78 GeV, so 3.56 GeV. 6 GeV is more than that. Allowed.
- mu+ mu-: each mu is about 0.1057 GeV, so 0.2114 GeV. Allowed.
- e+ e-: each is ~0.000511 GeV. So 0.001 GeV. Allowed.

So all the decay channels in option B are allowed.

Wait, let me double-check the bottom quark. Option B doesn't include it. So the correct answer must be B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, meaning \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the total mass of the pair is less than or equal to 6 GeV. 

To analyze the options, we consider the masses of the fermions:

- **\( b\bar{b} \):** The bottom quark (\( b \)) has a mass of approximately 4.5 GeV. A pair (\( b\bar{b} \)) would require \( 2 \times 4.5 = 9 \, \text{GeV} \), which is greater than 6 GeV. Thus, \( X \to b\bar{b} \) is not allowed.
- **\( c\bar{c} \):** The charm quark (\( c \)) has a mass of approximately 1.3 GeV. A pair (\( c\bar{c} \)) would require \( 2 \times 1.3 = 2.6 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Thus, \( X \to c\bar{c} \) is allowed.
- **\( s\bar{s} \):** The strange quark (\( s \)) has a mass of approximately 95 MeV (\( 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)). A pair (\( s\bar{s} \)) would require \( 2 \times 0.095 = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Thus, \( X \to s\bar{s} \) is allowed.
- **\( u\bar{u} \):** The up quark (\( u \)) has a mass of approximately 2.2 MeV (\( 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)). A pair (\( u\bar{u} \)) would require \( 2 \times 0.0022 = 0.0044 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Thus, \( X \to u\bar{u} \) is allowed.
- **\( d\bar{d} \):** The down quark (\( d \)) has a mass of approximately 4.7 MeV (\( 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)). A pair (\( d\bar{d} \)) would require \( 2 \times 0.0047 = 0.0094 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Thus, \( X \to d\bar{d} \) is allowed.
- **\( \tau^+\tau^- \):** The tau lepton (\( \tau \)) has a mass of approximately 1.78 GeV. A pair (\( \tau^+\tau^- \)) would require \( 2 \times 1.78 = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Thus, \( X \to \tau^+\tau^- \) is allowed.
- **\( \mu^+\mu^- \):** The muon (\( \mu \)) has a mass of approximately 105.7 MeV (\( 0.1057 \, \text{GeV} \)). A pair (\( \mu^+\mu^- \)) would require \( 2 \times 0.1057 = 0.2114 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Thus, \( X \to \mu^+\mu^- \) is allowed.
- **\( e^+e^- \):** The electron (\( e \)) has a mass of approximately 0.511 MeV (\( 0.000511 \, \text{GeV} \)). A pair (\( e^+e^- \)) would require \( 2 \times 0.000511 = 0.001022 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Thus, \( X \to e^+e^- \) is allowed.

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2 \times 4.5 = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B:** Includes \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), and \( e^+e^- \). All these decays are kinematically allowed, as their total masses are less than or equal to 6 GeV. This option is correct.
- **Option C:** Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because the top quark (\( t \)) has a mass of approximately 173 GeV, making \( 2 \times 173 = 346 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. Hence, this option is incorrect.

Thus, the only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order are listed in **Option B**.
