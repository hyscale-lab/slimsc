Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says: We have two reactions, and we need to select the correct reagents from the options given. 

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. 

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing reagents A and B.

Hmm. So I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw their structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, the ketone group is being converted into a cyanohydrin. Oh wait, yes, that rings a bell. I remember that cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone reacts with cyanide ions in the presence of an acid catalyst. So the reaction is the addition of NaCN to the ketone.

Wait, but usually, the formation of cyanohydrin requires an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen attacks the adjacent proton, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So the reagent A here would be an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B) or maybe something else like H2SO4. But looking at the options, the possible A's are H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Oh wait, in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. But in the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group, and it's converted into a carboxylic acid. That probably involves hydrolysis. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form carboxylic acids or amines, depending on the conditions.

So first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. So the acid is needed as a catalyst.

In the options, A could be H3O+ (like in options A and B) or NaHSO3 (options C and D). So which one is it?

Wait, but sometimes when you use HCN, it's done under acidic conditions. Alternatively, perhaps using an aqueous solution with HCN and a source of acid. If the reaction uses NaCN and a strong acid like H3O+ (which is H+ from H3O+), then that would make sense.

So for the first reaction, I think reagent A is H3O+.

Now for the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is treated with reagent B (which is H2O) to form a carboxylic acid. Wait, no, the reagent is B and H2O. So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The usual conditions are acidic (like with H2SO4 and H2O) or basic (like with NaOH and H2O), followed by acid work-up.

In the product, we have a carboxylic acid. So the reaction must be under acidic conditions. Because if you have a nitrile, say R-CN, and you add water and acid, it'll undergo hydrolysis to R-COOH.

So the reagent B must be an acid. Looking at the options, the possible B reagents are HCl, CH3COOH, or HCl again.

Wait, the options for B are:

Option A: B = HCl

Option B: B = CH3COOH

Option C: B = HCl

Option D: B = CH3COOH

Wait, the problem says that in the second reaction, the reagent is B and H2O. So the reagent B is probably the acid. So for the nitrile to hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid, the conditions would be acidic. So the reagent B would be an acid.

But in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH for options A and B, and same for C and D.

So in the second reaction, the nitrile (butanenitrile) is converted to a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B should be an acid, probably HCl or another strong acid. Alternatively, CH3COOH is a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, but the reaction is hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The typical conditions for that are either strong acid (like H2SO4) or strong base followed by acid. But if using a weak acid, would that work? Maybe in some cases, but perhaps the problem is assuming that.

So looking at the options, the possible B reagents are HCl (options A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D).

Wait, but in the first reaction, if A is H3O+, which is option A and B. So for the second reaction, if B is HCl, then option A and C would have A as H3O+ and B as HCl. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, then options B and D have A as H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, but the second reaction requires an acid for hydrolysis. So if the reagent B is HCl, that's a strong acid. If it's CH3COOH, that's a weak acid. Which is more likely to be used in such a reaction?

In practice, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids is often done under acidic conditions using H2SO4 as a catalyst, but sometimes other acids can work. Alternatively, using HCl as the acid would make sense.

So if the second reaction uses HCl as the acid (B = HCl), then looking back at the options, which ones have B as HCl?

Options A and C.

But in the first reaction, if A is H3O+ (as I thought), then option A's A is H3O+, B is HCl. So option A would be a possible choice.

But wait, let me check. Let me think again about the reagents.

Wait in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So the reaction
