Okay, let's see. I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complicated, but let's break it down.

So, the problem starts with Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Then, it reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Plus, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Alright, I think I should start by identifying what each of these substances could be.

First, let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G. Then G, when heated, gives B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Let me convert that to Celsius because I'm more familiar with common melting points in that scale. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, what substances have a melting point near 4°C? Oh, maybe something like ice? Wait, no, ice melts at 0°C. Or maybe something else. Wait, maybe sodium hydroxide? No, that's way higher. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C, which is just above 0. What else? Oh, maybe something like ammonium chloride? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is water? No, water freezes at 0, so melting point is 0. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is something like sodium chloride? No, NaCl has a melting point of around 800°C. Hmm, maybe I'm going the wrong way. Let's think about gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, if the molecule is something like H2O, that's H and O. H has 1 proton, O has 8. But H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Wait, but each molecule must have same number of protons and neutrons. So, for each molecule, the sum of protons equals the sum of neutrons. Alternatively, perhaps each atom in the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, the way it's phrased, "gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons"—I think it's that the molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons in total. Or maybe each atom in the molecule has equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, maybe it's a diatomic molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. For example, O has 8 protons, but if it's a heavier isotope, like O-18, which has 8 protons and 10 neutrons. But then O's protons and neutrons are 8 and 8 (if it's O-16, which is more common). Wait, but for a gas, perhaps it's H2. Because each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, but wait, that's not equal. Or maybe D2 (deuterium), each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So the molecule has 2 atoms, each with 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons would be 2, total neutrons 2. So equal. That could be. So gas W is H2 or D2. But wait, H2 has each H with 0 neutrons, so for H2, protons = 2, neutrons = 0. So no, that doesn't match. But deuterium would be D2, each with 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons = 2, neutrons = 2. So W is D2? But D2 is not a common gas; regular H2 is more likely. Alternatively, maybe it's another gas.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule is CO, but wait, that would have C (6 protons, 6 neutrons if it's 12C) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons if 16O). So CO has 6+8 = 14 protons, and 6+8 = 14 neutrons. So total protons and neutrons equal. So CO could be W. But CO is a gas, yes. Alternatively, maybe it's another molecule.

Wait, another possibility: NH3. Wait, each molecule's protons sum to 3 (from N) + 3 (from H) = 6. Neutrons: N has 7, but let's see. If it's the common isotope, N is 14N, which has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. H is 1H with 0 neutrons. So each NH3 would have: 14 (N) + 3*(1) (H) = 17 protons. Neutrons: 7 (from N) + 0 from H =7. So 17 vs 7, not equal. Doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is CH4. Let's see. C has 6 protons, H is 1 each. So for CH4: 6 +4*1 =10 protons. Neutrons: C is 6 (if it's 12C, 6 neutrons), H has 0. So 6 neutrons. 10 vs 6, not equal. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's another approach. Maybe the molecule of W is something like O2 or N2. O2: each O has 8 protons. So O2 has 16 protons. Neutrons: each O-16 has 8, so 16 in total. So protons and neutrons both 16. That fits! So W is O2 gas. Because each molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That makes sense. So W is O2.

So the reaction is X + Y → O2 + G (precipitate). Now, when G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is about 4°C. What's a solid that melts around 4°C? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? Because when it's heated, it decomposes. Wait, but I'm not sure about its melting point. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else.

Wait, another approach. Think about the precipitate G. If X and Y are reacting, perhaps it's a metal reacting with an acid. For example, a metal (like sodium) reacting with water (Y could be water). But wait, sodium reacting with water produces H2 (gas?), but earlier we thought W is O2, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, the reaction of X with Y produces O2. So what reacts with something to produce O2? Maybe a peroxide decomposes, but that's usually when heated. Alternatively, maybe a metal reacts with an acid in a way that O2 is released. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the product when G is heated gives B. B is a solid that melts at 4°C. Hmm, maybe it's a hydrated salt that loses water when heated. For example, perhaps G is sodium carbonate decahydrate, which when heated releases water, but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide. Wait, perhaps G is sodium hydroxide. But when heated, sodium hydroxide doesn't release B. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: think about the product when X reacts with a keto acid. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So, the reaction of X with a keto acid gives something with 2 oxygen atoms. X is a reagent used in organic chemistry. Common reagents are things like NaBH4, LiAlH4 (but those are for reductions). Alternatively, maybe something like NaOH or another base. But wait, if X is something like NaOH, reacting with a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid) would produce a salt, water, and perhaps release CO2. Wait, but the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the keto acid has a structure like RCOOH. If X is something like LiAlH4, it would reduce the acid to an alcohol. But that product would have more oxygen? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a metal, and when it reacts with an acid (Y), it produces H2 gas. But earlier we thought W is O2. So perhaps Y is not an acid but another substance. Alternatively, maybe X is a peroxide. Wait, for example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacts with water to produce O2 and NaOH. So the reaction would be: 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑. So in this case, X could be Na2O2, Y is H2O, W is O2. The precipitate G is NaOH, but that's a solution, not precipitate. Hmm, not right.

Wait, maybe the precipitate is a metal hydroxide. So perhaps X is a metal, Y is an acid. For example, Mg reacts with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2 gas, and heat. But then W is H2. But earlier, we thought W might be O2. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, let me go back. So W is O2. So the reaction produces O2. So perhaps X is a peroxide or another oxygen-containing compound.

Wait, another possibility: if Y is an acid, like sulfuric acid, and X is something that reacts with it to produce O2. Maybe a metal, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe X is a potassium permanganate, but that usually produces O2 when heated, not in a reaction with another liquid.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the possible identity of X. The question says that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, for example, if X is NaOH, perhaps it's using a heavier isotope of Na (like Na-23 or something heavier? Wait, Na has isotopes like Na-23 (most common with 11 neutrons), but I'm not sure if any heavier are common. Alternatively, if X is something like Cl-35 or Cl-37, but that's about chlorine.

Wait, another thought: X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents are NaBH4, LiAlH4, K (potassium), Na (sodium), etc. Wait, but which of these would produce O2 when reacting with a liquid?

Wait, another approach: look at the product with the keto acid. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So, perhaps X is a base that neutralizes the acid, producing a salt and water. Or maybe X is a reducing agent. Alternatively, maybe X is something like LiAlH4, which reduces a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid) to an alcohol. Then, the product would have more oxygen? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a metal, and when it reacts with a keto acid (like a ketone?), it produces something else. Wait, the question says "a certain keto acid". So, a keto acid is a carboxylic acid where the COOH group is attached to a ketone. So, for example, acetoacetic acid.

If X is a base, like NaOH, then the reaction would produce a salt, water, and perhaps release CO2. But the product would have more oxygens? Not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a reducing agent, like LiAlH4, it would reduce the keto acid. For example, reducing a carboxylic acid to an alcohol. For example, RCOOH → RCH2OH. But the product would have more hydrogens and less oxygens. Wait, but the question says the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, not sure.

Let me think about the reaction products again. The reaction of X with Y produces O2 and a precipitate G. Then G, when heated, gives B, which melts at 4°C. So, when G is heated, it decomposes to form B, which is a solid with a low melting point.

Wait, another angle: maybe G is a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate precipitates when certain reactions happen. When heated, sodium carbonate decomposes into Na2O and CO2. But then B would be a solid, like Na2O. But Na2O's melting point is much higher, around 1360°C. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate, which upon heating decomposes into CO2 and a hydroxide. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) when heated gives Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But then B would be Na2CO3, which has a higher melting point (around 824°C). No, that's way above 4°C.

Wait, another possibility: maybe G is a hydrated salt. For example, copper sulfate pentahydrate. When heated, it loses water and becomes anhydrous copper sulfate. But copper sulfate's melting point is around 150°C. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is something like ice. Wait, ice's melting point is 0
