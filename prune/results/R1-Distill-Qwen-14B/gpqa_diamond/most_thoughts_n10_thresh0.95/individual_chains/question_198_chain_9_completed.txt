Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. I remember that this probably has to do with complex ion equilibria and stability constants. 

So the problem gives me the concentrations: [Co(II)] is 10^-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants, β1 to β4, are given as 9, 40, 63, 16. Wait, stability constants usually increase with the order of the complex, right? But wait, β values are for each step. So for Co(SCN)_n, the βn is the formation constant for the nth complex.

The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4. So, each βn is the formation constant for that complex. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. That's odd because usually higher n complexes have higher β. Maybe the question has a typo, but I'll proceed as given.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, right? So n=2. So I need to find the concentration of Co(SCN)_2^2+ relative to all other Co species.

The approach is to calculate the distribution of Co among the different complexes. Since the solution involves multiple complexes, I can model this using the stability constants (β) and the concentrations of the ions.

The general formula for the fraction of each complex is given by the log of the ratio of the concentrations and the β values. But wait, the formula for the fraction of each species is (β^n * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum of all β^n [SCN^-]^n terms for n from 0 to 4). But wait, no, the fraction equation is based on the formation constants and the ligand concentrations.

Alternatively, I think the fraction of each complex is given by (β_n [SCN^-]^n) divided by the sum over all m of (β_m [SCN^-]^m), where m ranges from 0 to 4. Because each complex is formed stepwise, and the β values are cumulative. But wait, no, the β values are for each step. Let me clarify.

Wait, stability constants for complexes are typically cumulative. So the formation of Co(SCN)_n is the product of all the steps up to n. So β_total for n=1 is β1, for n=2 it's β1*β2, etc. But wait, in the given, the β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that can't be right because if they were cumulative, each step would need to be multiplied. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the βn here is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So for the first complex, Co(SCN), β1 is 9. For the second, Co(SCN)2, β2 is 40, etc.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the overall β usually increases with n. Here, β3 is 63 and β4 is 16, which is lower. That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed with the given numbers.

So, the general approach is to compute the fraction of each complex, then sum them to get the total, and then take the fraction for the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

So, the formula for the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum from m=0 to 4 of β_m [SCN^-]^m )

Wait, but wait, when m=0, that's the [Co^2+] ion itself. So β_0 would be 1, because Co^2+ is the starting point. So the denominator is sum from m=0 to 4 of (β_m [SCN^-]^m ), where β_0 is 1.

But wait, looking at the given β's, I think the β values are for each step. So the formation constants are stepwise. So β1 is the formation constant for the first SCN-, β2 is the second, and so on.

So the overall β for the complex Co(SCN)_n would be the product of β1 to βn. Because each step adds another SCN^-.

Oh wait, I think I got it wrong earlier. Let me think again. The given β's are the stepwise formation constants. So β1 is the formation constant for the first ligand: Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)^2+, with β1 = 9.

β2 is the formation constant for the second ligand: Co(SCN)^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_2^2+, with β2 = 40.

Similarly, β3 would be for the third ligand, so Co(SCN)_2^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_3^3+ (no, wait, charge? Wait, Co is II, each SCN is -1. So Co(SCN)_n^2+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_{n+1}^{2- (n+1)}? No, wait, Co(II) is +2. Each SCN is -1. So for n SCN's, charge is 2 -n. So Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}.

So the overall β for the complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise β's up to n. So the overall β for n=1 is β1=9, for n=2 it's β1*β2=9*40=360, for n=3 it's 9*40*63=22680, and for n=4 it's 9*40*63*16= 9*40 is 360, *63 is 22680, *16 is 362880.

Wait, but the question gives β4 as 16, but that would be the stepwise β for the fourth ligand. So the overall β for each complex are:

β_1_total = β1 =9,

β_2_total = β1 * β2= 9*40=360,

β_3_total = 9*40*63= 22680,

β_4_total= 9*40*63*16= 362880.

Wait, but that would mean the overall β increases a lot with n, which makes sense as the more ligands, the more stable the complex.

Now, the fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n_total [SCN^-]^n) / (sum for m=0 to 4 of β_m_total [SCN^-]^m )

Wait, but for n=0, it's just [Co^2+], so the term would be [SCN^-]^0 =1, and β_0_total is 1 (because it's just the free ion).

So the denominator is:

sum for m=0 to 4 of (β_m_total * [SCN^-]^m )

But wait, for m=0, [Co^2+] is present as β0_total [SCN]^0 = 1*1=1.

So let me compute each term.

Given [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Compute each [SCN^-]^m:

m=0 → 1,

m=1 → 0.1,

m=2 → 0.01,

m=3 → 0.001,

m=4 →0.0001.

Now compute each β_m_total * [SCN^-]^m.

Compute for each m:

m=0: β0 * [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1 =1.

m=1: β1_total * [SCN]^1 =9 * 0.1=0.9.

m=2: β2_total * [SCN]^2 = 360 * 0.01=3.6.

m=3: β3_total * [SCN]^3 =22680 * 0.001=22.68.

m=4: β4_total * [SCN]^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Now sum all these terms:

1 (m=0) + 0.9 (m=1)=1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

The fraction for m=2 (which is the [Co(SCN)_2^+] complex) is 3.6 divided by 64.468.

Wait, 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05556, which is 5.556%? But wait, the options are all in the 16-42% range. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck the m=4 term.

Wait, m=4: β4_total is 9*40*63*16. Let me compute that step by step.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

β1_total=9.

β2_total=9*40=360.

β3_total=360*63= 360 *60=21600 +360*3=1080 → 22680.

β4_total=22680 *16= 362880.

So [SCN^-]^4 is 0.1^4=0.0001.

So m=4 term: 362880 * 0.0001 =36.288.

Wait, that's correct.

Now the sum is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me add them again:

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

Now the fraction for m=2 is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05556, which is 5.556%.

But the options don't have that. So I must have done something wrong. Maybe I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. But perhaps those are the overall stability constants for each complex, not the stepwise. Oh, that's possible. Because the way the question is phrased: "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Oh, that's a key point. So if β1 is the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)], β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2], etc. So I don't need to multiply them stepwise.

Wait, that's a different scenario. So in this case, each βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN ions. So the fraction is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{m=1 to 4} β_m [SCN^-]^m )

Wait, no, because the sum would be all possible species, including the free Co^2+.

Wait, the general formula for the distribution is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{m=1 to max_n} β_m [SCN^-]^m )

Wait, no, wait. The correct formula for fraction of a complex is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{m=1 to 4} β_m [SCN^-]^m )

Because the denominator accounts for all possible species: the free Co^2+ (term 1) and each complex (m=1 to 4).

So in this case, each βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN ions.

So let me recompute with this understanding.

Given [SCN^-] =0.1 M.

Compute each term:

β1 [SCN]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.01)=0.4.

β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063.

β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016.

Sum all the βm [SCN]^m from m=1 to 4: 0.9 +0.4=1.3; 1.3+0.063=1.363; 1.363 +0.0016=1.3646.

Add 1 for the free Co^2+ term: denominator is 1 +1.3646=2.3646.

Now, the fraction for m=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646.

Compute 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169, which is about 16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

So that would correspond to m=2, which is 16.9% of all species.

So the answer is D) 16.9%.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the initial approach. The problem arises from whether the β values are stepwise or overall. The question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So each β is for the corresponding complex, implying they're overall, not stepwise. That's why the previous approach with each βn being the overall is correct.

Therefore, the correct fraction is about 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations. The stability constants β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, and β₄=16 represent the overall stability constants for the complexes [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, [Co(SCN)₃]³⁺, and [Co(SCN)₄]⁴⁺, respectively. The fraction of each complex is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \sum_{m=1}^{4} \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
\]

where \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The denominator accounts for all possible species: the free cobalt ion (Co²⁺, represented by the term 1) and the complexes formed with 1 to 4 thiocyanate ions.

### Step 1: Compute the contributions of each complex
For \( m = 1 \) to \( 4 \), calculate \( \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m \):
- \( m = 1 \): \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( m = 2 \): \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( m = 3 \): \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( m = 4 \): \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

Sum these contributions:
\[
\sum_{m=1}^{4} \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646
\]

Add the term for the free cobalt ion (1) to get the denominator:
\[
1 + \sum_{m=1}^{4} \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, \( m = 2 \)) is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{1 + \sum_{m=1}^{4} \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
f_2 \approx 0.169
\]

Convert this to a percentage:
\[
f_2 \approx 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
