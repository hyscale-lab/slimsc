--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says we have a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They give me the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we're supposed to find the momentum of a photon that would switch it to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, so the model used here is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that in such models, the molecule's energy comes from both rotational and vibrational states.

In the quantum mechanical model, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels are given by something like E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number. And the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (ν + 1/2) h w, where ν is the vibrational quantum number.

But wait, the question is about the molecule transitioning to the next state. Since it's in the fundamental state, that's usually the lowest vibrational state, which is ν=0. So, when it absorbs a photon, I think it's going to jump to the next vibrational state, which would be ν=1. But wait, or could it also involve a change in rotational state?

Wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, the molecule is in the ground vibrational state and ground rotational state. The next state could be either the next rotational state (J=1) for the same vibrational state or the next vibrational state (ν=1) with the same rotational state.

But the question is about the lowest possible energy next state. So, which transition requires less energy? That depends on which transition emits a lower photon energy. Wait, but the photon is being absorbed, so which transition would have lower energy, hence lower photon energy.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energies involved. The vibrational energy spacing is (1/2) h w between ν=0 and ν=1. The rotational energy spacing between J=0 and J=1 is B [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J-1) ] or wait, for J=0 to J=1, it would be E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B [ (1)(2) - 0 ] = 2B. Hmm, so what's the relation between B and w?

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by (h^2)/(8 π² μ R²), where μ is the reduced mass. And the vibrational energy depends on the same reduced mass, but the expression is (1/2) m ω² R² for the zero-point energy, but the photon energy will be h w.

So let me see: let's compute the energy difference for the rotational transition and the vibrational transition.

But wait, the question asks for the photon's momentum. Oh, right, momentum p is equal to h divided by λ. But since the photon's energy E is h f, and since f = c / λ, so p = h f / c = E / c. So, if I can find the energy ΔE that the photon must have, then p = ΔE / c.

So, I need to find which transition (rotational or vibrational) is lower in energy and thus requires a lower momentum photon.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, do we account for both rotational and vibrational changes? Or is the model considering that the bond length can change, hence affecting the moment of inertia?

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model, also known as the rotation-vibration coupling model, allows for the bond length to change during rotation, which complicates things. But maybe for the purposes of this problem, it's simpler to think of the transitions as either vibration or rotation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (ν=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). To go to the next state with the lowest possible energy, the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or its rotational state. But which one requires less energy.

So let me calculate the energies for each possible transition.

First, let's calculate the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (ν + 1/2) h w. The fundamental state is ν=0, so the next vibrational state is ν=1. The energy difference ΔE_vib is h w (1 + 1/2 - 0 - 1/2) = h w.

Wait, no. Wait, E_vib for ν=0 is (0 + 1/2) h w, and for ν=1, it's (1 + 1/2) h w. So the difference is (3/2 - 1/2) h w = h w.

So the energy needed for a vibrational transition is h w.

Now for the rotational transition. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B = (h^2)/(8 π² μ R²). For J=0, E_rot is 0. For J=1, E_rot is 2 B. So the energy difference ΔE_rot is 2 B.

So which is smaller, h w or 2 B?

If h w < 2 B, then the vibrational transition requires less energy. If 2 B < h w, then the rotational transition is lower.

So I need to compute both h w and 2 B, then compare.

Given that w is 4e14 rad/s. So h w is Planck's constant times angular frequency.

h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now, let's compute B.

B = h²/(8 π² μ R²).

But first, I need the reduced mass μ. μ is (m_X * m_Y)/(m_X + m_Y).

Wait, the masses are given in amu. I need to convert them into kilograms.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So m_X is 20 amu: 20 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-26 kg.

m_Y is 2 amu: 2 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y) = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27).

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (3.321e-26) * (3.321e-27) = let's compute 3.321^2 is about 11, so 11e-53 kg².

Denominator: 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

So μ ≈ (11e-53) / (3.6531e-26) ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, let me do that more accurately.

Wait, 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = 3.321^2 * 1e-53. 3.321 squared is approx (3.3^2)=10.89, but 3.321^2 = 3.321 * 3.321. Let me compute that.

3 * 3 =9. 3 * 0.321 = 0.963. 0.321 * 3 =0.963, and 0.321 *0.321≈0.103.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 3.321 *3.321:

3.321 * 3 =9.963

3.321 * 0.321 = let's compute:

3 *0.321=0.963, 0.321*0.321=0.103.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 3.321^2 as 3^2 + 2*3*0.321 +0.321^2 =9 + 1.926 + 0.103 ≈ 11.029.

So numerator is 11.029e-53 kg².

Denominator is (3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26) kg = 3.6531e-26 kg.

So μ = 11.029e-53 / 3.6531e-26 = approximately (11.029 / 3.6531) )e-27 kg.

11.029 /3.6531 is approximately 3. (because 3.6531 *3=10.9593, close to 11.029). So about 3.02e-27 kg.

Now, B = h²/(8 π² μ R²).

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J·s)^2.

8 π² is approximately 8*(9.8696)≈78.9568.

So 8 π² ≈ 79.

So denominator part 8 π² μ R².

μ is 3.02e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So denominator is 79 * 3.02e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

Let me compute that:

3.02e-27 *4e-20 =1.208e-46 kg m².

Multiply by 79: 1.208e-46 *79 ≈ 9.527e-45 kg m².

So denominator is 9.527e-45.

So B = (4.39e-67) / 9.527e-45 ≈ 4.39e-67 / 9.5e-45 ≈ (4.39/9.5) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.462 * 1e-22 = 4.62e-23 J.

Wait, no. 1e-67 /1e-45 is 1e-22. So 4.39 /9.5≈ 0.462, so 0.462e-22 J.

So B ≈ 4.62e-23 J.

Wait no, 4.39 /9.5 is roughly 0.462, so 0.462e-22 J? So B ≈ 4.62e-23 J.

So the rotational energy difference ΔE_rot is 2B ≈ 9.24e-23 J.

Wait, but earlier we had h w =2.65e-19 J. Comparing these two: 2.65e-19 J is much larger than 9.24e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait: wait no, wait, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me recheck the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units or calculations. Let me recompute B.

B = h²/(8 π² μ R²).

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx (6.626)^2 =43.9, so 43.9e-68 (since (1e-34)^2 is 1e-68) → 4.39e-67 J² s².

Wait, wait, no, J is kg m²/s². So (J s)^2 is (kg^2 m^4/s^2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each part step by step.

Compute h squared:

(6.626e-34 J·s)^2 = (6.626)^2 × (1e-34)^2 × (J^2 s²) → approximately 43.9 ×1e-68 J² s².

So h squared is approximately 4.39e-67 J² s².

Then, 8 π² μ R^2.

μ is 3.02e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m.

R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So 8 π² μ R² = 8 * (pi squared) * 3.02e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

Compute 8 * pi^2 ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

So 78.9568 *3.02e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

Multiply 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Then multiply by 78.9568: 1.208e-46 *78.9568 ≈ approximately 9.52e-45 kg m².

So denominator is 9.52e-45 kg m².

So B = h²/(8 pi^2 mu R^2) = (4.39e-67 J² s²) / (9.52e-45 kg m²) )

Wait, but J is kg m²/s², so J s² = kg m²/s² * s² = kg m².

Wait, so the units: numerator is [kg^2 m^4]/s^2, denominator is kg m². So J² s² is (kg² m^4 s^-2), denominator is kg m².

So the units of B are (kg² m^4 s^-2) / (kg m²) ) = kg m^2 s^-2 → which is (kg m²/s²) → which is Joules. So B has units of Joules.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (9.52e-45) ≈ 4.5e-23 J.

So yes, as before, B is about 4.5e-23 J.

Then 2B is 9e-23 J.

But earlier, h w is 2.65e-19 J. Which is much larger than 9e-23 J.

Wait, that's a big difference. So the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational transition. So the molecule would preferentially make the rotational transition if that's possible.

But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest state, which is J=0 and ν=0. So when it absorbs a photon, it can go to either J=1 (rotational) or ν=1 (vibrational). The problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the molecule would absorb a photon that allows it to transition from J=0 to J=1. So the photon's energy E_photon would be equal to ΔE_rot =2B.

Wait, but wait a second. Does the molecule's energy levels allow for transitions where both rotational and vibrational states change? Because sometimes in such models, transitions can involve changes in both states, but in this case, the question seems to be about the lowest energy next state, which would be the next rotational state, since it requires less energy.

But I'm a bit confused about the model. The question says it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which is more complex than separate rotational and vibrational models. However, perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can treat the transitions as separate, where the molecule can absorb a photon that changes either rotation or vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the total energy difference between the current state (J=0, ν=0) and the next possible state with the least energy. That next state would be the lowest possible energy state higher than the current.

Wait, but the current state is the lowest, so the next possible state would be the next highest, which could be either J=1 (same ν=0) or ν=1 (same J=0). Whichever transition requires less energy.

So comparing ΔE_rot (2B) and ΔE_vib (h w). Which is smaller?

We have h w=2.65e-19 J, and 2B=9e-23 J. So 9e-23 is much smaller. So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the molecule would absorb a photon with energy 2B.

Wait, but wait—could there be another possibility? Like a transition that increases both J and ν? But that would require even more energy, so it's not the next lowest state.

So the photon's energy is 2B, which is the rotational transition.

Thus, the photon's momentum p is E_photon/c.

E_photon=2B =9e-23 J.

c is 3e8 m/s.

p= (9e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) =3e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are 3e-31. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, wait, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg·m/s. So p is in Ns.

So if p is 3e-31 kg·m/s, that's 3e-31 Ns. But the options are all around 1e-27 or 1e-28. My calculation must be wrong.

Hmm. I must have messed up the calculation somewhere.

Let me recompute B.

Let me start from the beginning.

Compute μ: the reduced mass.

m_X =20 amu =20 *1.6605e-27 kg =3.321e-26 kg.

m_Y =2 amu=3.321e-27 kg.

μ= (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y) = (3.321e-26 *3.321e-27)/(3.321e-26 +3.321e-27).

Compute numerator:3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 *1e-53 = ~11 *1e-53 =1.1e-52 kg².

Denominator:3.321e-26 +0.3321e-26 =3.653e-26 kg.

So μ = (1.1e-52) / (3.653e-26) = (1.1/3.653) * 1e-26 → approximately 0.3 *1e-26 =3e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.1 /3.653 is approximately 0.3, so μ≈3e-27 kg.

Now B = h²/(8 pi² μ R²).

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

h squared = (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67 J² s².

8 pi² is approx 78.9568.

R is 2 angstrom =2e-10 meters.

R squared is 4e-20 m².

So denominator: 8 pi^2 * μ * R^2 = 78.9568 *3e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

Compute that: 78.9568 *3e-27 =236.87e-27 =2.3687e-25.

Multiply by 4e-20: 2.3687e-25 *4e-20 =9.475e-45 kg m².

So denominator is 9.475e-45.

So B= (4.39e-67) / (9.475e-45) ≈ approx 4.63e-23 J.

Ah, same as before.

So 2B is 9.26e-23 J.

So photon energy E =9.26e-23 J.

Momentum p = E / c = (9.26e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.26e-23) / (3e8) kg·m/s.

Compute that: 9.26e-23 /3e8 =3.086e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, that's 3.086e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.086e-31 Ns. But none of the options are anywhere near this value.

Wait, the options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range, which is about a million times larger than our calculated value. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm. Let me think again. Maybe I'm confusing the rotational and vibrational transitions.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about transitioning to the next higher energy state, which could be a combination of rotational and vibrational changes. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in its fundamental vibrational state but can change rotationally, but the model being used combines both. Wait, but the question says it's in its fundamental state, so that's both the lowest rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the vibrational transition, not the rotational one. Because I've heard that in such problems, sometimes the vibrational transition is considered as the main one.

But why? Because the rotational energy levels are much closer together, requiring lower energy photons, but perhaps the question wants the energy from the next higher energy state, which would be the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mistakenly thinking that the next state is the next vibrational state. But according to our calculations, the rotational transition is lower in energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me double-check.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters? Yes.

Wait, μ is 3e-27 kg.

h squared is 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 pi^2 mu R^2 =78.9568 *3e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

3e-27 *4e-20 =1.2e-46.

Multiply by 78.9568: 1.2e-46 *78.9568 ≈9.475e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.475e-45 =4.63e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So 2B is 9.26e-23 J.

Hmm. So the momentum p is E/c =9.26e-23 /3e8 ≈3.08e-31 kg m/s =3.08e-31 Ns.

Looking at the options again:

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns → 1.9e-28 is 1e-28, which is about 10^7 times larger than 3e-31.

Wait, so that's way off. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

So, E_photon_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is close but not exactly the same. Hmm. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 6.626 *4 =26.504, so 26.504e-20 → 2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

E_photon_vib =2.65e-19 J.

p =2.65e-19 /3e8 = approx 8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options don't have this exact value. The closest option is A)1.9e-28, which is about half of 8.83e-28. So that doesn't match.

Hmm. So what's going on? Where is my mistake here?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state, which could involve both a change in vibrational and rotational state, but that's not likely because the question says the 'lowest possible energy' next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor approximation, where the bond length R is fixed, which would change the calculation.

Wait, no, because the question says it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which accounts for bond length changes.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reduced mass is being calculated incorrectly. Let me re-calculate the reduced mass again.

m_X =20 amu =20 *1.6605e-27 kg =3.321e-26 kg.

m_Y=2 amu =3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (m_X * m_Y)/(m_X + m_Y) = (3.321e-26 *3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27).

Compute numerator:3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 =3.321^2 *1e-53 = 11.029e-53 kg².

Denominator:3.321e-26 +0.3321e-26 =3.6531e-26 kg.

So μ =11.029e-53 /3.6531e-26 =11.029/(3.6531) ) *1e-27 kg → approximately 3.02e-27 kg.

Yes, same as before. So no mistake there.

Hmm. Alternative approach: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which in the vibration-rotation model is a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes. But that's more complicated and I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So that would be the next higher energy state, which is the lowest possible. So maybe it's a combination of a vibrational and rotational transition that gives a lower total energy than just a pure rotational or pure vibrational transition.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the pure rotational transition has a lower energy than the vibrational, so the next state would just be the rotational one.

Wait, perhaps the model used in the problem combines both, so the energy levels are a sum of rotational and vibrational energies. So the lowest next state would be the one where both J and ν are increased by 1, but that would require more energy than either transition alone.

So perhaps the correct approach is to find the energy difference between the current state (J=0, ν=0) and the next state (J=1, ν=0), and then compare that to the energy difference between (J=0, ν=1).

So, the current state is E= E_rot(0) + E_vib(0) =0 + (1/2 h w).

The next possible states are:

1. J=1, ν=0: E= E_rot(1) + E_vib(0) =2B + (1/2 h w).

2. J=0, ν=1: E= E_rot(0) + E_vib(1) =0 + (3/2 h w).

We need to find the smallest possible ΔE, which is which of these two options.

So, the difference for option 1 would be (2B + 1/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )=2B.

The difference for option 2 would be (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )= h w.

So, comparing 2B and h w.

Earlier, I found h w=2.65e-19 J and 2B=9.26e-23 J. So 2B is smaller, so the next state would be option 1: J=1, ν=0. So the photon energy is 2B, which gives momentum p=2B /c.

But as before, that leads to p=3.08e-31 Ns, which is not among the options.

Hmm. So I'm getting stuck. Let's think—maybe I'm supposed to model this as a pure rotational transition, ignoring the vibrational part, but the question mentions the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the energy for the rotational transition is actually higher than the vibrational one. Let me recompute.

Wait, let me compute 2B and h w again, but more accurately.

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value).

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w=6.62607e-34 *4e14 = 2.650428e-19 J.

2B: earlier found as ~9.26e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.26e-23 J, which is much smaller than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition is lower.

Thus, the photon's momentum would be p=2B / c =9.26e-23 /3e8 ≈3.08e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have that value. So perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the rigid rotor, not the non-rigid one. Let me try that.

In the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed. So R is fixed, and the rotational constant B is computed using the same formula.

Wait, but I already did that. So same result.

Hmm. Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in terms of the total (rotational + vibrational) energy, which would be the combination of J and ν. So the next state is the one with the next higher total energy, which could be either J=1, ν=0 or J=0, ν=1.

We can compute the energy for each and see which is lower.

Energy for J=1, ν=0: E1 = 2B + (1/2 h w).

Energy for J=0, ν=1: E2 = 0 + (3/2 h w).

The energy difference from the ground state (E0 = 0 + (1/2 h w)) is:

For E1: (2B + 1/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) ) = 2B.

For E2: (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )= h w.

Which is lower: 2B is much less than h w, so E1 is the next state.

So photon energy is 2B.

But that brings me back to the same problem: the calculated p is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the energy levels. In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by:

E = E_rot + E_vib.

But the vibrational energy is quantized in quanta of h w, and the rotational similarly.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state in terms of the total energy, which could be a combination of a vibrational and a rotational quantum. But that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the harmonic oscillator approximation for vibration and rigid rotor for rotation. So the energy levels are E_vib = (ν + 1/2) h w, E_rot = B J (J+1).

But that doesn't change the calculation for the energy differences.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Morse potential for the vibration, but I don't think that affects the energy spacing for the transition from ν=0 to ν=1.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the question is looking for the photon momentum that causes a transition from the ground state (J=0, ν=0) to the first excited vibrational state (J=0, ν=1), which would require an energy of h w. So p = h w /c.

But then p would be 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns. The closest option is A)1.9e-28, but that's about 4 times less. So that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w. Let me check:

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. Correct.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the next state which includes both a vibrational and rotational change, leading to a lower energy than the pure vibrational transition.

But I don't see how that would be. Because any change in rotation would add energy.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the transition from (J=0, ν=0) to (J=1, ν=0), which requires 2B, and from (J=0, ν=0) to (J=0, ν=1), which requires h w. So the lower of these is 2B, hence the photon's energy is 2B.

But then, p=2B/c=9.26e-23 /3e8=3.08e-31 Ns. No option matches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let me recompute B with exact numbers.

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s.

μ =3.02e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

B = h²/(8 pi² μ R²).

h² = (6.62607e-34)^2 = approximately 4.3904e-67 J² s².

8 pi² =78.9568352.

mu R²=3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.02e-27 *4e-20 =1.208e-46 kg m².

So denominator is 78.9568352 *1.208e-46 =78.9568352 *1.208e-46 =9.524e-45.

So B=4.3904e-67 /9.524e-45 =4.608e-23 J.

So 2B=9.216e-23 J.

So photon's E=9.216e-23 J.

p=9.216e-23 /3e8=3.072e-31 Ns.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. Now I'm really stuck. Maybe the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which would require h w. So p= h w/c.

Let me compute that again.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, etc.

Wait, 8.83e-28 is approximately 8.8e-28, which is not exactly any option. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w. Let me recompute.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h=6.626e-34.

h *w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) e(-34 +14) =26.504e-20 J.

26.504e-20 is 2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

So p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

Hmm. So the correct answer is not among the options, which suggests I must have made a mistake in understanding the question.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum in the rotational transition, but I'm calculating it incorrectly.

Wait, let's think again: p=E/c. But E is the energy of the photon. So if the photon's energy is 2B, then p=2B/c.

But 2B=9.216e-23 J.

c=3e8 m/s.

So p=9.216e-23 /3e8 =3.072e-31 kg·m/s =3.072e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 or something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require a larger energy. But then the energy would be 6B, which is even smaller than h w. No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy in terms of per molecule, but the calculation is for per mole or something else. No, the problem is about a single molecule.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the model being used treats the diatomic as a three-dimensional rotor. But no, diatomic molecules are treated as two-dimensional (planar) rotors, so the rotational energy is (J(J+1)) times the rotational constant, which in 3D would be different, but in 2D it's the same.

Wait, no, diatomic molecules are linear, so their rotational degrees of freedom are two-dimensional, so J can be 0,1,2,..., and energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), same as before.

I'm really not sure what else to check. Maybe I should re-express all calculations in terms of different units or perhaps there's a miscalculation in exponents.

Wait, let me recheck the exponents.

h=6.626e-34.

w=4e14.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) *1e-34+14=26.504e-20= 2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 Ns.

But Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the value of h or w.

Wait, perhaps the given w is 4e13 rad/s instead of 4e14? Because that would change things.

If w is 4e13, then h w=6.626e-34 *4e13=2.65e-20 J.

p=2.65e-20 /3e8=8.83e-29 Ns. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the given R is 2 angstroms, but I used 2e-10 m. Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition as the only possibility, and I'm missing some factor. For example, perhaps the vibrational energy is (1/2) m ω² R², but that's just the zero-point energy; the photon's energy would still be h ω.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Perhaps I should look at the options and see if any make sense.

Wait, option C is 1.1e-27 Ns.

If p=1.1e-27 Ns, then E= p c =1.1e-27 *3e8=3.3e-19 J.

Which is about 3.3e-19 J. Compare to h w=2.65e-19 J. Close, but not exact.

Hmm, but 3.3e-19 is about 1.25 times h w. That doesn't make sense, because E_photon can't be higher than the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the vibrational energy in terms of energy levels including both rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum in the vibrational transition, but I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute 2.65e-19 J /3e8 m/s =8.83e-28 Ns. So none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass is being calculated incorrectly. Let me check again.

m_X=20 amu =20 *1.6605e-27 kg=3.321e-26 kg.

m_Y=2 amu=3.321e-27 kg.

μ= (3.321e-26 *3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27).

Calculate numerator: 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 *1e-53 =11.029e-53.

Denominator:3.321e-26 +0.3321e-26=3.6531e-26.

μ=11.029e-53 /3.6531e-26 = 3.02e-27 kg.

Yes, correct. So no mistake there.

I'm really stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns.

Wait, let me compute 1.1e-27 Ns *c =1.1e-27 *3e8 =3.3e-19 J.

Which is higher than h w=2.65e-19 J. So that can't be right.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the rotational constant in terms of energy per molecule. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state in terms of the rotational state, which is J=1, but the energy is 2B, which we calculated as 9.2e-23 J.

But then p=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns. No option matches.

Wait, the options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. That's about 1e5 times larger than our calculated 3e-31.

Wait a second—did I perhaps miss a factor of 1e5 somewhere? For example, perhaps the bond length was given in angstroms, but I converted to meters correctly.

No, R is 2 angstroms =2e-10 m. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of B again.

Wait, B =h²/(8 pi² μ R²).

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67.

8 pi² =78.9568.

μ R²=3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.02e-27 *4e-20 =1.208e-46.

Multiply 78.9568 *1.208e-46 =9.524e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.524e-45 =4.608e-23 J.

Wait, 4.6e-23 J is correct.

So the photon energy is 2B=9.216e-23 J.

So p=9.216e-23 /3e8=3.072e-31 Ns. No match.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the moment of inertia as I =mu R^2, but the rotational constant is B = (h^2)/(8 pi² I).

Which is what I did.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option C)1.1
