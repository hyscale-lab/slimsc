Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reactions, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let me try to think through each part carefully.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile (enolate) attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO-)2CH-. So when it forms an enolate, it's the central CH that becomes the nucleophilic site. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the acrylate part is CH2CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the structure should be CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-p-tolyl. Hmm, actually, more accurately, it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the substituent on the third carbon. Wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with the p-tolyl group attached to the middle carbon? Or maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; substituting on the third carbon (the middle carbon) would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so the three carbons are CH2-CH-COO-. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the p-tolyl group is on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the carbonyl is on the third carbon. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH–CO-OCH3 with the COO- attached to the acrylate, but I think I might be mixing up the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-p-tolyl group attached to the acrylate. Wait, maybe it's more like CH2=CH–C(p-tolyl)OCH3, but that doesn't fit the formula. Maybe it's methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)prop-2-enoate. So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Oh, that
