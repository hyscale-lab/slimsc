Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i, right? And when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So we need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square (the probability density) must integrate to 1 over all space because the probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should be equal to 1.

Wait, but the wave function given is a bit tricky. It's ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me think, the modulus squared would be the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts, right? Because for a complex number, |ψ|² = (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))².

So let's compute ψ(x) first. The real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ(x)|² would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)². Because when you square it, the signs don't matter, so 0.5 squared is 0.25.

So the probability density is [a² / (1 + x)] + 0.25. And to find the total probability, we integrate this from 1 to 3.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function can't just have an imaginary constant term. Because when you solve the Schrödinger equation, the wave function isn't necessarily real. But the condition here is that the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function is zero outside that region. Oh, but the given wave function isn't zero outside 1-3. Hmm, maybe the model is such that the wave function is as given, but only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Or perhaps the wave function is defined only in that region, which is why the measurements are confined there.

But I think the problem is more about normalization. So let's proceed.

The integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1 + x) + 0.25] dx must equal 1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because if the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. So integrating that over x from 1 to 3 will give 1.

So the integral is ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

I can split this into two integrals: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 plus 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to3.

Let me compute each part.

First part: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So first part is a² * ln(2).

Second part: 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*(2) = 0.5.

Adding both parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is roughly 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in the process?

Another thing: the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of |ψ|^2 must be 1. I did that correctly, I think. So the calculation seems right.

So the value of a is approximately 0.85.


To solve the problem, we need to normalize the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) over the region \( x \in [1, 3] \). The normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this region equals 1.

### Step 1: Compute \( |\psi(x)|^2 \)
The wave function has a real part \( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \) and an imaginary part \( -0.5 \). The probability density is:
\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

### Step 2: Set up the normalization condition
The normalization condition is:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]
Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \):
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1
\]

### Step 3: Split the integral
The integral can be split into two parts:
\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 1
\]

#### Part 1: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \)
The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):
\[
\ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

#### Part 2: \( \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx \)
The integral of \( 1 \) over \( [1, 3] \) is:
\[
3 - 1 = 2
\]

### Step 4: Combine results
Substitute the results back into the equation:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1
\]
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( a^2 \)
Rearranging:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]
\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

### Final Answer
The value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
