Okay, I'm trying to figure out this Michael addition problem. So, the question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. I need to determine the reactants and the major products for each case and then match them with the options given.

Let me start by recalling what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile (like an enolate) to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and creating a new enolate intermediate.

The first reaction is (A): dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. In such conditions, the base would deprotonate the alpha position of the malonate to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2, right? So when deprotonated, the enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CHCO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, E-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2CH2? No, wait, the acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, actually, wait, the formula is CH2=CH- group attached to the carbonyl. So the correct structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But wait, the E configurationâ€”so the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. For (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be: the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 2 and a methyl ester on carbon 1? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the acrylate group is -CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so methyl acrylate would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon, but wait, that would make it CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's the substituent on the acrylate chain. Maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, but then
