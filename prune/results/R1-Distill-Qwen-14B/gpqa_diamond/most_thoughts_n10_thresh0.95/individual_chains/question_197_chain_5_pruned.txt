Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in a reaction known as the HI (hydroiodic acid) cleavage, especially in the context of alkenes. When an alkene reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it usually leads to the cleavage of the double bond, adding iodide across the former double bond. So the reaction is probably an addition reaction.

First, I need to determine what Compound X looks like. They've given IR and NMR data, so I'll start by analyzing those.

Looking at the IR data:
- The broad peak between 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests an -OH group (maybe a carboxylic acid or an alcohol) or an N-H stretch, but since there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid). Wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm-1, often a very broad peak. So maybe that's a carboxylic acid?

But wait, looking again, the IR peaks are 3400–2500 (broad, possibly O-H?), 1720 (carbonyl), and then 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe there's an aromatic ring with some substituents. The 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl group attached to the aromatic ring, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Now, the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very deshielded proton. Common in aromatic protons, but wait, 10.5 is more like an aldehyde proton. But wait, wait a minute. Or maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. The broad singlet (bs) could be a carboxylic O-H proton. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So that could fit.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted. Because a doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton has two adjacent protons, but maybe in a substituent pattern that leads to a doublet. Alternatively, maybe it's an ortho coupling but that usually leads to more splitting. Hmm, not entirely sure, but let's hold that thought.

-7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, also doublet. Maybe this is a meta substitution, but more likely, it's part of a para-substituted benzene. Wait, maybe it's a substituent like a carbonyl group (like benzene ring with a ketone or carboxylic acid group) and another substituent that affects the ring's electron density.

The other peaks are at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). That's a little tricky. Let's try to piece this together.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, maybe a CH2CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH, like CH(CH3). The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be two protons adjacent to the CH(CH3) and perhaps connected to another CH2.

Wait, this seems similar to a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Let me think: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a multiplet, which could be the central CH in a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- structure. So perhaps there's an ethyl group attached to something else.

Alternatively, maybe there's a substituent on the benzene ring that's a ketone (from the IR 1720) and an ethyl group or some other substituent.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure. Suppose the ring has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or carboxylic acid) and another substituent, perhaps an isopropyl group or a butyl group.

Wait, let's look at the 1H NMR again:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): O-H of a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Could this be a para-substituted ring with two groups, say a carbonyl (like a ketone) and another substituent? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ring has a substituent that causes the two sets of protons to split into doublets. Wait, if it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but perhaps one of them is a carbonyl group, making it a para-substituted ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitro group or something else.

Wait, let's consider the substituent on the benzene. If the ring has a carbonyl group (like a ketone) at one position and another substituent at the para position, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. For example, if the substituent is in the para position relative to the carbonyl, then the protons ortho to the substituent would be a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a para-substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and another substituent, say an isobutyl group or something similar.

But let's think about the other NMR peaks. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH that's part of a chain attached to the ring. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): possibly two CH2 groups, but perhaps they're adjacent to a CH and a CH(CH3). The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH3 group.

So putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a group like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but then the structure would be a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a butyl group? Or perhaps a propyl group? Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but the IR suggests a carbonyl, so maybe the substituent is a ketone. Let's say the benzene ring has a carbonyl group (like a benzophenone derivative) and another substituent.

Wait, maybe the substituent is not on the ring but in a chain attached to the ring. Let me think about the NMR shifts again.

The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That could be a CH group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps as in a ketone. Wait, but if it's a ketone, the carbonyl is O, and the adjacent CH would be around 2.1-2.5 ppm, but 2.9 is higher, maybe if it's a secondary carbon adjacent to something else.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and an ethyl group attached via the ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent attached that is a ketone (like benzophenone) and another substituent that's an isopropyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -C(O)CH2CH2CH3 group. But that might not fit all the peaks.

Wait, let me try to piece together the structure.

The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm: O-H of a carboxylic acid. So there's a COOH group somewhere.

But wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, so that fits. The broad peak around 3000 would be the O-H stretch of the acid.

So if there's a COOH group attached to the ring, that's a possibility. Then, the substituent on the ring would be a COOH group and another group, perhaps an ethyl or isobutyl group.

Looking at the NMR shifts again, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each a doublet, 2H each. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene, where the substituents are in the para positions. So if the COOH is at position 1, the substituent would be at position 4.

Wait, but in that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6, perhaps. Wait, no, para substitution would have substituents in 1 and 4 positions, leading to protons in 2,3,5,6 positions. Wait, no, if substituents are at 1 and 4, the adjacent protons would be at 2 and 6, and 3 and 5. So perhaps the two doublets in the NMR correspond to the H at 2 and 6, and H at 3 and 5.

Wait, but if substituents are at 1 and 4, the H at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the substituent at 1, and their chemical shifts would be downfield. Similarly, the H at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to substituent at 4. So if substituent at 1 is COOH, substituent at 4 is another group, perhaps a chain.

So, for the aromatic Hs:

- H at 2 and 6: possibly more deshielded, appear at higher ppm (8.0 ppm as doublets).

- H at 3 and 5: perhaps less deshielded, appear at lower ppm (like 7.2 ppm as doublets).

That makes sense. So the ring has two substituents in para positions: a COOH group at position 1 and another group (let's say R) at position 4.

Now, looking at the other NMR peaks:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to another CH2 group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 (t,3H) is a CH2CH3 group.

So perhaps the substituent R is a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would make R an isobutyl group? Or maybe a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, wait. Let me think: the substituent R is attached to the benzene ring, and the structure is benzene-4-COOR, but that's not matching the given data. Alternatively, R is a carbon chain, perhaps an isobutyl group.

Wait, let me think about the substituent structure.

The NMR shows:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH2CH3 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two protons, perhaps adjacent to the CH and the CH2.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group connected to other groups.

So putting this together, the structure could be a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a substituent at position 4 which is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. Wait, but that would make the substituent a butyl group, but perhaps it's a propyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Or perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, which would make R an isopropyl group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, but then the NMR wouldn't show the 0.9 ppm triplet.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But let me think: if the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the structure would be benzene with a substituent like -(CH2)3CH3. But that's a n-butyl group. But looking at the NMR, there's a triplet at 0.9, which would correspond to the CH2CH3 group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the branching point. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the CH3 attached to the branching CH. Then, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be that branching CH.

So, the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but the benzene is attached to R at position 4. So the structure would be 4-(n-butyl)benzoic acid. Wait, but one of the options is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C). Or wait, let's look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me see. A sec-butyl group would be a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon. So it would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl would be CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, no, wait:_SEC-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait. Let me think: butyl groups can be n-butyl, iso-butyl, or sec-butyl. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3, but with the point of attachment at the first carbon.

iso-butyl: (CH2)2CHCH2-, but wait, no. Wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

I think I should better recall the structures:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (straight chain, four carbons).

- iso-butyl: CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but wait, iso-butyl is a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch on the first carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, no. iso-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no. Wait, the iso-butyl group is actually -(CH2)CH(CH3)2?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think of substituents. The substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is attached as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the structure would be benzene with a COOH group at position 1 and a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group at position 4.

Wait, but the IR and NMR data also show peaks that include 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H). So that would suggest a branching point with a CH group connected to a CH2CH3 and a CH2 group.

Putting it all together, the substituent R would be a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let's see: if R is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, that would be a n-pentyl group, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe R is a propyl group where the middle CH has a methyl branch, making it a isobutyl group.

Wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group, but perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, another approach: the substituent R is attached to the benzene ring as a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Then, the substituent would be a isopropyl group, but then where is the 0.9 ppm triplet? Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, which is a 3-methylbutyl group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have the structure CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, the sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the attachment is on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: butyl groups have four carbons. For a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's only three carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the NMR again.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) indicates a CH2CH3 group. So that's an ethyl group attached to something else. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is probably two CH2 groups adjacent to each other. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH group connected to both the CH2 groups and the benzene.

So the substituent would be a propyl group with a branch. Let's try to draw it:

- The benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a substituent R at position 4.

- R is a chain that starts with a CH2 attached to the ring, then a CH connected to another CH2 and a CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ring-COOH at 1, and R at 4 is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that would make R an iso-pentyl group or something. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. No, that's a butyl group, but how does that fit into the NMR?

Wait, let's think about the NMR shifts.

The 0.9 ppm triplet is the end CH2CH3 group. Then, the adjacent group would be a CH2 connected to a CH that's split into a multiplet. So the substituent would be a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's getting too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Then, the NMR would have:

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): the CH2CH3 group attached to the CH(CH3).

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): the CH3 attached to the CH.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): the two CH2 groups between the benzene and the CH(CH3).

Wait, but the substituent would be a propyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a iso-propyl group.

Wait, the substituent would be a CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it a iso-propyl group. So the structure would be benzene with COOH at 1 and iso-propyl at 4.

But then, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) group would have its protons. Wait, but in this case, the CH(CH3) would be attached to a CH2 connected to the ring. So perhaps the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is the CH in the iso-propyl group.

Wait, but wait, in an iso-propyl group, the CH is attached to two CH3 groups. That would make the CH a singlet, but in the NMR it's a multiplet. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group.

The substituent would be attached as -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's a 3-methylbutyl group. Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So benzene with a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached at position 4. Then, the substituent would be a 3-methylpropyl group, which is
