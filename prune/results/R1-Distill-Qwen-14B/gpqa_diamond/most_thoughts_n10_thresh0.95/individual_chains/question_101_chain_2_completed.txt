Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take my time and think through it carefully.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A to produce 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to pick the right reagent (A) and catalyst (B) from the given options.

First, I should probably figure out what kind of reaction this is. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine. Hmm, cyclohexylidene means a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, I think. So the substituent is like a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group (CH₂).

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring. So the reaction adds a cyclohexylidene methyl group to position 1 of the pyrrolidine.

Looking at the product structure, it seems like a ring expansion or some kind of addition. Oh wait, maybe it's an alkylation or some kind of cycloaddition? But the catalyst is acid, so perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed reaction involving some kind of carbocation or electrophilic addition.

Wait, another thought: The product has a cyclohexene ring attached. The starting material is an amine, and the reagent is compound A. So perhaps this is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? No, wait, Friedel-Crafts typically uses aromatic rings and acyl chloride or alkyl halides. But pyrrolidine is an amine, maybe it's a different kind of alkylation.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or a ring-forming reaction. Let's think about the structure. 3-methylpyrrolidine has a methyl group on the third carbon. The product adds a substituent at position 1. So perhaps it's an alkylation at the nitrogen?

Wait, no, because the substituent is on the carbon chain attached to the nitrogen. The pyrrolidine ring is a five-membered ring with four CH₂ groups and one NH. So position 1 is the nitrogen, but the substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group on the first carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm a bit confused.

Wait, wait. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is on carbon 1, which is adjacent to the nitrogen. So the structure would have a CH₂ group attached to the nitrogen, and then that CH₂ is connected to a cyclohexene (cyclohexylidene) group.

So, the reaction adds a CH₂-cyclohexene substituent to the pyrrolidine's carbon 1.

Now, thinking about possible reactions. Adding a substituent via an electrophilic attack perhaps. Since the catalyst is acid, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed alkylation or some kind of addition.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's a Mannich reaction? But that's usually for forming amine derivatives with alpha-amines, ketones, and such. Not sure.

Alternatively, could this be an example of a Cope reaction or some cycloaddition? But I don't think so because the product isn't a ring expansion but a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reagent A is an aldehyde. For example, if A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then maybe the reaction is a condensation, like a Claisen or aldol addition. But I'm not sure how that would react with pyrrolidine.

Alternatively, if A is an alkene, maybe a ring-opening metathesis or some other reaction. Wait, but looking at the options, A can be either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane.

Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene with a cyclohexane ring attached. So if A is vinylcyclohexane, and the reaction is acid-catalyzed, what kind of reaction would that be?

Wait, in acid conditions, alkenes can undergo carbocation rearrangements, but I'm not sure how that would apply here. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening or some kind of addition.

Wait, another thought: The product has a cyclohexene ring attached. If the reagent is vinylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring attached to a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-). Maybe the vinyl group is involved in a ring-forming reaction.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclopropane or some other small ring formation. But the product is a larger ring. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed process where the amine reacts with some electrophilic species.

Wait, let's think about the possible reactions of 3-methylpyrrolidine. It's a secondary amine. With acid, maybe it gets protonated. Protonated amines are more electrophilic, but how would that help in adding a substituent?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is some kind of alkylation. If compound A is an alkylating agent, like an alkyl halide, but in the options, A isn't an alkyl halide. Instead, the options are either an aldehyde or vinylcyclohexane.

Wait, looking at the product again: 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is a methylene group attached to a cyclohexene.

That makes me think of a Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction typically forms alkenes by reacting an aldehyde or ketone with a Wittig reagent (like an ylide). But in this case, the product has a cyclohexene ring attached, so perhaps the reagent is a cyclohexylidene group.

Wait, the Wittig reagent is usually something like an alkyl or aryl group attached to a P=O group. But in our case, perhaps the reagent is an aldehyde that would form the ylide.

Wait, but if the reagent is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then under acid conditions, perhaps it's not a Wittig reaction because the Wittig is typically base-catalyzed. Alternatively, maybe it's a different type of reaction.

Alternatively, if the reagent is vinylcyclohexane, perhaps it's involved in a cyclopropanation or some other process.

Wait, another angle: the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the structure is pyrrolidine with a CH₂–cyclohexene group attached at position 1.

How can that happen? Maybe via a conjugate addition or some kind of ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed cyclization. But the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the product is a larger molecule, perhaps formed by adding a cyclohexene group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement? But that's for vicinal diols, and I don't think that's applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Beckmann rearrangement, but that involves oximes and converts them into amides or lactams, which doesn't fit here.

Hmm. Let me think about the possible structures and reagents again.

The product has a cyclohexene (cyclohexylidene) attached via a methyl group. So the substituent is -(CH₂)-cyclohexene.

If reagent A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then the aldehyde group is attached to the cyclohexane. So maybe the aldehyde is undergoing some kind of condensation with the amine.

But 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine. Aldehydes can react with amines in nucleophilic addition, like in the formation of imines. So maybe the amine is reacting with the aldehyde to form an imine, but I don't see how that would lead to the cyclohexene group.

Wait, but the product isn't an imine. It has a cyclohexene group attached. So perhaps the aldehyde is being converted into a ring structure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Stork enamine reaction. Enamines are typically formed by the reaction of a ketone or aldehyde with an amine, followed by elimination to form an enamine. Enamines are used in various additions.

Wait, Stork enamine synthesis involves adding a ketone or aldehyde to an enamine, which then undergoes a Michael addition or similar. But in this case, the starting material is an amine, so maybe the aldehyde is part of the enamine formation.

Wait, let me think. If the starting amine is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the reagent is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, perhaps the aldehyde reacts with the amine to form an imine, but then something else happens.

Wait, but the product seems to have a ring structure beyond the pyrrolidine. So, perhaps the aldehyde is used in a ring-forming reaction, like forming a cyclic product.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Claisen or Aldol condensation, but again, that involves carbonyl compounds and their condensation. But I'm not sure how that connects to the amine.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide, but I don't think the starting material is an epoxide.

Alternatively, could it be a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? But pyrrolidine isn't an aromatic ring, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't apply here.

Wait, perhaps it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that typically happens in carbocation chemistry, and I'm not sure it applies here.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reagents. The options are A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and catalysts are TsOH or acetic acid. Alternatively, A = vinylcyclohexane, with same catalysts.

If the catalyst is acidic, TsOH is a strong acid (tosylic acid), acetic acid is weaker but still an acid catalyst.

If A is an aldehyde (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde), perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed aldol addition. But I'm not sure how that would lead to the product.

Alternatively, if A is vinylcyclohexane, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of hydride shift or carbocation rearrangement.

Wait, if the reaction is acid-catalyzed and involves an alkene, maybe it's a carbocation formation. So, perhaps A is vinylcyclohexane, which upon protonation could form a carbocation adjacent to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, but how would that react with pyrrolidine?

Wait, if the vinylcyclohexane is protonated, it could form a carbocation. Then, perhaps the pyrrolidine could attack the carbocation, leading to an alkylation.

But wait, pyrrolidine is a secondary amine. If it gets protonated under acidic conditions, it may become more electrophilic, but I'm not sure if it would attack a carbocation.

Alternatively, the pyrrolidine could act as a nucleophile and attack the carbocation formed from vinylcyclohexane.

Wait, let's think: vinylcyclohexane is CH₂=CH-cyclohexane. Upon protonation, the double bond could become more electrophilic. Then, perhaps a [1,2]-shift happens, forming a carbocation adjacent to the ring.

The structure would be something like cyclohexylidene (a cyclohexane with a double bond) attached to the pyrrolidine.

Wait, maybe the vinylcyclohexane, under acidic conditions, forms a carbocation at the bridgehead, which then reacts with the pyrrolidine. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydride shift. Protonation of the double bond, then a carbocation forms, but the position might rearrange.

Wait, if the vinylcyclohexane is protonated, the most stable carbocation would be at the bridgehead if possible. But bridgehead carbocations are generally not favored due to Bredt's rule. So perhaps the carbocation forms elsewhere.

Wait, when vinylcyclohexane is protonated, the most likely site is the less substituted carbon, leading to a secondary carbocation. Alternatively, the proton adds to the double bond, making the more substituted carbocation more stable.

Wait, perhaps the proton adds to the less substituted end to form a more stable carbocation. For example, in vinylcyclohexane, the double bond is between C1 and C2 (assuming cyclohexane is C6H11). Protonation on the less substituted end (say, C1) would give a secondary carbocation on C2, which is adjacent to the cyclohexane ring. But secondary carbocations are less stable than tertiary.

Alternatively, maybe the proton adds to a more substituted position, leading to a more stable carbocation. Wait, no. The addition of H+ to a double bond follows the more substituted position, leading to the more stable carbocation. So for vinylcyclohexane, adding H+ to the more substituted carbon (the one attached to two cyclohexane carbons) would form a more substituted carbocation.

Wait, but vinylcyclohexane is a six-membered ring with a double bond extending from it, so the structure is CH₂=CH-C5H10 (where C5H10 is part of the cyclohexane ring). So when protonated, the more substituted position would be the CH₂. Wait, no, the cyclohexane is a ring, so each carbon is connected to two others. The double bond is between two CH₂ groups, perhaps? Or maybe it's a bridge structure. Hmm, perhaps I should draw it mentally.

Wait, vinylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with a vinyl group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So the structure would be CH₂=CH- attached to the cyclohexane.

When protonated, the H+ would add to the double bond. The most substituted position would be the end where the double bond is attached to the cyclohexane. So the H+ would add to the CH₂ group adjacent to the cyclohexane, forming a secondary carbocation on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but secondary carbocations aren't very stable. Maybe an alternative pathway occurs.

Alternatively, maybe the carbocation rearranges via a hydride shift or a methyl shift to a more stable position.

Wait, if the initial carbocation is at the 2-position (assuming cyclohexane is at the 1-position), could it shift to form a more stable carbocation elsewhere?

But without a good position to shift to, perhaps it doesn't rearrange.

If the carbocation is formed, then 3-methylpyrrolidine could act as a nucleophile, attacking the carbocation. But wait, pyrrolidine is a secondary amine. Under acidic conditions, it might get protonated, making it less nucleophilic. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the pyrrolidine's lone pair could attack the carbocation, leading to alkylation.

So in this scenario, the pyrrolidine would attack the carbocation, leading to a new carbon-nitrogen bond. The product would have a CH₂ group connected to the pyrrolidine's nitrogen, but wait, the product has the substituent on the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is on the carbon that's attached to the nitrogen (position 1). So the pyrrolidine's structure is:

N
|
CH₂–C–(cyclohexylidene)

So the substituent is on the first carbon (the one adjacent to the nitrogen). So perhaps the attack is on the carbocation, leading to the substituent being added to the carbon next to the nitrogen.

But I'm not entirely sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. If the reagent is an alkyllithium or Grignard reagent, but the options don't have those.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about other possibilities. Maybe the reaction is a C–H activation, but that's probably getting too advanced.

Wait, another approach: looking at the possible options.

Option A: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH.

Option B: same A, B = acetic acid.

Option C: A = vinylcyclohexane, B = acetic acid.

Option D: same A, B = TsOH.

If the reaction involves an aldehyde, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition. The amine could attack the aldehyde, forming a hemiaminal or imine.

But then, how does that form the cyclohexene group? Maybe the aldehyde would form an enamine after some steps.

Wait, another thought: Enamine formation typically involves a ketone or aldehyde and a secondary amine. The steps are: first, the amine reacts with the aldehyde to form a Schiff base (imine), then upon treatment with a strong acid, it undergoes dehydration to form an enamine.

Enamines are useful in the Stork enamine synthesis, where they react with carbonyl compounds to form β-amino carbonyl compounds, which can then be hydrolyzed.

But in this case, the product has a cyclohexene group attached. So perhaps the aldehyde (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) is reacting with the amine to form an enamine, which then undergoes some reaction.

Wait, but the product is a substituted pyrrolidine with a cyclohexene substituent. So maybe the enamine is formed, and then it undergoes a conjugate addition or some kind of ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is formed and then it reacts with another molecule to form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the enamine could react with an alkene via a conjugate addition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Baylis-Hillman reaction, but that's more about α,β-unsaturated carbonyls.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to look for another angle.

The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. So the substituent is a methylene group connected to a cyclohexene ring.

If the reagent is vinylcyclohexane, which is CH₂=CH-C6H11, then under acidic conditions, perhaps it's protonated and forms a carbocation. The carbocation would then be attacked by the pyrrolidine.

Wait, but in that case, the pyrrolidine would have a substituent attached to the nitrogen, but the product has the substituent on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the carbocation is formed at the position where the CH2 is attached to the cyclohexane. So, if the vinylcyclohexane is protonated, the carbocation is at the end of the CH2 adjacent to the cyclohexane. Then, the pyrrolidine's carbon (position 1) attacks the carbocation, leading to a substituent on that carbon.

But wait, pyrrolidine is a ring structure. If the attack happens on the carbon next to the nitrogen, maybe that's how the substituent is added.

So, if the carbocation is formed on the CH₂ group attached to the cyclohexane, then the pyrrolidine's carbon 1 (the one adjacent to N) attacks, adding a CH₂-cyclohexane group to that carbon.

Wait, but the product has a cyclohexene, not cyclohexane. So perhaps the cyclohexane is deprotonated or rearranges to form a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the addition of the CH₂-cyclohexane leads to a ring formation, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the initial attack forms a cyclohexylmethyl substituent, but then an elimination occurs to form the double bond.

So the steps would be:

1. Protonation of vinylcyclohexane to form a carbocation.

2. Attack by pyrrolidine's carbon 1 to form a new bond, adding CH₂-cyclohexane.

3. Deprotonation and elimination to form a double bond, resulting in a cyclohexene substituent.

That would give the cyclohexylidenemethyl group.

So, in that case, the reagent A would be vinylcyclohexane, and the catalyst would be an acid.

Looking at the options, options C and D have A as vinylcyclohexane. The catalysts are acetic acid or TsOH.

So, which catalyst is more suitable for this kind of reaction? TsOH is a strong acid, often used as a catalyst in reactions like SN1 or E1 mechanisms, where carbocations are formed. Acetic acid is a weaker acid but can also act as a catalyst.

In this scenario, since we're forming a carbocation, a strong acid might be more effective. So TsOH (option D) would be better than acetic acid (option C).

Wait, but sometimes in enamine or imine formation, weaker acids are sufficient, but in this case, since we're protonating an alkene to form a carbocation, a stronger acid like TsOH would be better.

So the catalyst B would be TsOH, and the reagent A is vinylcyclohexane. So the correct option is D.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Option D says A is vinylcyclohexane and B is TsOH.

Yes, that fits. So the answer should be option D.


The reaction involves the acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A to produce 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group (a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group) at position 1 of the pyrrolidine. This suggests that the reaction involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate and subsequent nucleophilic attack by the pyrrolidine.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagent Options**:
   - **Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**: This is an aldehyde. While aldehydes can react with amines to form imines or enamines, the product structure does not indicate an imine or enamine formation. This makes cyclohexanecarbaldehyde less likely to be the correct reagent.
   - **Vinylcyclohexane**: This is an alkene with a cyclohexane ring. Under acidic conditions, vinylcyclohexane can be protonated to form a carbocation. The carbocation can then be attacked by the pyrrolidine, leading to the formation of the cyclohexylidenemethyl group.

2. **Catalyst Options**:
   - **TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid)**: A strong acid catalyst, commonly used in reactions involving carbocation formation (e.g., SN1 or E1 mechanisms). This is suitable for the reaction as it facilitates protonation of the alkene and carbocation formation.
   - **Acetic acid**: A weaker acid catalyst. While it can act as a catalyst, it is less effective than TsOH for carbocation-mediated reactions.

3. **Reaction Mechanism**:
   - Vinylcyclohexane is protonated under acidic conditions, forming a carbocation.
   - The pyrrolidine attacks the carbocation, leading to the formation of a bond between the pyrrolidine and the CH₂ group of vinylcyclohexane.
   - A subsequent elimination step forms the double bond in the cyclohexene ring, resulting in the cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine.

4. **Correct Option**:
   - The reagent **vinylcyclohexane** is suitable because it can form the necessary carbocation intermediate.
   - The catalyst **TsOH** is the most appropriate choice as it is a strong acid, facilitating the reaction.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagent and catalyst combination is **A = vinylcyclohexane** and **B = TsOH**, corresponding to **Option D**.

Answer: D
