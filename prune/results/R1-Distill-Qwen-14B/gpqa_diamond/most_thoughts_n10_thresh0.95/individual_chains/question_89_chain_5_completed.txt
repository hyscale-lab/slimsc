--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think through each part carefully.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when dibromides react with a strong base like KOH, elimination reactions can happen, typically leading to alkenes via an E2 mechanism. Since there are two bromine atoms on the adamantane, heating with KOH should lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene.

So product 1 is probably an adamantane diene or something similar. Wait, no, more accurately, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules when treated with a strong base like KOH. But wait, how does that elimination proceed? Hmm. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, known for its high stability. When you have two bromines on adjacent carbons (like 1,3 positions), elimination would form a double bond between those carbons, right?

Wait, wait. Wait, the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, so elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe the base abstracts a proton anti to the leaving group, leading to the formation of a double bond. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene.

Now, looking at the NMR data for product 1: the 1H NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), probably the olefinic protons since that's around where vinyl protons show up. The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) probably corresponds to the adamantane's bridgehead protons, which are typically in that region. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be some other protons, maybe from a different group, but in this case, after elimination, the structure is an alkene.

Wait, but according to the IR data, there's a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but product 1 comes from dehydrohalogenation, which should form an alkene, not a carbonyl. So maybe I messed up. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, wait. Wait, KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Could it be a substitution reaction? But 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two leaving groups on adjacent carbons. If both are leaving, that's more likely to form an alkene via elimination.

But the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is high for a carbonyl. Maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Wait, but how would that form from elimination? Oh, wait, maybe the base isn't just causing elimination but perhaps some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH in such a way that it forms an epoxide first? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but that doesn't directly explain the carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But two substitutions would require a very strong base and perhaps a very good leaving group. But I'm more inclined towards elimination because KOH is a strong base, and two adjacent leaving groups would make elimination favorable, leading to a double bond. So why the IR carbonyl?

Hmm, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a ketone? That doesn't seem to fit. Wait, could it be that the compound undergoes an elimination to form a carbonyl? Wait, wait, no. Elimination usually forms double bonds, not carbonyls. Unless there's some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the initial product is a diol, but that would require substitution, which would require two substitution steps. KOH in ethanol or another solvent might lead to substitution. But then a diol would have OH groups, which would show broad peaks in the NMR, but the product is a light yellow solid. The NMR data given doesn't show broad peaks except maybe the 4.79 ppm triplet, which could be vinyl protons, not OH.

Wait, maybe the IR is from an ether, but that's usually around 1100-1250 cm-1. No, 1720 is more like a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Epoxides have a peak around 1230-1250 cm-1, which doesn't match 1720. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is an elimination forming a carbonyl. But how? Oh, wait, in some cases, dehydrohalogenation can form carbonyl groups if the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl. For example, if the elimination leads to a conjugated diene but in a strained ring system, maybe a rearrangement occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a simple elimination but something else.

Wait, another possibility: the base could cause the elimination of HBr from each Br, but perhaps the structure is such that each elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require each Br to be attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl, which I don't think is the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. But how? Another thought: perhaps the initial compound is a di-substituted bromide that, upon treatment with KOH, undergoes a double elimination to form a ketone. Wait, maybe the reaction is the formation of an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone, but that seems unlikely under such conditions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider that the NMR has a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's indicative of a CH2 group adjacent to a CH2 that's split into a triplet. Oh wait, no, the triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons. So perhaps it's a -CH2-CH2- group, with each CH2 next to the other, leading to a triplet for each.

Wait, but in the case of an alkene, the vinyl protons are typically split into a doublet if they're each adjacent to one proton. But a triplet suggests they're next to two equivalent protons. So maybe the structure is such that each vinyl proton is adjacent to two others. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal coupling, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps the structure after KOH treatment isn't an alkene. Maybe it's a diol. So 1,3-diol? But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Oh, but maybe the diol is oxidized further. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention any oxidizing agent after KOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the product after KOH is an epoxide. So 1,3-epoxyadamantane. The IR for epoxide is around 1250 cm-1, not 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Let me think about the IR peak again. 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl, maybe an ester or ketone. So maybe the first step produces a ketone. How?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the KOH is causing a nucleophilic attack, but with two equivalents, leading to a substitution that forms a carbonyl. Wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a double substitution. But for that, the leaving groups would need to be on adjacent carbons, which they are.

Wait, substitution of two bromides by hydroxide would give a diol. So 1,3-diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the diol is then oxidized. But the question doesn't mention an oxidizing agent. So that's unlikely.

Another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but I'm not sure how that would form a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the structure after elimination is a conjugated diene, which could lead to some ring opening or a different product.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic structure with a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is not a substitution or elimination but something else. Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing a rearrangement. Wait, another possibility: the compound might undergo a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that involves carbocation shifts, which I don't think happens here because KOH is a strong base, not an acid.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fries rearrangement, but that's for aryl esters, which doesn't fit here.

Hmm. Maybe I should look at the next steps to see if that can help.

The product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 doesn't have any aromatic rings, as far as I know. So perhaps this step is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that would require an aromatic ring.

Wait, so product 1 is something else. Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acylium ion or something else. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkyl bromide, and aluminum isopropoxide is used for some kind of alkylation.

Wait, let me think again. The first reaction forms product 1, which is a light yellow solid. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe product 1 is a diene, and the aluminum isopropoxide is causing some kind of polymerization or addition. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether or something else that can react under Lewis acid catalysis.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the next step is some kind of dehydration using the Lewis acid as a catalyst, forming an alkene. But wait, then product 2 would be an alkene, and the ozonolysis would come next.

Wait, but the initial step's IR has a carbonyl, so maybe product 1 is a ketone. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH could lead to a ketone via elimination of two HBr molecules and forming a carbonyl group. How?

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a CH2 group, and eliminating HBr from each would form a carbonyl. For example, if each Br is on a carbon next to a CH2, eliminating two HBr would form a ketone. Let me imagine the structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: each Br is on a carbon adjacent to each other. If each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps elimination would form a bridgehead carbonyl. But bridgehead carbonyls are generally not very stable, but adamantane is a very rigid structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a bicyclic structure with a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, where each Br is removed, and the two adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group. So, each Br is on a CH2, and elimination would form a C=O.

Wait, if the structure is Br-C-C-Br, and upon elimination, it becomes C=O, but that would require each carbon to have two H's. Wait, but in reality, the structure of adamantane is such that each carbon is bonded to three other carbons and perhaps a Br in this case.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated dienone? Or maybe the two Br's are on adjacent carbons, and their elimination forms a carbonyl between them. For example, if you have Br-CR2-C-Br, eliminating both HBr's would form R-C(=O)-R. So in this case, the two Br's are on adjacent carbons, each attached to two other R groups. So eliminating HBr from each would form a ketone. That makes sense.

So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanedione, or something similar with a ketone group.

So, the IR at 1720 cm-1 would correspond to the carbonyl stretch of a ketone. That fits.

Now, the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H, triplet). Wait, but a ketone doesn't have protons on the carbonyl. So maybe this triplet is from another group. The 10H between 2.41-2.23 ppm likely belong to the bridgehead protons in adamantane, which are typically around 2 ppm.

The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be from another group. Wait, if product 1 is a diketone, perhaps it's a structure where there's a CH2 group next to the carbonyl. Wait, but in that case, the CH2 would be deshielded and might appear around 2.5 ppm, but perhaps in this case, it's lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the triplet at 4.79 ppm is from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. Wait, but the product 1 is formed via elimination, leading to a ketone. So maybe those 2H are from a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about the structure. If the initial structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon elimination of two HBr, the product would be 1,3-adamantanedione (with two ketone groups?), but that might not fit the NMR. Or perhaps a single ketone group formed between the two carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure becomes a cyclopropane with a ketone. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial elimination forms a single carbonyl group, not two, but that would require only one Br to be eliminated. Hmm, but the IR shows a single carbonyl peak, so maybe there's one ketone group.

Wait, perhaps the product is cyclohexanone or something similar, but that doesn't fit the adamantane structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial elimination forms a bridgehead ketone. So the NMR would show the bridgehead protons, and perhaps some other protons near the carbonyl.

Wait, but the 4.79 triplet (2H) is a bit confusing. Maybe it's from a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. If the structure has a CH2-CO group, then the CH2 protons would be split by neighboring protons. Wait, but if it's CH2 next to a carbonyl, the protons would be deshielded and show up downfield, perhaps around 2.5 ppm. But 4.79 is more upfield for a CH2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the 4.79 ppm triplet is from an ether group. Wait, but product 1 is from KOH treatment, which is a strong base, so perhaps it's a diol. But earlier we thought the IR didn't fit a diol. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether, like an epoxide. But the IR doesn't fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the triplet is from a vinyl group, but earlier I thought that wouldn't fit with the IR.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think about the next step.

Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Since aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, perhaps it's involved in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's not aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a Grignard-like compound, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an ether, formed by elimination with the Lewis acid as a catalyst. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol under the influence of the Lewis acid. But I'm not certain.

The next step is ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups, leading to product 3.

Wait, so product 2 must be an alkene. Ozonolysis would break it into fragments with carbonyl groups.

So if product 2 is an alkene, then product 3 would be a di-carbonyl compound, perhaps.

Wait, putting it all together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (maybe a diol? Or a ketone? Or an alkene?)

But according to the IR, product 1 has a carbonyl, so ketone.

Then, product 1 (a ketone) is heated with Al(i-Pr)3, a Lewis acid. Maybe this leads to some kind of enol formation or a conjugate addition.

Wait, another possibility: the ketone could undergo a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires an aromatic ring, which I don't think product 1 has.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone isn't the product. Maybe I was wrong about the initial step.

Let me revisit the initial step.

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is likely an elimination, forming an alkene. So product 1 is an alkene.

Then, the NMR of product 1 shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H). That would likely be the vinyl protons. If the alkene is between two bridgehead carbons, perhaps each vinyl proton is next to two equivalent protons, leading to a triplet. So each vinyl proton is coupling with two others, giving a triplet.

The IR at 1720 cm-1 doesn't fit with an alkene. Wait, but wait, maybe the IR isn't for product 1. Oh, wait, the question says that product 1 has that IR. So maybe I'm wrong about product 1 being an alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. So let's try that again.

If product 1 is a ketone, then the IR would make sense. The NMR would have the triplet at 4.79 ppm. Wait, but ketones don't have protons on the carbonyl. So the triplet must be from another group.

Wait, maybe the product is an enol ether. Enol ethers have protons on the double bond, which would show a triplet if coupled with two equivalent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a di-substituted alkene that's part of a cyclic structure, leading to a triplet for each vinyl proton.

Wait, but I'm stuck on the IR. Let's think differently.

Suppose that upon heating with KOH, the two Br atoms undergo elimination, forming a double bond. So product 1 is an alkene. The IR at 1720 cm-1 doesn't fit, so perhaps I'm mistaken.

Wait, another thought: Could the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 be from an ester group? But where would the ester come from? The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. No ester is present, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an enone, which could have a slightly higher wavenumber. Enones have conjugated double bonds which can lower the carbonyl frequency. So if product 1 is a conjugated enone, the IR at 1720 could fit.

But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Let me imagine the structure. If the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, eliminating HBr from each would remove two HBr and form a double bond, but also perhaps create a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure after elimination is an enone. For example, if the two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and a H, forming a double bond and a carbonyl group. So the structure would have a C=C adjacent to a C=O. That would be an enone, which has a conjugated system.

In that case, the IR would show the carbonyl around 1720 cm-1. The NMR would show the vinyl protons as a triplet if they are each coupled with two equivalent protons.

But wait, in an enone, the alpha protons (next to the carbonyl) are typically deshielded and can be split by the double bond protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the enone's double bond has protons that are each adjacent to two equivalent protons, leading to a triplet.

So, product 1 is an enone, which explains the IR and the NMR.

Then, product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. Perhaps this leads to some kind of cyclopropanation or another reaction, but more likely, it's a catalyst for a reaction involving the enone.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enone undergoes a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but again, that requires an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, the enone could undergo a conjugate addition, such as a Michael addition, but I'm not sure under what conditions.

Wait, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is acting as a Lewis acid to facilitate the formation of an acylium ion, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an enol ether, which reacts under Lewis acid conditions to form something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and the Lewis acid catalyzes a ring-opening or some addition.

Wait, another approach: the next step is ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 2 is an alkene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Product 3, after ozonolysis, would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

So, let's see the steps again:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with IR 1720 cm-1) via KOH.

2. product 1 → product 2 (an alkene) via Al(i-Pr)3.

3. product 2 → product 3 (after ozonolysis and dimethyl sulfide workup).

Then, the 1H NMR of product 3 is to be analyzed, focusing on the most deshielded proton.

So, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3 undergoes dehydration to form an alkene (product 2).

So, let's re-examine product 1.

If product 1 is a diol (1,3-diol), then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. The IR for epoxide is around 1250 cm-1, but the given IR is 1720. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed by some elimination.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes a dehydration to form an alkene. That would require the ketone to have adjacent hydroxyl groups or something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol, but then the IR would show an OH stretch, which is usually broad and around 3300 cm-1. The given IR doesn't mention that, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a geminal diol, which upon treatment with a Lewis acid would eliminate to form a carbonyl group. But that doesn't lead to an alkene.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that product 1 is an alkene, and the IR is a mistake? No, the question states the IR is at 1720 cm-1, so it must be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR is from another functional group, not directly from product 1. No, the question says product 1 has that IR.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is not elimination. Maybe it's a substitution. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH forms a diol. Then, the IR doesn't fit, but the NMR would have OH peaks, which aren't mentioned. So that's unlikely.

Another thought: Maybe product 1 is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide. But the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the ozonolysis step.

Ozonolysis of product 2 (an alkene) would break it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups adjacent to each other or in some arrangement.

The 1H NMR of product 3 would show protons adjacent to carbonyl groups. The most deshielded proton would be the one closest to the electronegative group, like the carbonyl.

In the case of ozonolysis, if the starting alkene is symmetric, the product would have two identical carbonyl groups, and the protons adjacent to them would be equivalent.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3.

Wait, perhaps the alkene in product 2 is such that when ozonolysis occurs, the resulting product 3 has two separate carbonyl groups with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The coupling would depend on neighboring protons.

Wait, if the structure after ozonolysis is something like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would have protons that couple with each other.

Alternatively, the structure could be a diketone with geminal protons, but that's less likely.

Wait, let me think about the initial structure.

1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. Let's imagine it's an adamantane ring with Br on carbons 1 and 3.

Elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3, making 1,3-adamantadiene. But product 1 has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial elimination forms a carbonyl group by a different mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, each Br is on a CH2 group. Eliminating HBr from each CH2Br would form a C=O.

So, the product would be 1,3-diketone.

Wait, but then the IR would show two carbonyl peaks or a strong peak around 1720 cm-1. That fits.

Then, product 1 is a diketone. The NMR would show the bridgehead protons (around 2.2-2.4 ppm, 10H) and perhaps some other groups.

The triplet at 4.79 (2H) is confusing. Maybe it's from a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but in a diketone, the carbonyls would be at positions 1 and 3. The bridgehead protons are typically around 2 ppm. The 4.79 triplet might be from a different group, perhaps a CH2 next to an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Then, product 1 (the diketone) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe this leads to some kind of rearrangement or the formation of an enol.

Wait, with a diketone, perhaps the Lewis acid catalyzes a ring-opening or a condensation reaction. But I'm not certain.

Another possibility: the diketone could undergo a nucleophilic attack, but I'm not sure what would attack it.

Alternatively, perhaps the diketone isn't the product. Maybe I'm way off.

Let me consider that product 1 is an epoxide. The IR would be around 1250 cm-1, which doesn't fit. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a conjugated diene with a carbonyl group, making it an enone. The IR would show the carbonyl, and the NMR would have a triplet for the enone's alpha protons.

Wait, more specifically, the enone structure would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. The protons on the double bond would be in a conjugated system. The coupling between these protons could lead to a triplet if each is coupled with two equivalent protons.

Wait, but in an enone, the protons on the double bond are usually trans and might be split by each other, leading to a doublet.

Hmm.

This is getting too confusing. Let me try to approach it differently.

The initial product (product 1) has a carbonyl (IR 1720), which suggests a ketone or ester. Since the starting material is a dibromide and KOH is used, it's more likely a ketone formed via elimination.

Product 1 is a ketone. Then, when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it undergoes a Claisen or aldol condensation, forming an alkene (product 2).

Wait, but Claisen and aldol typically require carbonyl groups and form alkenes. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 (the alkene) would break it into two carbonyl groups in product 3.

The NMR of product 3 would then show protons adjacent to carbonyls. The most deshielded would be those attached directly to the carbonyl.

In the case of ozonolysis, if the starting alkene is between two CH2 groups, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups with adjacent CH2 groups.

For example, if the alkene in product 2 is CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would break it into two formyl groups (O=CH2).

Wait, no. Ozonolysis of a simple alkene like CH2=CH2 would give two formaldehyde molecules. But in a more complex structure, it would give carbonyl compounds.

Wait, perhaps the alkene in product 2 is part of a cyclic structure, so ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls within a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkene is between two CH2 groups, making product 3 have two CH2-C=O groups.

So, in the NMR, the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would each be split by neighboring protons.

If the structure is something like CH2-C=O, the CH2 protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl and possibly coupled with each other, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each CH2 proton would be next to two others (from the adjacent CH2 group), leading to a triplet of triplets or another splitting pattern.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups. Each CH2 group's protons would be split by the neighboring CH2's protons.

If each CH2 has two protons, and they're next to another CH2 group with two protons, each proton would couple with two on the same CH2 (geminal coupling, but usually not observed) and with two on the adjacent CH2 (vicinal coupling).

Wait, geminal coupling is usually not observed because the protons are on the same carbon and rapidly exchange. So, only vicinal coupling would be seen.

So, each CH2 group's protons would be adjacent to two others on the next CH2. So each proton would be split into a triplet (coupled with two neighboring protons).

Wait, but if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 with two protons, each proton would have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

So, in the NMR, the most deshielded protons (on the CH2 next to carbonyl) would be a triplet.

Wait, but the options include triplet, triplet of triplets, etc.

Wait, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group's protons would be next to the other CH2 group. Each CH2 has two protons, so each proton on a CH2 would be split by two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, the most deshielded protons (those next to the carbonyl) would be a triplet.

So, the answer would be option A) triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if each CH2 is adjacent to two different sets of protons, maybe leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, each CH2 is between two carbonyls. Each CH2's protons would be adjacent to the other CH2's two protons. So each proton in a CH2 would be coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So each would be a triplet.

Thus, the most deshielded proton (on the CH2 next to the carbonyl) would be a triplet.

So the answer should be A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH leads to elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a product with a carbonyl group (IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹). This suggests the formation of a ketone, likely 1,3-adamantanedione. The NMR data supports this: the triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) corresponds to a CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl, while the protons in the adamantane framework (10H) appear between 2.41-2.23 ppm, and the 1.94 ppm (2H) likely corresponds to another group in the structure.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**: The ketone (product 1) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates a rearrangement or dehydration, forming an alkene (product 2). The alkene structure is consistent with the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Ozonolysis**: Ozonolysis of the alkene (product 2) cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. The resulting structure likely contains two carbonyl groups, such as a diketone. For example, if the alkene in product 2 is CH₂=CH, ozonolysis would yield two formyl groups (O=CH₂). In a more complex structure, the protons on the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls would couple with neighboring protons.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**: The most deshielded protons in product 3 are on the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls. These protons are coupled with two equivalent protons on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern. This matches the description of the coupling pattern for the most deshielded protons in the NMR spectrum of product 3.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a **triplet**.
