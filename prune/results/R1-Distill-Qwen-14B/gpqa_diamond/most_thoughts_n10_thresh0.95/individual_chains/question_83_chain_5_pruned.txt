Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations yet. But let's try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. Also, since acetic acid is a weak acid, its dissociation will affect the pH. Then, when titrated with NaOH, a strong base, it will form its conjugate base, acetate. 

First, let's figure out the concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and after adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration should be half, right? Because concentration is moles divided by volume. Oh yeah, because when you dilute, M1V1 = M2V2. So 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = M2 * 40 cm³. So M2 is (0.05 * 20)/40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we dilute it, it dissociates more. But for the initial step, maybe we just need the concentration before any reaction with NaOH. So the initial solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, the titration with NaOH. The question asks about 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Let's first find the equivalence point. To do that, we'll calculate the moles of acetic acid and moles of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid: volume (L) * concentration. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L (40 cm³ is 0.04 L) equals 0.001 moles. Because 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH should equal the moles of acetic acid. So moles NaOH = 0.001. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V is moles / concentration. So V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So, for the equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is needed. Now, the pH at the equivalence point. Since it's a weak acid and strong base, the salt formed will be sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So the solution will be basic.

Wait, but wait. The sodium acetate will dissociate completely, and the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions. So the pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of acetate.

So, first, let's find the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence. The total volume of solution at equivalence is the initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³ (0.05 L). The moles of acetate are 0.001 (same as acetic acid, since each mole of acid reacts with NaOH to form one mole of acetate).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. 

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that accurately. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is (1 /1.85) * 1e-9. Because 1e-14 /1e-5 is 1e-9. So 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so Kb ≈ 5.405e-10.

Then, the hydrolysis equation: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, we can set up the equation:

5.405e-10 = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So:

5.405e-10 ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then, pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but the options don't have a pH around 9. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me go through it again.

Wait, wait, another approach: The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

The Kb is (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Let me write it as:

(5.405e-10) = (x^2) / (0.02)

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approximately 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02. But in the options, none have a pH near 9. So perhaps I did something wrong. Or maybe I should consider activity coefficients, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the equivalence point. Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid + 20 mL water, so total 40 mL (0.04 L). Moles of acetic acid = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. So when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, moles needed is 0.001, so volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So yes, that's correct. So at equivalence, the volume is 40 +10=50 mL, 0.05 L.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the acetate concentration. Wait, 0.001 moles in 0.05 L is 0.02 M. So that's correct.

Hmm. Let me check if I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me compute 1e-14 /1.85e-5.

1e-14 is 1 x 10^-14, 1.85e-5 is 1.85e-5. So 1e-14 /1.85e-5 is (1 /1.85) * 1e-9. 1/1.85 ≈ 0.5405, so 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So, wait, the hydrolysis leads to OH^- conc of about 1.04e-5 M, which gives pOH ~4.98, pH ~9.02. But none of the options have pH 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the solution is 50 mL. Wait, no, because 40 mL +10 mL NaOH is 50 mL.

Wait, but the options don't have anything near 9. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73  

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Wait, none of the equivalence points are close to 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Wait, but at equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is of sodium acetate. The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

But at equivalence, [A^-] is 0.02 M, and [HA] is negligible. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, no, in the solution, the acetate is the only species. So in that case, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH using the Kb expression.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of [OH^-]. Let me recalculate:

Kb = 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming that [OH^-] is x, and [CH3COOH] is x, and [CH3COO^-] is 0.02.

So,

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / 0.02 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH ≈ 9.02.

But wait, the options don't have pH near 9. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I should try another approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is not at equivalence, but perhaps the equivalence point is correct, and I've made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. The formula is pH = ½ (pKa + pKw), because the solution of the conjugate base of a weak acid (like acetate) in water will have a pH determined by the hydrolysis of the anion.

Wait, pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = about 4.74 (since 1.8e-5 is 1e-4.74). So pKa is about 4.74. pKw is 14. So ½ (4.74 +14) is (18.74)/2=9.37. So pH should be around 9.37, which supports the earlier calculation of ~9.02, but why is that not matching any options.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the concentration of acetate. Wait, let's double-check.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH added: 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH is 0.001 /0.1 = 0.01 L =10 mL. So total volume is 40 +10=50 mL=0.05 L. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05= 0.02 M.

No, that's correct. So maybe the problem is elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact quadratic equation instead of approximating.

So, let's not approximate x as negligible. So:

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x)

Which is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

This is a quadratic equation, but since Kb is very small, x should be small compared to 0.02, so the approximation holds. So the initial calculation was correct.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's setup. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, another possibility: perhaps during the titration, the solution isn't at 25% of the equivalence volume, but 25% of the initial solution's volume. No, the question says 25% titration, which usually refers to the volume of titrant added relative to the equivalence point volume.

Wait, the equivalence point volume is 10 mL as we calculated. So 25% of that is 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

So the pH at 25% titration is when 2.5 mL of NaOH has been added.

Now, let's compute the pH at that point.

At 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

The initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, it will react with acetic acid:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So the moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is 40 mL (diluted solution) + 2.5 mL NaOH =42.5 mL=0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] =0.00025 /0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is around 4.74 (since Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa= -log(1.85e-5)=4.7355 ≈4.74.)

So pH=4.74 + log(0.005882 /0.017647).

Compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈0.3333.

Log(0.3333)= log(1/3) ≈-0.4771.

So pH=4.74 -0.4771≈4.263.

So pH at 25% titration is approximately
