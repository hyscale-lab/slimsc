Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think through it step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's in 2D, right? So it's probably a 2-dimensional metric embedded somehow. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, pseudosphere—maybe it's a hyperbolic surface or something.

Wait, what's a pseudosphere? From what I remember, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its area is finite but has infinite extent, or something like that. But I'm not exactly sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric describes a pseudosphere. Let me parse the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So the denominator must be positive, so 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the domain is within a circle of radius 2. So the metric is defined on a disk of radius 2.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Oh, maybe this metric is for a pseudosphere with r=2. Let me think about the form of metrics on pseudospheres. The standard metric for a pseudosphere (which is a hyperbolic plane) in polar coordinates is ds² = dr² + (a² sinh²(r/a)) dθ², where a is the radius of curvature. But that's in a different coordinate system.

Alternatively, for a metric given in terms of x and y, perhaps it's a conformally flat metric. Let's see: ds² = E (dx² + dy²), where E is some function. In our case, E = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the line element is conformally flat, meaning it's a scaling of the Euclidean metric.

So to find the area, I probably need to compute the area integral over the surface. But wait, the metric is defined for x² + y² < 4. So the "spatial" part is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But the area in this metric would be different from the Euclidean area because of the scaling factor.

The area A can be computed as the integral over the surface of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. But in 2D, for a metric ds² = E(dx² + dy²), the area element is sqrt(E) dx dy. Wait no, the determinant of the metric tensor in 2D is E * δ_ij, but I think the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Since g is diagonal, det g = E * E. Wait, no, in 2D, when the metric is diagonal, the determinant is (E)(E) - 0 = E². So the square root is E. So the area element is E dx dy.

So the area would be the integral over x² + y² <4 of E dx dy, where E=32/(4 -x² - y²).

So the area A is ∫∫ [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy, integrated over x² + y² <4.

To compute this integral, it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first (the r integral), then multiply by the θ integral.

Take the inner integral:

I = ∫ r=0 to 2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

I = ∫ u=4 to 0 [32 * (-du/2) / u ].

Wait, let's write it out:

I = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r dr] / (4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)].

Using substitution u=4 - r², du= -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So when r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So I = 32 ∫ (from u=4 to 0) (-du/2) / u.

The negative sign flips the limits:

I = 32 * (1/2) ∫ (from 0 to4) (du/u) = 16 ∫ (0 to4) (du/u).

Integrating 1/u gives ln |u|.

So I = 16 [ln u ] from 0 to4.

Wait, but wait a second. When u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln u approaches negative infinity. So this integral is divergent. Oh no, that would mean the area is infinite.

So the area A is ∫ (0 to2π) dθ * I.

But wait, if I is divergent, then the whole integral would be infinite.

But that's strange. Wait, let me think again. The substitution:

Wait, the expression was 32 r dr/(4 - r²) → when r approaches 2, 4-r² approaches 0, so the integrand goes to infinity. So the integral from 0 to 2 of (32 r)/(4 -r²) dr is ∫ (from 0 to2) (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Wait, let me compute that integral again.

Hmm.

Let me do it again without substitution.

Let me write the integral as ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me think about integrating 32 r / (4 - r²) dr.

Let me let u = 4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ 32 * [ (r dr )/(u) ] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ].

So that's -16 ∫ (du/u) = -16 ln |u| + C.

So the integral from r=0 to 2 is [ -16 ln |4 - r²| ] from 0 to 2.

At r=2: -16 ln (4 -4) = -16 ln(0) → which is positive infinity.

At r=0: -16 ln(4) → finite.

So the integral becomes [inf - (-16 ln4)] which is infinity.

Wait, so the inner integral I is divergent, which would imply that the area is infinite. So the area is +infinite.

Looking at the options, D is +infty.

So the correct answer would be D.


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we compute the area integral over the surface. The metric is conformally flat, meaning the area element is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( \det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2 \). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of integration is \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, compute the radial integral:

\[
I = \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
I = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

Reversing the limits:

\[
I = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{du}{u} = \ln|u| \), so:

\[
I = 16 \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 16 \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

As \( \ln 0 \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Since the radial integral diverges, the total area is also infinite.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite, corresponding to option D.
