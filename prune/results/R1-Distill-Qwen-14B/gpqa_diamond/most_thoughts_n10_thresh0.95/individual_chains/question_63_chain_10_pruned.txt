--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. They want to know the momentum of a photon that would cause the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. Oh wait, right, in spectroscopy, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions to a higher energy state.

The molecule is diatomic, made of elements X and Y. The masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

I remember that for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the total energy is a combination of these. The fundamental state is the lowest rotational and vibrational state.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, I think that refers to the next vibrational state, but wait, no, because the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Since they're asking for the lowest possible energy increase, it must be the smallest possible photon energy required. Which one would that be? 

Hmm, the energy levels for rotation are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. For vibration, E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The fundamental state is n=0, J=0. The next state would be either n=1 (vibrational first excited state) or J=1 (rotational first excited state). We need to see which of these transitions requires less energy because the photon's momentum is related to energy.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the one with the smallest energy increase. So which transition is smaller: the first vibrational or the first rotational?

Let me calculate both and compare.

First, let's find the vibrational energy difference. The fundamental state is n=0, so E0 = (0 + 1/2) h w. The next vibrational state is n=1, so E1 = (1 + 1/2) h w. The energy difference ΔE_vib = E1 - E0 = h w (1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2) = wait, no. E1 = (3/2) h w; E0 is (1/2) h w. So ΔE_vib = (3/2 - 1/2) h w = h w.

Wait, but wait, that's the energy difference for a vibrational transition. So ΔE_vib = h w.

For rotational transition, from J=0 to J=1. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1). B is given by (h^2)/(8 π² I c²), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by ħ²/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, B = (h²)/(8 π² I c²) ? Wait, maybe I should just compute it.

Hmm, moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. So I need to compute μ first.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Given Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu, so μ = (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but I have to convert that into kg. 1 amu is roughly 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.818 * 1.6605) e-27. Let me compute that: 1.8 *1.66 is around 2.988, so 1.818 *1.6605 ≈ 3.016, so μ ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = (3.016e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Wait, no, wait. Because I = μ R². So μ is 3.016e-27 kg, R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m². So I = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2 I). ħ is h/(2π), so ħ² = h²/(4 π²). So B = (h²)/(4 π² * 2 I) ) = h²/(8 π² I).

Wait, wait, no, B is defined as h/(8 π² c I) * c? I think I'm getting confused. Alternatively, B is the rotational constant in terms of energy. Because E_rot = B J (J+1), with B in energy units.

Wait, I think I should compute B in terms of h and I. Because E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I). So since ħ = h/(2π), E_rot = (h² J (J+1))/(8 π² I).

Wait, so B is (h²)/(8 π² I). So B = (h²)/(8 π² I).

So substitute I=1.2064e-46 kg m².

Compute B: h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J s)^2.

Then denominator is 8 π² * I. So 8 * (pi^2) ≈ 8*(9.8696) ≈ 78.957.

Multiply by I: 78.957 *1.2064e-46 ≈ 78.957 *1.2e-46 ≈ 94.75e-46 ≈ 9.475e-45.

So denominator is 9.475e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.475e-45 ≈ 4.39e-67 / 9.475e-45 ≈ 4.63e-23 J.

Wait, that seems too small. Let me check the calculation.

Wait, wait: h is 6.626e-34 J s. So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx (6.626)^2 = 43.9, so 43.9e-68 = 4.39e-67 (J² s²).

Denominator: 8 pi^2 I. 8 pi^2 is about 78.96. I is 1.2064e-46 kg m². So 78.96 * 1.2064e-46 = let me calculate that: 78.96 * 1.2064 ≈ 95.15. So 95.15e-46 = 9.515e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.515e-45 = about 4.39e-67 / 9.5e-45 = (4.39 /9.5) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.462 * 1e-22 = 4.62e-23 J.

Wait, no, 4.39e-67 divided by 9.5e-45 is 4.39e-67 /9.5e-45 = (4.39 /9.5) *1e-22. Let me compute 4.39/9.5: 4.39 /9.5 ≈ 0.462. So 0.462e-22 J, which is 4.62e-23 J.

So B is about 4.62e-23 J.

Now, the energy for rotational transition from J=0 to J=1.

E_rot(J=1) = B * 1*(1+1) = 2 B.

E_rot(J=0) = 0.

So ΔE_rot = 2 B = 2 *4.62e-23 J = 9.24e-23 J.

Alternatively, I can compute the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w.

So when n=0, E0 = (0 + 1/2) h w. When n=1, E1 = (1 + 1/2) h w.

ΔE_vib = E1 - E0 = h w ( (3/2) - (1/2) ) ) = h w (1) = h w.

Given w =4e14 rad/s, h=6.626e-34 J s. So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, that's 2.65e-19 J, which is way larger than the rotational transition's 9.24e-23 J.

So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon should cause a transition from the ground state (J=0, n=0) to the next lowest state, which would be J=1, n=0? Or wait, is that allowed?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about selection rules. In rotation-vibration transitions, the selection rules are ΔJ=±1 and Δn=±1. But for the fundamental state, which is J=0, n=0. The next possible state with the lowest energy would be either J=1, n=0 (rotational excitation), or n=1, J=0 (vibrational excitation).

Since the vibrational transition requires a higher energy, the photon would need to have enough energy to cause either. But the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lower energy transition would be the rotational one.

So the energy of the photon should match the rotational energy difference, ΔE_rot = 9.24e-23 J.

But wait, I thought that in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve changes in both J and n. But for the fundamental state, which is J=0 and n=0, the next states would be J=1, n=0 and J=0, n=1. The rotational transition requires less energy, so that's the one we're looking at.

So the photon's energy should be equal to ΔE_rot = 9.24e-23 J.

But wait, wait. Momentum p of a photon is related to energy by E = p c. Because for photons, E = pc, since their mass is zero. So p = E / c.

So p = (9.24e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s).

Compute that: 9.24e-23 /3e8 = 3.08e-31 kg m/s. Wait, but that's 3.08e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.08e-31 N s (since 1 N s = 1 kg m/s).

Looking at the options:

Options are A) 1.9e-28, B) 2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, none of them are around 3e-31. So wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Calculating B: E_rot = (h² J (J+1))/(8 π² I) ?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I), where ħ is h/(2π). So E_rot = (h² J (J+1))/(8 π² I).

So for J=1, E_rot = (h² * 2)/(8 π² I) = (h²)/(4 π² I) * (1/2) * 2 = (h²)/(4 π² I) *1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B as h/(8 π² c I) * something? No, perhaps I'm getting confused with units.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for B in terms of energy. B is the rotational constant, and it's in Joules, right?

Wait, maybe I should compute B in terms of wavenumbers, but perhaps not. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, compute E_rot for J=1.

E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * J (J+1).

So for J=1, E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * 2.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = 2 * (h²/(8 π² I)).

So ΔE_rot = (h²/(4 π² I)).

Wait, now let me compute that.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

h squared = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

I is 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So h²/(4 π² I) = (4.39e-67) / (4 * (pi^2) * 1.2064e-46).

Compute denominator: 4 * (pi^2) is about 39.478. So 39.478 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 47.6e-46 =4.76e-45.

So ΔE_rot = 4.39e-67 / 4.76e-45 ≈ (4.39 /4.76) * 1e-22 = approx 0.922 * 1e-22 J = 9.22e-23 J.

Which matches what I got before. So the energy needed is 9.22e-23 J.

So the photon's energy E_photon = 9.22e-23 J. Since E = p c, p = E/c = (9.22e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But wait, that's way smaller than any of the given options. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the moment of inertia calculation.

I = μ R².

μ is the reduced mass. Let's compute μ again.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) =40/22 = 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculate that: 1.818 *1.6605 = let me compute 1.8 *1.66=2.988, and 0.018 *1.66= ~0.0299. So sum is approx 3.0179. So μ ≈3.0179e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² =3.0179e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I =3.0179e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m². Correct.

Hmm, so that's correct.

Wait, but the energy for the rotational transition is 9.22e-23 J, which is 9.22e-23 J. So the photon's momentum is E/c = 9.22e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options don't have anything that small. So perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the next state in the vibration-rotation spectrum, meaning a combination of rotation and vibration. Hmm, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is J=0 and n=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be which? If the molecule can transition to either J=1, n=0 or J=0, n=1.

But the J=1, n=0 state has lower energy than J=0, n=1 because rotational transitions are much smaller in energy change than vibrational ones.

Wait, but the problem statement says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the smallest ΔE. So the rotational transition is lower in energy, so that's what the photon should cause.

But according to my calculation, the momentum is 3.07e-31 N s, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the transition to the next state in the rotational-vibrational model, which would be a combination of both. So, perhaps the first excited state is when n=1 and J=0. But that would require a higher energy than the rotational transition. Wait, but that would require more energy than the rotational transition. So why would the question say "the next state with the lowest possible energy"?

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the molecule's transition to the next higher state regardless of which, but I'm supposed to compute the photon's momentum for that transition.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing photon energy with momentum. The question asks for momentum, which is p = E/c.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of the rotational transition.

ΔE_rot =9.22e-23 J. So p =9.22e-23/(3e8) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, none match. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the rotational transition but the vibrational transition, which requires higher energy but gives a photon momentum that matches one of the options.

Wait, ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J.

p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is lower than this. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is close but not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE_vib.

Wait, ΔE_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. Correct.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s. So that's approximately 8.8e-28 N s.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option A:1.9e-28.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider both rotational and vibrational contributions, like a transition that includes both.

But if the molecule is in the fundamental state (J=0, n=0), the next state could be J=1, n=0 (rotational), or J=0, n=1 (vibrational), or perhaps J=1, n=1, but that would be higher in energy.

Wait, but the next state with the LOWEST possible energy would be the one with the smallest energy increase. So if the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational, the photon would have to match the rotational's ΔE.

But according to my calculation, that gives a p of ~3e-31 N s, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the transition to the next state in terms of quantum numbers, regardless of energy. But that can't be, because the question says "lowest possible energy."

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate B in terms of cm^-1 or some other unit, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for B is incorrect. Let me think again. The rotational energy levels are:

E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * J (J+1) 

So B is h²/(8 π² I). So I calculate that correctly.

Wait, let me compute B again.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

I = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So B = 4.39e-67 / (8 * pi² * 1.2064e-46) 

Denominator: 8 * pi^2 ≈78.96, multiplied by I (1.2064e-46) gives 78.96 *1.2064e-46 ≈95.14e-46 =9.514e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.514e-45 = approx 4.61e-23 J.

Then, ΔE_rot =2 * B =9.22e-23 J.

So that's correct. So p=3e-31 Ns.

Hmm, but no option matches. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So maybe it's a transition that combines both rotation and vibration. For example, the first overtone or something. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor, but that usually refers to the vibration allowing the bond length to change, affecting the moment of inertia. But in this problem, I think R is given as a fixed value, so perhaps it's the rigid rotor model.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the photon momentum for the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which would involve both a change in J and v. But the question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy,' which I think refers to the smallest energy increase.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can also undergo a transition to J=0 and v=1, but that requires higher energy than J=1 and v=0. So the photon must have the energy for the rotational transition.

But again, our calculation gives a p of around 3e-31, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, and my calculation of the vibrational energy is wrong.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the formula for the vibrational energy includes other terms. Wait, the vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So when n=0, E_vib = (1/2) h w. When n=1, it's (3/2) h w. So ΔE_vib = (3/2 - 1/2) h w = h w.

So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the calculation of p is incorrect. Let me recompute p for the vibrational transition.

ΔE_vib =6.626e-34 J s *4e14 rad/s =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, none match exactly, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait a second. Could I have confused the formula for momentum? Oh, wait, maybe the question is considering the transition to a higher rotational state, but perhaps the selection rules allow ΔJ=±2, but no, that's not correct. The selection rule for rotation is ΔJ=±1 for electric dipole transitions.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that's not allowed under dipole selection rules. So that can't be.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think: perhaps I made a mistake in the mass or bond length.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So the reduced mass is (20*2)/(20+2)=40/22=1.818 amu, correct.

Bond length R=2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

So I=μ R²=1.818 amu * (2e-10)^2.

Wait, 1.818 amu is 1.818 *1.66e-27 kg ≈3.017e-27 kg.

So I=3.017e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.207e-46 kg m².

Hmm, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in cm^-1 and then find the wavelength, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is considering the transition to the next higher state which includes both a rotational and vibrational change, but that would require more energy than either individual transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the vibrational transition, and I have a miscalculation in the energy.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of p for the rotational transition.

E_rot =9.22e-23 J.

p = E/c =9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 N s.

Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next vibrational state, which is n=1, but that's a much higher energy, but perhaps that's the only option.

Wait, but the options are much higher than my calculation for the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies? No, that would be even higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ. Let me recheck.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20+2)=40/22≈1.818 amu. Correct.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is using the harmonic oscillator model, which has energy levels E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference for n=1 is h w, which is what I calculated. So perhaps the answer is 8.8e-28 Ns, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in the rotational spectrum, which is the first overtone. No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, but the molecule is in the ground vibrational state. So the photon's momentum is for the rotational transition.

But again, I don't see an option matching.

Wait, perhaps I've messed up the calculation of E_rot. Let me compute B again with exact numbers.

h=6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value as per SI).

h squared: (6.62607015e-34)^2.

Compute that:

6.62607015^2 ≈43.906.

So h squared is 43.906e-68 =4.3906e-67 J² s².

Denominator:8 pi² I.

I=1.2064e-46 kg m².

So 8 pi² ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2064e-46 = let me compute 78.9568 *1.2064 = about 95.15, so 95.15e-46 =9.515e-45.

So B =4.3906e-67 /9.515e-45 =4.3906e-67 /9.515e-45 = approximately 4.614e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot=2 *4.614e-23 =9.228e-23 J.

p=9.228e-23 /3e8 =3.076e-31 Ns.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the photon's momentum for a transition that causes a change in vibrational state, but why would that be the next state with the lowest energy? Because the rotational transition requires less energy.

I'm confused. Maybe I need to look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the photon's momentum that would cause the molecule to transition from the fundamental state to the next state, which could be the first vibrational excited state (n=1), which requires ΔE=hw=4e14 *6.626e-34 =2.65e-19 J.

p=ΔE/c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

None of the options match, but perhaps the given options have a calculation mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the rotational transition, but I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the angular momentum change, but that's not the case because the question asks for the photon's momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the photon's energy as the sum of rotational and vibrational energies, but that would give a higher energy which isn't the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in the rotational-vibrational spectrum, which could be J=1, n=1. But that would have a higher energy than both J=1, n=0 and J=0, n=1. So that's not the next lowest.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition that includes both a rotational and vibrational change, but that's more complicated. However, the question is about the 'lowest possible' energy state, so it's more likely to be the rotational transition.

But according to my calculations, this isn't matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass or bond length.

Wait, let me recompute I.

I = μ R².

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) =40/22=1.818 amu.

1 amu=1.6605e-27 kg. So μ=1.818 *1.6605e-27=3.016e-27 kg.

R=2 angstrom=2e-10 m.

R squared is (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

So I=3.016e-27 *4e-20 =1.2064e-46 kg m². Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different formula for the rotational energy. For example, using E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1.

But I think in terms of energy, B is in Joules.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for the vibrational contribution to the energy in terms of the rotational-vibrational coupling, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the vibrational transition, even though it's higher energy, because the rotational transition's momentum doesn't match any options.

Wait, the photon's momentum for vibrational transition is 8.8e-28 Ns. The options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Option D is 1.4e-28, which is about half of 8.8e-28. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ΔE_vib.

Let me recheck ΔE_vib.

ΔE_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28. So 8.83e-28 Ns.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0, v=0 to J=0, v=1, which is a vibrational transition. But the momentum is 8.83e-28, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is looking for the transition to the first state with higher energy, regardless of whether it's rotation or vibration. But the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy," which suggests the smallest ΔE.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the energy levels within the rotational state. For example, the fundamental state is J=0, n=0. The next possible state with the lowest energy would be J=1, n=0 because the energy is lower than J=0, n=1.

But that's what I've been calculating, and it's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon's momentum for the transition to the next vibrational state, and the options have a typo or I'm missing a factor.

Wait, let me see. 6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

No option matches this.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for the speed of light, but that's unlikely. 3e8 m/s is the accepted value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's energy for the transition to J=2, but that's not allowed under dipole selection rules. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the bond length in a different unit. Wait, R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the transition to J=1, which has a certain energy, and the photon's momentum is calculated correctly, but the options are presented in different units.

Wait, 3.07e-31 Ns is 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all larger than that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should use the rotational constant B in terms of energy, but perhaps I should calculate it differently.

Wait, B is given by ħ²/(2I), where ħ is h/(2π). So:

B = (h^2)/(8 π² I).

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, let me compute B again with exact numbers.

h =6.62607015e-34 J s.

h^2= (6.62607015e-34)^2 = 4.39055e-67 J² s².

I = μ R² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.016e-27 *4e-20 =1.2064e-46 kg m².

Denominator:8 pi^2 I =8*(pi^2)*1.2064e-46.

pi^2 is approximately 9.8696.

So denominator=8 *9.8696 *1.2064e-46 =8*11.91e-46=95.28e-46 =9.528e-45.

So B =4.39055e-67 /9.528e-45.

Calculate that: 4.39055e-67 /9.528e-45 = (4.39055/9.528) *1e-22.

4.39055 /9.528 ≈0.4607.

So B≈0.4607e-22 J =4.607e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot=2B=9.214e-23 J.

p=9.214e-23 /3e8=3.071e-31 Ns.

Still no match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0, v=0 to J=1, v=1. But that would be a higher energy transition, involving both changes.

Wait, but that would require more energy than either transition alone.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should re-examine the options.

Options:

A)1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

Wait, the only option that's close to the vibrational transition's p is option A, which is 1.9e-28. My calculation for the vibrational transition is 8.8e-28, which is about 4.7 times larger than option A.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h*w.

Wait, h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Correct.

So p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using angular frequency in terms of cm^-1, but no, w is given in rad/s.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies, but that would be E_rot + E_vib, which is even larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum for a transition that involves both rotational and vibrational changes. But that's more complicated, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the transition to the next state in terms of quantum number, not energy. But that would require the photon to have a higher energy.

I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should just look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question and the answer is the rotational transition, but the options don't have it. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the formula p = h / (λ), but since E = hc/λ, so p = E/c = h/(λ c) *c= h/λ.

Wait, but I don't have λ. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute λ from the energy.

Wait, E=hc/λ.

λ = hc /E.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula p = m v, but photons don't have mass.

Wait, I think I've exhausted all options. Since none of my calculations match the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a diatomic molecule but a single atom. No, the question says diatomic.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass in atomic mass units instead of converting to kg.

No, because the formula for I requires kg.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the bond length in a different unit, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the first excited rotational state and the first excited vibrational state simultaneously, but that requires more energy than either.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should go with the vibrational transition, even though it doesn't match any option. But since none of the options match, perhaps the correct choice isn't listed, but I have to pick the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE_rot.

Wait, perhaps I should have used B = h/(8 π² c I) * something. No, I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers. The rotational constant B can also be expressed in cm^-1 as B = h/(8 π² c I). So B (cm^-1) = (6.626e-34 J s)/(8 π² *3e8 m/s * 1.2064e-46 kg m²).

Wait, let's compute that.

Denominator:8 pi^2 *3e8 *1.2064e-46.

8 pi^2≈78.96.

78.96 *3e8 =2.3688e10.

2.3688e10 *1.2064e-46 =2.3688e10 *1.2064e-46 =2.856e-36.

So B =6.626e-34 /2.856e-36 = approximately 232 cm^-1.

So B=232 cm^-1.

Then, the energy difference for rotational transition is 2 *B *hc.

Wait, because E=h c B in cm^-1.

Wait, no, for rotational transition, ΔE_rot =2 B hc, where B is in cm^-1.

Wait, B (cm^-1)=232, so ΔE_rot =2 *232 * hc.

But hc=12400 eV*Å.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute this in Joules.

Wait, 1 cm^-1 corresponds to hc=1.986e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot =2 *232 *1.986e-23 J.

232 *2=464.

464 *1.986e-23 =9.22e-21 J.

Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So p=9.22e-21 /3e8 =3.07e-29 kg m/s =3.07e-29 Ns.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the formula p = sqrt(2 m E), but that's for particles with mass, not photons.

Wait, photons don't have mass, so that formula doesn't apply.

I think I'm stuck. Based on all calculations, the correct photon momentum for the rotational transition is approximately 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't among the options. The vibrational transition gives 8.8e-28 Ns, which is also not an option. Perhaps the question expects me to choose option C, which is 1.1e-27, but I don't see how that would come about.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for angular momentum, not energy. But that's not what the question is asking.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy using the moment of inertia in atomic units, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recheck.

I=μ R².

μ= (20 *2)/(22) amu =1.818 amu.

1 amu=1.66e-27 kg. So μ=1.818 *1.66e-27=3.016e-27 kg.

R=2 angstrom=2e-10 m.

R²=4e-20 m².

I=3.016e-27 *4e-20=1.2064e-46 kg m². Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which allows R to change with vibration. But since the problem gives R as fixed, I think it's the rigid rotor model.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should go with the vibrational transition and see which option is closest.

But the calculated p is 8.8e-28
