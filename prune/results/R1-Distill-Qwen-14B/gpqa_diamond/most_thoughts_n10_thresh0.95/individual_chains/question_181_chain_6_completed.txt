Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos and the Sun. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, especially the proton-proton chain. 

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, why does that matter? Oh right, because neutrinos are produced in these reactions, and the time it takes for changes in the core to affect the neutrino flux we detect is about the light travel time from the core to the surface. Eight and a half minutes is roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, so if a reaction stops in the core, we would see the effect on neutrino flux after that time.

So, the question is about the ratio of fluxes in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are 10, 0.01, 1, or 0.1.

I remember that the pp-III branch is one of the steps in the proton-proton chain. The proton-proton chain has a couple of branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each produces different neutrinos. Oh wait, pp-I is the dominant process, I think, which produces a lot of 700-800 keV neutrinos. Or maybe it's the other way around? Let me think again. 

Wait, the main branch, pp-I, involves two protons fusing into deuterium, releasing a positron and a neutrino. Those neutrinos are lower energy, around 400 keV or so. The higher energy neutrinos come from the other branches, like pp-II and pp-III. Oh, right, the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, then the production of those high-energy neutrinos would drop.

Wait, but in this scenario, the pp-III branch stopped. So all other reactions continue. So what does that mean for the neutrino flux? The pp-III branch contributes to the production of neutrinos in a higher energy range. So if that stops, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would decrease, while band 1 (700-800 keV) would be mostly unaffected, assuming band 1 is from another process.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III contributes to higher energy neutrinos, so stopping it would reduce the higher energy neutrino flux more than the lower. So the flux in band 2 would decrease, and band 1 might remain the same.

But wait, another thought. Neutrino production in the Sun's core is mainly from the pp chain, which has three branches. The dominant one is pp-I, which produces lower-energy neutrinos. The other branches (like pp-II and pp-III) produce higher-energy neutrinos. So, if pp-III is stopped, does that affect the higher energy neutrinos more?

So, if pp-III is stopped, the production of higher-energy neutrinos (like in band 2, 800-900 keV) would stop. But what about band 1, from 700-800 keVâ€”does that come from other sources? Hmm, perhaps band 1 is from the main pp-I. If the pp-III stops, pp-I continues. So the flux in band 1 would remain the same, but band 2 would drop.

Wait, but when the pp-III stops, does that mean a significant portion of the neutrinos in band 2 comes from there? So if the pp-III branch is responsible for some of the 800-900 keV neutrinos, stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2, but band 1, which is lower energy, would have the same flux as before.

Let me try to think about this in terms of neutrino energies. The main neutrino from the pp-I branch is about 0.42 MeV, which is 420 keV. So that's below band 1 (700-800). The other branches, like pp-II and pp-III, produce higher energy neutrinos. For example, pp-III produces a neutrino of about 700 keV? Or wait, perhaps pp-III produces around 1.4 MeV? I might be getting this mixed up. Wait, I should recall that in the pp chain, the dominant process (pp-I) produces a neutrino of about 0.42 MeV. Then, the other processes (like pp-II and pp-III) produce higher energy neutrinos.

Wait, another point: the Beryllium neutrino. The pp-II branch involves a reaction where a beryllium-7 captures a proton to form beryllium-8, emitting a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is around 0.8 MeV, which is 800 keV. So maybe that's where the 700-800 keV band comes from. And the pp-III branch produces even higher energy neutrinos, perhaps around 1.4 MeV or so, which would fall into the 800-900 keV band? Or maybe the exact numbers are a bit different, but the general idea is that the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight. The main pp-I process produces low-energy neutrinos around 0.42 MeV. Then, the pp-II branch produces higher-energy ones, maybe around 0.8 to 1.0 MeV. And the pp-III branch is another step, perhaps even higher, like around 1.4 MeV. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact energies.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of the highest energy neutrinos (like around 1.4 MeV) would stop. But the question is about two specific bands: 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So, 700-800 is below 800 keV, and 800-900 is above.

Wait, if the pp-III neutrinos are above 800 keV, then stopping pp-III would reduce the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV), but band 1 (700-800) would be mostly unaffected.

But wait, another thing to consider: the total flux in each band. Let's say that the pp-III contributes a certain fraction of the higher band. For instance, if the pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV range, then their stopping would reduce the flux in band 2. Meanwhile, the pp-I and pp-II process continue, so the 700-800 band (band 1) would have its usual flux.

But wait, the pp-II process produces around 0.8 MeV, so that's in band 1. So if pp-II continues, band 1's flux remains the same, but if pp-III is stopped, which contributes to band 2, then the flux in band 2 would drop.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remain as they were, except the pp-III stopped. So the pp-I and pp-II continue. So, the neutrinos from pp-I (low energy), pp-II (around 0.8 MeV), and pp-III (maybe around 1.4 MeV) are all produced. But since pp-III is stopped, the 1.4 MeV neutrinos are not produced anymore.

So, in band 2 (800-900 keV), the flux is mainly from pp-III? Or perhaps also from pp-II. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So, the pp-II neutrinos are at about 0.8 MeV, which is the lower end of band 2 (800 keV). So, if band 2 is 800-900 keV, then the pp-II neutrinos at 0.8 MeV (800 keV) are just at the lower end.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are higher, say around 1.4 MeV, then they're in band 2 (since 1.4 MeV is 1400 keV). So, let's say the pp-III neutrinos are in band 2.

So, when the pp-III stops, the neutrinos in band 2 (800-900) would lose a significant portion of their flux. But the neutrinos in band 1 (700-800) are from pp-I and pp-II. Since pp-II is still running, the neutrinos at 0.8 MeV (the lower end) continue, but maybe pp-III's contribution to higher energies in band 2 is the main source.

But the question is about the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2 after the pp-III stops.

So, before stopping, what's the flux in each band? Let's think about that. The main source of neutrinos from the Sun is the pp-I process, which produces lower-energy neutrinos. So, the majority of the neutrinos are around 0.42 MeV. Then, the pp-II and pp-III contribute to higher energies.

So, the flux peaks around 0.4 MeV, and the higher energy neutrinos are less in number. So, the flux in band 1 (700-800) is probably much lower than the peak, but let's assume that the pp-II contributes to some extent.

But the pp-III contributes to the higher end, the 800-900 keV band. So, after the pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would drop, while band 1 remains mostly the same.

So, if normally the flux in band 2 is, say, X, and after stopping, it becomes zero (since all pp-III is stopped), but wait, that's not the case. Wait, pp-III is stopped, but other reactions continue. Are there other sources of neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range?

Wait, no, other branches like the CNO cycle also produce neutrinos, but I think the CNO neutrinos are even higher energy. Or wait, the CNO cycle produces neutrinos around ~1.5 MeV, which would be in band 2 as well. So if the CNO cycle is active, then stopping pp-III might not completely eliminate the neutrinos in band 2.

Wait, the question states that all other reactions remain as they were. So the CNO cycle is still producing neutrinos in band 2. So, the flux in band 2 would only lose the contribution from pp-III. So, the CNO neutrinos are in band 2, and pp-III is also in band 2? So, without pp-III, the flux in band 2 would be lower by the amount that pp-III contributed.

But how much did pp-III contribute compared to the CNO cycle? I'm not exactly sure about the relative contributions.

Wait, the dominant source of solar neutrinos is the pp-I process. But the CNO cycle is a minor contributor, especially in the core. Wait, the CNO cycle is more prominent in higher metallicity stars, but our Sun is mostly run by the proton-proton chain, so the CNO contribution is smaller. So, in the Sun, the CNO neutrinos are a smaller fraction of the total.

So, prior to the pp-III stopping, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) comes from both the CNO cycle and the pp-III branch. So, stopping pp-III would reduce the band 2 flux by the fraction that comes from pp-III. But pp-III is part of the pp chain, which is the dominant process. Hmm.

Wait, but I think the pp-III contributes to the high-energy neutrinos, perhaps in the 1-2 MeV range. So, without it, band 2 (800-900) would lose some of its neutrinos, but the CNO neutrinos (maybe around 1.5 MeV) would still be present.

But perhaps the main point is that the pp-III neutrinos are part of the high-energy tail, and without them, the higher end of band 2 (e.g., 800-900) would have less flux compared to band 1 (700-800), which is mainly from the pp-II and pp-I.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think in terms of the specific bands.

If after the pp-III stops:

- Band 1 (700-800 keV) has its usual flux because it's mainly from pp-II and possibly some pp-I.

- Band 2 (800-900 keV) has its usual flux minus the contribution from pp-III.

So, if the pp-III was a significant source for band 2, then the flux in band 2 would drop, making the ratio (flux band1 / band2) increase.

But how much does pp-III contribute to band 2?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are all in band 2, and without them, the flux in band 2 drops to what the CNO cycle provides, which is much less.

But if the CNO cycle produces a small fraction of the neutrinos, then the band 2 flux would decrease, making the ratio band1/band2 increase.

Wait, but without knowing the exact contributions, perhaps the question is implying that the pp-III is a major source of the higher energy neutrinos. So, when it stops, the band 2 flux drops to a much lower value.

If the pp-III was the main contributor to band 2, then the flux in band 2 would be approximately zero (or very low) compared to before. So the ratio band1/band2 would be very large.

But let's think about the flux in each band. Before the pp-III stopped, band 1's flux is F1, and band 2's flux is F2. After stopping, band 1 remains F1, and band 2 becomes F2' = F2 - (pp-III contribution to band 2).

But without knowing the exact numbers, perhaps the pp-III contributes a significant portion of the high-energy neutrinos. So, if the pp-III was the main contributor to band 2, then F2' would be much smaller.

So, for example, if F2 was dominated by pp-III, F2' would be similar to the CNO contribution, which is much smaller than F1.

Let me think about the approximate fluxes. The total neutrino flux from the Sun is dominated by the pp-I process, so the majority of neutrinos are around 0.4 MeV. The pp-II and pp-III contribute less, and CNO even less.

So, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) would primarily come from the pp-II process. The pp-II neutrinos are around 0.8 MeV, which is the lower end of band 1. So, F1 is mainly due to pp-II.

The flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) comes from the high end of pp-II and the pp-III, and perhaps the CNO. So, without pp-III, F2' would be the CNO contribution plus any remaining from pp-II beyond 800 keV.

Wait, but if the pp-II neutrinos are exactly at 800 keV, then any neutrinos from pp-II would contribute to band 1, not band 2.

Hmm, maybe I should think of it as follows:

- Band 1 (700-800 keV) is mainly from pp-II and possibly some lower pp-III or CNO.

- Band 2 (800-900 keV) is mainly from the higher end of pp-III and CNO.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the neutrino energy spectrum. It peaks around 0.4 MeV, then declines with higher energies. So, the number of neutrinos at higher energies is less.

If the pp-III branch was responsible for producing neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range, then the flux in band 2 would be significantly reduced upon its stoppage. But band 1, which is 700-800 keV, is higher than the peak, but lower than band 2. The number of neutrinos in band 1 is lower than the peak, but higher than band 2.

Wait, no. The peak is at ~0.4 MeV. So, neutrino flux decreases as energy increases beyond the peak. So, the number of neutrinos at 0.8 MeV (band 1) is much less than at 0.4.

But the number of neutrinos in band 2 (800-900 keV, which is 0.8-0.9 MeV) is even smaller. So, if the pp-III process produces a lot of neutrinos in band 2, which is a small fraction of the total, stopping that would reduce the band 2 flux.

But I'm not sure about the exact numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the main effect is that the pp-III contributes to higher energy neutrinos beyond 800 keV, so stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2. Since the flux in band 1 is already low, and band 2 is even lower, the ratio might not change much.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio before and after the pp-III stops. So, initially, the ratio was F1/F2. After stopping, it's (F1)/(F2').

If F2' is much smaller than F2, then the ratio would increase.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes a significant portion of the neutrinos in band 2, but the majority of neutrinos in band 2 come from the CNO cycle. But since the CNO cycle's contribution is much smaller, the pp-III might only be a minor part of the total.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the main sources:

- pp-I: 0.42 MeV, so in the lower energy range, not in the bands we're considering.

- pp-II: ~0.8 MeV, so the lower end of band 1 (700-800 keV).

- pp-III: perhaps around 1.4 MeV, which is in band 2 (800-900 keV).

- CNO cycle: produces higher-energy neutrinos, around 1.5-6 MeV, so they're in band 2 and beyond.

So, the neutrinos in band 1 (700-800 keV) are dominated by the pp-II process. The neutrinos in band 2 (800-900 keV) are from pp-III and the lower end of the CNO cycle.

So, if the pp-III stops, band 2 loses contributions from pp-III, but CNO is still there. So, F2' = F_cno (CNO contribution to band 2) + F_ppiii (which is zero now).

Wait, but in reality, the CNO neutrinos are a small fraction compared to the pp chain. So, if pp-III contributes a significant part of the neutrinos in band 2, then after stopping, F2' would be much smaller.

So, originally:

F1 (700-800) = mainly from pp-II.

F2 (800-900) = from pp-III and CNO.

After stopping pp-III:

F1 remains the same.

F2 becomes F_cno (the CNO contribution to that band).

Since the CNO produces fewer neutrinos than the pp chain, the F2' would be much less than F2.

So, the ratio F1/F2 would increase because F2 drops.

But without knowing the exact numbers, it's hard to say by how much.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are a minor part of the total. Let me think: the dominant neutrino production is from the pp-I process, which is about 99% of the solar neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III contribute maybe a few percent, and CNO is a very small fraction.

Thus, the pp-III neutrinos in band 2 (F2_ppiii) are a fraction of the total F2. So, if F2 is mainly from pp-III and CNO, and F_ppiii is a significant part of F2, then after stopping, F2' would drop.

So, suppose F2 was 100 units, with 90 from pp-III and 10 from CNO. Then, F2' would be 10. So F1 was, say, 10 units (from pp-II), then the ratio before was 10/100=0.1. After stopping, F1=10, F2'=10, so ratio becomes 1. So the ratio increased by a factor of 10.

But that's a made-up example. Alternatively, if F2 was 100, with 90 from CNO and 10 from pp-III, then F2' would be 90. Then the ratio F1/F2 was 10/100=0.1, after stopping 10/90=0.11. So, no significant change.

But I think the CNO contribution is much smaller, so in reality, F2 is dominated by pp-III. So, when pp-III stops, F2 drops to CNO, which is a small fraction. So F2' is much smaller.

So, if F1 was, say, 10, and F2 was 100 (so ratio 0.1), and after stopping, F2' is 10 (CNO contribution), then the new ratio is 10/10 = 1. So, the ratio increased by 10 times.

But the options are 10, 0.01, 1, or 0.1.

In that example, the ratio went from 0.1 to 1. So the increase is a factor of 10, making the ratio 1.

So, the answer would be option C) 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes a significant portion, but not all, of band 2.

Wait, but the question is about the approximate ratio. I think in reality, the pp-III neutrinos are a small fraction of the total, because the main source is the pp-I.

Wait, but in the Sun, the majority of the neutrinos come from the pp chain, but within the pp chain, the main branch (pp-I) is dominant. So, the pp-II and pp-III are minor branches. So, if the pp-III is stopped, the neutrinos in band 2 (which are from pp-III and CNO) would drop, but the band 1 (from pp-II) remains.

So, if F1 was 10 (pp-II), F2 was 20 (pp-III and CNO, say, 18 from pp-III and 2 from CNO), then after stopping, F2 becomes 2.

So the ratio would be 10/2 = 5, which is not an option. Hmm. So perhaps the actual numbers would suggest a flux ratio that's around 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are not a major part of the band 2. So, the stopping of pp-III would have a minor effect on the flux ratio.

Wait, but without the pp-III, the only source in band 2 is the CNO, which is a small fraction. Let's say that in band 2, 95% comes from pp-III and 5% from CNO. So, F2 was 100, then F2' is 5. F1 was, say, 10. So the ratio goes from 0.1 to 2, which is not an option.

But the options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino flux in band 1 is about the same as in band 2, but if pp-III is stopped, band 2's flux drops, making their ratio (F1/F2) higher.

But without knowing the exact numbers, this is tricky. Let me think of another approach.

The question is about the ratio after the pp-III stopped. The only change is in the higher-energy neutrinos. Since the pp-III produces around 1.4 MeV neutrinos, which are in band 2. So, after stopping, the band 2 flux would be just from CNO.

The CNO neutrinos are about 0.1% of the total solar neutrino flux. But I'm not sure about the exact contribution to band 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are in band 2, but they're a small part. So, the flux in band 2 without pp-III would be much lower.

If the CNO contribution is negligible compared to pp-III, then F2' is almost zero, so the ratio F1/F2 would be approximately F1/(0) which is infinity. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the CNO contribution is not negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute about 10% of the total neutrino flux, and the CNO contributes another 0.1%. So, in band 2, pp-III is 99% and CNO is 1%. Then, after stopping pp-III, F2' is 1% of the original F2.

So, the original F1 is say 1, and F2 is 100. Then, the ratio is 0.01. After stopping, F2 is 1, so the ratio is 1/1 = 1.

But that's a made-up scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are about 1% of the total, and the pp-III is another, say, 5%.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: the pp-III neutrinos are high-energy, so their flux is lower than the lower-energy ones. So, the number of neutrinos in band 2 is less than in band 1.

So, the original ratio F1/F2 is greater than 1. After stopping pp-III, which only affects F2, the ratio would increase further.

But looking at the options, option A is 10, option C is 1, and D is 0.1.

Wait, perhaps the original ratio is about 1, and after stopping pp-III, the F2 drops by a factor of 10, making the ratio 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are about 0.1% and the pp-III are about 10% of the total flux.

Wait, but I think the main point is that the stopping of pp-III would reduce the higher-energy neutrinos. So, band 1 would have the same flux as before, band 2 would have less, making the ratio (F1/F2) increase.

The options suggest that the ratio could be 10, 0.1, etc.

But perhaps the original fluxes are such that F1 is about the same as F2, making the ratio 1. After stopping, F2 is much lower, so the ratio increases to 10. So, the answer would be 10 (option A).

Wait, but without knowing exact numbers, it's tricky. Alternatively, I remember that the pp-III neutrinos are a small fraction of the total, so stopping them would not drastically change the ratio. 

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band 1 is about the same as in band 2, and stopping pp-III reduces band 2 by a factor of 10, making the ratio 10.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but based on the reasoning, if the pp-III contributes significantly to band 2, then the ratio would increase. The options suggest that the answer is around 1, 10, or 0.1.

Wait, another way: the pp-III neutrinos are in band 2, so their stopping removes a fraction of band 2's flux. Suppose that without pp-III, band 2's flux is 10% of its original value. Then, if F1 was 1 and F2 was 10, the ratio was 0.1. After stopping, F2 is 1, so the ratio is 1 (option C).

Alternatively, if F2 was 10 and F1 was 10, then ratio was 1. After stopping, F2 is 1, ratio becomes 10 (option A).

But I don't know the exact numbers.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main source of the 800-900 keV band. So, stopping them would make that band's flux go down to almost zero (if other sources are negligible). So, F2' is almost zero. Then, the ratio F1/F2 would approach infinity, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO cycle contributes to that band, so F2' is non-zero. But without knowing, perhaps the intended answer is that the ratio is approximately 1, as the neutrinos in band 1 come from a different process (pp-II) that isn't affected.

Wait, perhaps in the Sun, the majority of the neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band come from the pp-II process, while those in 800-900 come from pp-III and CNO. So, if pp-III stops, the 800-900 band loses its main contributor, but 700-800 remains same.

So, F1 is mainly from pp-II, F2 from pp-III and CNO. So, after stopping, F2' = F_cno.

If F_cno is much smaller than F_ppiii, then F2' is much less than F2.

So, the ratio F1/F2 would be higher.

Assuming F1 was equal to F2 before, then after, F1/(F_cno) would be higher. But without knowing the exact, perhaps the intended answer is 1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: the pp-III neutrinos are much higher energy, so the number in band 2 is much less than band 1. So, the original flux ratio F1/F2 is 10 or 100. After stopping, F2 would drop by a factor, so the ratio could be 10.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another perspective. The pp-III process contributes to the solar neutrinos, but the majority of the neutrinos are from the pp-I process, which are lower energy. So, the flux in the higher energy bands is much lower than the lower ones.

So, if the pp-III stops, the only effect is on the high-energy tail, which is already a small fraction. So, the flux in band 2 is already low, and stopping pp-III would make it even lower, but not by a huge factor. So, the ratio F1/F2 would be around 1, because both bands are low in flux, but if F2 was lower, the ratio increases.

But without knowing, I think the intended answer is that the ratio is approximately 1, so option C.


The question involves analyzing the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core hypothetically stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos, primarily in the 800-900 keV range, while the pp-II branch contributes neutrinos around 0.8 MeV (at the lower end of the 700-800 keV band). The CNO cycle produces even higher-energy neutrinos, but its contribution is much smaller compared to the proton-proton chain.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Energy Contributions**:
   - The pp-I process dominates solar neutrino production, producing low-energy neutrinos around 0.42 MeV, which are not relevant to the given bands.
   - The pp-II process contributes neutrinos around 0.8 MeV, primarily affecting the lower end of the 700-800 keV band.
   - The pp-III process produces higher-energy neutrinos, likely in the 800-900 keV range, and is the primary source of flux in this band.
   - The CNO cycle contributes neutrinos at even higher energies (1.5-6 MeV), but its overall contribution is much smaller compared to the proton-proton chain.

2. **Effect of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - The pp-III branch is responsible for a significant fraction of the neutrinos in the 800-900 keV band. Stopping it would reduce the flux in this band, leaving only the contribution from the CNO cycle.
   - The flux in the 700-800 keV band (band 1) is primarily unaffected because it is dominated by the pp-II process, which continues unaffected.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After**:
   - Before the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) is dominated by the pp-III contribution, with a smaller contribution from the CNO cycle.
   - After the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 is reduced to just the CNO contribution, which is much smaller.
   - The flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) remains largely unchanged, as it is dominated by the pp-II process.

4. **Approximation of the Ratio**:
   - The pp-III neutrinos are a significant contributor to band 2, so their removal would cause the flux in band 2 to drop significantly.
   - The flux in band 1 is already lower than the peak flux (around 0.4 MeV), but it remains relatively stable.
   - The ratio of fluxes, **band 1 / band 2**, would increase due to the reduced flux in band 2. However, the exact increase depends on the relative contributions of pp-III and CNO to band 2.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the dominance of the pp-III branch in band 2 and the smaller contribution of the CNO cycle, the flux in band 2 would drop significantly after the pp-III branch stops.
   - The ratio of fluxes would increase, but the exact factor depends on the relative contributions. Based on the reasoning, the ratio is approximately **1**, as the flux in band 1 remains relatively unaffected while the flux in band 2 drops to a much smaller value.
