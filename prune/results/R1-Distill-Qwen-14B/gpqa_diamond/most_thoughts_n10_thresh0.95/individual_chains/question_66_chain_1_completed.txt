Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, what do I remember about SMEFT? It's a framework that allows us to add higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, right? These operators are organized by their dimension, and each dimension corresponds to a certain energy scaleâ€”like, the lower the dimension, the higher the energy or the more relevant the operator is at lower energies.

The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me think about each of these.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Well, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? Because the Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT extends it. So all the operators in SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry. Operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, ensuring that they transform appropriately under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But in a quantum field theory (QFT), Poincare symmetry is fundamental. SMEFT is a QFT, so it must respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, do all operators automatically respect this? Because the way SMEFT is constructed, the operators are local and the theory is built in a way that respects Poincare. So yes, Poincare symmetry is also needed. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes people talk about Lorentz and Poincare as related but separate. Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. So, since SMEFT is a QFT built in a Poincare-invariant way, all operators must respect it. So 1 and 2 should both be correct.

Now, CP symmetry. Wait, the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP. Therefore, the operators themselves don't have to respect CP symmetry. It's possible for SMEFT to have terms that break CP, depending on the new physics. So option 3, CP symmetry, isn't necessarily something all operators must respect.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, especially those with spin. It states that a physical system cannot have a CP-violating state without a T-violating state, and vice versa. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and Lorentz invariance implies CPT symmetry. Because all the operators in SMEFT are Lorentz scalars, they must also respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? They must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait, earlier I thought about whether Poincare is included in the answer. Let me review. The question says "must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT."

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about Poincare symmetry. Because all Lorentz-invariant theories are Poincare-invariant if they include the necessary terms for translation invariance. But SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant QFT, so it must respect Poincare. But does each individual operator need to respect Poincare, or does the entire theory? Because each operator is a scalar, but the Poincare symmetry includes things like momentum conservation, which are more about the theory as a whole rather than individual operators. Hmm, perhaps I'm conflating the theory's symmetry with each operator's properties.

Wait, operators in QFT are local, so they should respect translation symmetry because they're in a Poincare-invariant theory. So each operator would have to be a Poincare scalar. Wait, but maybe it's the theory as a whole that's Poincare-invariant, and each operator's form is such that when you apply the symmetries, the theory remains consistent. So I think that in SMEFT, all the operators are required to be Poincare scalars. So 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincare) are both required.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit muddled. Let me think again. Lorentz symmetry is about local transformations (like rotations, boosts), which must be respected by each operator because operators are local. Poincare symmetry includes translations, which are also local. So each operator must be invariant under translations? Wait, but operators in a QFT are local, and the theory is translation-invariant, so the operators themselves don't have to carry any particular transformation properties under translations because they're integrated over spacetime. Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe the operators just need to be scalars under Lorentz, not necessarily Poincare.

Wait, but Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, so if an operator is a scalar under Lorentz, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a scalar under translations. But wait, operators in a Poincare-invariant theory would have to transform as part of a Poincare module. Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's better to think that in SMEFT, the operators are required to be Lorentz scalars, and the theory as a whole is Poincare-invariant. So perhaps each operator only needs to respect Lorentz symmetry, and Poincare is a property of the entire theory, not each individual operator. Or maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, would that break the theory's Poincare symmetry? I think that if any operator violates a symmetry, the theory would too. So perhaps each operator must be invariant under Poincare. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT framework enforces that all operators are Poincare-invariant, meaning that 1 and 2 are both correct.

Wait, but let me think of the structure of SMEFT. The operators are built as local operators, and the theory is built in a way that the S-matrix respects all the symmetries of the Standard Model. SMEFT is constructed to be Lorentz-invariant, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime structure. But translation invariance is a global symmetry, and operators don't carry any transformation properties under it. So perhaps each operator doesn't have to be a scalar under translations because it's just a local operator. But the entire theory must be Poincare-invariant, meaning that the sum of all terms (operators) must be invariant under Poincare.

Wait, but the question is about each operator needing to respect the symmetry. So perhaps only Lorentz and CPT are required, but not Poincare. Because translation invariance is a global symmetry, and operators are local, so each operator doesn't have to transform in a particular way under translations. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe Poincare symmetry is automatically satisfied if the theory is built in a way that the operators are local and the theory is Lorentz-invariant. So maybe only Lorentz symmetry is required as a per-operator condition, while the overall theory respects Poincare. But the question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So perhaps Poincare symmetry is more of a global property of the theory, not each operator.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall from what I've studied. In SMEFT, when you add operators, they are organized in terms of their Lorentz structure. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. But what about Poincare? Since the theory is built in a way that respects Poincare, each operator term must be a Poincare scalar. Because otherwise, the sum of all terms wouldn't be Poincare-invariant. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar, meaning that 2 is correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because translation invariance is a global symmetry, and operators are local. So perhaps each operator doesn't have to be invariant under translations because the invariance comes from the entire theory's structure. For example, the Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar, but individual terms (operators) might not have to be. Wait, but the Lagrangian is a scalar density, so it's a Lorentz scalar, but under translations, the Lagrangian doesn't change because it's a local quantity. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think of it this way: in a Poincare-invariant theory, the Lagrangian is a scalar, and each term in it must be a scalar. But wait, the operators are terms in the Lagrangian, so they must be Poincare scalars.

Wait, if the Lagrangian is a scalar, each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar. Because otherwise, the sum wouldn't be a scalar. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar, meaning that options 1 and 2 are both correct. But then why do I sometimes hear that Poincare is a bigger symmetry including Lorentz and translations, but each individual term is a scalar under Lorentz and also under translations? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare symmetry isn't something that each operator has to respect on their own, but the entire theory must respect it. So each operator doesn't need to transform in a particular way, but when you put all the terms together, the theory as a whole is Poincare-invariant. So whether the operators individually respect Poincare may not be required, as long as the total Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar.

But the question says "must be respected by all operators." So if each operator doesn't individually have to be a scalar under Poincare, then option 2 isn't correct. But I'm not 100% confident.

Wait, but the answer options are given, and the options are combinations. Let's look at the options again.

Option C is 1, 2, 4. So that's Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Option A is 1 and 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 3 (CP) is not necessarily respected, and 4 (CPT) is because it's a consequence of Lorentz invariance. So SMEFT must respect Lorentz (1) and CPT (4). What about Poincare?

If the question is about operators respecting the symmetry, then perhaps each operator must be a Lorentz scalar (so 1 is correct). Since the theory is Poincare-invariant, but each operator doesn't have to be a Poincare scalar because the overall Lagrangian is. Hmm, but that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of which symmetries are required of the operators. For example, when you write down an operator in SMEFT, it must be a Lorentz scalar. But it doesn't have to be a Poincare scalar because the theory's invariance comes from the sum of terms. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps all operators must be invariant under Lorentz symmetry, Poincare, and CPT. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: Lorentz symmetry is a local symmetry, and Poincare includes translations, which are a global symmetry. So each operator must respect Lorentz, but not necessarily Poincare. But the theory as a whole must respect Poincare, which would require that all the terms (operators) are arranged in a way that the total Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar.

So the question is about which symmetries must each operator respect. So perhaps only Lorentz and CPT, but not Poincare.

Wait, but Poincare includes translations, which are global symmetries. So operators as local terms don't have to be invariant under global translations because the invariance is ensured by the structure of the theory. So maybe only Lorentz and CPT are required.

Wait, but CPT is a combination of C, P, and T. Since the Standard Model isn't CPT-symmetric? No, wait, the Standard Model is CPT-symmetric. Wait, no, CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially in theories with spin. So all quantum field theories with spin must respect CPT symmetry because of the spin-statistics theorem. So SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry, so all operators must respect it.

So putting it all together:

Which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? Lorentz (1) and CPT (4). But wait, what about Poincare (2)? If each operator doesn't have to be a Poincare scalar, then 2 is not required. So the correct answer would include 1 and 4. But looking at the options, none of the options have only 1 and 4. The options are combinations of 1, 2,3,4.

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2 â†’ Lorentz and Poincare.

B) 3,4 â†’ CP and CPT.

C) 1,2,4 â†’ Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

D) 1,3,4 â†’ Lorentz, CP, CPT.

Hmm. So if both Lorentz and CPT must be respected, but not necessarily Poincare. But wait, if the operators must be Poincare scalars, then 2 is correct. So which is it?

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. Each operator in SMEFT is a local operator and must be a Lorentz scalar. The theory as a whole must be Poincare-invariant. So each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz, but under Poincare, they might transform in a non-trivial way. But the sum of all terms in the Lagrangian must form a Poincare scalar.

Wait, but each operator is part of the Lagrangian, which is a scalar. So each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar, which includes being a Poincare scalar. Because otherwise, the Lagrangian wouldn't be a scalar.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think of the Lagrangian. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density, which must be a scalar. Each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar. So each operator must be a scalar under Poincare symmetry.

So 1 and 2 are both correct. So the operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare.

Then, CPT: as CPT is a consequence of Lorentz symmetry (in theories with spin, which SMEFT has), so all operators must respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4.

So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the operators don't necessarily have to respect Poincare, but perhaps they do because the Lagrangian must be a scalar.

So, if the theory is Poincare-invariant (which it is), then each operator must be a Poincare scalar. Because the sum of operators in the Lagrangian must form a Poincare scalar. So each operator in the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar. Therefore, option C (1,2,4) is correct.

But wait, what's the correct answer? I'm a bit confused, but I think that since the theory is Poincare-invariant, each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So options 1,2,4 must be respected by all operators.

So the correct answer is C) 1,2,4.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators, which are organized by their dimension. These operators must respect certain symmetries to maintain the consistency of the theory. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it extends the Standard Model, which is Lorentz-invariant. All operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars, ensuring they transform appropriately under Lorentz transformations. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **PoincarÃ© Symmetry**: PoincarÃ© symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a quantum field theory (QFT), it must respect PoincarÃ© symmetry. Each operator in the Lagrangian must be a PoincarÃ© scalar to ensure the Lagrangian density is a scalar, which is necessary for the theory to be PoincarÃ©-invariant. Thus, PoincarÃ© symmetry must also be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry in general (e.g., CP violation in the CKM matrix). SMEFT can include operators that violate CP symmetry, depending on the new physics beyond the Standard Model. Therefore, CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, particularly in theories with spin. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. All operators in SMEFT are required to respect CPT symmetry.

In conclusion, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), PoincarÃ© symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected by all operators. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
