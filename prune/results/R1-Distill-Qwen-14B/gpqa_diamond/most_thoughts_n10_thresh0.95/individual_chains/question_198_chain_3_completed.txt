Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants, β1 to β4, are provided as 9, 40, 63, and 16.

Wait, stability constants (β) measure how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So, each β corresponds to a different complex. But wait, what are the complexes here?

I think for Co(II) with thiocyanate, the complexes might be [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where n is the number of SCN- ligands. So, the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(?), and so on up to n=4. Wait, but the β values are given up to β4=16. So four complexes in total?

Wait, wait. Let me recall. For each complex, the stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n SCN- ions. The first complex would be [Co(SCN)]^+ because Co^2+ plus SCN^- would give Co(SCN)^+ with charge 2+ + (-) = +1. So, the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Each β represents the formation from the previous complex. So, β1 is the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-. Then β2 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 from [CoSCN]^+ and another SCN^-, and so on.

Wait, no. Actually, the stability constant βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. Or is it stepwise? Oh right, usually, β is the overall formation constant. So for each complex, [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+-n}, the βn is the equilibrium constant for Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+-n}.

But wait, sometimes the stability constants are given for each step. So, β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc. But in this problem, I'm not sure. Let me read the question again.

The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Hmm, that probably means each β represents the stepwise formation. Like, β1 is the first ligand, β2 the second, etc.

So, the first complex is [CoSCN]^+ with β1=9. The second complex [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would have β2=40, but that's the stepwise. To get the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, you'd multiply β1 * β2. Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^- would have β3=63, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} would have β4=16.

Wait, but wait. The problem might be considering the overall β for each complex. So for [CoSCN]^+ it's β1=9. For [Co(SCN)_2]^0, it's β1*β2 = 9*40=360. For [Co(SCN)_3]^- it's 9*40*63=22680. And [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} would be 9*40*63*16=40320.

Wait, no. Or perhaps each βn is the overall constant for the nth complex. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. I think I need to clarify.

In the case of stepwise formation constants, each βn is the constant for adding the nth ligand. So β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc. Therefore, the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 through βn.

So, for [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), K1=β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), K2=β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

For [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3), K3=9*40*63 = 22680.

For [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (n=4), K4=9*40*63*16=40320.

Wait, but then the β4 is 16, which would be the stepwise for the fourth ligand, so K4 is 9*40*63*16 = 40320. So that's the highest overall stability constant. So the fourth complex is the most stable.

But the question is asking about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be the di-substituted complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So, the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 among all cobalt species.

Wait, but wait. The question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". I'm not entirely sure about the exact complexes and their colors, but the problem specifies it's about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 case.

So, to find the percentage, I need to calculate the mole fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 in the solution.

To find this, I should use the formation constants and the given concentrations of Co and SCN^-.

The general approach is to model each possible complex and calculate their concentrations, then sum them up to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

The problem is that the total concentration of Co is 1e-2 M. So the sum of all Co species (uncomplexed Co^2+ and all complexes) should equal 1e-2 M.

Let me think. Let's denote:

[Co] = [Co^2+] 
[Comp1] = [Co(SCN)]^+ 
[Comp2] = [Co(SCN)_2]^0 
[Comp3] = [Co(SCN)_3]^- 
[Comp4] = [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}

The total cobalt concentration is [Co] + [Comp1] + [Comp2] + [Comp3] + [Comp4] = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

The formation constants are:

K1 = β1 =9 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-])

K2 = β1*β2 =9*40=360= [Co(SCN)_2]^0 / ([Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-])

K3 =9*40*63=22680= [Co(SCN)_3]^- / ([Co(SCN)_2]^0 [SCN^-])

K4=9*40*63*16=40320= [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} / ([Co(SCN)_3]^- [SCN^-])

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, each K corresponds to the overall formation. So K1 is [Comp1]/([Co][SCN]).

Similarly, K2 is [Comp2]/([Co][SCN]^2), and so on. Or no, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the overall formation constants for each complex:

For [Co(SCN)]^+, K1 = β1 =9 = [Comp1]/([Co][SCN])

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0, K2 = β1 * β2 =9*40=360= [Comp2]/([Co][SCN]^2 )

For [Co(SCN)_3]^- , K3= β1*β2*β3= 9*40*63=22680 = [Comp3]/([Co][SCN]^3 )

And for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, K4=9*40*63*16=40320 = [Comp4]/([Co][SCN]^4 )

Wait, but wait. In that case, each formation constant is the overall for that complex. So, for example, [Comp1] = K1 * [Co][SCN]

Similarly, [Comp2] = K2 [Co][SCN]^2

But wait, this approach ignores the stepwise formation, but given the problem states that the stability constants are β1, β2, etc., perhaps each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex. That makes it easier.

So, with that assumption, the formation constants are:

β1 = [Comp1]/([Co][SCN])

β2 = [Comp2]/([Co][SCN]^2 )

β3 = [Comp3]/([Co][SCN]^3 )

β4 = [Comp4]/([Co][SCN]^4 )

Given that, we can express each complex in terms of [Co], [SCN], and the respective β.

But wait, the problem is that the concentrations of SCN^- might affect the distribution of the complexes. The given [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

So, substituting, each [Compn] = βn * [Co] * [SCN]^n.

Wait, but [SCN] is 0.1 M, so [Comp1] = β1 * [Co] * (0.1)^1

[Comp2] = β2 * [Co] * (0.1)^2

[Comp3] = β3 * [Co] * (0.1)^3

[Comp4] = β4 * [Co] * (0.1)^4

But wait, also, the total Co is [Co] + [Comp1] + [Comp2] + [Comp3] + [Comp4] = 1e-2 M.

So, substituting, [Co] * [1 + β1*(0.1) + β2*(0.1)^2 + β3*(0.1)^3 + β4*(0.1)^4 ] = 1e-2.

Wait, that makes sense because [Compn] = βn [Co] (0.1)^n.

So, let me write the equation:

[Co] (1 + β1 * 0.1 + β2 * 0.01 + β3 * 0.001 + β4 * 0.0001 ) = 1e-2

Wait, let me compute each term:

β1=9 → 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2=40 → 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

β3=63 → 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

β4=16 →16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Adding these up: 0.9 + 0.4 = 1.3; 1.3 + 0.063 = 1.363; 1.363 +0.0016=1.3646.

So, 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.

So [Co] * 2.3646 = 1e-2 → [Co] = (1e-2) /2.3646 ≈ 4.223e-3 M.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check the math.

Wait, 1 is from [Co], then each βn * (0.1)^n is the sum of the complexes.

So, the equation is [Co] * [1 + (β1 *0.1) + (β2 *0.1^2) + (β3 *0.1^3) + (β4 *0.1^4)] = 1e-2.

Yes, that's correct.

So, compute the terms:

β1 *0.1 =9 * 0.1 =0.9.

β2 *0.01=40 *0.01 =0.4.

β3 *0.001=63 *0.001=0.063.

β4 *0.0001=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum of these: 0.9 + 0.4 =1.3; +0.063 →1.363; +0.0016 →1.3646.

So total inside the brackets is 1 + 1.3646=2.3646.

So [Co] = 1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 4.223e-3 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

[Comp1] = β1 * [Co] * 0.1 =9 *4.223e-3 *0.1 = 9 *4.223e-4 ≈3.801e-3 M.

[Comp2] = β2 * [Co] * 0.01=40 *4.223e-3 *0.01=40 *4.223e-5≈1.689e-3 M.

[Comp3] =63 *4.223e-3 *0.001 =63 *4.223e-6 ≈2.662e-4 M.

[Comp4] =16 *4.223e-3 *0.0001=16 *4.223e-7 ≈6.757e-6 M.

Let me list all the concentrations:

[Co] ≈4.223e-3 M.

[Comp1]= ~3.801e-3 M.

[Comp2]= ~1.689e-3 M.

[Comp3]= ~2.662e-4 M.

[Comp4]= ~6.757e-6 M.

Now, the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is [Comp2].

So, the total concentration of all Co species is 1e-2 M.

The fraction of [Comp2] is [Comp2] / (total Co).

So, [Comp2] is 1.689e-3, and the total is 1e-2 =0.01.

So, fraction = (1.689e-3) / (1e-2) = 0.1689, or 16.89%.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. So, D is 16.9%, which is close to 16.89%.

So, the answer would be D) 16.9%.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Did I do everything correctly?

Wait, I assumed that each βn is the overall formation constant, so [Compn] = βn [Co][SCN]^n.

But another way, sometimes, the stepwise constants are used. So, in that case, the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of β1 to βn.

But in that case, [Comp1] = β1 [Co][SCN]

[Comp2] = β1 β2 [Co][SCN]^2

[Comp3] = β1 β2 β3 [Co][SCN]^3

[Comp4] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co][SCN]^4

Wait, but in that case, the calculation would be different.

In this scenario, the denominator would be 1 + (β1 * [SCN]) + (β1 β2 [SCN]^2 ) + ... etc.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me recalculate using the stepwise constants.

So, the correct approach for stepwise is that each βn is the stepwise formation, so the overall K for each complex is the product up to that βn.

So, for [Co(SCN)_1]^+, K1=β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0, K2=β1 * β2=9*40=360.

For [Co(SCN)_3]^- , K3=β1 β2 β3=9*40*63=22680.

For [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, K4=9*40*63*16=40320.

So, [Compn] = Kn [Co][SCN]^n.

So, [Comp1] =9 * [Co] * (0.1)^1.

[Comp2]=360 * [Co] * (0.1)^2.

[Comp3]=22680 *[Co] * (0.1)^3.

[Comp4]=40320 *[Co] * (0.1)^4.

Now, the equation becomes:

[Co] * [1 + 9*(0.1) + (9*40)*(0.1)^2 + (9*40*63)*(0.1)^3 + (9*40*63*16)*(0.1)^4 ] =1e-2.

Compute each term:

Term1: 9*0.1 =0.9.

Term2: 9*40 *0.01=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3:9*40*63 *0.001=22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4:9*40*63*16 *0.0001=40320 *0.0001=4.032.

So sum of terms: 0.9 +3.6=4.5; +22.68 →27.18; +4.032 →31.212.

So, denominator is 1 +31.212=32.212.

Thus, [Co] = (1e-2)/32.212 ≈3.104e-4 M.

Now, [Comp2] is 360 * [Co] * (0.1)^2.

Which is 360 *3.104e-4 *0.01=360 *3.104e-6≈1.117e-3 M.

Wait, computing:

360 *3.104e-4 = (360 *3.104) *1e-4 →1117.44 *1e-4 = 1.11744e-2.

Wait, no, wait: [Comp2] = K2 * [Co] * [SCN]^2.

Which is 360 * [Co] * (0.01) =360 * [Co] * 0.01.

Since [Co] is 3.104e-4, 360 *3.104e-4 *0.01 =360 *3.104e-6 =360*3.104 = 1117.44e-6=1.11744e-3 M.

Similarly, [Comp2] is 0.00111744 M.

Total Co concentration is 1e-2 M.

So, the fraction is [Comp2]/(1e-2) = (1.11744e-3) / (1e-2) →0.111744, or 11.17%.

Wait, that's not matching any of the options. So, perhaps I made a mistake in this approach.

Wait, but the options don't have 11%, so maybe I should re-examine.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the complexes are formed stepwise, but [Co] is the free ion, and each complex is built upon the previous.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model each complex as a stepwise formation.

Alternative approach:

Let’s denote [Co] as the free Co^2+ concentration.

Then, [Comp1] = β1 [Co][SCN].

[Comp2] = β2 [Comp1][SCN] = β1 β2 [Co][SCN]^2.

Similarly, [Comp3] = β3 [Comp2][SCN] = β1 β2 β3 [Co][SCN]^3.

[Comp4]=β4 [Comp3][SCN] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co][SCN]^4.

So, the total Co concentration is [Co] + [Comp1] + [Comp2] + [Comp3] + [Comp4] =1e-2 M.

So, substituting:

[Co] (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ) =1e-2.

Given that [SCN] =0.1 M.

So, compute each term:

Compute β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40 *0.01=360 *0.01=3.6.

β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63 *0.001=22680 *0.001=22.68.

β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 *0.0001=40320 *0.0001=4.032.

So, sum of terms: 0.9 +3.6=4.5; +22.68=27.18; +4.032=31.212.

So, total factor is 1 +31.212=32.212.

So, [Co] = (1e-2)/32.212 ≈3.104e-4 M.

Now, [Comp2] is β1 β2 [Co] [SCN]^2 =9*40 *3.104e-4 *0.01.

Calculating:

9*40=360.

360 *3.104e-4 =1.11744e-1.

Multiply by 0.01: 1.11744e-3 M.

So, [Comp2]=1.11744e-3.

The fraction is [Comp2]/(1e-2)= (1.11744e-3)/(0.01) =0.111744 →11.17%. But none of the options match this. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, but the options don't have 11%, so perhaps I made an error.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that each β is stepwise is incorrect, and each β is the overall for the complex. Let's go back.

Earlier, when I treated each βn as the overall for the nth complex, I got [Co] ≈4.223e-3 M, and [Comp2] ≈1.689e-3. Then fraction is 16.89%, which is near option D, 16.9%.

But let me think: if β1 is the overall for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc., then the approach where each [Compn] = βn [Co] [SCN]^n.

So, the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

So, substituting the βs and [SCN]=0.1:

Compute each term:

β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

β2 [SCN]^2 =40 *0.01=0.4.

β3 [SCN]^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

β4 [SCN]^4 =16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum: 0.9 +0.4=1.3; +0.063=1.363; +0.0016=1.3646.

So, denominator is 1 +1.3646=2.3646.

Thus, [Co] =1e-2 /2.3646 =4.223e-3 M.

[Comp2]= β2 [Co] [SCN]^2=40 *4.223e-3 *0.01=40 *4.223e-5 =1.689e-3.

So, fraction is 1.689e-3 /1e-2 =0.1689 →16.89%.

Which is option D:16.9%.

So, the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but why in the stepwise approach, I get 11.17%, which isn't an option, but when considering each βn as the overall constant, I get 16.9%, which is option D.

So, perhaps the given βn are the overall stability constants, not the stepwise, so each βn for [Co(SCN)_n] is the overall K.

In that case, the answer is D.


To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and concentrations ([Co] = 10⁻² M, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). The stability constants represent the overall formation constants for the complexes, where βₙ is the equilibrium constant for the formation of [Co(SCN)ₙ]^(2+-n).

### Key Steps:
1. **Formation of Complexes**:  
   The complexes are [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. Their formation constants are given as β₁, β₂, β₃, and β₄, respectively.

2. **Expression for Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}⁺] + [\text{Co(SCN)₂}⁰] + [\text{Co(SCN)₃}⁻] + [\text{Co(SCN)₄}²⁻] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}.
   \]

3. **Concentration of Each Complex**:  
   Using the overall stability constants, the concentration of each complex can be expressed as:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}ₙ]^{2+-n} = \betaₙ [\text{Co}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n.
   \]

4. **Substitute Known Values**:  
   Substituting [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M and β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16, the total cobalt concentration equation becomes:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}] \left( 1 + \beta₁ [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta₂ [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta₃ [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta₄ [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right) = 10^{-2}.
   \]

5. **Calculate Terms**:  
   Compute each term:  
   - \(\beta₁ [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\),  
   - \(\beta₂ [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4\),  
   - \(\beta₃ [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063\),  
   - \(\beta₄ [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016\).  

   Summing these:  
   \[
   0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646.
   \]

   Adding 1 for the free cobalt ion:  
   \[
   1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.
   \]

6. **Solve for Free Cobalt Concentration**:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}] = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.223 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]

7. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:  
   Using \([\text{Co(SCN)₂}⁰] = \beta₂ [\text{Co}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2\):  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)₂}⁰] = 40 \cdot 4.223 \times 10^{-3} \cdot (0.1)^2 = 1.689 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]

8. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:  
   The percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ is:  
   \[
   \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)₂}⁰]}{[\text{Total Co}]} \times 100 = \frac{1.689 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} \times 100 \approx 16.89\%.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**, corresponding to option D.

**Answer: D**
