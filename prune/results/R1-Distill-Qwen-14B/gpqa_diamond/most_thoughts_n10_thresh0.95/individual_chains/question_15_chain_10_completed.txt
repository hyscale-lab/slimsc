Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet is more likely to transit, Planet 1 or Planet 2. The researchers can only observe one, so they want the one with the higher probability. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Also, their host stars have different masses but the same radius.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. The formula for transit probability is something like R_star being the star's radius, a the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and maybe the planet's size. But in this case, since we're comparing, maybe the planet's size isn't given, but both are Earth-like, so perhaps similar sizes. Let me think.

Wait, transit probability P is roughly (R*/a) * (something?), or maybe it's more about the ratio of the star's size to the semi-major axis. Oh right, the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star))²^(1/2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a), but I'm a bit hazy on the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability depends on the alignment of the orbit. The formula for the probability is (R*) / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since both planets have circular orbits, e is zero. So it simplifies to R*/a. So the probability is proportional to R*/a.

So, the probability is higher when R* is larger and a is smaller. Because R*/a is bigger.

Wait, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, because the problem says both host stars have the same radii. So R* is same for both.

So then, the probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis a. Because a is in the denominator.

Wait, the orbital period is given, so I can relate that to a using Kepler's third law. The period P and the semi-major axis a are related by P² ∝ a³/(M_star), where M_star is the mass of the host star. Since the planets have the same mass, but the stars are different.

Wait, actually, the host stars have different masses. The star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. So M1 = 2*M2.

So for each planet, Kepler's third law says P² = (4π²/G(M_star + planet_mass)) * a³. Since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, we can approximate M_star + planet_mass ≈ M_star.

So for each planet:

P² = (4π²/(G M_star)) a³.

So a³ = (G M_star P²)/(4π²).

Therefore, a is proportional to (M_star * P²)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1: a1 is proportional to (M1 * P1²)^(1/3).

Similarly, a2 is proportional to (M2 * P2²)^(1/3).

Given that P1 is three times shorter than P2: P1 = P2/3.

And M1 = 2 M2.

So substituting:

a1 = (2 M2 * (P2²/9))^(1/3) = (2/9 * M2 * P2²)^(1/3).

a2 = (M2 * P2² )^(1/3).

So the ratio a1/a2 is ( (2/9)/(1) )^(1/3) ) = (2/9)^(1/3).

Wait, 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a1 is smaller.

But the transit probability is R*/a. R* is same for both, so the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So the probability for Planet_1 is (R* / a1) and for Planet_2 (R* / a2). So Planet_1's transit probability is (a2/a1) times Planet_2's.

Since a1 is 0.606 a2, a2/a1 is 1/0.606 ≈1.65. So P1 = 1.65 * P2.

Wait, that would mean Planet_1's probability is higher than Planet_2's by a factor of about 1.65. So they would prefer observing Planet_1.

So looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. That seems correct.

Wait wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the terms. Because a is the semi-major axis, so a1 is smaller than a2. So R*/a1 is larger than R*/a2, meaning higher probability for Planet_1. So yes, the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So the correct option is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on \( a \). Thus, a smaller semi-major axis \( a \) corresponds to a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_*} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star, we relate \( a \) to \( P \) and \( M_* \). For Planet_1, \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \). Substituting these values, the semi-major axis of Planet_1 (\( a_1 \)) is proportional to:

\[
a_1 \propto \left( M_1 \cdot P_1^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left( 2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9} \cdot M_2 \cdot P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_2 (\( a_2 \)):

\[
a_2 \propto \left( M_2 \cdot P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 has a smaller semi-major axis. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1's transit probability is:

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{R_*}{a_1}, \quad P_2 \propto \frac{R_*}{a_2}.
\]

The ratio of the probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.
