Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Also, for the total energy, I think each astronaut's energy contributes, and you add them together.

Wait, but wait, when the problem says "relative speed", are they asking for the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame? Or are they asking for the speed of the system's center of momentum frame? No, I think it's the first part about their relative speed.

So first, calculating the relative speed between them. Let's denote astronaut A as the one with mass 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B as 3m moving at 0.5c. But wait, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed isn't simply 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c because of the relativistic effects.

Right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Oh wait wait, wait. Let me get this right. If astronaut A is moving at u=0.6c in the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at v=0.5c in the same direction, then the relative speed of B as seen by A would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The formula for the velocity of an object as observed from another frame is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But in this case, if A is moving at u = 0.6c, and B is moving at v=0.5c, but in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, no, no. Wait, no, the formula is for when you have two frames moving relative to each other. Let me get this straight. Suppose the lab frame is S, and A is moving at u = 0.6c in S. Then, the speed of B in S is v = 0.5c in the same direction as A. So from A's frame (S'), the speed of B would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c²)).

So substituting the numbers: v is 0.5c, u is 0.6c. So (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. So the numerator is -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates that B is moving in the opposite direction relative to A. But since the question asks for speed, we take the magnitude, so about 0.1428c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c, so that's a possibility.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I should double-check the velocity addition formula. The formula is (v - u)/(1 - (vu/c²)), right? So if both are moving in the same direction, and u is higher than v, then v - u is negative. So the relative speed is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So relative speed is 0.14c.

So that matches options C and D for the relative speed part.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c². So for each, compute their gamma factor and then multiply by their rest mass energy, then add together.

So for astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for A: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy for A: 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

For astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for B: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So energy for B: 1.1547 * 3m c² = approximately 3.464 mc².

Total energy E = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc².

So the correct total energy is about 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

Wait, but let me recalculate the gamma factors to be precise. Let me compute them more accurately.

For A: u=0.6c.

Gamma A: 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Energy A: 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

For B: v=0.5c.

Gamma B: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(4/3) ≈ 1.154700538.

So 1.1547 *3 = 3.4641 mc²
