Hmm, okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: Two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune's mass. The orbits are circular. They used the radial velocity method (RV) to detect them. RV detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble.

So, the key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Wait, but wait. The RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us, right? The amplitude of this velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the size of the orbit. Oh, right, the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) / ( (P * (1 day))^(1/3) * (2π) )

Wait, maybe I should think of it as K being proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, from what I remember, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * P) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) ] / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But since the planets are similar to Neptune and the stars are like the Sun, I can probably approximate M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so the denominator simplifies.

Wait, but in this problem, the two planets have the same mass? The question says both have masses similar to Neptune, so perhaps M1 ≈ M2. So M_planet is the same for both.

So K ∝ (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, but wait, the formula I think is K = (v) is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, let me get the correct formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) ] / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But with e=0 and M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G/(2π c))^(1/3) * M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

Wait, but perhaps another approach. The RV method relates the velocity semi-amplitude K with the orbital period P, the mass of the planet, and the mass of the star. The formula I think is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / c )

Wait, maybe I should just think about the proportionality. Since both stars have the same mass (same as Sun), and the planets have similar masses, sin i is probably similar (assuming both are edge-on, but that's an assumption; but since the problem gives data, perhaps it's same for both).

So K ∝ M_planet / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, no. Wait, the formula from memory is K = (v) is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, let's get it right. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )^(1/ (3 * P)) )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let's write the formula properly.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

But since both planets have the same M_p and same M_*, and same inclination (assuming sin i is same for both, perhaps edge-on), then K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

So, K1 and K2 are the velocities for planet 1 and 2.

We have K1 = 5 milliangstroms, K2=7.

So K2/K1 = 7/5.

But since K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then:

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3), so K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Wait, let me double-check. If K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then K = A / P^(1/3), where A is a constant.

So for planet 1, K1 = A / P1^(1/3)
For planet 2, K2 = A / P2^(1/3)

So K2/K1 = (A / P2^(1/3)) / (A / P1^(1/3)) ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

So (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

We want to find P2/P1. Let me denote x = P2/P1.

So, (7/5) = (1/x)^(1/3)

Take both sides to the power of 3:

(7/5)^3 = 1/x

So x = 1 / ( (7/5)^3 ) = (5/7)^3

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute (7/5)^3 = 343 / 125 ≈ 2.744

So 1/x = 2.744, so x = 1/2.744 ≈ 0.364.

But wait, that's P1/P2 = 343/125 → (P1/P2) = (7^3)/(5^3) → then P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but the question is asking, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So P2 = x * P1, where x is P2/P1.

So if x is ≈ 0.364, then P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter than that of planet 1.

But wait, the options given are:

A) ~0.36
B) ~1.40
C) ~1.96
D) ~0.85

So the correct answer would be 0.36 times? So option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think
