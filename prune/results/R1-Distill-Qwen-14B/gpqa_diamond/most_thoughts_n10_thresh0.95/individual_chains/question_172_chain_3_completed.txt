Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation states of atoms depend on temperature. Oh right, this relates to the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. So the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state (or another lower state) is higher in star_1. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

Wait, the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The ratio of populations is given by (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Oh wait, actually, if the energy difference is ΔE, then the factor is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So the higher the temperature, the less suppression there is, meaning more excited atoms.

In this case, n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let's call n1 and n2 the ratios for star_1 and star_2 respectively. So n1 = 2 * n2. 

So the equation from Boltzmann is n_upper/n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for star_1: n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2: n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

But wait, the question says that star_1's iron is twice as excited as star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2. So substituting, we get 2 * n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) and n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

If I take the ratio n1/n2, that equals 2. So:

n1/n2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me calculate that exponent correctly. The exponents are: numerator is -ΔE/(k T1), denominator is -ΔE/(k T2), so when you divide exponents, you subtract. So:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

So the ratio n1/n2 is equal to this exponent. And we know n1/n2 is 2.

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, because the exponent is [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 ), so when I take ln, it becomes that. Let me rearrange the terms.

Wait, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is the same as -(1/T1 - 1/T2). So ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (- (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which can be written as ln(2) = - [ΔE/(k)] (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Hmm, let's see. But wait, the term inside the exponent was ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1). So the equation is:

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ] ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Alternatively, we can factor this as [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] multiplied by the other factors. Let me manipulate the equation.

Let me factor 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ). Because:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So substituting that into the equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k ) * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Wait, that's:

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So if I rearrange, maybe I can express this in terms of T1 and T2.

But in the given options, I don't see any that look exactly like this. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ln(2) = T2 / T1 → Doesn't seem right.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) → Hmm, that's (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) = (1/T2 + 1/T1 )

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2 → No, denominator would be squared, seems off.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) → Which is exactly the (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) term.

Wait, but the equation I have is ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But looking at the options, none of them have the ΔE/k term. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of n_upper/n_lower between the two stars.

So for star 1: n1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
Star 2: n2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Given that n1 = 2 n2, so 2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] ) / exp( [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is same as 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

So taking ln:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (ΔE) [ (1/(k T2)) - (1/(k T1)) ]

But in terms of the temperatures, how else can I write this? Let's factor out 1/(k):

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

Which is same as:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But wait, this is the same as earlier. So, if I write this as:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ] * (ΔE / k )

But none of the options have ΔE or k, so perhaps the question assumes that ΔE/(k) is a constant, but perhaps in the options, they are trying to write the equation without the ΔE/k term.

Alternatively, perhaps I should isolate the (T1 - T2) term.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange the equation:

(T1 - T2) = [ ln(2) * k ] / (ΔE) ) * (T1 T2 )

But I don't see any options with k or ΔE, which suggests I'm perhaps missing a step.

Wait, another approach: since the question is about the effective temperatures, perhaps I should express the ratio of their excitation. So the ratio is 2 = n1 /n2.

Which is 2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

So:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

Wait, but in the options, the correct equation would have ln(2) equal to (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by some constant. But in the options, the other terms (ΔE/k) aren't present. So perhaps the equation in the options is not including that term, perhaps they have assumed ΔE/k is a constant, but in the options, it's not present. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing the knowledge that the ratio of the excitation is proportional to exp( (T1 - T2)/(something) ), but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider T1 and T2 as the temperatures. Let me think of the ratio of the populations.

Suppose that the excitation ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1 = 2 n2.

But from Boltzmann, each n is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

So n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So n1/n2 = exp( [ΔE/(k) ] ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Which equals 2.

So:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

Multiply both sides by (T1 T2)/ΔE:

ln(2) * (T1 T2) / ΔE = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) * (T1 T2) / ΔE = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But again, I'm not seeing a direct match to the options.

Wait, perhaps if I take the reciprocal of both sides:

(1/ ln(2)) * ΔE/(T1 T2) ) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the Saha equation or another relation, but I think Saha is more about ionization, not excitation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is written as (n_upper/n_lower) being proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So star_1 has higher excitation, so T1 is higher than T2, because higher temperatures mean less suppression of the exponent.

Wait, if T1 is higher than T2, then 1/T2 is bigger than 1/T1, so (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive. Then, ln(2) equals a positive number multiplied by (ΔE/k). So that makes sense.

But the options don't include ΔE or k. So perhaps the equation in the options is abstracted, assuming the constants are incorporated.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) times (ΔE/k). But since the options don't have that, perhaps the question is not considering the ΔE/k term. Or perhaps ΔE/(k) is a constant, but I don't think that's the case. Hmm.

Wait the problem statement says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute ΔE/(k):

Boltzmann's constant k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, so ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K ) ) = 1 K.

Ah! So ΔE/k = 1 K. That's a nice simplification.

So then, ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 -1/T1 )

Since ΔE/k is 1 K, it's:

ln(2) = 1 * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, that's because:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So substituting, ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, that's option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the correct equation for the effective temperatures of two stars, \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The excitation ratio of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The relationship between excitation and temperature is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
n_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad n_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Given \( n_1 = 2 n_2 \), the ratio can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Notably, \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \) because \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Substituting this simplification, the equation reduces to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are inconsistent with the derived relationship:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it does not account for the difference in temperatures or the proportionality factor.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it introduces an additive term in the denominator, which is not supported by the derivation.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it includes a squared term in the denominator, which is not derived from the Boltzmann equation.
- **Option D**: Correct, as it matches the derived relationship \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \).

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is given by option D.

Answer: D
