Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. And I need to find the energy of the RHIC that gives this speed. The options are given, so I can figure it out.

Wait, first, I should figure out what nucleus X is. Oh, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A would be protons + neutrons. So Li has 3 protons normally, so 3 +3 =6, so it's Li-6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

Now, I remember that the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m0c².

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma.

Let me calculate v squared over c squared: (0.96c)^2 / c² = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.28 times 3.5714 is 1. Hmm, 1/0.28 is equal to 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857. So gamma is about 3.5714286.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m0c². The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately the sum of its protons and neutrons. Wait, but actually, the atomic mass is usually given in atomic mass units (u), and each u is about 1.6605e-27 kg. Alternatively, the mass can be found using the periodic table.

Li-6 has an atomic mass of about 6.940926 amu, I think. Wait, let me double-check. The standard atomic weight for Li-6 is about 6.94 amu, but maybe I should get the exact value from the periodic table. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the exact value, but for the sake of this problem, maybe it's given as m0c².

Wait, perhaps I can compute it using the mass of the nucleus. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.940926 atomic mass units. So the rest energy would be
