Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem says: Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

When looking at the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and we can assume the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two states based on their energies and the temperature. The formula is something like:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Since the problem mentions the transition wavelength, I think I can find the energy difference between the two levels using the relation E = hc/λ. Oh wait, because E2 - E1 = hc/λ, since photons are emitted when an electron drops from higher to lower energy.

So first, I should calculate the energy difference between the two levels. Let's see, the wavelength given is 1448 Å, which is 1448 x 10^-10 meters. But wait, I know that hc is a constant. Let me calculate E = hc/λ.

The value of hc is approximately 12400 eV·Å. So E = 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.56 eV (because 12400 divided by 1448 is roughly 8.56). Wait, let me compute that again. 1448 x 8 is about 11584, and 1448 x 8.5 is 12308. So 12400-12308 is 92, so 8.5 + 92/1448. 92 divided by 1448 is approximately 0.0636. So E ≈ 8.5636 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. The energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc/λ, correct? So E = hc/λ. So that gives the energy in eV. Hmm.

But wait, the Boltzmann factor uses E in terms of k*T. Since k is Boltzmann's constant in eV/K terms. I remember that k ≈ 8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K. So to find (E2 - E1)/(k*T), I can compute (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * T).

Wait, but wait. Let me be precise. Let's compute that factor for both the normal Teff and the spotted Teff.

So when the star has no spots, Teff is 6000 K. When it has spots, Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but wait—no, wait. The effective temperature when the star has 40% of its surface covered by spots is given as 5500 K. So the overall photospheric temperature is lower when spots are present.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) is lower.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

So first, let's find the ratio in both cases. The Boltzmann equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - ΔE / (k*T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same in both cases, because the transition is between levels in the same ion, so g2/g1 remains a constant. Therefore, the ratio of n2/n1 depends on exp( - ΔE/(k T) ), and since ΔE is the same in both cases (since the transition wavelength is fixed), the ratio will depend inversely on T.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: the ratio is proportional to exp ( -ΔE/(k T) ), so when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller. Which would imply that when the temperature is lower, the ratio n2/n1 is lower. So when the star has spots, the photosphere is cooler, so the ratio n2/n1 is lower. Which aligns with the problem statement: the ratio observed decreases when the star has spots.

So the ratio (n2/n1) without spots is higher than when there are spots. The question is asking for the factor by which it changes. So that would be (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_spots.

So the factor F is:

F = [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) ]

Because g2/g1 is the same in numerator and denominator, it cancels out. So F becomes exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) ) )

Wait, let me check that. Because the denominator has T2 (when there are spots, T is 5500 K). So let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, T1 is 6000 K (no spots), T2 is 5500 K (spots).

So 1/T1 is 1/6000, 1/T2 is 1/5500.

So 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) = -500 / 33e6 = approx -0.00001515.

Wait, but wait, ΔE is positive, right? Because E2 is higher than E1, so ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. So when substituting, the exponent becomes:

ΔE/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) )

Wait, but wait, this is (1/6000) - (1/5500) which is negative, because 5500 is less than 6000. So 1/5500 is bigger than 1/6000. So (1/6000 - 1/5500) is negative.

Wait, but in F, the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) ), which is (ΔE/(k)) * ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) ) = (ΔE/(k)) * ( - (5500 - 6000)/(6000 *5500) )) ).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the difference as 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2). So (5500 - 6000) = -500. So 1/T1 -1/T2 = (-500)/(6000 *5500) ) = -500/(33,000,000) ) ≈ -0.00001515 per K? Wait, no, the unit would be 1/K.

Wait, but let's compute this accurately.

ΔE is 8.56 eV.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/(k) = 8.56 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ let's compute this.

8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.56 * (1 / 0.00008617 ) ≈ 8.56 * (11603.6) ≈ approximately 8.56 * 11600 ≈ 8.56 * 10,000 is 85,600, and 8.56 * 1,600 is about 13,696. So 85,600 + 13,696 = 99,296. Let me check with a calculator approach:

8.56 / 0.00008617 = 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.56 * (10^5 / 8.617) ≈ 8.56 * 10^5 / 8.617.

Wait, 8.56 /8.617 ≈ approximately 0.993.

So 0.993 * 1e5 ≈ 99,300. Let's say about 99,300 K.

Wait, because 8.56 / 8.617 is approximately 0.993, so 99,300 K. So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99,300 K.

Then, (1/T1 - 1/T2) is (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000) / (6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -500 / 3.3e7 = -1.515e-5 per K.

So now, multiply ΔE/(k) by (1/T1 -1/T2):

99,300 K * (-1.515e-5 1/K) ) ≈ 99,300 * (-0.00001515) ≈ let's compute that.

99,300 * 0.00001515 = 99,300 * 1.515e-5.

Let me compute 1.515e-5 * 1e5 is 1.515, so 99,300 = 99.3 * 1e3. So 99.3e3 * 1.515e-5 = 99.3 * 1.515e-2.

Wait, 99.3 * 1.515e-2 = 99.3 * 0.01515.

Hmm, 100 * 0.01515 is 1.515, so 99.3 is 0.7 less than 100. So 1.515 - (0.7 * 0.01515) = 1.515 - 0.0106 ≈ 1.5044.

Wait, but since the multiplier is negative, because (1/T1 -1/T2) is negative, the overall exponent is negative.

So the exponent is approximately -1.5044.

So F = exp(-1.5044) ≈ what is that?

I know that exp(-1.6) is about 0.2019, and exp(-1.5) is about 0.2231. So 1.5044 is close to 1.5, so exp(-1.5044) is approximately 0.221.

Wait, wait, perhaps more accurately:

Let me calculate 1.5044.

At x=1.5044,

exp(-1.5044) ≈ 1 / exp(1.5044).

We know that exp(1.5) is approximately 4.4817. But 1.5044 is just a bit more than 1.5. Let's compute exp(1.5044) ≈ 4.4817 * exp(0.0044) ≈ 4.4817 * (1 + 0.0044) ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0044 ≈ approx 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.0044) ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0197 ≈ 4.4914.

So exp(1.5044) ≈ 4.4914. So 1/4.4914 ≈ 0.2226.

Wait, but let me just use a calculator approach for more precision. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed with the exact calculation.

So, F = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 -1/T2) ) = exp( (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) K )

= exp( (8.56 / 8.617e-5) * ( (5500 - 6000) ) / (6000 * 5500) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the term inside the exponential step by step.

Compute the exponent:

ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / 8.617e-5 eV/K = 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99,300 K.

Then, (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 * 5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) ≈ -1.515e-5 1/K.

Multiplying these together: 99,300 K * (-1.515e-5 1/K) ) = 99,300 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ let's compute 99,300 * 1.515e-5.

99,300 * 1.515e-5 = (99,300) * (0.00001515) ) = let's compute 99,300 * 1.515e-5.

Well, 1e5 is 100,000, so 99,300 is about 0.993e5. So 0.993e5 * 1.515e-5 = 0.993 * 1.515 ≈ 1.5044.

But since the product of K and 1/K is dimensionless, the result is 1.5044, but with a negative sign because of the (1/6000 -1/5500) being negative.

So the exponent is -1.5044.

So F = exp(-1.5044) ≈ 0.2217.

So the factor F is approximately 0.2217.

Wait, but wait. The factor F is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = exp( (ΔE/k)*(1/T1 -1/T2) ).

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, the exponent is (ΔE/(k T)) for each case, so for no spots: exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for spots: exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). So the ratio F is [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))]/[exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) ), because:

exp(-a)/exp(-b) = exp(b -a) = exp( (b -a) ) = exp( (1/T2 - 1/T1) * ΔE/(k) )

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me double-check.

(n2/n1)_no_spots = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

(n2/n1)_spots = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio F is [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

Which is the same as exp( ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )) )

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So in the previous calculation, I might have made a miscalculation in the sign.

Wait, I think I messed up the sign earlier. Let me recompute.

So 1/T2 is 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818.

1/T1 is 1/6000 ≈ 0.0001667.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive.

So the exponent is [ΔE/(k)] * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (0.0000151 1/K) )

So (8.56 / 8.617e-5 ) ≈ 99,300 K.

Multiply by 0.0000151 (which is 1.51e-5) gives:

99,300 * 1.51e-5 ≈ 99,300 * 0.0000151.

Let me compute that:

99,300 * 0.0000151 = 99,300 * 1.51e-5.

Let me compute 99,300 * 1.51e-5 = (approx) 99,300 * 0.0000151.

Compute 100,000 * 0.0000151 = 1.51. So 99,300 is 99.3% of that, so 1.51 * 0.993 ≈ approx 1.50.

So the exponent is about 1.50.

So F = exp(1.50) ≈ 4.4817.

Wait, that's a big difference. So the factor is about 4.48, which is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but earlier I thought I had a negative exponent, which gave me F around 0.22, which is 1/4.5.

Wait, that's where I went wrong. I think I mixed up the terms in the exponent.

Wait, let me recap. The ratio we're looking for is F = (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Which is [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] )

Which is positive because (1/T2 > 1/T1).

So the exponent is positive, so F is exp( positive number ), leading to a factor greater than 1.

So with T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K, the exponent becomes positive, so F is about 4.5.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5. So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The ratio of populations depends on the exponential term, which is sensitive to temperature changes.

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is determined from the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\) using the relation:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light. Substituting \(hc \approx 12400 \, \text{eV·Å}\) and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\), we find:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{12400}{1448} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The Boltzmann constant is \(k \approx 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). The effective temperatures of the star are \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spots). The ratio of the populations in the two energy levels is proportional to:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,300 \, \text{K},
\]

and

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99,300 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.50.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\exp(1.50) \approx 4.48.
\]

This means the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times larger when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots.
