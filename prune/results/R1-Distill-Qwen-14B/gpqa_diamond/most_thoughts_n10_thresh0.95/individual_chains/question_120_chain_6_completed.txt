Okay, so I have this question about stars' distribution in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

So, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Uniformly distributed in the entire universe? Or just in a certain volume? I think it probably means that stars are spread out uniformly in space, so the number density is constant. So, the same number of stars in each region of space, regardless of where you look.

Parallax, plx, is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So, a star with a parallax of 1 arcsec is 1 parsec away, which is nearby. A parallax of 0.5 means 2 parsecs, and so on.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (Δplx) changes with plx. So, we're looking for the relationship N(Δplx) as a function of plx.

Wait, the number of stars per unit parallax range... So, for a given parallax value 'p', how many stars have parallaxes between p and p + Δp?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density is constant. Let me think about how distance relates to parallax. Since distance d = 1 / plx, a change in distance Δd relates to a change in parallax. But wait, how does the distribution in parallax translate to the number of stars?

Let me think in terms of volumes. The number of stars in a certain volume is proportional to the volume. So, if I have a range of parallaxes, I'm looking at a range of distances. But how does the volume change with distance?

Volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness Δd is approximately 4πd² Δd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell's volume is (4/3)π(d+Δd)^3 - (4/3)πd^3 ≈ 4πd² Δd, when Δd is small compared to d.

So, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4πd² Δd, multiplied by the number density (n), which is the same everywhere. So, N_shell = n * 4πd² Δd.

But we're interested in the number of stars per unit parallax range. Since plx p = 1/d, d = 1/p. Let's substitute d in terms of p.

So, N_shell = n * 4π (1/p)^2 Δd.

But Δd is related to Δp. Because d = 1/p, so Δd = (Δp)/(p²). Because the derivative of d with respect to p is -d², so the change in d is approximately (Δp) * (-d²) )= (Δp) * (1/p²). So, Δd ≈ (1/p²) Δp.

Substituting Δd into N_shell:

N_shell ≈ n * 4π (1/p²) * (Δp / p²).

Wait, wait, let me make that substitution correctly. So, N_shell = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (Δd) 

But Δd = (Δp)/(p²) because d = 1/p → Δd ≈ -(1/p²) Δp. The negative sign here just indicates the direction, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, we'll take the absolute value. So, Δd ≈ (Δp)/(p²).

Putting it all together:

N_shell ≈ n * 4π (1/p²) * (Δp / p²) ) = n * 4π (Δp) / p^4.

Wait, so N_shell is proportional to 1/p^4 times Δp. So, the number of stars per unit parallax range (i.e., per Δp) is proportional to 1/p^4 multiplied by Δp. Wait, no, because N_shell is the number in the range Δp. So, the number per unit Δp is N_shell/(Δp) = (n 4π) (1/p^4) * (Δp) ) / Δp → (n 4π) (1/p^4) ).

Wait, no, maybe I got the setup wrong. Let me think again.

The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, for a given Δplx, how many stars lie in that range. The number density is n (constant), and the volume depends on the distance. So, if I have a range in plx from p to p + Δp, what is the corresponding distance range?

Wait, parallax is p = 1/d. So, when plx increases by Δp, the distance changes by Δd. So, for a thin shell at distance d, the volume is 4πd² dd. So, the number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dd.

But I want the number per unit plx. So, the question is, for a small Δp, how many stars are there? So, N = n * 4πd² dd. Since dd is the distance change corresponding to Δp.

Wait, since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. So, the differential distance dd is related to the differential plx dp as dd = (1/p²) dp. Wait, but plx is p, and dp is the change in plx. So, since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So, the absolute value is |dd| = (1/p²) dp.

So, substituting into N:

N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp.

Because d is 1/p, so d squared is (1/p)^2, and the distance shell's volume is 4πd² dd = 4π (1/p²) (1/p²) dp), since dd = (1/p²) dp.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me go step by step.

N = n * (volume of shell) = n * 4π d² (Δd)

But Δd is the change in distance corresponding to Δp. Since p = 1/d, so dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dp.

So, |Δd| = d² |Δp|.

But since d=1/p, d² = 1/p². So, |Δd| = (1/p²) |Δp|.

So, substituting back into N:

N = n * 4π (d)^2 * (d^2 |Δp| )

= n * 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) |Δp|

= n * 4π |Δp| / p^4.

So, the number of stars per unit range of plx is N/(Δp) )= (n 4π ) / p^4.

Wait, no, because N is the number in the range Δp, so to find the number per unit Δp, we divide by Δp. So, the number per unit Δp is N/Δp = (n 4π) / p^4.

So, the number of stars per unit parallax range (Δp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait. The question is phrased as: "how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?" So, the number per unit plx (i.e., per 1 unit of plx) is proportional to 1 / plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the correct answer should be A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought that in distance, the number of stars in a shell increases with d², so for parallax, which is inverse of d, the number would decrease with p^4.

Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the setup. Let me think of another approach.

If the number density of stars is constant, then the number of stars between plx p and p + Δp is proportional to the volume between distances d=1/p and d=1/(p+Δp). But wait, for small Δp, this is roughly the volume of a thin spherical shell at d=1/p with thickness Δd.

So, the volume is 4πd² Δd.

Now, Δd is the change in d when p changes by Δp. Since d = 1/p, Δd = - (1/p²) Δp.

So, the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * (Δp / p²).

Which is 4π Δp / p^4.

So, number of stars is number density times volume: n * 4π Δp / p^4.

Thus, the number of stars per unit Δp is (n 4π ) / p^4. So, the number per unit plx range is ~1/p^4.

So the correct answer would be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax and distance, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space. 

### Key Concepts:
1. **Parallax and Distance**: Parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( d = \frac{1}{p} \).
2. **Volume of a Spherical Shell**: The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( \Delta d \) is approximately \( 4\pi d^2 \Delta d \).
3. **Number of Stars in a Shell**: Since the number density of stars is constant, the number of stars in a shell is proportional to its volume. Thus, \( N_{\text{shell}} \propto 4\pi d^2 \Delta d \).

### Derivation:
1. **Relating \( \Delta d \) to \( \Delta p \)**: Using \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), the change in distance \( \Delta d \) corresponding to a change in parallax \( \Delta p \) is:
   \[
   \Delta d = \frac{\Delta p}{p^2}.
   \]
2. **Substitute \( d \) and \( \Delta d \) into the Volume**: The volume of the shell becomes:
   \[
   \text{Volume} \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{\Delta p}{p^2} = \frac{4\pi \Delta p}{p^4}.
   \]
3. **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax Range**: The number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( \Delta p \)) is proportional to the volume:
   \[
   N_{\text{stars per unit plx}} \propto \frac{1}{p^4}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases with \( p \) as \( \sim \frac{1}{p^4} \). This corresponds to **Option A**.
