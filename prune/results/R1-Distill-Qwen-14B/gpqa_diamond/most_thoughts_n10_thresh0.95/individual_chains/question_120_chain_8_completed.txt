Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Oh, uniform distribution, so the number of stars depends on the volume of space they occupy. But wait, when we're talking about parallax, it's about how spread out the stars are in terms of their distance from us.

I think parallax (p) is measured in parsecs, and distance (d) is p = 1/d. So the distance to a star is the reciprocal of its parallax. Right, so if a star has a parallax of 1 parsec, it's 1 parsec away. If parallax is 0.5 parsec, it's 2 parsecs away.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So, the number density in terms of parallax. Let's consider how the number of stars depends on the volume when you're looking out into space.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a certain volume is proportional to the volume. So, let's imagine a thin spherical shell at a distance d from the Earth. The thickness of this shell would be a small change in distance, say dd. The volume of this shell would be the surface area of a sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness dd. So, the volume element is 4πd² dd.

But wait, since parallax p is 1/d, we can express d as 1/p. So substituting d = 1/p, we get d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp. Hmm, because p is decreasing as d increases. But when we're considering small changes, the negative sign just indicates the direction of change, but for the purposes of counting stars, we probably take the magnitude.

So, the volume element in terms of p would be 4π (1/p²)² * (-1/p² dp). Wait, let me think again. Let's compute d in terms of p.

Since p = 1/d → d = 1/(p). So, dd = derivative of 1/p with respect to p → dd = -1/p² dp. The negative just shows that when p increases, d decreases, but the volume element should be positive, so I'll take the absolute value. So, the shell's volume in terms of p is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) ), because dd is 1/p² dp (absolute value). Wait, wait, let me re-express this.

The volume of the shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. Since d = 1/p, then d² = 1/p², and dd = ( -1/p² ) dp. But since we're considering dp as a positive change in parallax, and since in reality, as p increases, d decreases, which means that the shell's thickness is for a small increase in p. So, perhaps I should express the volume in terms of p.

Let me write the volume element as a function of p:

dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p²) * ( -1/p² dp )

But because we're looking for the number of stars, which is positive, we can take the absolute value, so:

dV = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when p increases, the number of stars should decrease. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the volume element is a function of how much parallax changes. Let's see: for a given range in parallax, say from p to p + dp, how much volume does that correspond to?

Because as p increases, the distance d decreases, so each shell at higher p is closer, but the thickness in terms of distance is smaller. But when we talk about the number of stars per unit change in p, we're looking at how many stars are in the range of parallaxes from p to p+dp.

So, the number of stars in that range would be proportional to the volume between p and p+dp, but wait, actually in terms of d, it's the volume between d and d+dd, where d=1/p, and dd is the change in d.

So, the volume element in terms of d is 4π d² dd. But to express this in terms of p, since dd = - (1/p²) dp, we can substitute:

dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p² dp) → so, the volume is 4π (1/p^4) dp, but since dp is a small positive change, and the volume can't be negative, the absolute value is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but that would mean the number of stars in a thin shell with parallax from p to p+dp would be proportional to (1/p^4) dp. But then, the number of stars per unit range of p (i.e., per dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. But that's option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought in terms of flux or something else, but no. Let me think again.

Wait, the total number of stars with parallax between p and p + dp is proportional to dV. So, dN = n * dV, where n is the number density of stars (stars per unit volume). But the question says the distribution is uniform, so n is constant. So, dN = n * dV.

We found that dV is 4π (1/p^4) dp. So, dN = 4π n (1/p^4) dp. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) would be proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit range of parallax (like per 0.1 parsec of parallax) would decrease as 1/p^4.

Wait, but that seems really steep. Let's think about it in another way. Let's say we have a certain volume in space. The number of stars in that volume is proportional to the volume. So, if you're looking at a range of parallaxes from p to p + delta_p, what's the corresponding distance range?

Distance d = 1/p. So, the distance range from d to d + delta_d, where delta_d = (1/p²) delta_p.

Wait, because d = 1/p → delta_d = -1/p² delta_p. Taking absolute values, delta_d = (1/p²) delta_p.

So, the volume of the shell is 4π d² delta_d = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p² delta_p) ) = 4π (1/p^4) delta_p.

So, the number of stars in that shell is proportional to this volume. So, the number of stars per delta_p is proportional to 1/p^4. So, the answer would be option A.

But wait, I've heard before that the number of stars per unit distance (in parsecs) decreases with distance squared. But wait, that's in terms of distance, not parallax.

Wait, let's think about how the number of stars per unit distance (d) changes. If you have two shells at distances d and d+dd, the volume of each shell is 4π d² dd. So, the number of stars in each shell is proportional to d² dd. So, the number per unit distance (dd) is proportional to d². But since d = 1/p, this becomes (1/p)^2 = 1/p².

So, in terms of distance, the number of stars per unit distance decreases as 1/d². But in terms of parallax, since d = 1/p, the number of stars per unit change in p would be proportional to 1/p^4, because as p increases (distance decreases), the volume decreases by 1/p^4.

Wait, but why the discrepancy? Because when you change variables from d to p, the dependencies change.

So, when you have a uniform distribution in space, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to d². So, per unit distance, it's d². But when you express this in terms of parallax, you have to change variables.

Let me think mathematically. Let N(p) be the number of stars with parallax less than p. So, the number of stars in the range p to p + dp is dN = N(p+dp) - N(p).

The total number of stars up to parallax p is equivalent to all stars within a distance 1/p. So, the volume up to distance 1/p is (4/3) π (1/p)^3.

So, N(p) = k * (4/3) π (1/p)^3 ), where k is the number density (stars per volume). So, dN = derivative of N with respect to p times dp.

dN/dp = derivative of [k (4/3) π (1/p^3) ] with respect to p.

Which is k (4/3) π * (-3) (1/p^4) ) = -k 4 π (1/p^4).

But since dN is positive, we take the absolute, so the number of stars per unit change in p is proportional to 1/p^4.

So, option A is 1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm now a bit confused because I thought the answer would be 1/p^3. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Let me calculate dN, the number of stars per unit change in parallax (dp).

dN = N(p + dp) - N(p) = k [ (4/3) π ( (1/(p+dp) )^3 ) - (1/p)^3 ) ]

Assuming that dp is very small, we can approximate 1/(p + dp) ≈ (1/p) (1 - dp/p ). So,

(1/(p+dp))^3 ≈ (1/p^3) (1 - 3 dp/p )

So,

dN ≈ k (4/3 π) [ (1/p^3)(1 - 3 dp/p ) - 1/p^3 ) ] 

= k (4/3 π) [ (1/p^3 - 3 (dp/p^4 ) - 1/p^3 ) ]

= k (4/3 π) (-3 dp / p^4 )

= -4 π k (dp / p^4 )

So, dN = | -4 π k (dp / p^4 ) | = 4 π k (dp / p^4 )

Therefore, the number of stars in a small range dp is proportional to 1/p^4. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, I remember in some contexts, like when considering how many stars are in a certain direction, the number per unit area is a factor, but the question is about per unit range of parallax.

Wait, another way to think: the number of stars per unit parallax interval (dp) is proportional to the volume per unit p. And that volume, as we found, is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit parallax is ~ 1/p^4.

So the correct option is A) ~ 1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). The question assumes a uniform distribution of stars in space, meaning the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

Consider a thin spherical shell at a distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \). The volume of this shell is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Since \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of \( p \) as \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) into the volume formula, the volume element becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume \( dV \), so the number of stars per unit range of \( p \) (i.e., per \( dp \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).

To confirm, we can also consider the total number of stars \( N(p) \) with parallax less than \( p \), which corresponds to all stars within a distance \( \frac{1}{p} \). The volume up to this distance is \( \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^3 \), so:

\[
N(p) \propto \frac{1}{p^3}.
\]

The number of stars in the range \( p \) to \( p + dp \) is the derivative of \( N(p) \) with respect to \( p \):

\[
\frac{dN}{dp} \propto -\frac{3}{p^4}.
\]

Taking the absolute value, the number of stars per unit range of \( p \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \), making the correct answer:

**Answer: A**
