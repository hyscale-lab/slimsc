Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains, and each branch has different steps. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches contribute to the overall neutrino emission. I think the pp-III branch is the dominant one, producing a lot of the high-energy neutrinos.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the Sun through the process where protons fuse, and one of the byproducts is a positron and a neutrino. So each of these branches produces neutrinos, but I'm not sure which branch emits which energy range.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, they want the ratio flux1/flux2.

If the pp-III branch stops, what happens? I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos. Let me recall: the pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, maybe around 50 keV or so? And pp-III produces higher energy ones, like around 1 MeV or more. So if the pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrino flux would drop.

Wait, but the neutrinos detected on Earth are from various sources in the Sun. The main neutrinos come from the pp-III branch, which produces the 8-B neutrinos. The cross-section for the neutrino interactions depends on their energy. Higher energy neutrinos have higher cross-sections for detection, but in this case, the production is what's stopping.

So, before the pp-III stopped, the flux in higher energy bands (like 800-900 keV) would be primarily from pp-III. If pp-III stops, then any neutrinos in that band would be missing. But wait, other branches like pp-I and pp-II might still contribute, but perhaps at lower energies.

Wait, the pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos. So, band 1 is 700-800 keV. If pp-III was stopped, would this band be affected? Or is it that band 2 (800-900) comes from pp-III, and band 1 might be from another source.

Wait, but the question states that all other reactions remain as they were. So only the pp-III branch stopped. All other reactions, including pp-I and pp-II, continue.

So, neutrinos from pp-I and pp-II are still being produced. Let me think about their energy distributions.

The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos. I think the neutrinos from pp-I have energies around a few tens of keV, maybe up to 100 keV or so. The pp-II branch produces a bit higher, perhaps up to a few hundred keV, but I'm not certain. The pp-III branch is the main contributor to the 8-B neutrinos, which have energies of about 1-2 MeV. So, in the bands given (700-800 and 800-900 keV), the pp-III neutrinos would fall into the 800-900 keV band, since 1 MeV is 1000 keV, so 800-900 is part of the pp-III energy range.

Wait, no: 1 MeV is 1000 keV, so 800-900 is just below that. So maybe some of the pp-III neutrinos are in that higher band. Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos' energies from the pp-III branch are higher than 800 keV, so they would be in band 2.

If pp-III stopped, then the production of neutrinos in band 2 (800-900) would drop. But what about band 1 (700-800)? Are there any neutrinos from other branches in that range?

The pp-I and pp-II branches produce lower-energy neutrinos. For example, the neutrinos from the pp-I branch (like the pep reaction) are around 20-30 keV. The pp-II branch produces higher, up to maybe 100 keV. So, the 700-800 keV band might not have significant contributions from pp-I or pp-II. Alternatively, perhaps the main neutrino sources in that range are from the pp-III branch, but I might be getting that wrong.

Wait, no. The pp-III branch produces a lot of neutrinos around 800 keV or more. So if pp-III stops, then band 2, which is 800-900, would have a much lower flux because the main source is gone. What about band 1 (700-800)? Are there any significant sources contributing there?

Alternatively, maybe the pp-I and pp-II don't contribute much to that band. So, if pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 drops, but band 1 remains as it was. Wait, no. Because if pp-III is stopped, but the other branches continue, but their neutrinos are lower in energy, then the only neutrinos in band 1 would be from other sources, but perhaps their contribution is negligible.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the neutrino spectrum. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the 8-B neutrinos, which have energies around 1.5 MeV. So, their energies are above 800 keV. So, if the pp-III branch stops, the 8-B neutrinos stop, which are in band 2. But what about other neutrinos?

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of band 1 to band 2.

If the pp-III neutrinos are in band 2, and all other neutrinos are below 800 keV (like pp-I and pp-II), then band 2 would have almost no neutrinos left after the pp-III stops. So, the flux in band 2 would drop to near zero, while band 1's flux would remain as it was before (assuming that it wasn't significantly affected by pp-III).

Wait, but in reality, the pp-I and pp-II branches might contribute a little to the 700-800 keV band. For example, maybe some of their neutrinos are in that range. So, if the pp-III stops, the only neutrinos in band 2 would be any from pp-I or pp-II that happen to have energies in that range. But I think those are minimal.

Alternatively, if the majority of neutrinos in band 1 are from pp-III, but that's unlikely because pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again: when the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos are affected?

The 8-B neutrinos come from the pp-III branch. They have energies around 1.5 MeV (1500 keV). So, the band 2 (800-900 keV) would have a significant contribution from the 8-B neutrinos. If pp-III stops, then the flux in band 2 would drop dramatically because the main source is gone.

Band 1 is 700-800 keV. Are there any neutrinos in that range? Well, other branches might produce some neutrinos in that energy. For example, the pp-I and pp-II branches may produce lower-energy neutrinos but perhaps some might have higher energies. Alternatively, maybe the question is such that the other branches don't contribute much to band 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-I and pp-II branches are lower in energy, so their flux in band 1 is negligible. So, without the pp-III, band 1's flux is from other sources, but maybe not much. Or perhaps the main source in band 1 is from the pp-III branch, but that's not correct because pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about the neutrino energy distribution. The dominant solar neutrinos (the 8-B type) have energies around 1.5 MeV. So, they fall into band 2 (800-900 keV is 0.8-0.9 MeV; 1.5 MeV is higher than that. So, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me confirm: 1 MeV is 1000 keV. So, band 2 is 800-900 keV (0.8–0.9 MeV). The 8-B neutrinos are around 1.5 MeV, so they are in a higher band, not band 2.

Wait, maybe I confused the bands. So, if the 8-B neutrinos are around 1.5 MeV, then they are in a band above 900 keV, perhaps in a band higher than band 2.

Wait, the bands given are 700-800 (band 1) and 800-900 (band 2). So, band 2 is up to 900 keV. So, the 8-B neutrinos (1.5 MeV) are in a higher band, say 1.5-2 MeV, which is beyond band 2.

But wait, the question is about the flux in bands 1 and 2. So, if pp-III stops, which neutrinos are affected?

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. The pp-III branch produces the 8-B neutrinos, which have energies around 1.5 MeV, so they would be in a higher band beyond 900 keV. So, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would be from other sources. What are those?

The other sources would be the pp-I and pp-II branches. The pp-I neutrinos (from the pep reaction) are lower energy, around 20 keV. The pp-II neutrinos are higher, perhaps up to a few hundred keV. So, in the 700-800 keV range (band 1), perhaps the pp-II branch contributes a little, and the same for band 2 (800-900 keV). But the main contributor to band 2 would be from the pp-II branch.

If the pp-III branch stops, the neutrinos from pp-III (which are in higher energy bands) are gone, but the lower-energy bands are still getting contributions from pp-I and pp-II. Therefore, the flux in band 1 (700-800) is from the pp-II branch, and band 2 is also from pp-II, but perhaps at higher energies.

Wait, but the pp-II neutrinos have a higher energy than pp-I but lower than pp-III. So, perhaps they have a spectrum that includes up to several hundred keV. So, maybe the majority of their neutrinos are in lower bands than band 2.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the neutrino flux from each branch.

The dominant neutrino production in the Sun is from the pp-III branch, which contributes about 86% of the total neutrino flux. The pp-I contributes about 14%, and pp-II is negligible. Wait, is that correct? Or is it that the pp-I contributes about 14% of the total luminosity but produces lower-energy neutrinos, while pp-III contributes most of the neutrinos.

Wait, the total number of neutrinos emitted by the Sun is dominated by the pp-III branch, because it's the most common reaction. The pp-III branch emits neutrinos in the 1-2 MeV range, so their flux is in higher energy bands. The pp-I and pp-II contribute fewer neutrinos but in lower energy ranges.

So, for band 1 (700-800 keV), are there any neutrinos from the pp-II branch? If the pp-II neutrinos have energies up to, say, 800 keV, then they would contribute to band 1. But maybe the main contributors to band 2 (800-900 keV) are the same pp-II neutrinos with higher energies.

Wait, but if the pp-III is stopped, then the only neutrinos in band 2 would come from the pp-II, but if the pp-II's neutrinos don't reach 800 keV, then band 2's flux would drop.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-II neutrinos do have some in the 800 keV range, but their numbers are much lower than the pp-III neutrinos. So, if pp-III stops, the main source for band 2 is gone, but the pp-II neutrinos are still present, but in much smaller numbers.

Wait, maybe the flux in band 1 is mainly from pp-II, and band 2 is from pp-III. So, if pp-III stops, band 2's flux drops, but band 1's flux remains as before.

But then, the ratio (flux1/flux2) would be high. For instance, if band 2's flux drops to almost zero, the ratio could be very large. But the options don't have a very large number beyond option A, which is 10.

Wait, the options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

If the pp-III branch is stopped, and band 2's flux was mainly from pp-III, then with pp-III stopped, band 2's flux would drop, while band 1's flux remains. So the ratio would be band1/band2 = (unchanged)/(drastically reduced) = a large number. So, the ratio would be much larger than 1. So, could it be 10?

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio after the pp-III branch stopped. So, before the stop, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) was higher than band 1 because more neutrinos were from pp-III. After stopping, band 2's flux drops, while band 1's remains (assuming it's from pp-II or other branches). So, the ratio would be higher, but perhaps not extremely high.

Alternatively, maybe the neutrinos from the pp-III are the only ones in band 2, so their flux in band 2 was dominant, and the other bands have much lower flux. So, when pp-III stops, band 2's flux becomes almost zero, making the ratio (band1 / band2) go to infinity, which isn't an option. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, another possibility: the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have a continuous spectrum. So, part of their emission would fall into band 1 and band 2. But if pp-III stops, then both bands would lose their contribution from pp-III. But if the other branches don't contribute much to either band, then the flux in both bands would drop, but perhaps in a different way.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio. So, perhaps the flux in band 1 is due to pp-III and other sources, and the flux in band 2 is due to pp-III and others. When pp-III stops, the flux in both bands is reduced, but the relative reduction is different.

Wait, but if the majority of neutrinos in both bands are from pp-III, then stopping it would cause both fluxes to drop, but perhaps the ratio remains similar. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have a higher energy than both bands, so their contribution is to higher energy bands beyond 900 keV. So, in that case, the flux in band 2 (800-900) is from other sources, like the pp-II. If pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would be the same as before, but the higher bands would drop. But the question is about bands 1 and 2, so this would mean that the ratio would stay the same.

Wait, but that can't be the case because the question says that pp-III stopped, so the flux in higher bands (like above 900 keV) would drop. But bands 1 and 2 would be unaffected, assuming the pp-III doesn't contribute to them. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos in band 1 (700-800) are from the pp-II branch, and band 2 are from pp-III. So, if pp-III stops, then band 2's flux drops, but band 1's remains. So, the ratio flux1/flux2 would increase because flux2 decreases.

If before the stop, band 2 had much higher flux, the ratio would be low. But after the stop, band 2's flux is low or zero, so the ratio would be high.

But let's think about the actual numbers. Let's say the pp-III neutrinos make up 90% of the flux in band 2 (800-900), and 10% from pp-II. So, when pp-III stops, band 2's flux drops to 10% of its original. Meanwhile, band 1 (700-800) was 50% from pp-II and 50% from pp-III (assuming some pp-III neutrinos fall into band 1). Wait, but if pp-III neutrinos are higher in energy, maybe their contribution to band 1 is minimal. So, if pp-III was contributing 10% to band 1, then after stopping, band 1's flux drops to 90% of original, while band 2's drops to 10% of original.

So, the ratio flux1/flux2 would be (0.9 flux1_original) / (0.1 flux2_original) = 9 (flux1_original/flux2_original) * (0.9/0.1) = [assuming original ratio is X] X *9. But I don't know the original ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the original ratio is 1, meaning flux1_original = flux2_original before pp-III stopped. But that's unlikely because pp-III produces higher energy neutrinos, so more would fall into band 2. So, original flux2_original is higher than flux1_original.

Wait, but if pp-III neutrinos are above 900 keV, then band 2 (800-900) wouldn't have much from pp-III.

Ah, maybe I misunderstood the energy ranges. Let me clarify: the 8-B neutrinos (pp-III) have energies around 1.5 MeV, which is 1500 keV. So, they are in a higher band than band 2 (800-900 keV). So, the 8-B neutrinos don't contribute to bands 1 and 2, but to a higher band beyond 900.

Wait, that changes things. So, the bands 1 and 2 (up to 900 keV) are from pp-I and pp-II. The pp-III neutrinos are in higher bands (above 900 keV).

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the higher bands (like 900-1000 keV) would lose their flux, but bands 1 and 2 would remain the same. Because the question is about the ratio of bands 1 and 2, which are both below 900, their fluxes wouldn't be affected by the pp-III stopping.

Wait, but that can't be right because the question says that the pp-III stopped, and the ratio changes. So, perhaps some of the neutrinos from pp-III do fall into bands 1 and 2?

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch has a spectrum that includes some lower energies. Let me think about the neutrino energy distribution from pp-III.

The pp-III branch produces 8-B neutrinos with a spectrum peaking around 1.5 MeV, but there's a spread. Some of them might have energies below 800 keV, though perhaps not many. So, if pp-III stops, the flux in bands 1 and 2 would decrease.

So, let's say that without the pp-III, the neutrinos in bands 1 and 2 only come from pp-I and pp-II.

In that case, what's the flux ratio between band 1 and 2 from pp-I and pp-II?

The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos (like 20 keV), so their contribution to bands 1 and 2 is minimal. The pp-II branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps up to 800 keV or so.

Wait, if pp-II's neutrinos have energies up to 800 keV, then band 1 (700-800) would get more neutrinos from pp-II than band 2 (800-900), which would have none from pp-II. But that's not possible because pp-II's maximum is 800.

Alternatively, maybe pp-II's neutrinos have a distribution that extends into band 2. For example, some of them might have energies just a bit above 800, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-II neutrinos have a tail that extends into band 2, so their flux in band 2 is non-zero.

But if the pp-III stops, the only neutrinos in bands 1 and 2 would be from pp-I and pp-II. But pp-I contributes almost nothing (low energy), and pp-II contributes more to lower energies.

So, let's assume that without pp-III, bands 1 and 2's flux is from pp-II and pp-I, with pp-II being the main contributor.

So, pp-II's neutrinos have a spectrum that peaks around, say, 500 keV, but with a tail extending to higher energies. So, the flux in band 1 (700-800) would be lower than in band 2 (800-900), but wait, that doesn't make sense because higher energy is beyond the peak.

Alternatively, let's model it as a simple distribution. Suppose that the pp-II neutrinos have a distribution where the number of neutrinos decreases with energy. So, more neutrinos are at lower energies, fewer at higher.

So, in band 1 (700-800 keV), the pp-II neutrinos are present, but in lower numbers than at lower energies. Band 2 (800-900) would have even fewer. So, the flux in band 1 is higher than in band 2.

But then, the ratio flux1/flux2 would be greater than 1.

Wait, but this is getting too speculative. Maybe I should think about the fact that the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stops. So, if the pp-III neutrinos contributed to band 2, then stopping it would reduce band 2's flux much more than band 1's.

But earlier confusion arises about whether pp-III neutrinos are in bands 1 or 2.

Wait, the 8-B neutrinos are around 1.5 MeV, so they are in a higher band than 900 keV. So, the bands 1 and 2 (up to 900 keV) are not affected by the pp-III stopping. Therefore, the flux in bands 1 and 2 remains the same.

But that can't be right because the question is asking about a ratio change. So, maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, another angle: if the pp-III branch stops, the neutrinos from that branch are no longer produced. Those neutrinos are in higher energy bands, so bands 1 and 2 are not affected. So, the ratio of fluxes in bands 1 and 2 would stay the same as before.

But the question says, what is the approximate ratio after the pp-III stops. So, if the ratio was 1 before, it remains 1. But I'm not sure.

But the question's options include C)1, which would be the case if the ratio doesn't change. But why would the ratio change?

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III branch also contribute to band 2. If so, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2. But if the pp-III neutrinos don't fall into bands 1 and 2, then the ratio remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from pp-III have a lower energy than 1.5 MeV, including into band 2. So, when pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would drop, but band 1's flux is from other sources.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely sure about the energy ranges.

Let me think differently. The question says the pp-III branch stopped. The pp-III is the main source of high-energy neutrinos. So, the flux of high-energy neutrinos (above, say, 500 keV) would drop. So, in band 2 (800-900 keV), which is a higher energy, the flux would drop more than in band 1 (700-800). So, the ratio flux1/flux2 would increase.

Suppose originally, the flux in band 2 was twice that of band 1 (flux2 = 2 * flux1). After pp-III stops, band 2's flux drops to zero (since pp-III was its main source), while band 1's flux is still from other sources, say, 10% (if some pp-III neutrinos were in band 1 but others were in band 2). Wait, but if pp-III neutrinos are in higher bands, band 1's flux isn't affected.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from pp-III have a spectrum that includes part of band 1 and all of band 2. So, when pp-III stops, both bands lose some flux.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to think about the solar neutrino spectrum.

I remember that the solar neutrino spectrum peaks around 0.5 MeV (500 keV) with a long tail extending to higher energies. So, the majority of neutrinos are below 1 MeV. The 8-B neutrinos are around 1.5 MeV, so they are in a higher band. Therefore, the flux in bands 1 and 2 (up to 900 keV) would be from the lower-energy neutrinos.

So, if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos beyond 900 keV are affected, but bands 1 and 2 are not. So, the flux in bands 1 and 2 remains the same. Hence, the ratio remains the same as before, perhaps around 1.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute a small part to band 2. So, their stopping would cause band 2's flux to drop slightly, but band 1's flux remains. So, the ratio would increase a bit.

But the options don't have a number higher than 10, and the only option higher than 1 is A)10.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from pp-III contribute more to band 2 than I thought. So, when it stops, band 2's flux drops, making the ratio higher.

But without knowing the exact numbers, I'll have to make an educated guess.

If the pp-III stopped, the high-energy neutrinos stop, so the flux in band 2 (which includes higher energies) drops more than band 1. So, the ratio flux1/flux2 increases. So, if before the stop, the ratio was 1 (flux1=flux2), after the stop, flux2 drops, making the ratio larger than 1.

But the options don't have a higher value than 10. So, I'm thinking that option A)10 is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band 2 is much larger than band 1 before the stop. So, the ratio is originally much less than 1. When pp-III stops, band 2's flux drops, making the ratio flux1/flux2 increase.

But without knowing the original ratio, it's hard to say. But according to some quick research in my mind, the majority of the solar neutrino flux is in the lower energy bands. So, band 1 and 2 would have significant flux, but without the pp-III, the flux in higher bands beyond 900 keV drops.

Wait, but in the question, band 2 is 800-900 keV. The 8-B neutrinos are at 1.5 MeV, so beyond band 2. So, the flux in band 2 is from pp-II, and the flux in band 1 is also from pp-II.

Wait, would the pp-II neutrinos have enough energy to reach 800 keV? I think the pp-II neutrinos have a maximum energy around 800 keV. So, in that case, the pp-II neutrinos would fall into band 1 (700-800) and maybe a small part into band 2 (800-900).

Wait, if the pp-II neutrinos have a distribution where some are in band 1 and some in band 2, then if pp-III stops, the flux from the pp-II remains. So, in that case, the ratio would not change much, possibly remaining around 1. So, the answer would be C)1.

But I'm not sure. Another angle: the neutrino flux from the sun is dominated by the pp-III branch in terms of number. So, stopping it would reduce the overall neutrino flux. But for the given bands, if the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy bands, then the flux in bands 1 and 2 comes from the pp-I and pp-II, which are not affected. So, the ratio remains the same.

Wait, but the question says to find the ratio after the pp-III stops. So, before the stop, the flux in band 2 (800-900) would be from pp-II and pp-III. But since pp-III is stopped, band 2's flux drops, while band 1's may not drop as much.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos contribute to band 2, their stopping would reduce the flux in band 2. So, the ratio would increase.

So, for example, if before the stop, the flux in band 2 was 90% from pp-III and 10% from pp-II, and band 1 was 50% from pp-II and 50% from pp-III. After the stop, band 2's flux is 10% of the original (from pp-II), and band 1's is 50% (from pp-II). So, the ratio is (0.5)/(0.1) =5. But 5 isn't an option. The closest option is A)10.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes more to band 2 than to band 1. So, the ratio increases more.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band 2 is dominated by pp-III, while band 1 is from other sources. So, the ratio after stopping would be much higher.

But without knowing the exact percentages, it's hard. But given the options, the most plausible answer is A)10, because the ratio would increase because band 2's flux drops more than band 1's.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if the pp-III neutrinos are in higher bands, then bands 1 and 2 are only affected by pp-I and pp-II. Therefore, their fluxes wouldn't change, so the ratio remains the same.

But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is C)1, meaning the ratio remains the same. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, considering that the pp-III branch is stopped, but the other branches continue. The neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in higher energy bands, so their stopping doesn't affect the flux in bands 1 and 2. Therefore, the ratio between bands 1 and 2 remains the same as before. So, if before the ratio was 1, it remains 1. Therefore, the answer is C)1.

I think that's the correct reasoning. Because the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy bands beyond 900 keV, the flux in bands 1 and 2 is unaffected by their stopping. So, their ratio remains the same.


The question involves analyzing the impact of the sudden cessation of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core on the neutrino flux in two energy bands: 700–800 keV (band 1) and 800–900 keV (band 2). The pp-III branch is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, specifically the 8-B neutrinos, which have energies around 1.5 MeV (1500 keV). These neutrinos are in a higher energy band beyond 900 keV, so they do not contribute to bands 1 and 2. Therefore, the flux in bands 1 and 2 is dominated by neutrinos from the pp-I and pp-II branches, which produce lower-energy neutrinos.

The pp-I branch produces very low-energy neutrinos (around 20–30 keV), while the pp-II branch produces neutrinos with energies up to several hundred keV. These neutrinos contribute to bands 1 and 2, but their fluxes are not significantly affected by the cessation of the pp-III branch. Since the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy bands, their stopping does not alter the flux in bands 1 and 2. As a result, the ratio of the flux between bands 1 and 2 remains unchanged.

Given this reasoning, the ratio of the flux in band 1 to band 2 remains approximately 1, as the flux in both bands is unaffected by the cessation of the pp-III branch.
