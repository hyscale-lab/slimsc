Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. So first, let's understand what's happening here. When you dilute a weak acid like acetic acid, its concentration decreases, which affects its pH. Then, when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, you neutralize the acid and form the conjugate base. 

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Let me compute the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution.

Dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/(V1 + V2). Wait, no, actually, when you add volumes, the total volume is V1 + V2. So the initial moles of acetic acid are M1*V1. After dilution, the new concentration is (M1*V1) / (V1 + V2).

So initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. Then, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration, M2, is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So after dilution, the acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So let's calculate how much NaOH is needed.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, you've added 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question asks about two points: 25% titration and equivalence. So 25% titration would be when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

Wait, no. Wait, the 25% titration is when 25% of the required volume of NaOH has been added. Wait, no — the question says '25% titration' which I think refers to the point where 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized. Alternatively, sometimes '25% titration' refers to the point where 25% of the solution has been titrated. Hmm. Let me think.

But in this case, since the problem states it's a titration, I think it refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence has been added. Wait, no, I think another approach. Since the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted. So 25% titration would mean that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of moles. Let me calculate the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration.

At equivalence, we need 10 cm³ of NaOH. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added, we've neutralized 25% of the acetic acid.

Ok, so first, let's compute the pH at 25% titration. So how much acetic acid remains, and how much acetate is formed.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 moles. At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So moles reacted: 0.00025. Remaining acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume at this point is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a mixture of weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.736.

So pH = 4.736 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Let me calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.736 -0.477 ≈ 4.259, which is approximately 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. So that's a possible match.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because sometimes I might have messed up the moles.

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Diluted to 0.04 L: 0.025 M. So that's correct.

At 25% titration, volume of NaOH is 2.5 cm³. So moles NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So moles reacted are 0.00025.

Thus, remaining HA is 0.00075, and A- is 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Ratio [A-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(0.333) ≈ 4.736 - 0.477 ≈ 4.259, which is 4.26.

So the first pH is 4.26. Looking at the options, option A and D have 4.26 and 4.57 as the first value.

Wait, but let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium is a spectator ion, the solution's pH depends on the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

So the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point is: moles of acetate is 0.001 moles, and the total volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The Kb is very small, so we can approximate the hydrolysis as:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) where C is the concentration of acetate.

So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02 as the second value. Hmm. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

Square root is 1.04e-5, so OH- is 1.04e-5. pOH is about 4.98 → pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

But looking at the options, the equivalence point pH is either 6.73, 7.00, 8.52, or 6.92.

Wait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait a second. The NaOH is 0.1 M, and the equivalence point volume is 10 cm³. So the total solution volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³. The acetate concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. That's correct.

But wait, when you mix NaOH (a strong base) with a weak acid, the equivalence point solution is a solution of the conjugate base. So the solution should be basic, but according to my calculation, it's pH around 9.02. But none of the options have that.

Wait, let me recheck the question. Oh! Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. Moles of acetic acid: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Correct.

Then, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point requires 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So total volume is 40 +10 = 50 cm³.

So the acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, wait. Oh! Wait, no. Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Correct.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6? Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

The square root of 1.081e-11 is approximately 1.04e-5 (since (1e-5)^2 is 1e-10, 3e-6 would be 9e-12, but 1.08e-11 is 1.08 *1e-11, so sqrt is about 1.04e-5.5? Wait, wait, 1e-5 is 1e-5, and (3.29e-6)^2 is about 1.08e-11. Oh wait, 3.29e-6 squared is 1.08e-11, right? Because 3.29^2 is about 10.8, and 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. So 3.29e-6 squared is 1.08e-11. So [OH^-] is 3.29e-6 M. So pOH is -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.48. So pH is 14 -5.48 =8.52.

Ah! I see where I went wrong. I must have miscalculated the square root earlier. Let me correct that.

So, [OH^-] is sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288e-6) is log(3.288) + log(1e-6) → 0.5168 -6 → -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832.

pH is 14 -5.4832 = 8.5168, which is approximately 8.52.

So the equivalence pH is about 8.52. So looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. That matches.

So the first pH (25% titration) is 4.26, equivalence is 8.52. So option A.

Wait, but let me double-check this. Because another possibility is considering the dilution and the initial pH before titration. But the question is about the titration points, so the calculations above are correct.

Wait, but what about the initial pH after dilution?

Wait, let's compute it just for thoroughness. The initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

The dissociation of acetic acid is: CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So the initial concentration is 0.025 M.

Using the approximation: [H+] ≈ sqrt(Ka * C) = sqrt(1.85e-5 * 0.025) = sqrt(4.625e-7) ≈ 6.8e-4 M. pH ≈ 3.17.

Wait, that's interesting. So the initial pH is around 3.17, which is option B's first value. But the question is about during the titration, not the initial solution.

So the initial pH isn't needed for the question. The first pH after 25% titration is 4.26, equivalence is 8.52. So option A.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes when titrating a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is in the basic region. So the pH would be higher than 7. So option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, which matches.

So the answer should be option A: 4.26 and 8.52.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After the reaction:
- Remaining moles of acetic acid (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}\)):

\[
0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

- Moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed:

\[
0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume at this point is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.736\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.736 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.736 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.259 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume at the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion undergoes hydrolysis:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
