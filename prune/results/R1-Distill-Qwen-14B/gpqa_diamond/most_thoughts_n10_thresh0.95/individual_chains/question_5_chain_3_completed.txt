Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm. I remember that for angular momentum in quantum mechanics, the operator components are related to the Pauli matrices. So, maybe the operator P here is a spin-1/2 operator since the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

Wait, the muon is a spin-1/2 particle, right? So the operator P must be the spin operator. So P is similar to the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Now, the operator for a direction n is given by the vector (n_x, n_y, n_z), and the spin operator in that direction would be P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. So the eigenvalue equation would be (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the y-component n_y is zero. So the operator simplifies to P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but how do I find the eigenvector? Let's think about the general approach. For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along any direction. The normalized eigenvectors can be found by solving the eigenvalue equation.

But maybe there's a smarter way. I remember that for a spin-1/2 particle in the direction (θ, φ), the spin-up state can be written in terms of the spherical harmonics or the eigenvectors of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. So that means the angle θ from the z-axis is in the x-z plane, which implies that the azimuthal angle φ is either 0 or π/2 or something? Wait, the x-z plane is the plane where y=0, so φ is zero or π? Let me think, in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle φ is measured from the x-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ is 0 or π. So direction n can be parameterized as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since φ is 0 or π, we can write n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) when φ=0, or (-sinθ, 0, cosθ) when φ=π. But since eigenvectors are defined up to a phase, maybe it doesn't matter.

Wait, but the problem says n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the eigenvector should depend on θ and φ as appropriate. Oh wait, but since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle φ is 0 or π, but in that case, n can be represented with φ=0, so the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the spin operator along this direction is P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So the eigenvalue equation is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me write down the matrices for each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So when the operator is P·n, which is P_x n_x + P_z n_z, because n_y is zero.

So substituting the matrices, P·n = (ħ/2) [n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Which simplifies to (ħ/2) [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix form is:

(ħ/2) * [n_z   n_x
          n_x  -n_z ]

The eigenvalues for this matrix should be ±ħ/2, as expected for spin-1/2.

We're interested in the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So setting up the equation (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0.

Where I is the identity matrix. So:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ] times the vector [a, b]^T equals zero.

Wait, no. The matrix becomes:

( (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] ) - ( ħ/2 I ) )

Which is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

So setting each element times (1/ħ/2) gives the matrix:

[ n_z -1   n_x
   n_x   -n_z -1 ]

Multiplying by the vector [a, b]^T gives zero.

So the equations are:

( n_z -1 ) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + ( -n_z - 1 ) b = 0

Hmm, let me write these as:

(1) (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
(2) n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

I can solve these equations for a and b.

From equation (1):

( n_z -1 ) a = -n_x b
=> a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

But wait, n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so n_x² + n_z² =1.

Let me express n_z as cosθ and n_x as sinθ, since in the x-z plane, the polar angle θ would be measured from the z-axis. So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting, equation (1) becomes:

( cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b = 0

So a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Simplify denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) = -2 sin²(theta/2 )

Numerator: - sinθ = -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So a = [ (-2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) / ( -2 sin²(theta/2) ) ) ] b

Simplify:

a = [ (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] b

=> a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b = cot(theta/2) b

So a = cot(theta/2) b.

So the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2). So the eigenvector can be written as [a, b]^T = [ cot(theta/2) b, b ]^T.

We can choose b=1 for simplicity, but we need to normalize the vector.

Wait, another approach: let's choose b as a parameter, then a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So the vector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are these the components, or are they spin-up components? Hmm.

Wait, another way: I can take the ratio a/b = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ].

Which with n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ,

a/b = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ]

Which, as I did earlier, simplifies to cot(theta/2).

So the components are proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But let's compute the normalization condition.

The vector is [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2) b, b ]

So the norm squared is a² + b² = [ cot²(theta/2) + 1 ] b² = csc²(theta/2) * b².

So to normalize, we set b² / sin²(theta/2) = 1, so b = sin(theta/2).

Then a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait, that's the same as the eigenstate for spin-up in the z-direction when theta is zero, which makes sense because when theta is zero, n is along z, and the eigenvector is [1,0]^T. Hmm, but that's the case when n is along z, θ=0, so cos(theta/2)=1, sin(theta/2)=0, so the vector is [1,0], which is correct.

Wait, but for a general direction in the x-z plane, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait, let me check when theta is 90 degrees. If theta is 90 degrees, then n is (1,0,0) in the x-z plane, but wait no: if theta is 90 degrees from z, then n is along x. Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, theta is measured from the z-axis. So when theta=90, n is in the x-direction.

Wait, so in that case, the eigenvector would be [ cos(45), sin(45) ] = [√2/2, √2/2 ].

Which makes sense for spin-up along x: the eigenstates are (|↑x) and |↓x), which are (|0> + |1>)/√2 and (|0> - |1>)/√2, respectively.

So yeah, that seems correct.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but that seems more like the spherical harmonics for l=1, m=0 or something, but this is for spin-1/2.

Option D involves sqrt terms and more, but I think I've derived it without any sqrt, just cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Wait a second, but wait, the operator P is given as a vector with components P_x, P_y, P_z, each being (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix. So the eigenvalue equation is (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

But wait, in our case, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y = 0. So the operator is n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Hmm, but in the above derivation, I didn't consider any phase factors. Wait, another thing: the eigenvectors for spin-1/2 along a direction (theta, phi) are given by:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |1>

|-> = sin(theta/2) |0> - e^{i phi} cos(theta/2) |1>

Wait, that's the standard expression. But in the case where the direction is in the x-z plane (phi=0 or pi?), so for phi=0, the eigenvector would be cos(theta/2) |0> + sin(theta/2) |1> for spin-up.

Wait, that's exactly what I found earlier, except without the e^{i phi} factor because phi is zero.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Looking back at the options, option C matches this.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So that's our answer.

But wait, looking again at the problem statement. The operator P is given with components P_x, P_y, P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but when I compute the eigenvector, I don't see any ħ dependence in the components. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, and the eigenvector doesn't carry ħ, it's a dimensionless vector.

So the options that have ħ in them (like option A and D) probably include the components in a way that isn't correct, because eigenstates are dimensionless.

Wait, option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ) — that can't be right, as those are vectors with ħ, which doesn't make sense for a state vector. So that's probably incorrect.

Option D: sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2). Again, ħ in the components is wrong. So this option is incorrect.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)). Hmm, that's the form for a spherical harmonic, but for spin-1/2, the components have theta/2, not theta. So this is probably wrong.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that matches what I derived.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

where $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane, parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ simplifies to:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.
\]

Substituting the given matrix forms for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the matrix representation of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is then:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) | \psi \rangle = 0,
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, the eigenvalue equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z - 1 & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
\]

Solving these equations, the ratio of the components $a$ and $b$ is found to be:

\[
\frac{a}{b} = \cot(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ is incorrect because the eigenvector components should be dimensionless, and this option includes $\hbar$.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is incorrect because the components depend on $\theta$ and $\phi$ in a form inconsistent with spin-1/2 eigenstates.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived eigenvector exactly.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ is incorrect because it includes $\hbar$ and introduces unnecessary coefficients.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
