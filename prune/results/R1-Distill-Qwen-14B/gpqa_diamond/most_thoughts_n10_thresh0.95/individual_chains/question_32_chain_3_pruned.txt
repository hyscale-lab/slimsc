Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, the nucleus is given as X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium atom has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = mass number 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Now, the question is about relativistic energy. Oh right, when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics; we need to use special relativity. The energy in relativity isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

The formula for total energy (E) of a particle is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (m*c²). Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Let me compute gamma. v = 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². Then, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Taking the square root of that gives sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yeah, so 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c², where m is the rest mass. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u), because each nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1u, and Li-6 has 6 nucleons. So m = 6 u.

Wait, but what's the conversion from atomic mass units to GeV/c²? I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². Because 1 u = 1.6605×10^-27 kg, and E=mc², so 1 u * c² ≈ 1.4924×10^-10 J. Then converting to eV: 1 J is 6.242×10^18 eV, so 1.4924e-10 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 931.5 MeV. So 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c². Therefore, 6 u is 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is 5.589 GeV.

Then, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by rest energy. Gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.589. Let's do it step by step.

3 * 5.589 is 16.767. 0.5714 *5.589 is approximately let's see: 0.5 *5.589 is 2.7945, 0.0714 *5.589≈0.4009. So 2.7945 + 0.4009 ≈ 3.1954. Adding that to 16.767 gives 16.767 +3.1954=19.9624 GeV.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should compute more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

3.5714 *5.589:

Let me compute 3 * 5.589 = 16.767

0.5714 *5.589:

Compute 5.589 * 0.5 = 2.7945

5.589 *0.0714: let's see, 5.589 *0.07=0.39123; 5.589 *0.0014≈0.007825. So 0.39123 +0.007825≈0.39905.

So 0.5714 *5.589=2.7945 +0.39905 ≈3.19355.

So total E = 16.767 + 3.19355 ≈19.96055 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option C (20.132 GeV), and perhaps another option. Let me check the options again.

Options provided:
A) 18.475 GeV
B) 23.069 GeV
C) 20.132 GeV
D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, 19.96 is close to 20 GeV, but the options don't have exactly that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me recalculate gamma.

v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps I should use more precise calculations. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 10/2.8 = 100/28 = 25/7 = approximately 3.57142857.

So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass is not exactly 6 u. Let me think. The mass of Li-6 is actually a bit less than 6 u because of the binding energy. Oh, right! That's a detail I missed. Because in reality, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons due to the mass defect (binding energy). So using 6u would overestimate the mass, and thus the rest energy would be lower.

But wait, the problem states "X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons," which is Li-6. The exact mass might be important here. Let me find the exact mass of Li-6.

I think the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 u. Because the standard atomic weight is about 6.941 g/mol, but for the nucleus, considering it's a single atom, the mass is 6.013 u approximately.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. For example, Carbon-12 has a mass of exactly 12 u because it's used as a standard. But for other isotopes, the mass can be slightly different.

Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.013 u. Let me look that up as a fact,
