--- Full Content ---
Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Okay, the question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, the reaction forms acetate ions and water. The equivalence point would be when all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

First, I think I should calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So initially, before dilution, the volume is 20 cm³ and concentration is 0.05 M. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Let me calculate the new concentration.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let me compute that: 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, for the titration. The NaOH is 0.1 M. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity * Volume = 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). Wait, wait, wait: wait, wait. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. Oh right, because 1 cm³ is 0.001 L. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. Then after adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L.

So moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.05 M (original) * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Because 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

So for equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point is when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Now, I'll need to compute the pH at two points: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Starting with the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. Since it's a 1:1 reaction, moles of acetic acid will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of acetate will be 0.00025 moles.

The total volume at this point is the initial diluted volume plus the NaOH added. Initial volume was 40 cm³ (0.04 L), and NaOH added is 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L). So total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L. Let's compute that: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[Acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The pH is equal to pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = let me compute that.

Wait, log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328, approximately 4.73.

So pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.4771.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.253. Approximately 4.25.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 0.00025 / 0.0425 is 0.005882. 0.00075 /0.0425 is 0.017647. So ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

Yes, that's correct. So the log is approx -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is about 4.25. So looking at the options, the first pH is around 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52; option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the concentrations. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial moles after dilution are 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 25% of that is 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. So acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Acetate is 0.00025 mol. Correct.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L. So concentrations are 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M, and 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. Correct.

So Henderson-Hasselbalch gives pH = 4.73 + log (0.005882 / 0.017647) → wait, wait, wait. Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). So [A-] is 0.005882, [HA] is 0.017647.

So [A-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

So log(0.3333) is -0.477. So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 → about 4.25.

So first pH is approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option A's first pH is 4.26, which is very close. Option D's first pH is 4.57, which is higher.

So perhaps the first part is option A or D.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. Since NaOH is a strong base, the solution will have excess OH- ions because the acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH-.

So, the solution at equivalence point will consist of sodium acetate in solution. Sodium ions are spectators, so we can ignore them. The acetate ions will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be calculated using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

But wait, alternatively, since the solution is a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the pH will be basic. So we can compute the pH by finding the concentration of OH-.

First, calculate the concentration of acetate at equivalence point.

At equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have been converted to acetate. The total volume is initial diluted volume plus the volume of NaOH added at equivalence.

Wait, initial diluted volume is 40 cm³, and at equivalence, the NaOH added is 10 cm³. So total volume is 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, using Kb for the acetate ion:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assume [OH^-] = x, and [CH3COOH] = x. Then Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since x will be small compared to 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) → log(1e-5) is 5, log(1.04) is approx 0.017, so pOH ≈ 4.983. So pH = 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Wait, but wait, that's not matching any of the options. Let me check my calculation again.

Wait, I think I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me re-calculate Kb.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb of acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → approximately 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

Setting up the expression:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² /0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) *0.02 → which is 1.081e-11.

So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) → what's that?

Calculate sqrt(1.081e-11) → sqrt(1.081) is about 1.039, so 1.039e-5.5? Wait, no. Wait, 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2. So sqrt(1.081e-11) is approximately 1.04e-5.5? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2, but 1.0e-5.5 is about 3.16e-6. Wait, but 1.04e-5 is 1.04e-5, which is 1.04 x 1e-5. So pOH would be -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98, so pH = 14 -4.98 = 9.02.

But looking at the options, none of the equivalence point pHs are around 9.02. The options have equivalence points of 8.52 (A), 6.73 (B), 7.00 (C), 6.92 (D). So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, maybe I should not have neglected x in the denominator. Let me try a more accurate approach.

The Kb expression is x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5.

Wait, but that gives pOH about 4.98, pH about 9.02.

Hmm, but none of the options have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the moles or concentrations.

Wait, let's recheck the moles at equivalence point.

Original acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, all 0.001 mol is converted to acetate. The solution volume is 40 cm³ (diluted) plus 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

So [acetate] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, maybe I didn't account for activity coefficients or something else, but that's beyond the scope of this problem. Perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, maybe the solution is not just acetate, but also the sodium ions, but sodium is a spectator ion, so it doesn't affect pH.

Wait, what if I made a mistake in calculating Kb?

Kb = Kw / Ka → yes, that's correct. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

Wait, perhaps I should do the exact calculation without the approximation. Let me try that.

Set up the equation: x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Approximate x as 1e-5, which is 1e-5. Then 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

But maybe x is a bit larger than 1e-5. Let me compute x^2 = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is small, let's proceed with x ≈ 1e-5 and see.

But wait, if x is around 1e-5, then 0.02 -x ≈ 0.0199, which is about 0.02. So the approximation holds.

Wait, but what gives a pH around 8.52? Let me think. Maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is not just the acetate but also the product of the neutralization. Wait, when NaOH is added, it's a strong base, so it dissociates completely. For each mole of NaOH, it neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volumes. Let me go back.

Wait, initial diluted volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), and when you add 10 cm³ of NaOH (0.01 L), the total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb value.

Wait, let me compute Kb more accurately. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = let's compute that.

1e-14 ÷ 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.54054 * 1e-9 → 5.4054e-10.

That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the solution isn't just acetate; perhaps there's an error in considering the solution.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the solution is a buffer solution at equivalence point? No, equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, so it's just the conjugate base and its salt.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without assuming x is negligible.

So:

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x)

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Therefore, x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

So pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH ≈ 9.02.

But the options don't have a pH near 9.02. The closest is option A's 8.52, which is lower. So perhaps I miscalculated something else.

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial moles. Let me recheck.

Original acetic acid: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M → 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Diluted with 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of H2O: total volume 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So concentration after dilution is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence, 0.001 mol of NaOH is added, converting all acetic acid to acetate. So 0.001 mol acetate.

Volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ → 0.05 L. So [acetate] = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for the hydrolysis of acetate:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming that [CH3COOH] = x and [OH^-] = x, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So x² =5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02.

Again, none of the options have about 9.02. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution at equivalence point is a buffer? No, that's not the case. At equivalence, all the weak acid has been neutralized, so it's just the conjugate base.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the acetate ion's concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value without approximation.

So the equation is x² =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

Assuming x is small, but perhaps I should solve it more accurately.

Let me write it as x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 *0.02) =0.

This is a quadratic equation: x² + (5.405e-10)x - 1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)] / 2a.

Where a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 = (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) ≈ 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=approx 6.577e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.577e-6 ] / 2.

Only the positive root makes sense.

So x= ( -5.4e-10 +6.577e-6 ) /2 ≈ (6.577e-6 ) /2 ≈3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.516; so pOH=5.484 → pH=14-5.484=8.516.

Ah, so that's about 8.516, which is approximately 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52.

Wait, that's matching option A's second value of 8.52. But earlier, the 25% titration point gave a pH of about 4.25, which matches option A's first pH of 4.26.

So the two pH values would be approximately 4.26 and 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I approximated x as 1e-5, I got pH around 9.02, but when I did the exact solution, I got 8.52, which is option A.

So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but why did the initial approximation give a different result? Because when x isn't negligible compared to 0.02, even though it's small, it does affect the result.

So, to recap:

At 25% titration, pH is about 4.25.

At equivalence point, pH is about 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). Using the dilution formula:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

The moles of acetic acid after dilution are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \cdot 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \cdot 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reaction converts 0.00025 mol of acetic acid to acetate, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Acetate formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at this point is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{Acetic acid}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{Acetate}]}{[\text{Acetic acid}]} \right),
\]
where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.25**.

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate. The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \(K_b\):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{Acetate}]}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). Then:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{Acetate}] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.0200 = 1.08 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, solving the quadratic equation more accurately gives:

\[
\text{pH} \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
