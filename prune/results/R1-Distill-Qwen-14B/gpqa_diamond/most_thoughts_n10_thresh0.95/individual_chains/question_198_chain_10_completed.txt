Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. Let me read it again.

The problem says that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, wait. So, the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^n+, right? The stability constant β tells us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, each β corresponds to a different complex.

Let me think about the complexes. Co can form complexes with multiple SCN- ions. So, the possible species are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)₃]^- , and [Co(SCN)₄]^2−. Because the β values are given for each step. So β1 is the first step: Co²+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+; β1 is 9. Then β2 is the next step, where [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β2=40. Similarly, β3 would be [Co(SCN)₂]^0 + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)₃]^- , β3=63. And β4 is [Co(SCN)₃]^- + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)₄]^2−, β4=16.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm not exactly sure which complex is blue. Wait, I remember that the [Co(SCN)₆]^3− is the intense blue complex, but in this case, the problem says "dithiocyanato", which would imply two SCN- ligands. Or wait, maybe it's a typo, and the intended complex is the hexathiocyanato? No, the question specifically says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ions. So the complex in question is [Co(SCN)₂]^0.

So I'm to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^0 in the solution.

The problem is about finding the distribution of the species. So, we have to calculate the mole fractions of each complex. The total cobalt is the sum of all the species: Co²+ (free), [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)₃]^- , and [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

But how to approach this? I think it's a log distribution problem, where each complex's concentration is determined by the stability constants and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN-.

Wait, the total concentration of Co is given as 1e-2 M. The SCN- is 0.1 M. So the initial concentrations are [Co²+] = 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. But as the complexes form, [SCN-] will decrease, but wait, the problem says the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. Hmm, maybe we can assume that the SCN- concentration doesn't change much because the complex formation is not too extensive. Or perhaps the solution is at equilibrium, considering the complexes.

Wait, perhaps I should model the system using the stability constants. The general approach is to write the formation equations and then express each complex's concentration in terms of the free [Co²+] and [SCN-].

The species present are:

1. Co²+ (free)
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ → formed by Co²+ + SCN-
3. [Co(SCN)₂] → formed by [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN-
4. [Co(SCN)₃]^- → formed by [Co(SCN)₂] + SCN-
5. [Co(SCN)₄]^2− → formed by [Co(SCN)₃]^- + SCN-

Each step has a stability constant β. So, the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the previous one and [SCN-].

Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then:

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN-]

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * [Co(SCN)]^+ * [SCN-] = β2 * β1 x [SCN-]^2

Wait, no. Wait, β is defined as the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for each step. So, the formation of [Co(SCN)]^+ from Co²+ and SCN- is:

Co²+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+ ; β1 = [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ] / ( [Co²+][SCN-] )

Similarly, the formation of [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is:

[Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)₂]^0 ; β2 = [ [Co(SCN)₂] ] / ( [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ][SCN-] )

So, each subsequent β is a step-wise constant.

So, overall, the concentration of each complex can be written in terms of [Co²+] and [SCN-], but considering all the previous steps.

Alternatively, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)ₙ]^(2-n) would be the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, that makes sense. So for [Co(SCN)]^+, the overall β is β1 =9.

For [Co(SCN)₂]^0, the overall β is β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

For [Co(SCN)₃]^- , it's β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=25200.

For [Co(SCN)₄]^2−, it's β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=  362880.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, the overall stability constant K for the complex [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of the stepwise β's up to that n. So, K1=β1, K2=β1β2, K3=β1β2β3, K4=β1β2β3β4.

So, the concentration of each complex is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co²+] [SCN-]^n

So, for each complex, the concentration is K_n [Co²+] [SCN-]^n.

So, the concentrations are:

[Co²+] = x

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 x [S]^1 = 9 x S

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 = β1 β2 x S^2 = 360 x S²

[Co(SCN)3]^- = β1 β2 β3 x S^3 = 25200 x S^3

[Co(SCN)4]^2- = β1 β2 β3 β4 x S^4 = 362880 x S^4

But wait, S is [SCN-], which is 0.1 M. Wait, but as the complexes form, [SCN-] decreases. But since the initial [SCN-] is 0.1 M, and the total Co is 1e-2 M, which is 0.01 M, the maximum number of SCN- that can be tied up in complexes is 4 * 0.01 = 0.04 M. So, 0.1 M is much larger than that, so the change in [SCN-] due to complexation is negligible. So, we can approximate [SCN-] as 0.1 M throughout.

So, substituting S=0.1:

[Co(SCN)]^+ =9 x * 0.1 = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 = 360 x * (0.1)^2 = 360 x *0.01= 3.6 x

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, no. Let me recompute.

Wait, the [Co(SCN)]^+ is β1 * x * S^1 =9 x * 0.1=0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 is β1 β2 x S^2 = 9*40=360. S=0.1, so (0.1)^2=0.01. So 360 x *0.01= 3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)3]^- is β1 β2 β3 x S^3 =9*40*63= 25200. 0.1^3=0.001. So 25200 x *0.001= 25.2 x.

[Co(SCN)4]^2- is β1 β2 β3 β4 x S^4 =9*40*63*16= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880. S^4=0.1^4=0.0001. So 362880 x *0.0001=36.288 x.

Wait, but the sum of all these species plus the free Co²+ must equal the total Co concentration, which is 0.01 M.

So,

Total Co = [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)₂]^0 + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^2− = x + 0.9x + 3.6x +25.2x +36.288x = ?

Let's sum the coefficients:

x (1) + 0.9x (1.9) + 3.6x (5.5) +25.2x (30.7) +36.288x (66.988)

So total: 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+3.6=5.5; 5.5+25.2=30.7; 30.7+36.288=66.988.

So, 66.988 x = 0.01 M.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 66.988 x = 0.01 → x = 0.01 /66.988 ≈ 0.0001493 M.

Wait, but that would make [Co²+] = x ≈ 1.493e-4 M. Let me confirm:

Yes, x ≈ 0.01 /66.988 ≈ 0.0001493 M.

Wait, but let me compute 66.988 x =0.01 → x=0.01 /66.988 ≈ 1.493e-4 M.

Now, each complex's concentration can be calculated.

So,

[Co²+] = x = 1.493e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)]^+ =0.9 x = 0.9 *1.493e-4 ≈ 1.344e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 =3.6 x ≈ 3.6 *1.493e-4 ≈ 5.375e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^- =25.2 x ≈25.2 *1.493e-4 ≈3.766e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^2- =36.288 x ≈36.288 *1.493e-4 ≈5.42e-3 M.

Wait, let me compute all these:

1.493e-4 *0.9 =1.344e-4.

1.493e-4 *3.6 =5.375e-4.

1.493e-4 *25.2= 3.766e-3.

1.493e-4 *36.288= approx 5.42e-3.

Now, sum all these to make sure they add up to 0.01 M.

x = 1.493e-4 → 0.0001493

0.9x≈0.0001344 → sum so far is 0.0002837.

+3.6x=0.0005375 → sum is 0.0008212.

+25.2x=0.003766 → sum is 0.004587.

+36.288x=0.00542 → sum is approximately 0.010007. Which is about right, considering rounding.

So, the concentrations of each complex are:

Co²+: 1.493e-4 M.

Co(SCN)+: 1.344e-4.

Co(SCN)₂^0:5.375e-4.

Co(SCN)3^-:3.766e-3.

Co(SCN)4^2-:5.42e-3.

Now, the question is the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^0.

So, [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is 5.375e-4 M.

Total cobalt species sum to 0.01 M. So, the percentage is (5.375e-4 / 0.01 ) *100%.

5.375e-4 / 0.01 = 0.05375 → 5.375%.

Wait, that's about 5.375% which is roughly 5.4%. But none of the options are around 5%. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, let me check. Maybe I messed up the stability constants or the way I applied them.

Wait, the β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, for each step, the β is the formation constant for that step. So, the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product up to βn.

Wait, but wait, βn is the nth step's formation constant, so for [Co(SCN)₂], β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

So, [Co(SCN)₂] = K2 * [Co²+][S]^2 =360 *x*(0.1)^2.

Wait, 0.1^2 is 0.01, so 360 * x *0.01 =3.6 x. That's correct.

Hmm, but the total Co is 0.01 M, and the sum of all species is 66.988 x =0.01 → x≈0.0001493.

So, [Co(SCN)₂] =3.6 * 0.0001493 = approx 5.375e-4.

So, 5.375e-4 /0.01 =0.05375 → 5.375%. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the stability constants. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't using the overall K, but stepwise β.

Wait, another approach is to model the distribution using the cumulative βs. Another way is to use the formula for each species in terms of the free ion and the ligand.

Alternatively, perhaps the formation of each complex is as follows:

The general approach is to compute the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion.

But perhaps the correct approach is to compute the fraction of each complex as (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [SCN-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN-] + β1 β2 [SCN-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN-]^3 + ... )

Wait, yes, that's probably the right approach. So, the fraction of each species is calculated based on the overall β and the ligand concentration.

So, the fraction f_n of the nth complex is f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [S]^n) / (1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + ... )

In this case, the total is the sum from n=0 to 4.

Wait, n=0 is the free Co²+.

So, the denominator D is:

D = 1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4

And the fraction f2 (for [Co(SCN)₂]^0) is (β1 β2 [S]^2) / D.

Calculating D:

beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16.

[S]=0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term 0: 1 → 1.

Term1: β1 [S] =9 *0.1 =0.9.

Term2: β1 β2 [S]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 =9*40*63*(0.1)^3.

9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 * (0.1)^3=22680*0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 =9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

9 *40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880. (0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So, D=1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Calculating:

1+0.9=1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5+22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D≈64.468.

Now, the fraction f2 is (term2) / D → term2 is 3.6.

So f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05557, or 5.557%.

That's about 5.56%, which still doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are not cumulative? Let me think again.

Wait, the stability constant βn is for the nth step, so the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of β1 through βn.

So, the calculation of D as the sum of all possible terms is correct.

But the options given are much higher, like 16%, 25%, 38%, 42%. So perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption. Oh wait! Maybe the problem refers to the dithiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)₃]^−, which would be the triply charged complex. No, the question says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN-.

Wait, wait, perhaps the question is about the hexathiocyanato complex. That's a possibility I didn't consider. Because I remember that the intense blue color is associated with [Co(NH3)6]^3+ but in this case, it's SCN-.

Wait, but the question says dithiocyanato, so two SCN. Oh, but wait, perhaps "dithiocyanato" implies two SCN per Co, but in the solution, the complex is [Co(SCN)₂]^0, which is colorless? Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the hexathiocyanato complex, which would be [Co(SCN)6]^3−, which is a different structure. But the question clearly states dithiocyanato, which is two, so I think that's not the case.

Hmm, but I'm getting about 5.5% as the percentage, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the [SCN-] is 0.1 M, but in the solution, after complex formation, the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. But if the initial [SCN-] is 0.1 M, and the Co is 0.01 M, then the maximum possible [SCN-] that can be consumed is 0.04 M (since each Co can take up to four SCN-). So 0.04 is much less than 0.1, so the approximation holds, and [SCN-] is still effectively 0.1 M.

So, perhaps I'm correct, but the options don't include 5.5%. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the D calculation.

D = 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Adding up:

1 +0.9=1.9.

1.9+3.6=5.5.

5.5+22.68=28.18.

28.18+36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct.

So, term 2 is 3.6, so 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557 → 5.557%.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm using the stability constants.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given as the overall constants, not the stepwise. But the problem states that β1, β2, etc., are stability constants of the complexes. So that would imply that β1 is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is the overall for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, etc.

Wait, wait, that's a possibility. If the βs are overall constants, then for [Co(SCN)]^+, β1 =9. For [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β2=40. For [Co(SCN)3]^- , β3=63. For [Co(SCN)4]^2−, β4=16.

In that case, the overall K for each complex is different.

Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because the β for [Co(SCN)₂] would be different than the product of β1 and β2.

Hmm, perhaps that's the confusion. Let me think.

If the β's are given as the overall stability constants for each complex, then the approach is different. So, for each complex, the concentration is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co²+] [SCN-]^n.

But in this case, for each complex, βn is the overall constant for that complex.

So, [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 [Co²+][S]^1.

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 = β2 [Co²+][S]^2.

[Co(SCN)3]^- = β3 [Co²+][S]^3.

[Co(SCN)4]^2− = β4 [Co²+][S]^4.

So, in that case, the denominator D becomes:

D =1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4.

So, substituting the values:

β1=9, [S]=0.1.

So:

Term0=1.

Term1=9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2=40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

Term3=63 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

Term4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

So,

D=1 +0.9=1.9 → +0.4=2.3 → +0.063=2.363 → +0.0016≈2.3646.

So, D≈2.3646.

The fraction for [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is Term2 / D → 0.4 /2.3646≈0.169 → 16.9%.

Ah! Now that's option D:16.9%.

So, that must be the correct approach. But wait, why would the β's be given as the overall constants for each complex, not stepwise?

In some textbooks, the stability constant (formation constant) K is the overall constant for the complex. So, for [Co(SCN)]^+ → K1=β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)₂]^0 → K2=β2=40.

Wait, that would imply that the overall K for [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is 40, which would mean that [Co(SCN)₂]^0 =40 [Co²+][S]^2.

In that case, the previous approach would be correct, and the percentage comes out to be 16.9%, which is option D.

But earlier, I thought the β's were stepwise, leading to a lower percentage.

So, perhaps the problem states that the β's are the overall stability constants, not stepwise. Because the question says 'stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16.'

Ah! So each β is the overall stability constant for each complex. So, β1 is the K for [CoSCN]^+; β2 is K for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, etc.

In that case, the denominator D is 1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4.

Which gives D=1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=2.3646.

So, the fraction f2 is 0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169 → 16.9%, which is option D.

So, the correct answer must be D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the concentrations [Co²⁺] = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Interpretation of Stability Constants**:  
   The stability constants provided are overall stability constants for the complexes:
   - β₁ corresponds to [Co(SCN)]⁺.
   - β₂ corresponds to [Co(SCN)₂]⁰.
   - β₃ corresponds to [Co(SCN)₃]⁻.
   - β₄ corresponds to [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.

2. **Fraction of Each Complex**:  
   The fraction of each cobalt species is determined using the formula:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
   \]
   Here, \( f_2 \) corresponds to the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰.

3. **Substitute Values**:  
   - \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
   - Compute each term in the denominator:
     - Term 0: \( 1 \)
     - Term 1: \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
     - Term 2: \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
     - Term 3: \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
     - Term 4: \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)
   - Sum of terms in the denominator:
     \[
     D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
     \]
   - Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰:
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{\text{Term 2}}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
     \]

4. **Percentage Calculation**:  
   The percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = f_2 \cdot 100 = 0.169 \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

Answer: D
