Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in relativity, adding velocities isn't as straightforward as classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. 

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, but wait, in relativity, mass is part of the energy equation. Oh wait, the question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. So first, I need to find the relative speed between them.

Wait, both are moving in the positive x-direction. So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds, right? But wait, no, because in relativity, you can't just subtract speeds like that. You have to use the formula for relative velocity.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)) ). Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Oh yeah, because the speeds are fractions of c, so let me plug in the values. 

So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Plugging into the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Simplify numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²/c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So that's approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut's total energy is given by gamma * m c². Wait, but the problem says their masses are 2m and 3m. So I need to calculate each of their energies and add them together.

First, calculate gamma for each. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For the first astronaut (v=0.6c): gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * m1 c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait wait, but the mass is 2m, right? So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut (v=0.5c): gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * m2 c² = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc².

So the total energy should be about 5.96 mc² and relative speed is 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. Option D has E=5 mc², which is too low.

Wait, let me double-check the velocity calculation. (0.6-0.5)c is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6*0.5)c² / c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1 / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428, which is about 0.14c. So that's correct.

And the energies: 2.5 + approximately 3.464 is 5.964, which matches option C. So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (\(v_1 = 0.6c, m_1 = 2m\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (\(v_2 = 0.5c, m_2 = 3m\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
