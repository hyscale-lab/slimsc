Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The given density matrix is ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. 

Wait, what's the difference between a pure state and a mixed state? Oh right, a pure state is a single ket vector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, while a mixed state is a statistical mixture, meaning it's a convex combination of different pure states. So in this case, ρ is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability because the coefficients are both 1/2.

So the state is a completely mixed state for a single qubit. Now, the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is a vector r = (x, y, z) such that ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So I need to find the vector r that satisfies that equation.

Let me write out the given ρ again. ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) / 2. Hmm, wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in (1,1). Adding them together, the diagonal elements become 1 each, so the matrix is diagonal with 1/2 on the diagonal. So ρ looks like:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

That's a 2x2 matrix. Now, I need to express this in terms of I and the Pauli matrices. I know that the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, let's consider ρ = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz ) / 2. Wait, no, the general form is (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz ) / 2. Because each Pauli matrix is multiplied by the respective component of the vector r, which is a 3D vector.

So, let's compute each term. I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Now, the other terms:

r_x σx is r_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] → [[0, r_x],[r_x, 0]].

Similarly, r_y σy is r_y * [[0, -i],[i, 0]] → [[0, -i r_y], [i r_y, 0]].

r_z σz is r_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] → [[r_z,0], [0, -r_z]].

Adding all these together:

(I/2) + (r_x σx)/2 + (r_y σy)/2 + (r_z σz)/2.

Wait, actually, the general expression is ρ = (I + r·σ ) / 2. So the entire expression is (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz ) / 2.

So, let me compute each part:

First, I/2 is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Then, (r_x σx)/2 → [[0, r_x/2], [r_x/2, 0]].

Similarly, (r_y σy)/2 → [[0, (-i r_y)/2], [ (i r_y)/2, 0 ].

And (r_z σz)/2 → [[r_z/2, 0], [0, (-r_z)/2 ].

Now, sum all these matrices together:

The (1,1) element is 1/2 + r_z/2.

The (1,2) element is (r_x/2) [from σx] plus (-i r_y / 2) [from σy].

The (2,1) element is (r_x/2) plus (i r_y /2).

The (2,2) element is 1/2 - r_z/2.

So the overall matrix is:

[[ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
 [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

Now, comparing this to the given ρ matrix which is diagonal with both diagonal elements 1/2. So let's set the off-diagonal elements to zero and the diagonal elements to 1/2.

Looking at our general expression, the diagonal elements are (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. Set each to 1/2:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z =1 → r_z =0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 =1/2 → same result.

The off-diagonal terms in our general expression are (r_x - i r_y)/2 and the complex conjugate. For those to be zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero.

So (r_x - i r_y)/2 =0. So real part is r_x =0, and imaginary part is -r_y =0 → r_y=0.

Wait, because (r_x - i r_y) must be zero. So r_x must be zero and r_y must be zero.

So the vector r is (0, 0, r_z). And r_z is zero.

So r = (0, 0, 0).

Which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. So the state is in the center of the Bloch sphere, meaning it's a completely mixed state. Because the Bloch vector is zero, and the density matrix is (I)/2, which is the maximally mixed state for a qubit.

Now, looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → seems like a point on the equator, but probably not for our case.

B) (0,0,1) → that's the state |0⟩, but wait, ρ in our case is a mixture, so maybe not.

Wait, wait. If the density matrix is |0⟩⟨0|, then the vector would be (0,0,1). Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| would be (0,0,-1). But our case is a mixture of both, so the vector is zero.

So the correct option is C) r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit, as it is an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation, where the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) corresponds to the density matrix:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

with \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) being the Pauli matrices. Expanding this expression and comparing it to the given \(\rho\), we find:

1. The diagonal elements of \(\rho\) are both \(1/2\), which implies \(r_z = 0\).
2. The off-diagonal elements of \(\rho\) are zero, which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** This represents a point on the equator of the Bloch sphere, not the origin.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** This corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not a mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** This represents the completely mixed state, consistent with the given density matrix.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** This is not a valid state on the Bloch sphere.

The correct answer is **C**, as the Bloch vector \(r = (0, 0, 0)\) corresponds to the completely mixed state.

Answer: C
