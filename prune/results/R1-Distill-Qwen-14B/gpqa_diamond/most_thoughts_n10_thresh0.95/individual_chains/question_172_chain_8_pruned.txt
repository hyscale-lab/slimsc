Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I remember from my studies that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of energy levels in their atmospheres follows the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the relative populations of different energy states.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 have twice as excited a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, let's denote the energy levels as E. The ratio of populations, n_upper/n_lower, should be given by the Boltzmann equation. Oh wait, the ratio is n = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, for star_1, the ratio is twice that of star_2. But wait, no, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So maybe that means the population in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2 for the same energy level. Or perhaps it's about the excitation relative to the ground state?

Wait, I think it's about the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. So let's say for each star, the ratio is n_upper/n_lower. So for star_1, this ratio is 2 times that of star_2.

Wait no, actually the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. So n1/n2 = 2, where n1 is the ratio for star_1 and n2 for star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the excited state is more populated in star_1. Let me restate the question: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited..." So the excitation level is higher, which would mean more atoms are in higher energy levels in star_1.

So, for each star, the ratio of the upper level (excited) to lower (ground) is given by Boltzmann. So let's say for star_1, n1 = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly, for star_2, n2 = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

Wait, but the problem says that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is the same for both stars. So ΔE is the same, 1.38e-23 J. So, the question is about the ratio of n1 to n2.

But the question states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So I think that n1/n2 = 2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me read again. "Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, perhaps the excitation is higher in star_1. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower is higher in star_1 than in star_2. So n
