--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let's see what the question says.

The compound's been analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR. The main peaks mentioned are a very broad absorption at 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups. Like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broad, which might suggest it's a strong hydrogen bond, maybe like a carboxylic acid. But another thought: maybe it's an alcohol. Or perhaps an amide, but I think that's less likely because the options don't have nitrogen.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. 1700 is a strong peak, so that's probably a carbonyl group. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like an acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower. That could indicate conjugation, like in an acid where the carbonyl is around 1700 and the conjugated peak is lower, maybe an acid derivative. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, but the 1650 might be C=C stretching.

Looking at the 1H NMR: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. That would explain the 1650 peak possibly being C=C.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: 45 could be (CH3)2O (that's 45?), wait, (CH3)2O is 45? No, wait, (CH3)2O is 3*(1) for each CH3 (so 2*3=6) plus O=16, so 32? No, wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, molecular formula for (CH3)2O is C2H6O. The molecular weight would be (2*12) + (6*1) + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46. Hmm, so 46 isn't 45. What gives 45? Let me think.

Another common fragment is CH3CHO (which is acetaldehyde), molecular weight is 44. Wait, no, 44. Then 45 could be C3H7O? Wait, maybe looking for a different approach. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 could be a CH2 group attached to something else. Or maybe a carbonyl group with some CH2s. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CO group (acetyl), which is 43, but that's 43. Hmm.

Wait, the molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So let's think about the molecular formulas first. Let's compute the degree of unsaturation for each.

For C6H12O: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0, N=0. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So DoU is 1. That could be one ring or one double bond.

C6H10O: DoU = (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond.

C6H10O2: DoU = (14-10 -0)/2= (4)/2=2. So same as above.

C6H12O2: DoU= (14-12)/2= (2)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond.

Wait, but from the NMR, we know there's a vinyl group, which is a double bond, so DoU should at least have one. So options with DoU=1 could have one double bond, and others have more.

Looking back at the IR: the 1700 and 1650 peaks. 1700 is a carbonyl. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an acid where the carbonyl is around 1700 and the adjacent O-H (if present) or another C=O is lower. Wait, but another possibility: the 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C, but that's usually higher, around 1600-1450. Wait, but 1650 could also be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone or an ester perhaps.

Wait, but why two peaks? If the compound has two carbonyl groups? But that would be unusual unless it's something like an acid anhydride or a compound with two different carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl (like ester or ketone) and the other is a conjugated C=C.

Wait, the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000. That's probably an O-H group. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then, in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 and the O-H is broad. Also, the C-OH would stretch around 1300-1250. But in the question, the IR shows two peaks besides the broad O-H. So the other peaks are 1700 (C=O) and 1650. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 1650 is a C=O stretch for an ester or something else. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is another group, like an aromatic ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So let's think about the possible structures.

Looking at the mass spec peak at m/z 45. Let's see, what's the molecular weight of each option.

C6H12O: Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(16) =72+12+16=100.

C6H10O: (72)+(10)+(16)=98.

C6H10O2: 72+10+32=114.

C6H12O2:72+12+32=116.

So the molecular ions would be at 100, 98, 114, 116.

But the fragment is at 45. Let's think about possible fragments that would give m/z 45.

What structures could break into a fragment of 45?

For example, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which has a molecular weight of 114. So if a fragment breaks off, say, a 45 m/z piece, the remaining would be 114-45=69. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH3CO group (43), which doesn't add up. Wait, but 45 could be something else.

Wait, another approach: 45 is a common fragment in mass spectrometry. Let me think of 45 as a possible group. For example, (CH3)2CO (acetone) is molecular weight 58. No, that's not it. Another possibility is CH3CH2OH, which is 46. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH2CH2O, but I'm not sure. Or maybe a carbonyl group with something.

Wait, another approach: 45 could be the molecular weight of a fragment such as C3H7O. Let me compute that: 3*12 +7 +16= 36+7+16=60. No, that's not 45. Alternatively, C2H5O is 45? Let's compute: 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16. 24+5+16=45. Oh! So C2H5O would be 45. So that's a possible fragment.

So, if the parent compound has a fragment that loses some part to leave C2H5O, that would give m/z 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the cleavage of a carbonyl group.

Wait, but C2H5O is an ether group, but that's 45. So the parent compound could have an ethoxy group or something similar.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the fragment is a ketene ion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone. So if the compound is an ester, maybe the ester group would break into an acylium ion or something else.

Wait, the IR showed a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group. So perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid. So let's think about a structure that's a carboxylic acid with a double bond (since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens) and an ester or something else.

Wait, but looking at the options, which of them have O and O2? The options with O2 are C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.

So if it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would have at least O. For example, C6H12O2 could be a dicarboxylic acid, or an ester plus something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an alcohol group? Or perhaps a ketone and an alcohol.

Wait, another approach: the FTIR has a broad peak, so O-H. The 1700 peak is a carbonyl. So maybe it's an ester.

Wait, esters have a carbonyl around 1700-1750. They also have an O-H? Wait, no, esters don't have O-H; they have an ether linkage. So if the O-H is present, maybe it's an acid.

Hmm, maybe the compound is a substituted benzoic acid. But I don't see any indication of aromatic protons in the NMR description.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't say anything about aromatic signals, so perhaps the compound doesn't have an aromatic ring. So maybe it's a simple carboxylic acid with a double bond.

So structure possibilities: maybe something like CH2CH2(COOH)CH2CH2CH3 or similar. Wait, but let's think about the molecular formula.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

If the formula is C6H12O2, the possible structures could be a diol with a carbonyl group. Or maybe an ester.

Option B: C6H10O.

This would have a DoU of 2, so maybe two rings or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU is 2. So maybe two rings or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU is 1. So maybe one ring or one double bond.

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so there's at least one double bond. So options B and C have DoU 2, which would require another double bond or a ring.

Wait, the FTIR shows a broad O-H. So if the compound is a diol, but diols don't typically have a carbonyl group. But the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe it's a compound with both a carbonyl and an O-H, like a carboxylic acid.

If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would have O2, I think. Because the formula is RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2.

Wait, let's compute for a simple carboxylic acid. For example, hexanoic acid is C6H12O2. So that fits option A.

Wait, but hexanoic acid has a structure CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. But in that case, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 groups next to the COOH, and a singlet for the COOH protons, but wait, the COOH protons are exchanged and might not show up in the NMR. Or they could appear as a broad peak. But the question states that the NMR has several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Wait, hexanoic acid doesn't have any double bonds, so no vinyl H's. So that can't be the structure.

Hmm, so maybe the compound isn't a simple carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. So structure like CH2=CHCOOH. Let's see, the formula would be C3H4O2. But our options are all C6, so perhaps it's a substituted version with more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's compute the molecular formula for that.

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3: that's C5H8O2. But our options are all C6. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclopropane ring or something else, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester or something else.

Wait, but let's go back to the IR. If the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, then the IR would have a broad peak, and the C=O around 1700. The 1650 peak could be the conjugated double bond. So perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid.

Structure like CH2=CHCOOH. But that's only 3 carbons. Let's extend it to 6 carbons. For example, perhaps a longer chain with a double bond and a carboxylic acid group.

Another approach: for the NMR, since they've got vinyl hydrogens, the structure has a double bond, which would add to the DoU. So if the IR has a C=O at 1700, that's another DoU. So the total DoU would be 2 (C=O and C=C). So for a six-carbon compound, the molecular formula would have DoU of 2.

Looking at the options, which options have DoU of 2?

Option B: C6H10O. DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So yes, DoU is 2.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is (14-10)/2=2.

Option A: DoU is 1. So perhaps less likely as we've got two DoU (C=O and C=C).

Option D: DoU is 1.

So options B and C have DoU 2.

But looking at the IR, the O-H is present, which would require an O in the formula. So options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O) have one O each.

Wait, option B is C6H10O. That would have O, but what about the carbonyl in IR? That would require a C=O group, which would take another O, unless it's an aldehyde where O is from the same group. Wait, no, aldehydes have an O in the carbonyl.

So if it's a carbonyl group, that's another O. So the formula would require at least two O's if it's a carboxylic acid or an ester, etc.

So the options with two O's are C and A.

Wait, but option C is C6H10O2. That has two O's, which would make sense for a carbonyl group (like ester, ketone, acid, etc.) plus an O-H group (acid) or an ether.

So let's consider option C: C6H10O2.

DoU is 2. So maybe a double bond and a carbonyl group.

If the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, for example. Or perhaps a diester.

Alternatively, the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, that would be 3 carbons in the acid part, but let me see the formula.

Wait, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3: that's C5H8O2. But the options are for C6. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH2.

Wait, maybe a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. Like a cyclic ester (lactone), but that would have O in the ring.

Wait, but the mass spec shows a fragment at 45. Let's tie that in.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(16*2) =72+10+32=114.

In mass spectrometry, the most abundant fragment is often the largest, but sometimes smaller fragments are more prominent. A fragment at m/z 45 would mean a part of the molecule broke off. So maybe the molecule cleaves into a 45 and 69 (since 114-45=69).

What could 45 be? As I thought earlier, C2H5O is 45. So perhaps the molecule has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). Then, upon fragmentation, the ethoxy could come off as a fragment.

So, if the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group, for example, the ester would be R-O-CO-R'. If the R is ethyl, then the fragment might be the ethoxy group.

Wait, but ethoxy is C2H5O, which is 45. So if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, which would have a molecular formula of C5H8O2. But our options are C6. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diester or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the compound could be a methyl acrylate derivative, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester functional group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclopropane with a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the mass spec again. Fragment at 45, so 45 is C2H5O.

If the parent compound is C6H10O2, and it breaks into a C2H5O fragment and a C4H5O fragment, but wait, that doesn't add up. 6-2=4 carbons on the other side. 4 carbons would have a molecular weight of (4*12) + (5*1) + (16) =48+5+16=69. So that works.

So the parent would be C6H10O2. The fragment would be C2H5O (45) and the rest is C4H5O (69). I'm not sure what C4H5O would be, but perhaps a ketone or something else.

Wait, another approach: the fragment at 45 could also be from the cleavage of a larger group. For example, in an ester, the ester group could break. The ester group is R-O-CO-R'. Upon cleavage, the R-O could break off as a fragment. So if the R is ethyl (C2H5), then R-O is C2H5O, which is 45. So that would fit.

So the parent compound would have an ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl group. So it's an ester: R-O-CO-R''.

So, for example, ethyl something ester. Let's say the ester is part of a larger molecule. So perhaps the ester is ethyl acrylate or something similar.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. If the ester is ethyl acrylate, that's CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The molecular formula is C5H8O2. But our options are all C6. Hmm.

So maybe the ester is attached to a longer chain. For example, a six-carbon ester where the ethyl group is the R-O part. So the structure would be R-O-CO-R', where R is ethyl and R' is a four-carbon group with a double bond.

Wait, but the molecular formula would have to be C6H10O2. Let's compute for CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's 4 carbons in R' would make the formula C6H10O2. Let me check:

R is ethyl (C2H5), R' is CH2CH2COO- maybe? No, wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R', so for R=ethyl (C2H5), R' would be CH2CH2COO- but that's not correct. Maybe R' is CH2CH2CH2- something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's compute the formula: that's 2 (from CH2=CH) + 2 (CH2COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 2+2+2=6 carbons. The formula would be C6H10O2. Yes, because each CH2 contributes 2 H, but let's count:

CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH2CH3.

Breaking it down:

CH2=CH- (2 C, 3 H each (but double bond affects H count)).

Wait, perhaps it's better to count all H's:

Structure: CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3.

Each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond reduces the H's.

Wait, maybe it's easier to calculate the molecular formula.

Each part:

CH2=CHCH2- : that's 3 carbons, with one double bond.

COO: 2 O's.

CH2CH3: ethyl.

So the formula would be:

C (3 from CH2=CHCH2-) + 2 (from COO) + 2 (from ethyl) = 3+2+2=7 C? Wait, no, wait, the COO is part of the ester, so the COO connects the two parts. So CH2=CHCH2-COO-CH2CH3: that's 3 (from CH2=CHCH2) + 2 (from COO) + 2 (ethyl)= 7? Wait, but the options are all six carbons. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. But that's five carbons in the ester, which would be C5H8O2, but our options are C6. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. For example, a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond nearby.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted acrylic acid ester. But I'm not sure.

Well, maybe I should focus on the options again. The key points are:

- O-H (broad peak at 3000)
- C=O at 1700
- C=C stretching at 1650
- Vinyl H in NMR
- Fragment at 45 in MS.

Given that, and the options, let's think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular formula.

Possible structures: ester, carboxylic acid, etc.

If it's a carboxylic acid, like hexanoic acid, but that doesn't have a double bond, so the NMR wouldn't show vinyl H.

So probably not.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU is 2. So possible structures include a double bond and a carbonyl.

If it's an ester with an ethoxy group, the fragment would be C2H5O (45), which fits the mass spec.

So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be 5 carbons, but the formula is C6. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a four-carbon acid and an ethyl group, like CH2CH2CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. That's a six-carbon ester, but no double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so double bond is needed.

So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's six carbons:

CH2=CH (2 C) - CH2 (1 C) - COO (2 O) - CH2CH2CH3 (3 C). Wait, but that's 2+1+3=6 C, but the CH2=CH- is two C, and the COO connects to ethyl, which is two C. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's a four-carbon ester with a double bond. For example, CH2=CHCH2COOCH3. But that's five carbons, and the formula would be C5H8O2, not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is ethyl something with a double bond. Like ethyl 3-pentenoate? Wait, but 3-pentenoate would be CH2CHCOOCH2CH3, which is again five carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, like a five-membered ring. For example, butyrolactone, but that's a four-membered ring. Hmm.

Well, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think about the options again.

The mass spec fragment is 45. If it's an ethoxy group, that fits. So the parent compound must have an ethoxy group. So the formula must include an OCH2CH3 group.

Looking at the options, which have O2 and can have an ethoxy group.

Option C: C6H10O2. So possible structure: ethyl something ester, where something has four carbons and a double bond.

Wait, ethyl 4-pentenoate? That would be CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH2CH3. But that's seven carbons, which is too long.

Alternatively, the structure could be a six-carbon ester with a double bond and an ethoxy group. For example, ethyl 3-hexenoate, which is CH2CH2CH=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, but that's seven carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted acrylic acid ester. Wait, acrylic acid is CH2=CHCOOH. As an ester, it would be CH2=CHCOO-R. If R is ethyl, then the ester is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The formula would be C5H8O2. Our options are C6H10O2. So that's one carbon short.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3 (ethyl 3-pentenoate). That would be five carbons in the acid part and ethyl, making seven. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

C6H10O2 has a molecular weight of 114. If the molecule breaks into a 45 fragment and a 69 fragment, what would the 69 be?

69 could be C4H9O. Let's see: 4*12=48, 9=9, 16=16. 48+9+16=73. No, that's not 69. Alternatively, maybe it's C3H7O. 3*12=36 +7 +16=60. No. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment isn't from splitting off an ethoxy group but from cleavage elsewhere. For example, a ketone group could break off.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be a CH3CO+ ion. The molecular weight of CH3CO+ is 43. But 43 isn't 45. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2CH2O group, which is 45. So if the molecule has a CH2CH2O group, that could fragment.

So, putting it all together, the best fit seems to be option C: C6H10O2.

Because:

- The IR shows O-H (broad peak), which would come from a hydroxyl group, but in this case, perhaps it's part of a carbonyl group. Wait, no, the O-H is separate. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if it's an ester, there's no O-H. Unless it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's recap.

The FTIR peaks are:

- Broad peak at 3000 cm-1 → O-H (like alcohol or carboxylic acid)
- 1700 → C=O (ester, ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid)
- 1650 → possibly conjugated C=O, or a C=C

The NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond is present.

The mass spec shows a fragment at 45, likely C2H5O.

So the structure has an O-H group, a C=O, and a C=C.

So possible structures include a dienol or something similar, but not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal with a double bond and a carbonyl group. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a β-keto acid, which would have two carbonyl groups. But that would have higher IR peaks.

Wait, back to the molecular formula options. Let's list each and see what they imply.

Option A: C6H12O2 → DoU 1. Could be a ring and a carbonyl. But then, where is the double bond for the vinyl H?

Because the NMR has vinyl H, there must be a double bond. So if DoU is 1, that could be a ring plus a double bond, but that would require DoU 2, which isn't the case for option A. So option A probably doesn't fit.

Option B: C6H10O → DoU 2. So either two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

But the IR shows a carbonyl, which is a double bond. So that would account for one DoU, and the other could be a ring or another double bond.

But then, where's the O-H? The FTIR has a broad O-H peak, so O must be present. Option B has only one O. So if the O is in an alcohol group, then the structure has an O-H and a carbonyl group (from DoU 2: a ring or another double bond). But that would require two O's, which option B doesn't have. So I think option B is less likely.

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU 2. So perhaps a ring and a carbonyl, or two double bonds (like conjugated), or a carbonyl and a double bond.

In this case, the O-H could be from a carboxylic acid (which would require another O for the C=O). So the structure could be a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, but then the molecular formula would include O2.

So, for example, a structure like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. That's hex-3-enoic acid. Its formula would be C6H10O2. Yes.

Wait, let's compute that:

CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH → six carbons, with a double bond between C1 and C2.

The formula would be C6H10O2.

In this case, the FTIR would show:

- Broad O-H from the carboxylic acid at ~3000 cm-1
- C=O at ~1700
- C=C at ~1650 (maybe a bit lower than a typical alkene)

The NMR would show the vinyl hydrogens as a triplet or something, and the other protons as appropriate.

Mass spec: the molecular weight is 114. A fragment at 45 could be from cleavage. Let's imagine the molecule breaks at the double bond. If it breaks between C2 and C3, the resulting fragments would be CH2=CHCOOH (which is 72) and CH2CH2CH2 (which is 36). That doesn't add up to 45. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks off a smaller fragment.

But wait, the fragment at 45 is m/z=45. So in the case of hex-3-enoic acid, perhaps the base peak is from the cleavage of the COOH group. Wait, but carboxylic acids typically don't ionize easily. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of the COOH group. Wait, but that would leave a larger fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ester, like ethyl something, which would have an ethoxy group (m/z=45). So if the structure is an ester with an ethoxy group, then the fragment at 45 is from the ethoxy part.

So with that, the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.


The unknown compound has been analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The key observations and deductions are as follows:

1. **FTIR Analysis**:
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.
   - A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be from a carboxylic acid, ester, or ketone.
   - A peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or a C=C stretching vibration.

2. **¹H NMR Analysis**:
   - The presence of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicates the presence of a double bond (C=C).

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of a fragment with a molecular weight of 45. This is consistent with a C₂H₅O group (ethyl group attached to oxygen).

4. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**  
     Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This suggests either a ring or a double bond. However, the NMR data indicates the presence of a double bond (C=C), and the IR data suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). This option does not account for the observed O-H group.
   - **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**  
     Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2. This could correspond to a combination of a ring and a double bond or two double bonds. However, the IR data indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), which would require an additional oxygen, making this option unlikely.
   - **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**  
     Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2. This could correspond to a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond (C=C). The presence of an O-H group (from the IR data) and the fragment at m/z = 45 (C₂H₅O) further supports this option. A plausible structure is an ester with an ethoxy group and a conjugated carbonyl group.
   - **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**  
     Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This suggests either a ring or a double bond. However, the NMR data indicates the presence of a double bond (C=C), and the IR data suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), making this option unlikely.

5. **Conclusion**:
   The most consistent explanation for the given data is that the compound is **C₆H₁₀O₂**, which has a degree of unsaturation of 2, accounting for both the carbonyl group (C=O) and the double bond (C=C). The fragment at m/z = 45 corresponds to a C₂H₅O group, and the broad IR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group.
