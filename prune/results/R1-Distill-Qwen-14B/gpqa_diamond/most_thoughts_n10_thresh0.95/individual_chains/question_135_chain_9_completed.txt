Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f̄(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think I might have misread that. Oh right, it's probably L(y) = -λ_f f̄(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). But wait, maybe that's just a typo in the way it's presented. Anyway, the important part is that X is a boson interacting with fermions.

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing possible fermion-antifermion pairs.

So, first things first, I need to figure out which fermions X can decay into. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in particle physics, the rest mass energy has to be enough to create the pair.

But wait, what are the masses of the different fermions? Let me think.

I remember that the masses of the quarks are much lighter compared to the given mass of X (6 GeV). But wait, actually, the masses of up, down, strange, and charm quarks are around a few MeV to a few hundred MeV. For example, up and down are around 2-5 MeV, strange maybe 100 MeV, and charm about 1.5 GeV. Then the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. The top quark is much heavier, about 173 GeV. The leptons: electron is about 0.0005 GeV, muon around 0.1 GeV, tau around 1.77 GeV. 

Wait, but wait. The boson X is 6 GeV. So, for X to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So, each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV, because 2 * m_fermion <= 6 GeV => m_fermion <= 3 GeV.

So let's list the fermions and check their masses:

Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV → definitely allowed.

Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV → allowed.

Tau (τ): ~1.77 GeV → allowed, since 2*1.77 is about 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV.

Quarks:

Up (u): ~2-5 MeV → allowed.

Down (d): similar to up.

Strange (s): ~100 MeV → allowed.

Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV → 2*1.5 =3 GeV ≤6 → allowed.

Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV → 4.5*2=9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b bbar because 9 GeV >6 GeV. So b is out.

Top (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV. So no.

Now, looking at the options.

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, e+ e−.

Wait, but b is 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Wait, c is 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3 GeV <6 → allowed. Tau is 1.77, so 3.54 <6 → allowed. Muon, 0.2 GeV, 0.4 GeV <6. e is negligible. So yes, this looks possible. But wait, what about the other fermions like charm, strange, etc.

Option C: Same as B but includes t and b? No, because t is way too heavy. So, the option includes t, which is impossible. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Again, the b is a problem. So D includes b, which X can't decay into.

Wait, but what about the c quark and tau? Let me recheck.

So X can decay to c cbar (allowed since 2*1.5=3 <6), s sbar (2*0.1=0.2 <6), u and d (masses negligible), tau tau (2*1.77=3.54 <6). Also, leptons are allowed as their masses are way below 3 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all allowed. Option D includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct decays are all except those that require more than 6 GeV.

So among the options, option B is the one that includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Option B has c cbar, which is allowed.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? Because if X can't decay into b because 2*m_b is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So any option that includes b is incorrect.

So options A and D are out because they include b. So between B and C.

Option C includes t, which is way too heavy, so C is wrong. So the correct option is B.

Wait, but what about the fermion content of the Lagrangian? The given Lagrangian is L = -λ_f f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this represents Yukawa coupling terms. So the interaction is between the boson X and a fermion ψ_f. So which fermions are involved?

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ_f f̄(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, I think perhaps the notation is that f and ψ_f are the same? Or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is for each fermion f, involving ψ_f, which could be the same as f. So the interaction is with all possible fermions, as long as they are present in the theory.

Assuming that the problem is about the possible decay channels, the kinematics would depend only on the mass. So the fermions must have mass less than 3 GeV each.

So that allows all fermions except b and t.

Wait, but the quarks have different masses. So in the Standard Model, each quark has a mass. So for a fermion to be produced, the mass of the fermion must be <= 3 GeV.

So, the possible fermions are: e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. Because their masses are all less than 3 GeV (except for the b quark, which is 4.5 GeV, which is above 3 GeV).

So the decay products can be any pair of these fermions. So the possible decay channels are all pairs where each fermion has mass <=3 GeV.

Looking at the options, option B lists: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. That's all allowed except the b quark.

So the correct answer is option B. So the decays include c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair must be less than or equal to the boson's mass. This means each fermion's mass must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The masses of the known fermions are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up (\( u \)): \( \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down (\( d \)): \( \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange (\( s \)): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with masses \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). The bottom quark (\( b \)) and top quark (\( t \)) are excluded because their masses are too large (\( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \), respectively).

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \). All these fermion pairs satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so this option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is kinematically forbidden because \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden for the same reason as in Option A. Hence, this option is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.

Answer: B
