--- Full Content ---
Alright, I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and NMR spectra, which I can use to determine the structure of Compound X. Once I know what X is, I can figure out what happens when it reacts with those reagents.

Let me break down the IR data first. IR is useful for identifying functional groups. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which I think is a broad region, maybe due to an -OH stretch or an amine. Wait, but more specifically, 3400–2500 could indicate an O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol) or maybe an N-H stretch. But the presence of a 1720 cm-1 peak is crucial because that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is a typical region for a carboxylic acid (maybe around 1700, but sometimes higher) or an ester. Also, there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which might be from aromatic C=C stretching, possibly indicating substituents on a benzene ring.

Now looking at the NMR data, which is 1H NMR. The peaks are:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 usually suggests an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton because those are usually around 10-12 ppm. But wait, a carboxylic acid proton is typically broad because of hydrogen bonding, so that fits. But wait, another possibility is an aromatic proton... No, aromatic protons are usually lower, like in the 7-8 ppm range. So 10.5 would be a carboxylic acid -OH, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, another thought: maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, but the integration is 1H. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like from a phenol? Phenolic O-H can be around 10 ppm, but they are usually broader. Wait, but in DMSO, phenol O-H can be around 5 ppm. So maybe the solvent is CDCl3? Because in CDCl3, a phenolic O-H can appear around 5-7 ppm, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group like a ketone? No, ketones don't have protons.

Wait, perhaps it's an ester. Wait, no, esters have carbonyls but their protons are elsewhere. Let's think again. The broad signal at 10.5 ppm, integrating for one proton... Could that be a carboxylic acid proton? If so, that would mean Compound X has a carboxylic acid group. Because when a carboxylic acid proton is present, it's usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So maybe that's what it is.

Next, the NMR shows a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and each is a doublet. So, for example, in p-xylene, you have two doublets. So in the NMR, the two protons at each position would be split into doublets due to coupling with each other. So that's probably an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but if the substituents are in the para positions, then the two protons on the ring would be on adjacent carbons, or opposite? Let me think. If the substituent is on the para position, then the protons next to it would be in positions that are adjacent—like in 1,4 positions. So, for example, if the substituent is a methyl group in position 4, then the protons in positions 2 and 6 (assuming the substituent is at position 4) would each have two neighboring protons, but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that causes the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

Wait, another thought: if the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions, each causing the adjacent protons to be split. For example, a substituent in the para position (like a methyl) would lead to two sets of doublets for the adjacent protons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. Wait, but looking at the IR, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I thought was a carbonyl. So perhaps the aromatic ring has a carbonyl substituent. So, maybe the ring is a benzene ring with a substituent like a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, if the aromatic ring is para-substituted with a carbonyl group, like a benzoic acid, then the adjacent protons would be deshielded. But benzoic acid would have a -COOH group. So in that scenario, the NMR would have a peak for the COOH proton at around 10 ppm as a broad singlet, which matches the first peak. So that fits. Then the aromatic protons would be in two doublets, each with two protons, as para substitution, which matches the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm peaks.

Wait, but benzoic acid would have a structure like PhCOOH, so the aromatic ring would have a COOH group in one position, and perhaps another substituent in the para position. Alternatively, it could be a substituted benzoic acid. But in the NMR data, we have two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which suggests that the substituents are in the para positions. So perhaps the ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid) and the other is another group, maybe an alkoxy group or an alkyl group. Or perhaps the substituents are two different groups in the para positions.

Wait, but let's look at the other NMR signals. There's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be a methylene group adjacent to another group, perhaps a CH2 or a CH between two carbons. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)—maybe a CH2 group next to something else. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)—a methyl group attached to something that splits it into a doublet. Maybe a CH(CH3) group. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)—a terminal methyl group, like an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid), and the other is an alkyl chain with a branching.

Wait, considering the 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H, that's likely a methyl group attached to a CH that's part of a larger structure. For example, a (CH2) group attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to another CH2 group that leads to a terminal CH3. So maybe the structure is something like Ph-CO-O-R, but wait, the IR doesn't show an ester oxygen. Wait, the IR at 1720 could be a ketone, ester, or carboxylic acid. But the presence of a broad peak at 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid, because esters don't have that peak.

Wait, but another point: the IR also has a peak at 1720 cm-1. If it's a carboxylic acid, that's a bit higher than typical, but possible. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. But then, where's the O-H stretch? If it's an ester, O-H wouldn't be present, unless it's a hemiacetal or something. But the broad peak at 10.5 is more consistent with a carboxylic acid.

So, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a COOH group in position 4 and an isobutyl group in position 1 (if I'm numbering the ring correctly). Or maybe it's in position para to each other, like 4-COOH and 1-isobutyl.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. The aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm as doublets (each 2H) suggest that the substituents are in the para positions. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 (assuming the ring is numbered with substituents in positions 1 and 3), but wait no—para would be 1 and 4. So substituents in para would be positions 1 and 3? Wait, no. Wait, in a benzene ring, the para positions are 1 and 4. So if substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B at position 4, then the adjacent protons would be in positions 2 and 6 (for substituent A) and positions 3 and 5 (for substituent B). Those protons would each be next to substituents and thus might split into doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is in position 2 and substituent A in position 6, but that's not para. Maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me try to visualize the ring.

If the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions (positions 1 and 4), then each substituent would have two adjacent protons. For example, substituent in position 1 would have protons in positions 2 and 6, and substituent in position 4 would have protons in positions 3 and 5. Each of these adjacent protons would be split into a doublet due to coupling with each other. So in the NMR, if substituent 1 is a strong electron-withdrawing group (like COOH), the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be deshielded and appear downfield. Similarly, if substituent 4 is an electron-donating group (like an isobutyl group), the protons in positions 3 and 5 would be less deshielded, appearing upfield.

So in the NMR data, the two doublets (8.0 and 7.2 ppm) would correspond to these adjacent protons. The downfield peak (8.0 ppm) would be the protons next to the COOH group (since that's an electron-withdrawing group, causing the protons to be deshielded and appear downfield), and the protons next to the alkyl group (like isobutyl) would be upfield (7.2 ppm). That makes sense.

So, putting this together, the benzene ring has a COOH group in position 1 and an isobutyl group in position 4. Wait, but let me think about the isobutyl group structure. Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? Or wait, no. Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, wait. Isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH3? No, wait. The structure of isobutyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3), but that's not correct. Let me correct myself. The isobutyl group is actually -CH2CH(CH2CH3) or wait, no—the correct structure. Wait, iso-butyl is the substituent where the branch is on the second carbon. So it's -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. No, iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. The correct structure of iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, maybe I should draw it. So the iso-butyl group is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, iso-butyl is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)? No, that's tert-butyl. Wait, maybe I should think again. The butyl groups are:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (straight chain)
- iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3) ? No, wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. The correct structure of iso-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. Let me think: iso-butyl is a four-carbon group where the branching is on the second carbon. So it’s -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the iso-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but that would be longer. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me clarify:

Butyl groups:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (four carbons in a straight chain)
iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3) ? Wait, no. Wait, iso-butyl is actually CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, that’s not possible. Oh, wait, correct iso-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, iso-butyl is a three-carbon group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So it's CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, iso-butyl is actually CH2CH(CH3)2? Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to think of the structure as:

The iso-butyl group is –CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that would make it a four-carbon group with a branch on the second carbon. No, wait, iso-butyl is actually –CH2CH(CH2CH3)–? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's –CH(CH2CH3)CH2–. I think I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. Maybe it's better to move on and come back to that.

So, the NMR also shows peaks for the alkyl chain. The 2.9 ppm peak (m, 1H) could be a CH that is next to another CH2 group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is an iso-butyl group. So, the structure would be 4-isobutylbenzoic acid. Let me think about the structure. Benzoic acid has a COOH group. If the substituent is iso-butyl in the para position, the structure is 4-(isobutyl)benzoic acid. Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, the substituents in the benzene ring are at positions 1 and 4 for option D, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. But in our case, the substituents are para, so perhaps both substituents are in the 4 position and another position? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the NMR shows only two substituents on the benzene ring, right? Because the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each with two protons. So that suggests two substituents in the para positions. If one substituent is the COOH group, the other would be another group, perhaps an isobutyl or sec-butyl.

Wait, looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzoic acid group (COOH) at position 4, and a sec-butyl group at position 4 as well? No, that can't be possible because you can't have two substituents at the same position on a benzene ring. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. If the substituents are para to each other, then one is at position 1 and the other at position 4. So, if one substituent is the COOH group at position 1, the other would be the alkyl group at position 4. So the structure would be 4-(substituent)-benzoic acid, where the substituent is an isobutyl group.

So, the structure would be 4-isobutylbenzoic acid. But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that's a possibility.

Wait, but I thought the substituent was an isobutyl group. However, I'm a bit confused about the structure of the substituent.

Let me think about the NMR signals again. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group between two CH2 groups. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is likely a CH2 next to another CH2 or CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH (since it's a doublet), and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group.

So the substituent chain could be: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that would be a pentyl group? No, wait. Let me think: perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a methyl branch. For example, a propyl group where the middle CH has a methyl attached. So that would be a sec-butyl group. Wait, no. Let me draw it.

Suppose the substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain, but how? Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2–. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2–. No, wait. Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

Wait, another approach: the substituent likely has a branching because of the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) methyl group attached to a CH. That suggests a structure like CH(CH3) connected to another CH2 group. So the substituent is probably an isobutyl group, which is CH2CH(CH3)2. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, but that would make the group: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2–? No, perhaps I should look it up mentally. The correct structure for iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–. No, I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to think of the substituent as a branch with a CH(CH3) group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon, making it a sec-butyl group. So the substituent would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2–. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

The substituent in the NMR has a CH2 group at 1.7 ppm (2H, m), which is next to a CH group at 2.9 ppm (1H, m). The CH group is next to a CH(CH3) group (the 1.4 ppm d, 3H is a methyl attached to a CH), and that CH is next to another CH2 group leading to a terminal methyl (0.9 ppm, t, 3H).

So the substituent's structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain with branching on the second carbon. So that would be a iso-butyl group. Because iso-butyl is (CH2)2CH(CH3). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2–. No, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the substituent as:

The substituent is a four-carbon group where the branch is on the second carbon: so position 1 is a CH2, position 2 is a CH with a methyl group attached, and position 3 is another CH2 connected to a terminal CH3.

So the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's actually a straight chain. Hmm, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So it's a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But then the terminal would be CH2CH3, which would give a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). But wait, in that case, the structure would be a pentyl group? No, wait, perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a benzene ring with a methyl branch on the middle carbon. So, the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring. That would give a structure like benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So that would be a pentyl group? No, wait, that's iso-pentyl? Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. No, wait, that's not possible because CH(CH3)2 is a quaternary carbon. So that can't be attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH has a methyl group attached. So the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2–. But that would be a three-carbon group with a branch on the second carbon. So that's an iso-propyl group. But iso-propyl is CH(CH3)2, so that's a three-carbon group, but the NMR shows more carbons.

Wait, the NMR shows a chain with four carbons: the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, then a CH2 (1.7 ppm, m 2H), then a CH (2.9 ppm, m 1H), then another CH2 (maybe not, but perhaps a branching point). Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests that the CH2 group adjacent to the terminal CH3 is split into a triplet. So that CH2 would have two neighboring protons. So perhaps the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would be a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that's a longer chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, going back to the NMR data:

The substituent chain has:

- A terminal methyl (0.9 ppm, t, 3H)
- Then a CH2 (1.7 ppm, m, 2H)
- Then a CH (2.9 ppm, m, 1H)
- Then a CH3 attached as a doublet (1.4 ppm, d, 3H)

So, the structure would be:

The substituent attached to the benzene ring is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain: the substituent would be a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So that would make it a iso-butyl group. Because iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. Let me think again: the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That's a four-carbon group where the branch is on the second carbon. So, it's a iso-butyl group.

Wait, no. The iso-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. No, that's not correct. The correct structure of iso-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2–. Wait, that can't be. Maybe I should think of it as:

The substituent is a iso-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. But that can't be because it would require a quaternary carbon attached to the benzene. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, the structure would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2–. But then, the terminal CH3 would be on the third carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a iso-pentyl group, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the middle carbon. So, that would make it a iso-propyl group, but that's a three-carbon substituent.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the options. Let's look at the options again.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

So, if the substituents are para, the benzoic acid would be at position 1 and the alkyl group at position 4. So in option C, the substituents are 4-(sec-butyl) and the COOH is at position 1, which is the same as position 4 in a benzene ring? No, benzene is a six-membered ring, so position 1 and 4 are across from each other.

Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would have the COOH group at position 1 (assuming the substituent is numbered 4). Or wait, no, the numbering would have the COOH at position 1, and the sec-butyl at position 4.

So the structure would be:

Benzoic acid with a substituent at position 4. The substituent is a sec-butyl group.

What's a sec-butyl group? The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2–, attached to the benzene.

Wait, but the substituent's structure would then be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2–, which is a four-carbon group with a branch on the second carbon. So the structure would be:

Ph-COOH at position 1, and at position 4, a substituent -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a five-carbon substituent? No, wait, that's four carbons: benzene-COOH, then a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3), connected to another CH2, connected to a CH3.

Wait, perhaps that's a pentyl group. No, wait, if it's a butyl group, it's four carbons. So, the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon. That's a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1. So the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

But wait, let me think about the NMR again.

In the NMR, the substituent's protons would be:

The terminal CH3 is at 0.9 ppm, triplet (because adjacent to a CH2). Then the CH2 next to it is at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which would be split into a multiplet due to coupling with both the adjacent CH and the next CH2. Then, the CH in the middle is at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which would be coupled with both the adjacent CH2 and the next CH2. Then, the CH(CH3) group would have a methyl group at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a doublet because it's attached to a CH that's connected to another group.

So, the substituent structure must be a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group, which is a iso-butyl group. Because, in that structure, the CH(CH3) is connected to two CH2 groups.

Wait, but in an iso-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)2. No, that's not possible because that would require three CH3 groups on a single carbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me get back to the substituent. The NMR shows:

- 0.9 ppm, t, 3H: terminal CH3.
- 1.7 ppm, m, 2H: adjacent CH2.
- 2.9 ppm, m, 1H: CH connected to the benzene.
- 1.4 ppm, d, 3H: CH3 attached to a CH.

So, the structure is:

Benzene ring attached to a CH group (at 2.9 ppm), which is attached to a CH2 group (1.7 ppm), which is attached to a CH(CH3) group (1.4 ppm, d), which is attached to another CH2 group (but wait, no, because the 1.7 is a CH2, so perhaps the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch on the third carbon. But then the NMR would show a triplet for the terminal CH3, a quartet for the adjacent CH2, and so on. But in our case, the NMR shows a triplet for the terminal CH3, a multiplet for the adjacent CH2, and so on.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Which would be a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon. Hmm, but that's a four-carbon substituent (butyl) with a branch on the second carbon. So that would be a iso-butyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the substituent structure. Let's think about the reaction. The problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What kind of reaction is that?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used to perform a substitution reaction, especially to replace a halogen. Alternatively, more specifically, they can be used in the hydrolysis of certain groups. Wait, but wait, red phosphorus with HI is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction? No, that's for ketones and amines. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines, but that's with water. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hunsdiecker reaction, but I
