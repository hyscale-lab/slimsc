Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of x and y. So this is a 2D spacetime? Or maybe a surface in higher dimensions. Not sure yet.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, pseudosphere—wait, that's a term from hyperbolic geometry. A pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. But wait, sometimes in general relativity, a pseudosphere could refer to a surface in 2D with a specific metric.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere—like, how is area calculated in this metric? So in general, the area in a 2D metric would involve an integral over the coordinates, with the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor.

So the metric here is given as ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me write that in terms of components. The metric tensor g would have g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms g_{xy} and g_{yx} would be zero. So it's a diagonal metric.

The area element dA in a 2D metric is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is just (g_xx)(g_yy) - 0 = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the sqrt of that is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element would be dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but wait, that's the area element for this metric. But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Wait, maybe I should think about what this metric represents.

Looking at the denominator, 4 - x² - y². That looks a bit like the equation of a circle. Because x² + y² = 4 would be a circle of radius 2. So the denominator is (4 - (x² + y²)) = (2² - (x² + y²)).

So the domain of this metric is where 4 - x² - y² is positive, because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative, leading to a problem with the metric (like singularities or imaginary terms). So the region is x² + y² < 4. So the valid area is inside a circle of radius 2.

But wait, what's the connection to a pseudosphere? A pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. Wait, the metric might be that of a hyperbolic space. Another thought: in 2D, the metric for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(y²), but that's for the upper half-plane. Alternatively, in the Poincaré disk model, it's ds² = (4 dx² + 4 dy²)/(4 - x² - y²)^2. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = [4 (dx² + dy²)] / (4 - (x² + y²))². Hmm, but in our case, the metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So that's 32 (dx² + dy²) divided by (4 - x² - y²). So that's not the same as the Poincaré disk model.

Wait, maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature for this metric to see if it's a pseudosphere. Because a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature.

For a 2D metric in the form ds² = E(x, y) (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula involving the determinant and its derivatives. Alternatively, for a metric that's conformally flat, like this one (since it's a multiple of dx² + dy²), we can compute the curvature.

The conformal factor here is E(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). The Gaussian curvature K for a metric E(dx² + dy²) is given by:

K = (-1/(2E)) * [ (d²E)/(dxdy) - (d²E)/(dx²) - (d²E)/(dy²) ) ] + ( ( (dE/dx)^2 + (dE/dy)^2 ) )/( 2 E^2 ) )

Wait, maybe there's a simpler formula. Alternatively, since it's conformally flat, the curvature can be found using the formula:

K = ( (Δ sqrt(E)) ) / (2 E )

Where Δ is the Laplacian operator. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe for a metric E(dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = ( (E_x E_y) - (E_{xx} + E_{yy}) ) / (2 E^2 )

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it in a different way.

Wait, let me try to compute the Gaussian curvature. The formula for Gaussian curvature for a 2D metric is:

K = (1/(2E)) [ (E_x E_y) - E_{xx} - E_{yy} ]

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I remember that for a metric ds² = A(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = -(1/(2A)) * ( (A_x)_y - (A_y)_x ) + ( (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 )/( 4 A^2 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature using the formula:

K = - [ ( (ln A)_{xx} + (ln A)_{yy} ) + ( ( (ln A)_x )^2 + ( (ln A)_y )^2 ) ) ] / 2

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the Ricci scalar for this metric. Since it's a 2D metric, the Ricci scalar R is equal to 2K, where K is the Gaussian curvature. So if I can compute R, I can find K.

For a 2D metric ds² = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j, the Ricci scalar is given by R = ( (g^{ij} R_{ij} ) ) / sqrt(g), but that might not be the easiest way.

Wait, in 2D, the Ricci scalar can be calculated using:

R = ( (g^{ij} (partial_k g_{ij}) ) ) / sqrt(g) )_{,k}  ?

Hmm, perhaps another way: The Ricci scalar in 2D is given by:

R = (2 (g^{αβ} ∂_β ∂_α ln sqrt(g) )) )

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should instead consider the form of the metric.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the metric in polar coordinates. Let me try that.

Let me switch to polar coordinates where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ².

So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ² )

Hmm, now the metric looks like:

ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) dr² + (32 r²/(4 - r²)) dθ².

Wait, but in polar coordinates, the metric for a flat space would have ds² = dr² + r² dθ². So this one is scaled by a factor of 32/(4 - r²) in both terms.

So the line element is conformally flat, with a conformal factor of sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

Wait, perhaps the Gaussian curvature is easier to compute in polar coordinates. Let me recall that in polar coordinates, the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - (1/(2 r)) [ (ln A)_{rr} + (1/r) (ln A)_θθ + ... ] 

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach. For a metric in polar coordinates:

ds² = A(r) ( dr² + r² dθ² )

The Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = (1/(2 A)) [ (A')/(r) ) + (A)/(2 r²) ) ]

Wait, maybe not. Another approach: The Gaussian curvature K in polar coordinates can be found using:

K = - (1/(2 r)) [ (d/dr)( (ln A) / r ) ) + (1/r^2) (d² (ln A)/ dθ² ) ]

Wait, but since A doesn't depend on θ, the second term (in θ) will be zero. So,

K = - (1/(2 r)) [ (d/dr)( (ln A)/r ) ]

So let me compute that. Let A(r) = 32/(4 - r²).

So ln A = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

d/dr (ln A) = 0 - ( -2 r )/(4 - r² ) = (2 r)/(4 - r² )

Now, (ln A)/r = [ (ln 32) - ln(4 - r²) ] / r 

So d/dr ( (ln A)/r ) = [ (2 r)/(4 - r²) ) * (1/r) ) + ( ln(4 - r²) - ln(32) ) * ( derivative of 1/r ) ]

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

Let me denote B(r) = (ln A)/r = [ ln(32/(4 - r²)) ] / r.

So dB/dr = [ derivative of ln(32/(4 - r²)) ] * (1/r) ) + [ ln(32/(4 - r²)) ] * ( derivative of 1/r )

Wait, the derivative of ln(32/(4 - r²)) is [ ( derivative of numerator ) / ( numerator ) ]

Wait, the derivative of ln(32) is zero, and the derivative of ln(4 - r²) is ( -2 r )/(4 - r² )

So derivative of ln(32/(4 - r²)) = (0) - ( -2 r/(4 - r²) ) ) = (2 r)/(4 - r²)

So,

dB/dr = (2 r)/(4 - r²) * (1/r) ) + [ ln(32/(4 - r²)) ] * ( -1 / r² )

Simplify:

= (2)/(4 - r²) ) - [ ln(32/(4 - r²)) ] / r² 

Now, putting this back into the expression for K:

K = - (1/(2 r)) * [ 2/(4 - r²) - ln(32/(4 - r²)) / r² ]

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because K should be a constant if this is a pseudosphere, right? Because a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature.

Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the metric again.

Wait, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me think about the possible coordinate system. The denominator is 4 - r², where r² = x² + y². So the domain is r² <4.

So the metric is defined for r <2. But wait, in 2D, the pseudosphere is an infinite surface, but in this case, the metric is only defined up to r=2, beyond which it's singular.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing pseudosphere as a surface with constant negative curvature, which is infinite in extent, but in this problem, perhaps the radius refers to the boundary at r=2. So perhaps the area is being considered up to that radius.

But wait, if the metric is only valid for r <2, then the surface described by r=2 is the boundary, maybe a circle of radius 2 in some sense.

Wait, but in our case, the metric is conformally flat, so the area element is scaled by 32/(4 - r²).

Wait, but if I'm to compute the area enclosed by a circle of radius r=2, but in this metric, r=2 is the boundary where the denominator becomes zero. So perhaps that's a point at infinity, or maybe the area is up to that point.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is computed by integrating the area element over the entire allowed region.

Wait, the allowed region is x² + y² <4. So integrating over the entire disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Wait, but the area element in this metric isn't flat, it's scaled by 32/(4 - r²).

So the area A is ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

In polar coordinates, the area element would be [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So integrating from r=0 to r=2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So,

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

We can factor out the constants:

32 ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

Now the radial integral: ∫0^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me substitute u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr.

So, when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So, the integral becomes ∫ (4 to 0) [ r / u ] (-du/2r )

The r in numerator and denominator cancels, and the negative flips the limits:

(1/2) ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du = (1/2) [ ln u ] from 0 to4.

Wait, but ln u as u approaches 0 is negative infinity. So the integral from 0 to4 is ln4 - ln0 → infinity.

Wait, that's a problem. The integral diverges. So the area would be 32 * (2π) * (infinite) → infinity.

But wait, the radial integral is from r=0 to r=2. So let's compute it step by step.

The integral ∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make substitution u =4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So,

∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ] = ∫ ( (-1/2) du ) / u = (-1/2) ln |u| + C.

Evaluating from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2: u=4 -4=0 → ln0 = -infinite.

At r=0: u=4 → ln4.

So,

[ (-1/2)( ln0 ) ] - [ (-1/2)( ln4 ) ] = [ (-1/2)( -infinite ) ] + (1/2) ln4 → (infinite) + (finite).

So the integral diverges to infinity. Thus, the area is infinite.

Wait, but that's the area of the entire space described by this metric. Because the metric is defined for r <2, but the area up to that point is infinite.

So the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. If the pseudosphere in this context refers to the entire surface described by this metric, which extends up to r=2, then the area is infinite.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) 0 → No, area can't be zero.

Option B) 4π(x² + y²) → But that's a function dependent on x and y, which doesn't make sense for the total area.

Option C) 4π(x² - y²) → Same issue, dependent on x and y.

Option D) +infinite → That matches our conclusion.

So the correct answer should be D.


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D spacetime. The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute this, we first recognize that the metric is conformally flat, with the conformal factor \( E(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The area element in this metric is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then computed by integrating over the entire domain of the metric. The metric is valid for \( r < 2 \), as the denominator \( 4 - r^2 \) becomes singular at \( r = 2 \). Thus, the area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Factoring out constants:

\[
A = 32 \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The angular integral evaluates to \( 2\pi \). For the radial integral, we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This integral diverges because \( \ln u \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). Therefore, the total area is infinite. This implies that the pseudosphere described by this metric has infinite extent, consistent with the fact that pseudospheres in hyperbolic geometry are infinite surfaces.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is clearly not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is a function dependent on \( x \) and \( y \), which is not meaningful for the total area.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, for the same reason as option B.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the area diverges to infinity.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.

Answer: D
