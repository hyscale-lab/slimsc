Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let me see what the question says.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with cyanide can form nitriles through a substitution. But wait, substitution usually happens in aliphatic positions. Butan-2-one is a ketone, so it's (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN-, under certain conditions, it should undergo nucleophilic addition.

Wait, but substitution? Oh, wait, maybe it's a hydrocyanation. Or wait, no, because hydrocyanation would be adding HCN to the carbonyl, not substituting. But NaCN in a protic solvent perhaps?

Wait, another thought: maybe it's the Beckmann rearrangement or something else. Or maybe it's a condensation reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone reacting with a cyanide to form a cyanohydrin.

Oh, right! The cyanohydrin formation. When a ketone reacts with hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or a cyanide ion in a suitable condition, it forms a cyanohydrin. The reaction is a nucleophilic addition where the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group. But wait, in this case, the product is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So that's exactly the cyanohydrin formation.

But wait, the reagent here is NaCN, not HCN. So how does that work? I remember that in the presence of an acid catalyst, the nucleophilic addition can occur. So maybe reagent A is an acid. Because without acid, the cyanide might not be a strong enough nucleophile.

So for the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and acid (like H3O+) would form the cyanohydrin. So reagent A is H3O+.

Now looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl
Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH
Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl
Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ in options A and B.

Now the second reaction is about converting a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is the corresponding carboxylic acid.

So how do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I remember that typically, you might hydrolyze the nitrile. The common methods are acidic or basic hydrolysis. 

In the presence of water (H2O) and an acid catalyst, like HCl, the nitrile can undergo hydrolysis. Alternatively, using a strong base might give a carboxylic acid after acid workup.

Wait, but the reaction here says that reagent B is H2O. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis using H2O as the solvent, and B is the catalyst.

So the conditions for nitrile to carboxylic acid could be strong acid and heat. So for the second reaction, I think the reagent B is HCl. Because when you hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids, you usually use HCl (like in H2SO4 and H2O with heat, or more commonly, conc. HCl and H2O with heat).

Wait, another thought: Alternatively, sometimes you might use a base like aqueous NaOH, but that would give a sodium carboxylate, which would then be acidified to get the carboxylic acid. But in this case, the product is the carboxylic acid, so perhaps the reaction is done under acidic conditions.

So B is HCl. Looking at the options, in option A, B is HCl; option C has B as HCl. So which options have A as H3O+ and B as HCl? Option A and option C have A as H3O+ and NaHSO3, respectively.

Wait, no. Let me check options again. Option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. Option C is A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

So for the first reaction, we thought A is H3O+.

So for the second reaction, B is HCl. So the correct option is the one where A is H3O+ and B is HCl. That would be option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Another possibility: in the second reaction, perhaps reagent B isn't the acid. The question says reagent B is H2O. So the reaction is with H2O as a reagent, perhaps in the presence of an acid or a base.

Wait the question says "B (H2O)"—so I think that means that H2O is the reagent, but there might be another component. Wait, the way the question is written is a bit unclear. Let me read it again.

"2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid"

So B is H2O. Hmm, but H2O alone might not be enough. So perhaps the reaction is under acidic conditions. Or maybe B is the acid.

Wait, perhaps the reagent is HCl (B), and H2O is the solvent?

Wait, no. The way the question is written, the reaction is: [compound] + B (H2O) → product. So B is H2O, but perhaps there's another component. Or, perhaps B includes H2O and another catalyst. Maybe I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, perhaps B is a catalyst, and H2O is the solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is a reagent that is H2O along with an acid.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, which suggests that the nitrile is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. So the reaction would involve H2O (as a solvent or reactant) and an acid catalyst.

Wait, but in the question, reagent B is given as H2O. So perhaps the reagent is H2O along with an acid. Hmm, but the way the question is written, B is H2O. That's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is under basic conditions. Let me think again.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions gives a carboxylic acid. Under basic conditions, it gives a carboxylate. So if the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction must be under acidic conditions. So in the second reaction, B should be an acid, like HCl.

Wait but looking at the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. So perhaps H2O is the solvent, and B is the acid. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternate approach: let's think about the first reaction again. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that suggests that the carbonyl group is converted to a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. That is the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (protonating the carbonyl oxygen to make it more electrophilic). So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

So the options where A is H3O+ are options A and B.

Now for the second reaction, which reagent B is involved. The product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile must have undergone hydrolysis under acidic conditions. So the second reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid, which would require H2O and an acid (like HCl). So B would be an acid.

Looking at the options, when A is H3O+ (options A and B), then for B:

Option A: B is HCl.

Option B: B is CH3COOH.

So which is correct?

Wait, the reaction in the second step is nitrile to carboxylic acid. The common way to do this is to hydrolyze the nitrile under strongly acidic conditions, typically with HCl and heat. So B would be HCl.

So between options A and C, but option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. That fits.

Wait, but wait, let me check the reaction conditions for nitrile hydrolysis. Another method is using H2O under acidic conditions, perhaps with H2SO4. So sometimes, in the presence of H2O and acid, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.

So in the second reaction, perhaps B is the acid (like HCl). So in the reaction, reagent B is HCl. So in the options, which have A as H3O+ and B as HCl is option A.

So the correct answer would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, now looking at the other options to see if any fit better. What about option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I'm not sure how that would be used in the first reaction. Oh, wait, another reaction: sometimes, ketones react with sodium bisulfite to form bisulfite adducts, but that's more about the acidity of the carbonyl. But for cyanohydrin formation, I think acid is needed, not a bisulfite.

So I think the first reaction requires an acid like H3O+, so options A and B are candidates.

Thus, putting it all together, the correct reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon by CN⁻, which is facilitated by an acid catalyst. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the suitable acid catalyst for this reaction, making reagent A = H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This hydrolysis reaction typically requires water (H₂O) and an acid catalyst. Among the options, HCl is a strong acid commonly used for this purpose, making reagent B = HCl.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, CH₃COOH is not typically used for nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for cyanohydrin formation, as it does not act as an acid catalyst in this context.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
