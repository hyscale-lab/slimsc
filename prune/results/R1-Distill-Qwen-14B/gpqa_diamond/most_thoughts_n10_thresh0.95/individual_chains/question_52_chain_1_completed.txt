Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a star with certain parameters. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so when the star doesn't have spots, compared to when it does.

Hmm, I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels in a star's atmosphere is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two states based on their energies and the temperature. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the Teff is lower. Let me think about how temperature affects this ratio.

First, the energy difference between the two levels is related to the wavelength of the transition. The transition corresponds to about 1448 Å. Using the formula E = hc/λ. But I don't think I need the actual energies because we're looking for a ratio. Maybe the temperature change is enough.

But wait, the star's effective temperature has changed. So the overall temperature affects the population ratio. When the star has spots, 40% of the surface is covered, and the overall Teff is lower. I think the effective temperature is an average, so maybe each spot affects the local temperature, but the problem says the overall Teff is 5500 K, so perhaps we can model the whole photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but the question is about the photosphere. Spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when the spots are present, the average Teff is lower. But the photosphere is where the star emits most of its light, so the overall emission is a combination of the spotted and unspotted areas.

But for the purpose of the Boltzmann equation in the photosphere, I think each region (spot and non-spot) would have different temperatures. But the problem states that when spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, maybe the problem is considering the effective temperature as the average, but the actual photosphere has regions at different temperatures. But wait, the question says "in the stellar photosphere"—so perhaps the photosphere's temperature is effectively lower in the spotted case.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again. When the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. But the ratio is measured in the photosphere. Do spots cause the entire photosphere to cool, or do they just create cooler regions on a hotter surface?

I think the star's photosphere when not spotted is at 6000 K. If 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. But the photosphere's temperature distribution changes. But when considering emission lines, like the Ti ratio, it's the local temperature that matters. But the problem says, "in the stellar photosphere"—so perhaps the overall effect is an average.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the entire photosphere as being at the effective temperature. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, meaning the photosphere is cooler on average.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the spots are cooler than the surrounding. So perhaps the observed ratio is a combination of the two regions. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K in that case.

Alternatively, maybe the star's total luminosity changes. The Teff is related to the luminosity by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So when 40% of the surface is cooler, the total luminosity would be less than when the entire surface is at 6000 K.

But the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So the ratio depends on the local temperature of the regions where Ti is present.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The star's surface without spots has Teff 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is spotted, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But the spots are cooler, so the unspotted regions must be hotter to bring the average down. Or do they? Wait, actually, spots are cooler than the surrounding. So if 40% is covered by spots (lets say at T_spot), the remaining 60% is at T_unspotted, which is higher than 6000 K, because the overall Teff is lower than 6000 K.

Wait, let me think about the calculation. The overall Teff^4 is a weighted average of the areas. The Stefan-Boltzmann law for each region would contribute to the total luminosity. So the total luminosity would be L = L_unspotted + L_spotted.

Where L_unspotted is 0.6 * (R^2 σ (T_unspotted)^4) ) and L_spotted is 0.4 * (R^2 σ (T_spot)^4) )

But the total luminosity also equals (R^2 σ (Teff_total)^4 )

So,

0.6*(T_unspotted)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4 = (5500)^4

But without spots, the entire surface is at 6000 K. So when the star is without spots, Teff is 6000 K.

But when 40% spots are present, T_unspotted must be higher than 6000 K, and T_spot is lower. Let's say T_spot is less than 6000 K, and T_unspotted is more than 6000 K. Let me compute T_unspotted.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Because the problem says, when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% is covered, the overall Teff (as measured from the star's luminosity) is 5500 K. So, the entire star's average is 5500 K.

But the photosphere—each part is either at T_spot or T_unspotted. So the observed line ratio (Ti levels) would be a mixture of the two regions. Because the line comes from the photosphere, which includes both spotted and unspotted regions.

But the problem states that the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two levels decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio is (n2/n1)_spotted < (n2/n1)_unspotted. Because the spots are cooler regions, and the unspotted regions are hotter? Or wait, no. Let me think about the ratio.

The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels. For higher temperatures, the exponential factor is larger, so the ratio increases. Because if T increases, the denominator k T is bigger, so the exponent is smaller (since ΔE is positive), so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) becomes larger, making n2/n1 larger.

Wait, actually, ΔE = E2 - E1. If E2 > E1, then ΔE is positive. So if T increases, the exponent becomes smaller (because denominator is bigger), so exp(-ΔE/(kT)) increases. So n2/n1 increases with T. Therefore, when the star has spots, if the temperature is lower, the ratio n2/n1 would be lower. Which is what the problem says: the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio is lower when the photosphere is cooler.

But wait, the star with spots has a lower overall Teff, but the actual regions with Ti are a mix of hotter and cooler regions. So perhaps the line ratio is a combination of the two regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying it by considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present.

But in reality, the photosphere would have some regions hotter and some cooler. So the line ratio would be an average of the two regions.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to model it.

First, compute the energy levels. The transition is at 1448 Å. So the energy difference ΔE = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light. Let me compute ΔE.

But for the purpose of the ratio, perhaps I can compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two temperatures.

Wait, but what are the temperatures here? When there are no spots, the photosphere (or the regions without spots) are at 6000 K. When there are spots, 40% of the surface is at T_spot (cooler), and 60% is at T_unspotted (hotter).

But in the case of spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the effective temperature is a combination of the two regions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, which simplifies the calculation.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the problem again. When the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere is now at 5500 K.

Wait, but that would mean that the entire photosphere is cooler, which may not be the case. Spots are just cooler regions on the surface; the rest is at a higher temperature.

But the problem says that when 40% is covered, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the star's overall emission is as if the entire surface were at 5500 K. But the actual photosphere has varying temperatures.

But the line ratio is measured in the photosphere, which includes both regions. So the observed ratio would be a weighted average of the ratios from the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is simply asking us to compare the ratio when the photosphere is at 6000 K to when it's at 5500 K. That would make the problem simpler.

Let me try that approach. So, the ratio of n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-h c/(λ k T)).

So the ratio without spots (T=6000 K) and with spots (T=5500 K) would give a factor of (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = [exp(-h c/(λ k (6000)))] / [exp(-h c/(λ k (5500)))].

Wait, but wait. The formula for the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So the ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming g2/g1 is the same in both cases (which it probably is, since we're considering the same element and ionization state).

So, let me compute the ratio of the ratios.

Factor = (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = [exp( -ΔE/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k * 5500) ) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( [ΔE/(k) ] ( 1/5500 - 1/6000 ) )

Wait, let me compute the exponent.

ΔE = hc / λ.

So plugging that in:

[ΔE/(k)] (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (hc/(λ k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000)

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000:

= (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) )
= 500 / (33,000,000)
= 1 / 66,000

So,

(hc/(λ k)) * (1/66000 )

But λ is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1.448e-8 meters.

Compute hc/(λ k):

h = 6.626e-34 J s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1.448e-7 m (wait, 1448 Angstroms is 1.448e-8 meters? Wait, 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 m, so 1448 Angstroms = 1.448e-7 m.

Wait, yes: 1e-10 m * 1448 = 1.448e-7 m.

So,

hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

λ = 1.448e-7 m

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So,

hc/(λ k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 )

Compute denominator: 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = 1.448 *1.38e-30 ≈ 1.989e-30.

So, numerator is 1.9878e-25.

So,

1.9878e-25 / 1.989e-30 ≈ (1.9878 / 1.989) * 1e5 ≈ approx 1e5.

So, hc/(λ k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 divided by 1.989e-30 is:

1.9878e-25 / 1.989e-30 = (1.9878/1.989) * 1e5 ≈ (0.999) * 1e5 ≈ 99900 ≈ ~1e5 K.

So, (hc/(λ k)) ≈ 1e5 K.

Now, the exponent becomes (1e5 K) * (1/66000) ) = 1e5 / 66000 ≈ 1.515 approx.

So, the exponent is approximately 1.515.

Then, the factor is exp(1.515). Let's compute that.

e^1.515 ≈ e^1.5 is about 4.48, e^1.6 is about 4.95. Wait, 1.515 is just a bit above 1.5.

Let me compute it more accurately.

We can recall that ln(4.5) is about 1.504. So 1.515 is approx 4.54? So exp(1.515) ≈ 4.54.

Wait, let me check:

ln(4.5) ≈ 1.504077.

So 1.515 is 0.01093 above ln(4.5). So e^(1.515) = e^(1.504077 + 0.010923) )= 4.5 * e^0.010923.

e^0.010923 ≈ 1 + 0.010923 + (0.010923)^2/2 ≈ 1.010923 + 0.000059 ≈ 1.010982.

So, 4.5 * 1.010982 ≈ 4.5494.

So approximately 4.55.

So the factor is about 4.55.

Wait, but earlier I considered the factor as (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/5500 -1/6000) ) ) = exp(1.515) ≈4.54.

But the question is about the ratio when the star does not have spots (6000 K) compared to when it has spots (5500 K), which is the same factor: 4.54.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

But wait, I'm making an assumption here that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that's not correct because the photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions. So maybe I should model it as a combination.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to treat the entire photosphere as being at the effective temperature when spots are present. So, when no spots, T=6000 K; when spots, T=5500 K.

But in reality, the photosphere is a mix, which complicates things. However, perhaps the problem simplifies it by considering that the overall photosphere is at 5500 K.

So, in that case, the factor would indeed be ~4.5, so option C.

But wait, another thought: the ratio of Ti levels is a function of temperature. So when the effective temperature drops, the ratio n2/n1 decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower.

So the question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. So, factor = (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

Which, as we computed, is about 4.5.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the star's photosphere as a sum of the two regions, and the line ratio is a blend of the two regions. So the observed ratio would be a weighted average of the two.

So, let me compute T_unspotted and T_spot.

We know that the effective temperature when 40% is covered is 5500 K.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the total luminosity is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

When there are spots, the total luminosity L = 0.6 L_unspotted + 0.4 L_spotted.

Each L_unspotted is 4π R² σ T_unspotted^4 per unit area, but since the area is 60% of the total, L_unspotted = 0.6 * 4π R² σ T_unspotted^4. Wait, no. Wait, the entire unspotted area is 60% of the surface. So L_unspotted = 0.6 * (4π R²) * σ T_unspotted^4 / (4π R²) ) → no, wait, L_unspotted = 0.6 * (4π R²) * σ T_unspotted^4 / (4π R²) )? No, that can't be right.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: the star's total luminosity when spots are present is L = L_unspotted + L_spotted.

Each of these is the surface area multiplied by the flux from each region.

Flux from unspotted: 0.6 A * σ T_unspotted^4, where A is the total surface area (4π R²). Similarly, spotted: 0.4 A * σ T_spot^4.

So L = (0.6 A σ T_unspotted^4) + (0.4 A σ T_spot^4) ) 

And the total luminosity is also equal to (A σ Teff^4 ), since Teff is the effective temperature.

So,

0.6 T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 = Teff^4

We know Teff is 5500 K when spots are present. Without spots, Teff is 6000 K.

But without spots, the entire surface is unspotted, so T_unspotted = 6000 K.

Wait, but when spots are present, T_unspotted must be higher than 6000 K because the average Teff is lower than 6000 K.

Wait, let me compute that.

When there are no spots, Teff = 6000 K.

When 40% is covered by spots, the average Teff is 5500 K.

So,

0.6 T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 = (5500)^4

But without spots, T_unspotted would be 6000 K, but when spots are present, T_unspotted is higher.

Wait, but I don't know T_spot. Let me assume that the spots are at a lower temperature, say T_spot = ?

Alternatively, perhaps the spots have a temperature lower than 6000 K, but I don't have their exact value. So I can't compute T_unspotted without more information.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to proceed under the assumption that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, which would simplify the calculation.

So, going back to the initial approach, the factor is approximately 4.5, so option C.

Another way to think: the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( - h c/(λ k T) ). So the ratio when T=6000 is R1, and when T=5500 is R2. The factor is R1/R2 = exp( (h c/(λ k )) (1/(5500) - 1/(6000)) )

Which is the same as before.

So, the factor is about 4.5.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of the ratios when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{5500}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is related to the wavelength of the transition (\( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \)) by \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light. Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.37 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

The term \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \) is then:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.37 \times 10^{-19}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9920 \, \text{K}.
\]

The difference in the inverse temperatures is:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33 \times 10^6} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) \approx 9920 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.515.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.515) \approx 4.54.
\]

This matches closely with option \( \text{C} \) (\( \sim 4.5 \)).

ANSWER: C
