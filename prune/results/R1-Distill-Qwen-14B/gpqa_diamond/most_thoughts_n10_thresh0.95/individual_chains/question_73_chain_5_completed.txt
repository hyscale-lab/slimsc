Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds, so I can't just use regular classical mechanics. I remember that at speeds close to the speed of light, you have to use special relativity principles.

The problem states: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting their speeds like in classical mechanics. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at speeds u and v relative to a common frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, which direction is which? Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, the astronaut with the higher speed is moving faster. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, denominator: 1 - (0.6 *0.5) c² / c². So that's 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. Numerator is 0.1c. So 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.142857c, which is roughly 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's one part done, the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Now for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. Oh wait, but wait, the system's total energy would be the sum of their individual energies. Right, because energy is additive in relativity, considering each object's frame.

So, each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c². Let me compute each gamma.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = Gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So energy E2 = Gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So the total energy is approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2 and v=0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc² and same v. So the correct total energy is 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, wait, the question specifies 'the total energy of the system'. Wait, but in relativity, the total energy of a system isn't just the sum of the energies of each object unless you're considering their rest frames. Or perhaps, maybe they're considering the combined system in the center of momentum frame or something else? No, wait, the problem just asks for the total energy, which would be the sum of their energies in the same reference frame.

Wait, the problem states that the two astronauts are moving in the same direction, so perhaps each is in their own frame, but the question is about the system's energy. So yes, the total energy would be the sum of their energies as observed in the rest frame where the system's center of momentum is at rest. Wait no, no, wait. When the problem says "the total energy of the system", I think it's referring to the sum of their energies in the same inertial frame, perhaps the lab frame (assuming that's where they are both observed). But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's total energy is the sum of their energies as measured in the same frame. Let me check: the problem says "the total energy of the system". So it's possible that the system's rest frame is considered. But that's more complicated. Wait, in the center-of-momentum frame, the total energy would be the sum of the energies as observed in that frame, but that frame might have a different velocity. But the question is not clear on that. Hmm.

Wait, the problem is probably just asking for the sum of each astronaut's energy as measured in the rest frame of the first astronaut or the other, but that's more complicated. No, I think the problem is simply asking for the sum of their energies as observed from the same frame, perhaps the lab frame where both are moving. Because each astronaut is observed moving in the same direction, but the problem doesn't specify a particular frame. Wait, perhaps the problem is just looking for the sum of their energies as measured in the lab frame where they're both moving. Or maybe the lab frame is the one where one of them is stationary. Oh, wait no, because both are moving in the same direction, their velocities are given relative to some frame, perhaps the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rest frame of the combined system, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of both energies in the same frame, say the lab frame where each is moving at 0.6c and 0.5c.

Wait, but in reality, if the two astronauts are moving in the same direction, their velocities are measured from the same frame, perhaps the lab frame. So their energies would be E1 and E2 as computed earlier, and the sum would be about 5.96 mc². So that would correspond to option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Looking back, option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc², which matches my earlier calculations.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using principles of special relativity.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds \( u \) and \( v \) in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

The denominator simplifies to \( 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \), and the numerator is \( 0.1c \). Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

This matches the relative speed of \( 0.14c \) in options C and D.

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \( 2m \), Speed \( 0.6c \))
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \( 3m \), Speed \( 0.5c \))
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \):
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). This corresponds to **option C**.
