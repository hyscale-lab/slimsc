Hmm, okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is asking about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states of the system when measured. The eigenvectors are normalized, meaning their length is 1.

The direction n is in the x-z plane. Since it's arbitrary, I think the direction can be expressed in terms of polar coordinates, probably involving an angle θ from the z-axis and φ in the x-y plane. But since it's in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ would be either 0 or 180 degrees, I think, but maybe it doesn't matter here. Alternatively, maybe the direction can be parameterized as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) since it's in x-z plane.

Wait, but the operator P is being considered along direction n. Oh, I think the operator for the component along a direction n is given by the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, P = n · σ * (ħ/2), where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices.

Wait, so the operator P would be (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z) * (ħ/2). But wait, in this problem, the operator is given as components, but perhaps the operator along n is a combination of these components. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator in question is the component P along n, which would be a combination of Px, Py, and Pz. So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write down each component's matrix. 

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, if I construct P along n, which has components (n_x, 0, n_z), then:

P = n_x * P_x + n_z * P_z

Substituting the matrices:

n_x * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which can be written as (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, wait. Let me compute that.

The first term (n_x P_x) is n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

The second term (n_z P_z) is n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So adding these together, each element:

Top left: 0 * n_x * (ħ/2) + 1 * n_z * (ħ/2) → (n_z ħ/2)
Top right: 1 * n_x * (ħ/2) + 0 → (n_x ħ/2)
Bottom left: same as top right, because the matrix is symmetric? Wait, no, P_y isn't symmetric, but in our case, since n_y=0, the cross terms might be symmetric.

Wait, no, the matrices for P_x and P_z are both Hermitian, so P should be Hermitian as well.

So the matrix for P is:

[[ (n_z) * (ħ/2), (n_x) * (ħ/2) ],
 [ (n_x) * (ħ/2), (-n_z) * (ħ/2) ] ]

Wait, wait another moment. Let me recheck:

n_x P_x = n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

n_z P_z = n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So adding these, P = (n_x P_x) + (n_z P_z) → their sum:

Top left element: 0 + n_z*(ħ/2)
Top right: 1*(ħ/2)*n_x + 0 → n_x ħ/2
Bottom left: same as top right because P_x is symmetric. So yes, same as top right.
Bottom right: (-n_z) * (ħ/2)

So the matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

Now, the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix in a direction n are ± ħ/2. Because the eigenvalues of P (which is n · σ * ħ/2) are ± ħ/2.

So since we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2, we can write the equation:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, no. Because P is (n · σ)(ħ/2), so the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (± ħ/2) |ψ>.

So for our case, we take the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the equation is:

[ (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2) to simplify:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation is:

n_z ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = ψ₁
n_x ψ₁ - n_z ψ₂ = ψ₂

Hmm, let me write these equations:

1) n_z ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = ψ₁
2) n_x ψ₁ - n_z ψ₂ = ψ₂

Rearranging equation 1:

(n_z - 1) ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = 0 → (n_z - 1) ψ₁ = -n_x ψ₂ → ψ₂ = [ (1 - n_z) ψ₁ ] / n_x

Wait, but if n_x is zero, that might be a problem. But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, n_x could be zero, but if n_x=0, then the direction is along z. So let's see. But perhaps it's better to approach the problem using more general methods.

Alternatively, I can write the eigenvalue equation as [P - (ħ/2) I ] |ψ> = 0, but wait, no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is (P - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0.

So the matrix becomes [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ] multiplied by (ħ/2), but since we've divided by (ħ/2), the matrix is:

[ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

Wait, maybe I should have considered the equation without dividing by (ħ/2). Let me try that again.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Which is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [ψ₁, ψ₂]^T = (ħ/2) [ψ₁, ψ₂]^T

Divide both sides by (ħ/2):

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [ψ₁, ψ₂]^T = [ψ₁, ψ₂]^T

So the equations are:

n_z ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = ψ₁ → (n_z - 1) ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = 0 → (1)

n_x ψ₁ - n_z ψ₂ = ψ₂ → n_x ψ₁ - (n_z + 1) ψ₂ = 0 → (2)

So from equation (1):

(n_z -1) ψ₁ = -n_x ψ₂ → ψ₂ = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] ψ₁

Similarly, from equation (2):

n_x ψ₁ = (n_z +1) ψ₂ → ψ₂ = (n_x / (n_z +1)) ψ₁

Hmm, so I have two expressions for ψ₂. So:

(1 - n_z)/n_x = n_x/(n_z +1)

Cross-multiplying:

(1-n_z)(n_z +1) = (n_x)^2

Left side: (1 - n_z)(n_z +1) = 1 - (n_z)^2 → So 1 - n_z² = n_x²

But since n is a unit vector (I think), n_x² + n_z² = 1. So 1 - n_z² = n_x² → that's correct. So the two expressions are consistent.

So now, let's pick one of the expressions for ψ₂. Let's take from equation (1): ψ₂ = [(1 - n_z)/n_x ] ψ₁

So the eigenvector can be written as [ψ₁, ψ₂]^T = ψ₁ [1, (1-n_z)/n_x ]^T

But we need to normalize this vector. So the normalization condition is |ψ₁|^2 + |ψ₂|^2 = 1.

So |ψ₁|^2 + | (1 - n_z)/n_x ψ₁ |^2 = 1 → |ψ₁|^2 [ 1 + ( (1 -n_z)^2 / (n_x)^2 ) ] =1

Hmm, let's compute the term in the brackets:

Denominator is n_x². Let me write it as N = [ (n_x)^2 + (1 -n_z)^2 ) ] / (n_x)^2 → Wait, no.

Wait, 1 + (1- n_z)^2 / n_x^2 = [n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2 ] / n_x^2

So, 1 + (1 -n_z)^2 / n_x^2 = [n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2 ] / n_x^2

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 → n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2 → 1 - n_z^2 =n_x^2.

So substituting:

n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2 = (1 - n_z^2) + (1 - 2 n_z + n_z^2) )= 1 - n_z^2 +1 - 2 n_z + n_z^2 = 2(1 -n_z)

So the denominator becomes [2(1-n_z)] / n_x^2 → Wait, no. Let me recompute:

Wait,

n_x^2 + (1-n_z)^2 = (1 - n_z^2) + (1 - 2n_z +n_z²) ) = 1 -n_z^2 +1 -2n_z +n_z^2 = 2 - 2n_z.

So the term in the brackets is (2 - 2n_z)/n_x^2.

So ψ₁^2 [ (2 (1 - n_z) ) / n_x^2 ] = 1 → |ψ₁|^2 = n_x^2 / [ 2(1 - n_z) ]

Hmm, but what is 1 -n_z? Since n_z = cosθ, perhaps. Because in spherical coordinates, the direction n makes an angle θ with the z-axis, so n_z = cosθ, and n_x = sinθ cosφ. But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, φ=0 or π. Let's say n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So n_x = sinθ, n_z= cosθ.

So substituting:

1 - n_z = 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2) → from the trigonometric identity.

n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So n_x^2 = 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) → 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(theta/2)

So 2(1 -n_z) = 2 * 2 sin^2(theta/2) → 4 sin^2(theta/2)

So putting that into |ψ₁|^2:

n_x^2 / [ 2(1 -n_z) ] → [4 sin²(theta/2) cos²(theta/2)] / [4 sin²(theta/2)] ] → cos²(theta/2)

So |ψ₁| = sqrt( cos²(theta/2) ) → which is |cos(theta/2)|. Since the direction is arbitrary, but in the x-z plane, theta is between 0 and pi, so cos(theta/2) is positive for theta < pi. So ψ₁ = cos(theta/2).

Then, ψ₂ = [(1 -n_z)/n_x ] ψ₁ → [ (2 sin^2(theta/2) ) / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) )) ] * cos(theta/2)

Wait, let's compute (1-n_z) = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and n_x = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) → so (1 -n_z)/n_x = [2 sin^2(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ) → [sin(theta/2) ] / cos(theta/2) → tan(theta/2)

So ψ₂ = [ (1 -n_z) / n_x ] * ψ₁ → (2 sin²(theta/2)) / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) * cos(theta/2)

Wait, another approach: ψ₂ = [ (1 - cosθ)/(sinθ) ] * ψ₁.

So (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So the ratio is [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ) = [sin(theta/2)] / cos(theta/2) ) = tan(theta/2).

So ψ₂ = tan(theta/2) * ψ₁ → ψ₂ = tan(theta/2) cos(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)

Because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so when multiplied by cos(theta/2), it's sin(theta/2).

Wait, let me compute:

tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2) / cos(theta/2)

So tan(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)

So ψ₂ = sin(theta/2)

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. But wait, we need to ensure normalization. Let's check:

|cos(theta/2)|^2 + |sin(theta/2)|^2 = cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1 → correct.

Wait, but wait, quantum mechanical eigenvectors are defined up to a phase, so the eigenvector can be multiplied by any complex phase (e^{iφ}), but the question is about the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So in this case, the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Alternatively, there's another possibility. Because the eigenvectors for spin-1/2 systems along a direction n can be expressed as [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)]^T, where phi is the azimuthal angle. But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi. So if phi=0, then the second component is sin(theta/2). But if phi=pi, it's -sin(theta/2). But the options given don't include a phase factor except for option B and D.

Wait, the problem says the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so phi can be any angle? Or wait, if n is in the x-z plane, then it's at phi=0 or pi? Because the x-z plane is the plane where y=0. So phi is 0 or 180 degrees.

Wait, but in the question, the operator is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector would have components [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → no, that's different.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)).

Hmm, but in my calculation, the eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). But looking at the options, none of them have hbar in the components except option D. Wait, but the eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? Because the operator P has units of ħ/2 times a matrix, so the eigenvectors are just dimensionless. So the options with hbar (like option A and D) might not be correct.

Wait, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found, but perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization.

Wait, let me think again. The components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], but perhaps there's a factor due to the operator being scaled with ħ/2. Wait, no, the eigenvector is a unit vector regardless of the scaling of the operator. Because the operator is scaled, but the eigenvector is a state vector, which is normalized.

So the correct normalized eigenvector is option C. So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), so option C.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by ħ, but that doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are unit vectors. So I think option C is the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a normalization factor somewhere. Let's double-check the normalization.

Wait, the eigenvector I found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, which is already normalized. So the state vector is |ψ> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as:

\[
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 
n_z & n_x \\ 
n_x & -n_z 
\end{bmatrix},
\]

where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

where $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $P$ into the eigenvalue equation and solving the resulting system of equations yields the eigenvector components:

\[
\psi_1 = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad \psi_2 = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

The eigenvector is normalized, as:

\[
|\psi_1|^2 + |\psi_2|^2 = \cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1.
\]

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Contains $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Involves $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$, which does not match the derived components $\cos(\theta/2)$ and $\sin(\theta/2)$.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived components $\cos(\theta/2)$ and $\sin(\theta/2)$.
- **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ and additional normalization factors, which are not consistent with the derived eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it accurately represents the normalized eigenvector components.

Answer: C
