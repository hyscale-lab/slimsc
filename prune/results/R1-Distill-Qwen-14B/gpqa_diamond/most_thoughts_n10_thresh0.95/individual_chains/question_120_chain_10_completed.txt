Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says stars are uniformly distributed, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? I remember that the parallax of a star (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. Oh right, because 1 parsec is the distance at which 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and farther stars have smaller parallax.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So like, if I consider a small range in parallax, how many stars fall into that range. Let's imagine I pick a range from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars are there in that range?

Since stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, I think that means they're uniformly spread out in space, but more distant stars would be less dense because space is three-dimensional. Wait, but the distribution is uniform in terms of density, perhaps? Or maybe it's uniform in terms of number per some volume.

Wait, the problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. So the number density of stars is constant throughout space. So density n = N/V, where N is number of stars and V is the volume.

But let's think about parallax. Parallax depends on distance. So the number of stars within a certain volume as a function of distance. Let's model this.

The volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dr is the surface area of a sphere (4πd²) multiplied by dr. But wait, because the number of stars is proportional to the volume. So if we have a thin shell around a sphere of radius d, the volume is 4π d² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx.

So if I have a range in parallax from plx to plx + dplx, then the corresponding distances are d = 1/plx and d + dr = 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, maybe I should express dr in terms of dplx.

Alternatively, think in terms of parallax. Let's consider a small change in parallax, dplx. We want to find the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx.

Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume between those two distances. So the number of stars in that range would be (number density) * (volume between d and d').

Number of stars, dN = n * (4π d² dr), where dr is the change in radius. So we need to express dr in terms of dplx.

Wait, plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Then, let me find dr in terms of dplx.

Differentiate both sides: dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're considering a small positive dplx, the change in d would be a small negative, so the volume element still makes sense.

So, substituting d = 1/plx, dr = -dplx/(plx)^2.

Wait, but in our case, when plx increases by dplx, d decreases. So the volume element would be the volume between d and d - dr? Hmm, maybe I should think about it more carefully.

Wait, when plx is plx, d is 1/plx. When plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dr. So the volume between d and d - dr is the volume of the shell at distance d, with thickness dr.

Alternatively, let me compute the differential volume element in terms of plx.

dV = 4π d² dr.

But dr = - dplx / (plx)^2.

So dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2) ) * (-1) ?

Wait, no, because dr is negative, but we can take the absolute value for the volume. Because when plx increases, d decreases, so the shell from d to d - dr is a thin shell. So the volume is 4π (d)^2 dr. But dr is negative, so the actual volume is positive.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express d in terms of plx and find how the volume changes with plx.

Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx → d = plx^{-1}.

So, the volume element between plx and plx + dplx is the volume of the shell from d=1/plx to d=1/(plx + dplx). Wait, that's a bit complicated.

But perhaps I can approximate for small dplx.

Let me consider two parallax values, plx and plx + dplx. The corresponding distances are d = 1/plx and d' = 1/(plx + dplx).

The volume between these two is 4π (d'^2 - d^2) dr, but wait, no. Wait, the volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² dr, where dr is the thickness of the shell. But I'm comparing two radii, d and d', so the volume between them is 4π (d'^2 - d^2) dr, but wait, that's not accurate because dr is the thickness, and the integral is over all r.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the differential volume. The differential volume dV is 4π d² dd, where dd is the change in d.

But we need to express this in terms of plx and dplx. Since plx = 1/d, we can write d = 1/plx, so dd = -d^2 dplx → because d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, let's take the derivative of d with respect to plx.

d = 1/plx → dd/dplx = -1/(plx²).

So, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting into dV:

dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2 dplx) ) 

Wait, that's 4π (1/plx^2) * ( - (dplx / plx^2) )

But that gives dV negative, but volume can't be negative. So perhaps I should take the absolute value. Or maybe consider the positive change.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express dV as 4π (d)^2 * |dd|.

So, |dd| = (1/plx²) dplx.

So,

dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) dplx) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, the number per unit parallax range would be (n * dV) / dplx, but wait, no.

Wait, let's define the number of stars as N = n * Volume.

The number of stars per unit range of parallax would be the number of stars in a thin shell (dV) divided by the change in parallax (dplx). Or is it cumulative? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think about it step by step.

The number of stars in a volume element is proportional to the volume. So, the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * dV, where dV is the volume corresponding to this range in parallax.

So, dV is the volume between d=1/(plx) and d=1/(plx + dplx). Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the volume of the shell at a distance d with thickness dr.

Wait, but when plx increases by dplx, the distance decreases. So the volume element is the volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr.

But again, I need to express dr in terms of dplx.

Wait, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dr = - (dplx)/(plx^2).

So, the volume of the shell is 4π d^2 dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -dplx / plx^2 ) )

But since dr is negative, the actual volume is positive. So the volume element is 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) ) = 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

Wait, but that would make dV = 4π dplx / plx^4.

So the number of stars in this shell is N = n * dV = n * (4π dplx / plx^4).

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So that's N per dplx, which is (n * 4π dplx / plx^4 ) / dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, that would suggest that the number of stars per unit parallax is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the number decreases as 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivation.

Wait another approach: consider that the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to that volume. So if I have a range of parallax, I need to find the corresponding volume.

Let me think about the volume between two distances d1 = 1/plx and d2 = 1/(plx + dplx).

The volume is (4/3)π (d2^3 - d1^3).

But for small dplx, d2 ≈ d1, so I can approximate the volume as the derivative of (4/3 π d^3) with respect to d.

So, dV = 4π d² dd.

Again, since dd = -d^2 dplx, because d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, dV = 4 π (1/plx^2) * ( - 1/plx^2 dplx )

But again, the volume can't be negative, so taking the absolute value, dV = 4 π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx ) = 4 π dplx / plx^4.

So the number of stars in that volume is n * dV = n * (4 π dplx / plx^4).

So the number per unit parallax range is (n * 4 π dplx / plx^4) / (dplx) ) = 4 π n / plx^4.

So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, another approach: considering that the number of stars in a given distance interval (distance shell) is proportional to the volume of that shell, which is 4π d^2 dd. And since d = 1/plx, we can express this in terms of plx.

So, number of stars in a distance range dd is proportional to d^2 dd.

But since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx.

So, substituting, the number is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * ( -dd/(1/plx^2) )) [because dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx → dplx = - plx^2 dd ]

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of plx.

Let me change variables. Let me have the number of stars per unit plx.

The number of stars in a range plx to plx + dplx is N = n * (4π d^2 dd ). But dd is in terms of d.

But plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

Differentiating both sides, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting into N:

N = 4 π n ( (1/plx)^2 ) ( - (1/plx^2) dplx )

But since we're looking for the number of stars per unit dplx, we'd take N / dplx.

So N/dplx = 4 π n (1/plx^2) (1/plx^2) ( -1 ) → but ignoring the negative,

N/dplx = 4 π n / plx^4.

So again, conclusion is that the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer is option A, ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume of that region.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dd \). Using \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \): 

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the expression for \( dV \), we get:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Taking the absolute value (since volume cannot be negative), the volume becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to \( dV \), so the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of stars}}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).
