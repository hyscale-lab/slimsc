Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to unpack it.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless versus when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So this is an excitation problem, I think. In LTE, the ratio of populations of two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two states to the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is in the form: (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
n2 and n1 are the number densities of the two levels,
g2 and g1 are the statistical weights,
E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels,
k is the Boltzmann constant,
T is the temperature.

In this problem, when the star has no spots, the effective temperature is 6000 K. When spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But wait, I'm not entirely sure how the presence of spots affects the effective temperature. Do spots make the overall temperature lower because they're cooler regions? Yes, that's right. So the star's overall photosphere, when spots are present, is at a lower temperature. But wait, the problem says the photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the star as a whole is cooler when spots are present.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So I think I need to compute this ratio at both temperatures (6000 K and 5500 K) and find the ratio of the ratios.

Wait, but the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T goes down, the ratio (n2/n1) goes down. That makes sense because lower temperatures should lead to lower excitation, so higher energy levels are less populated relative to lower ones.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is from a lower to higher energy level, so the ratio n2/n1 is for level 2 over level 1, which would be higher when T is higher.

Wait, in the Boltzmann equation, (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then as T increases, the exponential factor increases, making n2/n1 larger.

In this problem, when the star has spots, T is lower. So n2/n1 should decrease. Which matches what the problem says: the ratio decreases when spots are present. So, the ratio without spots is higher than with.

The question is, what is the factor by which the ratio changes. So I need to find (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K.

Let me write the ratio:

(n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Where ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So, ΔE = hc / λ.

But since the problem gives the wavelength (1448 Å), I can calculate ΔE for each temperature.

Wait, but when I take the ratio of the two ratios, the (g2/g1) terms will cancel out. Because the ratio is (n2/n1)_T1 divided by (n2/n1)_T2, which is [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ].

So the g's cancel, and we get exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). Because:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me check that:

-ΔE/(k T1) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, let me compute the exponents:

The first exponent is -ΔE/(k T1), and the denominator has exponent -ΔE/(k T2). So when you divide, the exponents subtract:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b). So a is (-ΔE/(k T1)), b is (-ΔE/(k T2)).

So a - b = (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, no: let me compute a - b:

a = -ΔE/(k T1)
b = -ΔE/(k T2)
a - b = (-ΔE/(k T1)) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) 
= (-ΔE/(k T1)) + ΔE/(k T2)
= ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

So the exponent is ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

Wait, but 1/(T2) is less than 1/(T1) because T2 (5500 K) is less than T1 (6000 K). So [1/T2 - 1/T1] is positive because T2 < T1. Since ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), the exponent is positive.

So the entire exponential factor is exp( positive number ), which is greater than 1.

So the ratio (n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But wait, in the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower (T2 =5500), (n2/n1) is lower. So the ratio without spots (T1=6000) over with spots (T2=5500) is greater than 1. So the factor is greater than 1, which matches the exponential being positive.

Now, I need to compute this factor.

First, compute ΔE = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant: 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c is speed of light: 2.99792458e8 m/s
λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(2.9979e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m)

Let me compute this:

h*c = 6.626e-34 * 2.9979e8 ≈ 1.986e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.986e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

So ΔE ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But we can also compute this in terms of eV to make it easier, since I know that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. Hmm, 8.56 eV? That's like in the X-ray range. But the transition is given as 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1448 Angstroms is 144.8 nm. UV light is around 10-400 nm, so 144 nm is in the UV. The energy should be about 8.56 eV. Hmm, that seems high for a typical atomic transition, but maybe for Ti it's possible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, let me double-check the wavelength. 1448 Å is 1448 * 1e-10 meters. So 1.448e-7 meters. Yeah, that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it in terms of k (Boltzmann constant) and T to find the exponent.

Wait, let's compute (ΔE)/(k) in units that can be used with temperatures in Kelvin.

k is the Boltzmann constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So (ΔE)/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 9.95e4 K.

Wait, so that's about 1e5 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 99500 K.

Now, the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

Compute 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1/5500) - (1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500/(3.3e7) ) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So exponent = 99500 K * 1.515e-5 1/K.

Multiply 99500 * 1.515e-5.

Let me compute that:

99500 * 1.515e-5 = (approx 1e5) * 1.5e-5 = 1.5. But more precisely:

99500 ≈ 9.95e4.

9.95e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.95 * 1.515) * 1e-1.

Compute 9.95 * 1.515.

10 * 1.515 = 15.15; subtract 0.05 *1.515 (0.07575) → 15.15 - 0.07575 ≈ 15.07425.

Multiply by 1e-1 → 1.507425.

So the exponent is approximately 1.507.

So the factor is exp(1.507) ≈ ?

What's e^1.5? e^1 is ~2.718, e^0.5 is ~1.648. So e^1.5 ≈ 4.48.

Wait, e^1.507 ≈ 4.5? Let me check more accurately.

Using calculator-like approach:

e^1.507:

We can compute ln(4.5) ≈ 1.504. Because e^1.504 ≈ 4.5.

Wait, e^1.504 ≈ 4.500 approximately.

So e^1.507 is about 4.505 or so.

Wait, but let me think: the exponent is about 1.507, so the value is approximately 4.5.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5. So the ratio (without spots) is about 4.5 times higher than when it has spots.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other factors. The problem says the ratio decreases when the spots are present, which fits with our calculation because when spots are present, T is lower, so the ratio (n2/n1) is lower. Thus, the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 ≈ 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me double-check the exponent calculation.

Exponent: (ΔE/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4

1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4

Difference: 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5.

Multiply by (ΔE/k) = 99500.

99500 * 1.513e-5 = ?

99500 = 9.95e4.

9.95e4 * 1.513e-5 = (9.95 * 1.513) * 1e-1.

Compute 9.95 * 1.513.

9 * 1.513 is 13.617.

0.95 * 1.513 ≈ 1.43735.

Total ≈ 13.617 + 1.43735 = ~15.05435.

Multiply by 0.1: 1.505435.

So exponent is about 1.5054, which is about 1.505.

e^1.505 ≈ 4.5.

Yes, that's correct.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. So the answer is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The ratio of the populations at two temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\). The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is calculated using the wavelength of the transition (\(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\)):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 2.9979 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Substituting:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(2.9979 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Next, compute \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\), where \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now calculate the exponent:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right),
\]

where \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\). Compute \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\):

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33000000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
99500 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.507.
\]

Finally, compute the factor:

\[
\exp(1.507) \approx 4.5.
\]

This means the ratio of the populations of the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times larger when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
