Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem to solve. Hmm, a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral structures have all sides equal and all angles equal too. But wait, no, wait. I think in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, but the angles alpha, beta, gamma can be different? Or wait, no. Wait, in a rhombohedral, all angles are equal, right? So in this case, the angles are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral crystal with a cubic lattice but with all angles 30 degrees.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal. The formula I remember for interplanar distance d_hkl is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) * (something) ), but wait, no. That's when the lattice is cubic, maybe?

Wait, no, wait. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the metric tensor. The formula is d^2 = (a^2 h^2 + b^2 k^2 + c^2 l^2 - 2ab hk cos gamma - 2ac hl cos beta - 2bc kl cos alpha ) / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2). But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I think for a general crystal, the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula:

1/d^2 = (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) - (2hk cos gamma)/(a b) - (2hl cos beta)/(a c) - (2kl cos alpha)/(b c)

Wait, but for a rhombohedral crystal, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma. So that should simplify things.

So in this problem, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and each angle alpha, beta, gamma is 30 degrees. We're looking for the (111) plane, so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging into the formula, let's see:

1/d^2 = (1^2)/(10^2) + (1^2)/(10^2) + (1^2)/(10^2) - (2*1*1 cos 30)/(10*10) - (2*1*1 cos 30)/(10*10) - (2*1*1 cos 30)/(10*10)

Wait, because gamma is 30, and the same for alpha and beta.

So let's compute each term. Each term with (h^2/a^2) is 1/100, and since all three are same, that's 3*(1/100) = 3/100.

Now the other terms: each of the three subtractive terms is (2hk cosθ)/(ab). Since h=k=l=1, and a=b=c=10, each term is (2*1*1 * cos30)/(10*10) = (2 * (√3/2)) / 100 = (√3)/100. Since there are three such terms, the total subtractive part is 3*(√3)/100.

So putting it all together:

1/d^2 = (3/100) - (3√3)/100

Which is [3 - 3√3]/100 = (3(1 -√3))/100

Wait, but wait, because √3 is approximately 1.732, so 1 -√3 is about -0.732, so 3*( -0.732 ) is about -2.196. So 1/d^2 is about (-2.196)/100, which is negative. That can't be right because d^2 can't be negative.

Wait, did I get the formula wrong? Because if the angles are less than 90 degrees, the terms would have positive cosine. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, maybe I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a cubic system, but rhombohedral is a type of cubic system? Wait, no, no; rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system, or is it cubic? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems. It's a type of cubic system, but with all angles equal and not 90 degrees. So in the cubic system, the interplanar distance formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²), but in this case, it's a rhombohedral, so the angles are not 90 degrees, so the formula isn't that simple.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to use the volume formula for a rhombohedral unit cell. The volume V is a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + 3 cos^3θ) where θ is the angle. But maybe that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be found using d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) )

Wait, let me think. For a cubic system, yes, d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But for a rhombohedral, because the angles are not 90 degrees, the formula changes. So perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - hk(1 + cos α) - ... )

Wait, perhaps I should look up the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance formula for a general crystal is given by:

d_hkl = 1 / sqrt( (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - (2hk cos gamma)/(a b) - (2hl cos beta)/(a c) - (2kl cos alpha)/(b c) )

So in this case, a = b = c =10, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So substituting, each term:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So,

d^2 = 1 / [ (1^2)/(10^2) + (1^2)/(10^2) + (1^2)/(10^2) - (2*1*1 * cos30)/(10*10) * 3 ]

Wait, because all three cosine terms are same, so each (2hk cos theta)/(a*b) is same.

Wait, so:

(h²/a²) = 1/100 for each h, k, l.

Sum of h²/a² terms: 3*(1/100) = 3/100.

Now the subtractive terms: each term is (2hk cos theta)/(a b). Since a=b=c=10, each term is (2*1*1 * cos 30)/(10*10) = (2 * (√3/2)) / 100 = √3 / 100.

But there are three such terms because hk, hl, and kl.

So subtractive part is 3*(√3/100) = 3√3 /100.

So putting it together:

d^2 = 1 / [ (3/100) - (3√3/100) ) ] = 1 / [ (3(1 - √3))/100 ) ]

Wait, but that denominator would be 3(1 -1.732)/100 = 3*(-0.732)/100 → negative. So 1/d^2 is negative, which is impossible. That can't be right.

Hmm, so that can't be correct. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the reciprocal of the sum, but perhaps I messed up the signs. Let me think again.

Wait another possibility: Maybe the terms are subtracted in the denominator. Wait, no, the formula is 1/d² equals the sum of the terms.

Wait, perhaps I missed a negative sign in the formula. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - (2 h k cos gamma)/(a b) - (2 h l cos beta)/(a c) - (2 k l cos alpha)/(b c).

If all angles are 30 degrees, which is acute, cos30 is positive. So the subtractive terms are 3*(positive).

So if 1/d² = (3/100) - 3*(√3/100) → 3 (1 - √3) /100 → 3(-0.732)/100 → -0.02196.

So 1/d² is negative, which is impossible. So that suggests I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I should have added the terms instead of subtracting.

Wait, I think I might have the formula wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c² ) + (2hk cos gamma)/(a b) + (2hl cos beta)/(a c) + (2kl cos alpha)/(b c)

Wait, no, that would make the denominator even bigger, leading to a smaller d.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the formula. Let me think about the structure factor or the Miller indices.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another approach. The interplanar distance can be found using the relation between the planes in the crystal and the unit cell.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk(1 + cos α) - hl(1 + cos β) - kl(1 + cos γ) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, another approach: The volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos α + 3 cos^3 α ), but I don't know if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this in terms of vectors.

In a rhombohedral lattice, all edges are equal, a = b = c = 10 A, and the angles between them are all 30 degrees.

The unit cell can be considered as vectors a, b, c with |a|=|b|=|c|=10 and angles between each pair being 30 degrees.

The (111) plane corresponds to the plane where h=1, k=1, l=1.

The interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the norm of the reciprocal lattice vector.

Wait, maybe using the reciprocal lattice approach.

Reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

u = (1/a) [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) (1/a) ... ]

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = 1/ sqrt( (h^2 (1/a²) ) + (k^2 (1/b²) ) + (l^2 (1/c²) ) - 2 h k (cos gamma)/(a b) - 2 h l (cos beta)/(a c) - 2 k l (cos alpha)/(b c) ) )

Wait, but that's the same as what I did earlier. So in this case, all a, b, c are equal to 10, and all angles are 30 degrees.

So plugging in:

1/d² = (1/(10)^2)(1 + 1 + 1 ) - (2*1*1 cos30)/(10*10) *3

So 1/d² = (3/100) - (3 * (√3/2 )) / 100

Wait, (√3/2) is approx 0.866, so 3*0.866 is about 2.598.

So 1/d² = (3 - 2.598) / 100 → 0.402 / 100 → 0.00402 → d² = 1/0.00402 ≈ 249. So d is sqrt(249) ≈ 15.78 A. That's way bigger than the interatomic distance. That can't be right because in a crystal, the interplanar distance should be smaller than the interatomic distance.

Wait, but I'm getting a positive value here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Because the formula I have is 1/d² = sum of (h²/a²) terms minus the sum of the cosine terms.

Wait, perhaps in this case, if the angles are acute, the cosine is positive, so the subtractive terms are positive, which could lead to a negative denominator. But that's impossible because d^2 can't be negative.

Hmm, perhaps I did the formula wrong. Let me think again. Another approach: Maybe the formula for rhombohedral is similar to cubic but with a correction factor involving the angles.

In a cubic system, d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² )

But for rhombohedral, where angles are not 90 degrees, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2 h k cos(theta) - 2 h l cos(theta) - 2 k l cos(theta) )

But wait, that would be:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 cos(theta) (hk +hl + kl) )

So for (111), h=k=l=1. So,

d = a / sqrt(3 - 2 cos(theta) * 3 )

Because hk + hl + kl = 3.

So cos(theta) is cos(30) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.

So plug in:

d = 10 / sqrt(3 - 2 * 0.866 *3 )

Compute denominator: 3 - 2 * 0.866 *3 → 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, denominator is sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. That can't be right. So this approach is wrong.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps my formula is incorrect. Maybe I should have added the terms instead of subtracting?

Wait, perhaps it's:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 cos(theta) (hk + hl + kl) )

So for (111), it's:

d =10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(√3/2)*3 )

Compute denominator: 3 + (2 * 0.866 *3 ) → 3 + 5.196 → 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is about 2.864.

So d =10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom. But that's much smaller than the interatomic distance of 10 A. That doesn't make sense because interplanar distances are generally smaller than the interatomic distances, but in this case, the options are all around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula again. Maybe I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos(theta)) )

Wait, let me try that.

So for (111), denominator is 3 - (3)(1 - cos30) → 3 -3*(1 - 0.866) → 3 -3*(0.134) →3-0.402=2.598.

So sqrt(2.598)= approx 1.612.

d=10/1.612≈6.198 A. Still too small.

Hmm, none of these approaches seem to be giving me an answer close to the options given (8.95, 9.08, etc.), so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal.

Upon checking, the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

Wait, no, that can't be because for alpha=beta=gamma=30, plugging (111) would give:

d =10 / sqrt(3 - 2*1*1*(0.866)*3 ) → denominator: 3 - 5.196= -2.196 → sqrt of negative number. So that's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - 2(hk cos gamma)/(a b) - 2(hl cos beta)/(a c) - 2(kl cos alpha)/(b c) )

Which is what I thought earlier.

So, in our case:

a = b = c =10.

alpha = beta = gamma =30 degrees.

h=k=l=1.

So,

1/d² = (1/100)(1+1+1) - [ (2 *1*1 * cos30)/(10*10) ) *3 ]

So,

1/d² = (3/100) - (3 * (√3/2) )/(100)

Compute the value:

√3 ≈1.732, so √3/2 ≈0.866.

So,

3/100 = 0.03

3*(0.866)/100 = 2.598/100 =0.02598.

So,

1/d² = 0.03 -0.02598 = 0.00402.

So,

d² = 1/0.00402 → approximately 248.95 → d ≈ sqrt(248.95) ≈15.78 A.

But that's larger than the interatomic distance of 10 A, which doesn't make sense. Because the interplanar distances are typically smaller than the interatomic distance, especially for lower-order planes.

Wait, but maybe I mixed up the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - 2 (hk cos gamma)/(a b) - 2 (hl cos beta)/(a c) - 2 (kl cos alpha)/(b c) )

Wait, but that's the same as before. So perhaps the formula is correct, but my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the angles are 30 degrees, but in a rhombohedral structure, the angles are typically 60 degrees. Wait, no, rhombohedral can have any angles as long as a = b = c.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is in the angle definitions. In a rhombohedral lattice, sometimes the angles are defined differently. But for this problem, the angles are given as 30 degrees, so I have to proceed with that.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula I'm using is correct, but I inverted a and the denominator. So perhaps d = 1/sqrt( ... ), but in the case where 1/d² is negative, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps in the rhombohedral system, the formula for interplanar distance is different. Maybe it's better to model the vectors.

In a rhombohedral lattice, the lattice vectors are a, b, c with |a|=|b|=|c|=10, and the angle between any two is 30 degrees.

The (111) plane has the normal vector (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the magnitude of the projection of the vector (a + b + c) onto the unit normal vector, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the interplanar distance can be found by the formula:

d = | (a + b + c) · n | / |n|,

where n is the normal vector (h, k, l). But wait, that's for a cubic system. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, in a general system, the distance between two adjacent planes is given by the reciprocal of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices adjusted by the angles.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the reciprocal space approach. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

u = (2π/a) (h) / (h² + k² + l² - hk (1 + cos α) - hl(1 + cos beta) - ... )

No, perhaps that's not the right way.

Wait, after a lot of thinking, I think the correct approach is to use the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system which is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk (1 + cos α) - hl (1 + cos β) - kl (1 + cos γ) )

But since alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So, for (111):

d = 10 / sqrt(1+1+1 - (1*1)(1+0.866) *3 )

Wait, because hk =1, hl=1, kl=1; for each pair.

So,

Denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 3*(1.866)).

3 - 5.598 = -2.598.

That's negative again, so sqrt of negative is impossible. So that's wrong.

Hmm, maybe the formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos θ) )

Where θ is the angle.

So for (111):

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 - 3*(1 - 0.866) = 3 - 3*(0.134) → 3 - 0.402 = 2.598.

So sqrt(2.598) ≈1.612.

So d =10 / 1.612 ≈6.198 A. But that's not close to the options given.

Wait, but the options are all around 9 A, which is closer to the interatomic distance. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is simply d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² ), but that's for a cubic system. So for (111), that would be 10 / sqrt(3) ≈5.77 A. Still not matching the options.

Wait, maybe I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle.

So in this case, theta=30 degrees.

So,

d =10 / sqrt(3 + 2*3*(0.866) )

Compute denominator:

3 + 2*3*0.866 = 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)≈ 2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.492 A. Still too small.

Wait, but all the options are in 8-10 A. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 - 2*3*0.866 )

3-5.196= -2.196 → sqrt(negative). Nope.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

Wait, another approach is to use the volume of the unit cell and the area of the plane.

Wait, the volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is given by V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos α + 3 cos^3 α )

Plugging in a=10 and α=30 degrees.

Compute cos 30 = √3/2 ≈0.866.

So V=1000 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.866) +3*(0.866)^3 )

Compute inside the sqrt:

1 - 2.598 + 3*(0.866^3 )

0.866^3 ≈0.866 *0.866=0.75, *0.866 →≈0.6495.

So,

1 - 2.598= -1.598.

3*0.6495=1.9485.

So total inside sqrt: (-1.598) +1.9485=0.3505.

So V=1000 * sqrt(0.3505) ≈1000 *0.592 ≈592 A^3.

Now, the area of a face in the (111) plane.

Wait, but I'm not sure how this helps. Alternatively, the area can be found using the formula for the plane, but perhaps it's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the Miller indices change in the rhombohedral system, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) ) * 1/(sqrt(1 - cos α + cos^2 α )) )

Wait, that's a guess. For (111), it would be 10 / sqrt(3) * 1/(sqrt(1 -0.866 +0.866^2 )).

Compute denominator inside:

1 -0.866 + (0.75) = 1 -0.866 +0.75 = 0.884.

sqrt(0.884)= approx 0.940.

So d= (10/1.732) * (1/0.940) → approx 5.77 *1.064=6.14 A. Still too small.

Wait, none of these approaches are giving me the right answer. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let's think about the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal lattice.

The general formula is:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2hk cos γ/(ab) - 2hl cos β/(ac) - 2kl cos α/(bc)

In our case, a=b=c=10, α=β=gamma=30 degrees.

So,

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So,

1/d² = (1/100 + 1/100 +1/100 ) - (2*1*1 * cos30)/(10*10)*3

Compute each part:

Sum of squares: 3/100 =0.03

Cos30=√3/2 ≈0.866. So,

Each cosine term: (2 *0.866)/(100) → 1.732/100=0.01732 per term.

Three terms: 0.05196.

So,

1/d² =0.03 -0.05196= -0.02196.

Wait, that's negative. Hence, no real solution. That can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I should redo the calculation more accurately.

Wait, a=10, so a²=100.

Compute each term:

(1²/10²) =0.01, there are three such terms, so 0.03.

Now, the cosine terms:

Each cosine term is (2hk cosθ)/(a b).

Since a=b=c=10, each denominator is 100.

Each numerator is 2*1*1 * cos30=2*0.8660=1.732.

So each term is 1.732/100=0.01732.

Three such terms, so 0.05196.

So,

1/d² =0.03 -0.05196= -0.02196.

But 1/d² can't be negative. So perhaps the problem setup is impossible because with angles of 30 degrees in a rhombohedral system, the (111) planes would not exist, or perhaps it's a mistake in the question's parameters.

But the question gives four options, so I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c² ) + 2 hk cos γ/(ab) + 2 hl cos beta/(ac) + 2 kl cos alpha/(bc)

Wait, that would give:

1/d²= 0.03 + 0.05196=0.08196.

d²=1/0.08196≈12.20 → d≈3.49 A. Still small.

But the options are all around 9 A. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses vectors, and the metric tensor is involved.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

g = [ [ a², a b cos γ, a c cos beta ],
       [ a b cos gamma, b², b c cos alpha ],
       [ a c cos beta, b c cos alpha, c² ] ]

But since a=b=c=10, and all angles are 30 degrees, the matrix becomes:

g = [ [100, 10*10*0.866, 10*10*0.866 ],
      [10*10*0.866, 100, 10*10*0.866 ],
      [10*10*0.866, 10*10*0.866, 100 ] ]

Which is:

g = [
 [100, 86.6, 86.6],
 [86.6, 100, 86.6],
 [86.6, 86.6, 100]
]

The inverse of the metric tensor gives the reciprocal lattice metric tensor, which is used to find d.

The (hkl) plane corresponds to the reciprocal vector (h,k,l). The interplanar distance d is related by:

d² = (h^2 g_11 + k^2 g_22 + l^2 g_33 - 2 h k g_12 - 2 h l g_13 - 2 k l g_23 )^{-1}

Wait, no, wait. I think the correct formula is:

d^2 = 1/( h² g_11 + k² g_22 + l² g_33 - 2 h k g_12 - 2 h l g_13 - 2 k l g_23 )

So, for (111):

Compute numerator:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

Compute each term:

h² g_11 = 1*100 = 100

k² g_22 =1*100=100

l² g_33=1*100=100.

Now, the cross terms:

-2 h k g_12 = -2 *1 *1 *86.6 = -173.2

-2 h l g_13 = -2 *1 *1 *86.6 = -173.2

-2 k l g_23 = -2 *1 *1 *86.6= -173.2

So summing all terms:

100 +100 +100 -173.2 -173.2 -173.2 = 300 - 519.6 = -219.6.

So,

d²=1/(-219.6) → negative again. That can't be right.

Hmm, but this suggests that the interplanar distance is imaginary, which is impossible. So perhaps the angles given in the problem make the crystal structure impossible for certain planes, but since the question asks for the (111) plane, maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the absolute value somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the inverse correctly.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d^2 = (h^2 g_11 + k^2 g_22 + l^2 g_33 - 2 h k g_12 - 2 h l g_13 - 2 k l g_23 )^{-1}

But in that case, the denominator would be negative, so d^2 is negative, which is impossible. So perhaps this indicates that for the given angles, the (111) plane is not possible, but since the problem provides options, this must not be the case.

Wait, maybe I inverted the formula. Oh wait! No, I think I have the formula wrong. The correct formula is:

d^2 = (h^2 g_11 + k^2 g_22 + l^2 g_33 + 2 h k g_12 + 2 h l g_13 + 2 k l g_23 )^{-1}

Wait, but that would change the sign of the cross terms. Let's try that.

So,

d^2 = 1 / [ 100 +100 +100 + (2*1*1*86.6)*3 ]

Wait,

sum of squares: 3*100=300.

cross terms: 2*86.6*(3) → 519.6.

so,

d^2 =1/(300+519.6)=1/819.6≈0.00122.

so d≈sqrt(1/819.6)= approx 0.0349 A, which is way too small.

This can't be right either.

Wait, I'm so confused. Maybe I should go back to the beginning.

Another approach: For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula can be written as:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (1 + cos θ) )

Where θ is the angle between the edges (30 degrees here).

So for (111):

h=k=l=1,

so,

denominator = sqrt(3 - 3*(1 + 0.866) )

= sqrt(3 -3*(1.866) )

= sqrt(3 -5.598 )= sqrt(-2.598 ) → imaginary again. Hmm.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options and see if any make sense.

The options are approximately 9 A.

Wait, the interatomic distance is 10 A, so perhaps the interplanar distance is close to that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the formula d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² )

Which for (111) is 10/sqrt(3)=5.77 A, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

So for (111):

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 2*3 *0.866 )=10 / sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 A. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reciprocal of the distance. But no, that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a ) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, then it's 10 / sqrt(3 + 5.196)= same as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Which would give 10 / sqrt(3 -5.196)= imaginary.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer isn't appearing. But the options are given, so perhaps I should recalculate the formula I used earlier.

Wait, let's go back to the formula:

1/d² = (3/100) - 3*(√3/2)/100 → 3/100=0.03; 3*(√3/2)=2.598 → 2.598/100=0.02598.

So,

1/d² =0.03 -0.02598=0.00402 → d²=1/0.00402≈248.95 → d≈15.78 A.

But that's larger than a, which is 10 A. That can't be correct, as the interplanar distance should be smaller than the interatomic distance.

Wait, but perhaps the question's angles are in error, or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos θ) )

So, with θ=30 degrees.

So,

d=10/sqrt(3 -3*(1 -0.866) )

=10/sqrt(3 -3*0.134 )

=10/sqrt(3-0.402)=10/sqrt(2.598)=10/1.612≈6.198 A.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the (111) plane in terms of the unit vectors. Each unit vector is along a, b, c axes with angles 30 degrees between them.

The normal vector would be along (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes along the normal.

But I'm not sure how to compute that. Another approach: The plane equation is n·r = d, where n is the normal vector (1,1,1), and r is the position vector.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice points are at r = h a + k b + l c, where a, b, c are the basis vectors.

Wait, but perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

But with θ=30 degrees.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 - 2*3*0.866)

3 -5.196= -2.196 → sqrt(negative). So again, impossible.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is one of the options provided, and perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, earlier when I calculated using 1/d² = 0.00402, which gives d≈15.78, that's larger than a, but perhaps the formula is correct, and the answer is not among the options, but the question expects us to proceed despite that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the formula correctly.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h²/(a²) + k²/(b²) + l²/(c²)) + 2 (hk cos gamma )/(ab) + 2 (hl cos beta )/(ac) + 2 (kl cos alpha )/(bc) )

So,

1/d² = (3/100) + 3*(2*1*1 *0.866)/(10*10 )

Wait, 2*1*1*0.866=1.732, divided by 100 → 0.01732 per term.

3 terms: 0.05196.

So,

1/d²=0.03 +0.05196=0.08196 → d= sqrt(1/0.08196)=sqrt(12.207)≈3.49 A.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 (hk + hl + kl) )

Which for (111) is 10/sqrt(3 - 6) → sqrt(-3), which is impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should give up and pick the option closest to 10/sqrt(3)=5.77, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering all angles as 30 degrees, but perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the angles are 60 degrees. But the problem states 30 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the supplement angles, like 180-30=150 degrees. So cos(150)= -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

Let me try that in the initial formula.

So,

1/d² = (3/100) -3*(2*1*1*(-0.866))/(10*10 )

Wait, 3*(2*(-0.866))/(100) → 3*(-1.732)/100= -0.05196.

So,

1/d²=0.03 - (-0.05196)= 0.08196 → d≈3.49 A.

Same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck, but according to the given options, the answer should be around 9 A. Maybe the correct approach is to use a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos θ) )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos θ) )

Let's compute that.

For (111):

Denominator: sqrt(3 + 2*3*(1 - 0.866) )

= sqrt(3 +6*(0.134) )

= sqrt(3 +0.804)=sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10
