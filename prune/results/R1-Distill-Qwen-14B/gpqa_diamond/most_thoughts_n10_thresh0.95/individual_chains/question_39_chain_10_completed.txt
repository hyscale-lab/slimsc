Hmm, okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through what I remember.

So the question is about the wave function of a particle in a system. We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles' positions, none were found outside the interval between x=1 and x=3. So the particles must have been found only between x=1 and x=3. The question is asking for the value of 'a'.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density of finding the particle. So the integral of the probability density over all space must equal 1 because the total probability is 1.

But wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a complex function. The general form is usually ψ(x) = something. But in this case, there's an imaginary part. Oh right, the wave function can be complex. So the probability density is |ψ(x)|².

So the probability density would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. When you square the modulus, you add the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

Wait, actually, the modulus squared is (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))². So yes, [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2.

So, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1, because the particle was only found between 1 and 3. Wait, no, actually, the wave function is given, and when they measured, all particles were found between x=1 and x=3. That suggests that the wave function is zero outside this interval, right? Because the probability of finding the particle elsewhere is zero. So our wave function must be zero for x <1 and x>3. But looking at the given wave function, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So if that's the case, perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3.

Wait, but how does that work? Because if the wave function is defined as that expression for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere, then the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ|² dx must be 1. Because the total probability is 1.

So the first thing I need to do is compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 and set it equal to 1. Then solve for 'a'.

Let me write down the expression for |ψ(x)|². So:

|ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2
= (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me split the integral into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 =1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: a² * integral from 1 to3 of 1/(1+x) dx.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluated from 1 to3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2). I think ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a = sqrt(0.7213).

What's the square root of 0.7213? Let's see. 0.85 squared is 0.7225, which is close. Oh, because 0.85^2 is 0.7225. So a is approximately 0.85.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

Compute 0.7213:

sqrt(0.7213) ≈ Let's see:

0.84 squared is 0.7056.

0.85^2=0.7225.

0.845^2: 0.845 * 0.845 = ?

0.8^2 is 0.64, 0.04^2 is 0.0016, but wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 845 *845.

Wait, 845 * 800 = 676000, 845*45=38025, so total 714,025. So 0.845^2 is (845/1000)^2) = 714025/1000000 = 0.714025.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me compute 0.849^2:

0.849 *0.849.

Compute 849 *849:

Hmm, 800*800=640000.

800*49=39200, 49*800=39200 again. Wait no, 800+49 is 849.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.

Let me compute 0.84^2 = 0.7056.

0.84^2= 0.7056.

0.85^2=0.7225.

We have a²=0.7213, which is between 0.84 and 0.85. Let's compute 0.849^2.

(0.84 + 0.009)^2 = 0.84^2 + 2*(0.84)(0.009) + (0.009)^2.

0.7056 + 2*(0.00756) + 0.000081.

=0.7056 + 0.01512 + 0.000081 = 0.720801.

Our a² is 0.7213, so 0.849^2 = 0.7208. Close.

Compute 0.8495^2: let's see.

= (0.849 + 0.0005)^2.

=0.849^2 + 2*(0.849)(0.0005) + (0.0005)^2.

Which is 0.720801 + 0.000849 + 0.00000025.

So approximately 0.72165.

Wait, but a² is 0.7213. So 0.849^2 is 0.7208, which is 0.7213-0.7208=0.0005 less. So perhaps a is about 0.8496 or so. Wait, but maybe I should just use 0.85 as a rough estimate.

But wait, let's go back. The options are:

A) 1.1

B) 0.85

C) 0.35

D) 0.6

So from the calculation, a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my initial setup because sometimes I get confused with the wave function normalization.

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when I take the modulus squared, I get (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because (real)^2 + (imaginary)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx =1.

Which I correctly set up and found a≈0.85.

Wait, but here's a point: the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So is the wave function only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere? Because the problem says that when they measured, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside of that interval. So in the region x <1 and x>3, ψ(x) is zero. Therefore, the expression given must be valid only between x=1 and x=3.

So that's correct.

So the normalization integral is from 1 to3.

So the calculation I did is correct, leading to a≈0.85.

So the answer should be option B) 0.85.


To determine the value of "a" in the wave function, we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the square modulus of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle was only found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), the wave function is zero outside this interval. The total probability must integrate to 1 over the interval \(x=1\) to \(x=3\). Therefore, we set up the normalization condition:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

1. **First integral**: \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)

   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\). Evaluating from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\):

   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**: \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\)

   This is straightforward:

   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining both results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**
