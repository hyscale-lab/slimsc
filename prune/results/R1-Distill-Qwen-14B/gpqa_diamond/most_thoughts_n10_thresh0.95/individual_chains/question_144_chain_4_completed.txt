Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance has to do with the particle's lifetime and how it decays. 

The question gives me some numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, which I think is also called the decay length. 

Wait, what's the formula for decay length? I think it's something like the product of the lifetime and the velocity of the particle, multiplied by the speed of light. Oh right, the formula is L = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the lifetime, β is the velocity over the speed of light (v/c).

But how do I find τ? Oh, right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the lifetime to the energy width. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by the width Γ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait. I think the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that makes sense. Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

So first, I should compute τ. Then, find the velocity β, and then compute L.

But wait, let me think about the steps again. First, calculate the lifetime τ. Then, calculate the velocity β, and then multiply by c and τ to get the decay length.

Hmm, but how do I find the velocity? I think I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The energy E of the meson is given, which is 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV, so I can find the momentum p from E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

Wait, but the units are a bit tricky here. Let me make sure. E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so I should probably convert everything to SI units or use natural units where c=1. Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in units that make the calculation easier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relativistic formula β = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)), but wait, no, that's gamma squared. Wait, no—wait: β is v/c, so I should find beta from the energy.

Wait, the energy E is given as the production energy, so I can treat E as the total energy of the meson. So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

So p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ) / c.

But I'm working in units where c=1, perhaps, or need to convert. Alternatively, let me see. Let's think about natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. But for calculations, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of velocities.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the velocity beta as sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)). Because in natural units, m and E would have the same units if c=1. Wait, maybe I should express everything in terms of units where c=1 to simplify.

Wait, the energy E of the meson is 8 GeV. Its rest mass is 1.2 GeV/c², so when E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², I can compute beta as sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused with the units. Let's try to compute beta.

Wait, in natural units where c=1, E (in GeV) equals m (in GeV/c²) times c². But perhaps it's better to proceed by using the formula beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, so let's compute (m c^2)^2. m is 1.2 GeV/c², so m c² is 1.2 GeV. E is 8 GeV. So (m c²)^2 = (1.2)^2 (GeV)^2, and E² is (8)^2 (GeV)^2.

So beta squared is 1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2) = 1 - (1.44)/(64) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, so beta is about 0.9887.

But wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Let me compute 1.44 divided by 64: 1.44 / 64 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is about 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, but perhaps I should use beta = p c / E. Alternatively, since E is given, and m is given, maybe it's better to compute beta as sqrt(1 - (m c²)^2/(E)^2) → sqrt(1 - (1.2)^2/(8)^2) ) → sqrt(1 - 1.44/64) → sqrt(1 - 0.0225) → sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887. 

Now, moving on to the lifetime. The lifetime tau is ħ / Γ. Let's compute that. The width Γ is given as 320 MeV. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me make sure. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Gamma → 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV → (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that numerically. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, the decay length L is c * tau * beta. 

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L = c * tau * beta.

Plugging the numbers in: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9887.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625e-16. Then, multiply by 0.9887.

6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.101e-16 m.

Wait, but that's about 6.1e-16 meters. Looking at the options, they are all around 4e-15 or 5e-16, like options A and D are 5e-16 and 4e-16, but I'm getting around 6e-16. Hmm, that doesn't match any option. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up units somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's recheck the calculation for tau.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ / Gamma.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 → 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's correct.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Multiply by beta (0.9887): 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.101e-16 m.

Wait, but the options don't have anything close to 6e-16. The options are A) 5.0223e-16, B)4.0655e-15, C)5.0223e-15, D)4.0655e-16.

Hmm. Did I make a mistake in beta calculation?

Wait, another way: beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

But wait, I think I made a mistake in using E. Because E is the total energy, but when I write E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, then E is the total energy, so E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = E² – (m c²)^2.

So, p = sqrt( (E² – (m c²)^2) ) / c.

But wait, perhaps when calculating beta, which is v/c, which is (pc/E). Because beta = v/c = p c / E.

Ah! That's a better way to compute beta. So beta = (p c) / E.

Wait, that's correct. Because p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c². So p c = gamma m v c, and E = gamma m c². So p c / E = (gamma m v c ) / (gamma m c² ) ) = v/(c) = beta.

So beta = p c / E.

So, from E = 8 GeV, m c^2 = 1.2 GeV.

So, E² = (8)^2 = 64 (GeV)^2.

(m c^2)^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.

So, pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV = 7.91 GeV.

So, beta = (7.91 GeV) / 8 GeV = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875 (same as before). So that part was correct.

So, back to tau. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should consider the natural line width. The decay width Gamma is related to the lifetime by Gamma = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Gamma. So I think that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion for ħ.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582/0.32) * 1e-25 s.

As before, that's about 2.056875e-24 seconds.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So, L = c * tau * beta.

So, 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta (0.98875): 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.101e-16 m.

Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta?

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used E_X = 8 GeV as the center-of-mass energy, but perhaps I should consider that the meson's energy is actually higher. Wait, but no, the problem says production energy is 8 GeV, which I think is the total energy.

Alternatively, maybe I should have used the mean lifetime as tau = ħ/(Gamma), but perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether it's the total width or something else. Or maybe it's the decay constant or another factor.

Wait, another thought: The decay width Gamma is related to the lifetime by Gamma = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Gamma. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula L = c * tau * (p c) / E. Because beta is (p c)/E.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute L = c * tau * (p c / E) → c * tau * beta.

So, let me recompute:

L = c * (tau) * beta.

Where tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So, c * tau = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by beta (0.98875): 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.101e-16 m.

Hmm. But the options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute p c first.

We have E =8 GeV, m c^2=1.2 GeV.

So, (p c)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 – 1.44 = 62.56.

So, p c = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

Then, beta = (p c)/E = 7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the mean decay length formula, which is L = c * (tau) * beta gamma. Wait, no, tau is already the lifetime, which includes gamma. Because tau is the proper lifetime, and the mean lifetime measured in the lab frame is gamma tau. Wait, no, wait. Wait, tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). The lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake here. Because in the particle's rest frame, the lifetime is tau = ħ / Gamma. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer by a factor gamma. So the decay length is calculated using the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma * tau.

So, decay length L = c * (gamma tau) * beta.

Because beta is v/c, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So L = c * gamma tau * beta.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the particle is moving, it takes longer to decay as seen in the lab frame, so the decay length increases by gamma.

So I think I missed this gamma factor earlier. Let me recalculate.

So, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) → 1/sqrt(1 - (0.98875)^2).

Wait, beta is 0.98875, so beta^2 is approximately 0.9775. So 1 - beta^2 is 0.0225, sqrt is 0.15, so gamma is 1/0.15 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

beta = 0.98875 → beta² = (approx) 0.9775.

1 - beta² = 0.0225.

sqrt(0.0225) = 0.15.

So gamma = 1/(0.15) = 6.666...

So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

So, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, wait: 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 → 2.056875e-24 * 6.6667 ≈ Let's compute 2e-24*6.6667=1.33334e-23, 0.056875e-24 *6.6667≈ 0.37916e-24 = 3.7916e-25 → total about 1.37125e-23 s.

So, L = c * tau_lab * beta → 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s * 0.98875.

Compute 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 → 3 * 1.37125 = 4.11375 → 4.11375e-15 m.

Then multiply by 0.98875: 4.11375e-15 * 0.98875 ≈ 4.072e-15 m.

Wait, that's approximately 4.07e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m. So option B is close to 4.07e-15.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute gamma again more accurately.

Beta is 0.98875.

Beta squared is (0.98875)^2 = let's compute it exactly.

0.98875 * 0.98875:

= (approx) (0.98)^2 is 0.9604, and 0.98 * 0.00875 * 2 → 0.98 * 0.0175 = 0.01715, and 0.00875^2 is approx 0.00007656.

So 0.9604 + 0.01715 + 0.00007656 ≈ 0.97762656.

So 1 - beta^2 = 1 – 0.97762656 = 0.02237344.

sqrt(0.02237344) ≈ 0.149577.

So gamma is 1 / 0.149577 ≈ 6.6833.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau = 6.6833 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.6833 * 2.056875:

= 6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125
0.6833 * 2.056875 → approx 0.6833 * 2 =1.3666, 0.6833 * 0.056875≈0.03885 → total ≈1.40545 → total 12.34125 +1.40545≈13.7467.

So tau_lab ≈ 13.7467e-24 s → 1.37467e-23 s.

Now, L = c * tau_lab * beta.

c=3e8 m/s.

So 3e8 * 1.37467e-23 = 3 *1.37467e-15 = 4.12401e-15 m.

Multiply by beta (0.98875):

4.12401e-15 * 0.98875 ≈ let's compute 4.12401 * 0.98875 = approximately 4.12401 * (1 - 0.01125) = 4.12401 - 4.12401 * 0.01125 → 4.12401 ≈4.069.

So 4.069e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option D is 4.0655e-16 m, which is an order of magnitude smaller.

So this calculation gives approximately 4.07e-15, which matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but why the difference between the approximate 4.07 and option B's 4.0655?

Ah, perhaps because I approximated gamma as 6.6833, but perhaps a more accurate calculation would get closer to 4.0655e-15.

So the correct answer should be option B: 4.0655e-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta
\]

where \( c \) is the speed of light, \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the particle, and \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light. The lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The decay width is given as \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), the lifetime is:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The total energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the rest energy \( m_X c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \frac{p c}{E},
\]

where \( p c = \sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2} \), we compute:

\[
p c = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \frac{p c}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the lab-frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the lab-frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \), where:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}.
\]

With \( \beta^2 \approx 0.9775 \), we find:

\[
1 - \beta^2 \approx 0.0225, \quad \sqrt{0.0225} \approx 0.15, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.15} \approx 6.6667.
\]

Thus:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
Using \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), the decay length is:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} \cdot \beta = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.371 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot 0.98875.
\]

First, compute \( c \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} \):

\[
c \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \approx 4.113 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

Then, multiply by \( \beta \):

\[
L = 4.113 \times 10^{-15} \cdot 0.98875 \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
