Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, right. So I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more favored. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^{2- something}.

Wait, the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the dithiocyanato would be the one with two SCN- ions. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^something. The charge would be... well, Co^2+ and each SCN^- is -1, so 2+ + 2*(-1)= 0. So the complex would be neutral. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, I think.

But wait, the stability constants given are β1, β2, β3, β4. Each probably corresponds to the complex with 1,2,3,4 SCN- ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

So the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2], which is β2. But wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato". I think the blue color corresponds to the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex. So that's the one with two thiocyanate ions.

So the task is to find the fraction of Co that is in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, considering all possible complexes and the free Co^2+.

I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the distribution of species can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The general approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step. But since there are four complexes, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the fraction of each species.

Wait, another approach is to use the formula for the fraction of each complex:

The fraction f_n of the complex with n SCN- ligands is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [SCN]^k )

Wait, but wait, the total Co is distributed among all species: free Co^2+ and all the complexes. So the denominator is the sum of all possible β terms multiplied by [SCN]^n plus 1 for the free ion.

Wait, no, the formula is:

The fraction of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Because each β_n is the stability constant for the nth complex. So each term in the denominator accounts for the possible complexes and the free ion (which is 1).

So the denominator is the sum of each possible species contribution.

In our case, [SCN] is 0.1 M. Let's compute each term in the denominator.

Compute each term:

Term for n=0 (free Co^2+): 1

n=1: β1 * [SCN]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

n=2: β2 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

n=3: β3 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

n=4: β4 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 ≈ 2.3646

So the denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Wait, but the numerator for n=2 is β2*(0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

So the fraction f_2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169. So about 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. But wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So that's [Co(SCN)_2], so fraction f_2, which is ~16.9%.

But hold on, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Wait, but sometimes when there are higher complexes, the calculation can be more involved. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the stepwise formation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the conditional formation constant or some other approach.

Wait, another thought: the total concentration of Co is 0.01 M. The fraction f_2 is the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 divided by the total Co concentration.

So the percentage would be (f_2 * c(Co)) * 100, but since the denominator already includes all species, f_2 is the mole fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, no, f_n is the ratio of the complex's concentration to the total concentration of all Co species. So the percentage is f_2 * 100.

So according to my calculation, f_2 is approx 0.169, which is 16.9%. So option D.

But wait, let me compute the denominator more accurately.

Compute each term:

n=0: 1.

n=1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

n=2: 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

n=3: 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

n=4: 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Sum: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; +0.4 = 2.3; +0.063 = 2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

Yes. So denominator is 2.3646.

So f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me calculate 0.4 divided by 2.3646.

2.3646 × 0.169 ≈ 0.4?

Wait, 2.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 0.3999, which is approx 0.4.

So 0.169 is about 16.9%, so option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, the options are A:42.3%, B:25.6%, C:38.1%, D:16.9%.

So the correct answer would be D.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I'm missing something in the stability constants. Because sometimes, the stability constant is given as β for each step, and to get the overall β for the complex with n ligands, you might have to multiply the step-wise βs.

Wait, no. The given β1, β2, etc., are the overall stability constants. Because β for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is the product of each step. For example, β2 would be β1 * β2_step, where β2_step is the step from [CoSCN]^+ to [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

But in the question, the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, I think β1 is for the first complex (n=1), β2 for n=2, etc.

So my initial approach is correct.

Therefore, the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16, corresponding to complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 thiocyanate ions, respectively. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

The fraction of cobalt in the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex is given by:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
- \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
- \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)

The denominator is the sum of all terms:
\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction \( f_2 \) is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Thus, the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is:
\[
f_2 \cdot 100 \approx 16.9\%
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
