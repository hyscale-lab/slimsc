--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The problem states that there's a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because those have strong, broad O-H stretches. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but I'm not sure yet.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which I think is a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ketone or an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Or could it be an amide? But the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not an amide.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It says there are several peaks, including some for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe a conjugated system since there's a peak at 1650 in IR, which could be a conjugated double bond next to a carbonyl group.

Now the mass spec part: the fragment peak is at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be (CH3)2O+ (methyl ether, but that's 31?), wait, what's the molecular weight of C3H6O? Let me calculate: 3*(12) =36, 6*(1)=6; O is 16. So 36+6+16=58. No, that's not 45. Wait, 45 is maybe the molecular ion of something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a fragment with a carbonyl group.

Wait, 45 could be the tropylium ion, which is C7H7+. No, that's 91. Or maybe it's a smaller fragment. What about a CH2CO+ group? Let's see: CH2CO is 44 (12*2 + 1*4 +16 = 24+4+16=44), but maybe adding one more H? Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, 45 could be (CH3CO)+, which is 43 (12*2 + 3 +16= 24+3+16=43?), but that's not 45. Or perhaps a CH2CH2O group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene ion or something else.

Wait, another approach: looking at the molecular formulas. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So the possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

I need to figure out which fits the data.

Let's think about the FTIR first. The broad peak at 3000 suggests an O-H group. So possible functional groups: carboxylic acid, alcohol, or maybe an ester (but ester O-H is usually less broad and might not be as strong). Alternatively, maybe it's an ether, but ethers don't have O-H. So probably either a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Wait, but the carbonyl at 1700. A carboxylic acid's carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, yes. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the formula would have at least one O from the -COOH group. Let's see the options: options A and C have two oxygen atoms, while B and D have one and two respectively.

Wait, option D is C6H12O, which would have one O. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the formula would be CnH2nO2, because the formula for carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2. So for n=6, it would be C6H12O2 (which is option A). Hmm. But wait, the problem states that the IR shows a peak at 1650. If it's a carboxylic acid, maybe that's an overtone or another group. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is due to conjugation. Or perhaps it's an ester? Because esters have carbonyl around 1700-1750, but maybe some esters are lower. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule has a double bond. So maybe it's an enol ester? Or an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester or acid. Let me think about the possible structures.

Alternatively, if the compound is a ketone, but then the O-H would not be present, so that might not fit the IR. But the broad peak suggests O-H, so probably not a ketone.

So if it's a carboxylic acid or an ester, or an alcohol with a carbonyl group.

Wait, another point: the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. For a carboxylic acid, maybe losing CO2 would leave a fragment. Let's see: if the molecular formula is C6H12O2 (option A), then the molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116. If it loses CO2 (which is 44), then the remaining would be C5H12O, which has a molecular weight of 5*12 +12 +16=60 +12+16= 88. Hmm, but the fragment is 45, not 44 or 88.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment at 45 comes from a smaller part. Let's see. 45 is 45 g/mol. What could that be? Let's see: C3H6O2? That would be (3*12) +6 +32=36+6+32=74. No. Or maybe C3H6O? (3*12)+(6)+(16)=36+6+16=58. No. Wait, maybe it's a CH2 group attached somewhere? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone fragment. Or perhaps the fragment is from a CH3CO group. Let me calculate: CH3CO is (12*2)+(1*3)+16=24+3+16=43. Hmm, close to 45, but not exactly. Wait, maybe it's (CH3CO) with a loss of something. Or maybe it's a different group.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, the structure would be R-O-CO-R'. Esters have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, which fits. And the broad peak at 3000 could be from an -OH group, but esters don't have free -OH unless it's an ester with an adjacent hydroxyl. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a cyclic structure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the molecular formulas and possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be a cyclic ester (like a lactone), a diol with a ketone, but more likely a carboxylic acid or an ester. For a diacid, but with six carbons, that's possible.

Option B: C6H10O. This would be an alcohol with six carbons and one O. But the IR has a carbonyl peak, which would require another O, so this option might not fit. Because if it's an alcohol with a carbonyl, then the O count would be two, making it C6H10O2 (option C) or C6H12O2 (option A).

Option C: C6H10O2. So two O's. Possible structures could be an ester, a ketone with an alcohol, but more likely an ester or a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Option D: C6H12O. Only one O. So again, to have a carbonyl group, you need another O, so perhaps this is less likely, unless it's a ketone. But then the broad peak wouldn't be there.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to approach each piece of data again.

FTIR: 3000 (broad) → O-H. So the compound has an O-H group. 1700 → C=O. So maybe a carboxylic acid (since they have both O-H and C=O). But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, then the formula should be CnH2nO2. For n=6, C6H12O2, which is option A. But wait, the molecular formula of a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2. So for hexanoic acid, it's C6H12O2. But hexanoic acid is a saturated acid, and in this case, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond. So maybe it's not a simple carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. So a compound with a double bond adjacent to the carboxylic acid. That would fit the vinyl H in NMR. The structure would be something like CH2=CH-COOH, but that would be a dien structure. Wait, wait, but the formula of such a compound would be C6H10O2. Because, for example, if it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH, but that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is within the chain.

Wait, let's think about the formula for an alpha, beta-unsaturated acid. For a five-carbon acid, maybe it's something like CH2=CHCH2COOH. But that would be C5H8O2. Hmm, but our options are C6. So perhaps it's a six-carbon compound with a double bond and a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, another thought: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule has a double bond. If the compound is a dien, perhaps. Or it could be an ester with a double bond.

Wait, the FTIR at 1650 cm-1: that could be a conjugated double bond, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So the carbonyl is at 1700, and the conjugated double bond would cause a peak around 1650.

So the structure might be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or acid. Let's think. An alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would have a structure like CH2=CHCOOR. The carbonyl would be at around 1700, and the conjugated double bond would cause the peak at 1650.

So the formula would be C6H10O2 (since each double bond reduces the number of H by 2). Let's see: for a six-carbon ester with a double bond, the formula would be C6H10O2. That's option C.

Wait, but the molecular formula for an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would be CnH2n-2O2. Let's see: n=6 → 2n-2=10, so C6H10O2. Yes, which is option C.

So putting this together:

- FTIR shows O-H (broad peak), so it's a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But the presence of a carbonyl and the conjugated double bond (from IR) suggests it's an acid with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but if it's an ester, the O-H wouldn't be present. So that would rule out an ester. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, but a carboxylic acid with a double bond would have the formula C6H10O2. Because the general formula for a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2. If it's unsaturated (with a double bond), each double bond reduces the H count by 2. So for n=6, 2n=12, minus 2 (for the double bond) → 10 H. So the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

But wait, the possible options are:

A) C6H12O2 → 12 H, so no double bonds, but the NMR shows vinyl H. Hmm, that's a problem. Because a double bond would reduce the H count. So option A (C6H12O2) would have 12 H, which would imply no double bonds, but the NMR shows vinyl H. So that's a contradiction.

So option A is probably incorrect because it would not have a double bond, but the NMR shows vinyl H.

Thus, the correct formula should be option C, which has 10 H. So a double bond is present.

Wait, but the mass spec's fragment is at 45. Let's think again. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is (6*12)+(10)+(2*16) =72 +10 +32=114 g/mol. So the molecular ion would be at 114. But the fragment is at 45. What fragment would give 45?

Hmm, maybe it's a loss of something from the molecule. Alternatively, the fragment is a smaller ion, like a CH2CO+ group. Let me calculate the molecular weight of CH2CO+. CH2CO is 44 (12*2 + 2 +16 = 24 + 2 +16=42? Wait: CH2CO is CH2-CO, which is CH3CO, but that's 43 (12*2 +3 +16= 24+3+16=43). Hmm, but that's 43. The fragment is 45, which is 2 more. So maybe another approach.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion, which is a (CH3)2CO+? Wait, the formula for that would be C3H4O, which has a molecular weight of 3*12 +4 +16=36+4+16=56. No, that's not 45.

Wait, another approach: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, then possible losses during fragmentation include losing a fragment of 69 (maybe), leaving 45. But wait, 69 is the molecular weight of something else, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from an ethyl group plus something. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe a propyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketone group. Wait, 45 could be a ketene ion, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is an ester. If it's an ester, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But that would have more than six carbons. Alternatively, a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass fragment is due to a more stable fragment, like a vinyl group. For example, CH2=CH- could break off, but that's 28 (CH2=CH- is 28?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage of the molecule to form a smaller ion. For example, if the molecule breaks at the carbonyl, maybe the fragment would be the acylium ion (CH2=CHCOO+), but that's 73 (12*4 + 3 + 16 =48+3+16=67? Not sure).

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the data again.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. The IR has a carbonyl and an O-H. So the compound likely has a conjugated system, perhaps an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid.

In that case, the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C). So the molecular formula is C6H10O2.

Now, the mass spec shows a fragment at 45. Let's think about the possible fragments. One possibility is that the molecule breaks to form a fragment with a molecular weight of 45. So what's 45? 45 is 9*5, but that doesn't help much. Wait, 45 could be C3H7O+? Let me calculate: (3*12)+(7)+(16)=36+7+16=59. No. Or C3H3O2+? 3*12=36, 3 H=3, O2=32. 36+3+32=71. No. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH3COCH2+ group, which would be 59 (12*3 +6 +16=36+6+16=58). No, not 45.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. The degrees of unsaturation can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero here, (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 → (14-10)/2 =4/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could be one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds, or a triple bond plus a double bond, etc. But the NMR shows a vinyl group, so a double bond. So perhaps one double bond and a ring.

Wait, but the formula C6H10O2 with two degrees of unsaturation could be a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. Wait, a lactone would have a ring, and if there's a double bond, that's another degree of unsaturation. So that would fit.

So, for example, a gamma-lactone with a double bond. But I'm not sure how that would affect the mass spec.

Wait, another idea: the mass fragment at 45 could be the loss of a 70 mass fragment. Because 114 (molecular weight) - 70 =44, which is close but not exactly. Or maybe the other way around.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is formed by cleavage at the carbonyl group. For example, in an alpha,beta-unsaturated acid, the molecule might break between the carbonyl and the double bond, leaving a fragment with the carbonyl group and a smaller chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketone. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOH, but that's five carbons. Wait, perhaps it's a six-carbon compound: CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. The molecular formula would be C6H10O2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH.

In that case, during mass spectrometry, the molecule could fragment in a way that leaves a smaller piece. For example, losing the CH2CH2CH2COOH part and keeping the CH2=CH part. But that's only two carbons, which would be 28 (CH2=CH2 is 28). Not matching 45.

Alternatively, maybe it breaks after the carbonyl group. For example, the molecule breaks into a five-carbon fragment and a one-carbon fragment. But that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the fragment is due to the formation of an acylium ion. For example, the carbonyl group could form a stable ion. The acylium ion for a six-carbon compound would be larger than 45, but perhaps a smaller ion is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ring-opening. If the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond, then during fragmentation, the ring could open, releasing a smaller fragment. For example, a four-membered ring lactone would release a smaller fragment upon cleavage.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is formed by the loss of a group like COOH, but that would leave a 45 fragment only if the rest is small. For example, if the original molecule is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3, but that's seven carbons. Hmm, not fitting.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the methyl ester part. For example, if the compound is an ester with a methyl group, the fragment could be the methyl ester's ion. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the result of a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in mass spectrometry for ketones. The McLafferty rearrangement produces a fragment with a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Wait, another idea: the fragment at 45 could be the (CH3)2CO+ ion, which is 44 (acetone). Hmm, 44 is close but not exactly 45. Unless there's an additional H or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the (CH3)COCH2+ ion, which would be 59. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's the (CH2)2CO+ ion. Let me calculate: (2*12)+(2*2) +16=24+4+16=44. Again, close to 45 but not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back.

The key points are:

- O-H (from IR) → formula must have O-H, so either -OH or another O-containing group.

- C=O at 1700 → formula must have a carbonyl group.

- NMR shows vinyl H → double bond present.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: C6H10O2 → 6 carbons, 10 H, 2 O.

This formula has two O and 6 carbons. Possible structures: a carboxylic acid with a double bond, or an ester with a double bond, or a ketone with an alcohol group and a double bond.

But the O-H is present, so if it's an ester, there would be an O-H elsewhere, which would require another functional group, which might complicate things. Alternatively, if it's a diol with a carbonyl group, but that seems less likely.

Wait, another possibility: it's a beta-keto acid. For example, a compound with a structure like CH2=C(COOH)CH2CH2CH2. But that would be more like a six-carbon structure with a keto and carboxylic acid group. Let me check the formula. Each keto group is O, and the carboxylic acid is another O, so total O is two. So the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

In such a structure, the IR would show O-H (from the acid), the C=O from the keto group, and the C=C from the double bond, which would explain the NMR's vinyl H.

As for the mass spec fragment at 45, perhaps it's a fragment from the beta-keto acid. For example, the loss of the COOH group (which is 44 g/mol?), leaving a fragment of 70 (6*12=72 - 2 H2=2 → 70). But 70 isn't 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a larger group, leaving a smaller ion. For example, if the molecule breaks after the keto group, the fragment could be the CH2-CO part, which is 44. Close but not 45.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is from a CH2=CHCO+ group. Let's calculate: CH2=CHCO+ is (CH2=CHCO) → 12*3 + 5 (since each CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1, CO has... Wait, the molecular formula for CH2=CHCO is C3H4O. So molecular weight is 3*12 +4 +16=36+4+16=56. Hmm, that's not matching 45.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3CO+ group, which is 43. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a COCH2CH2+ ion. COCH2CH2 has a molecular weight of (12*3)+(4)+16= 36+4+16=56. No.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let's think of the mass 45. 45 divided by 15 is 3, so maybe it's a propyl group plus something. Or perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, 45 could be a propyl group with an oxygen. For example, OCH2CH2CH3 is 45? Let me calculate: O is 16, each CH2 is 14 (12+2) and CH3 is 15. So O + CH2CH2CH3 → 16 + (14*2) +15 → 16+28+15=60. No.

Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl ester group. CH3O would be 31. Not 45.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fragment is a result of the molecule losing a larger part and retaining a smaller one. For example, if the molecular ion is 114, and it loses 69, then 114-69=45. So what could 69 be? 69 is the molecular weight of something like C4H9O (4*12=48 +9 +16= 73? No. Or C3H7NO, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, 69 is the molecular weight of something else. Let me see: 69 = 12*2 + 9 + 16*2 → 24 +9 +32=65. Not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, 69 could be the molecular weight of C3H15O. No, that's 3*12=36 +15 +16=67. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's a cleavage after the carbonyl group. For example, if the molecule is RCOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, then losing RCO- would leave CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, which has a molecular weight of 70 (since it's C5H11). Again, not 45.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should make a decision based on the other data and see if the mass spec part aligns.

If the compound is C6H10O2 (option C), which has a double bond and an O-H, that fits the IR and NMR data. The mass spec fragment at 45 might be a specific fragment I can't identify right now, but the other data points strongly suggest option C.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecule is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH, losing the CH2CH2COOH part (which would be 70 g/mol, as 70 is 70) would leave a fragment of 44 (CH2=CH2 is 28, but that doesn't add up). Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the compound is an ester with a double bond. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. The formula would be C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 114. During fragmentation, it might lose the ester group, leaving the CH2=CHCOO- part. But I'm not sure about the exact fragments.

Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could be the result of a McLafferty rearrangement in an ester. McLafferty rearrangement occurs in ketones, where a gamma hydrogen is abstracted, leading to a six-membered transition state and the formation of a new carbonyl. The fragment formed would be the alkene part. For example, if the ester is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3, the McLafferty rearrangement would form a fragment with the double bond, but I'm not certain how that would translate into the m/z.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the acylium ion. For an ester, the acylium ion would have a molecular weight of the acyl group. For example, if the acyl group is CH2=CHCOO-, then the molecular weight would be 73 (3 carbons: 3*12=36, 4 H: 4, O:16 → 36+4+16=56). No, that's 56, not 45.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me summarize:

- The IR suggests O-H (broad) and C=O (1700 and 1650).

- The NMR shows vinyl H, meaning a double bond.

- The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2 → no double bond (since 12 H for a 6-carbon would be fully saturated). But the NMR has vinyl H, so this is probably wrong.

B) C6H10O → only one O, but we have O-H and C=O, so two O's needed. So B is unlikely.

C) C6H10O2 → fits two O's, a double bond, and O-H.

D) C6H12O → only one O, which doesn't fit the O-H and C=O.

So the correct answer is either C or A. But A can't have a double bond because it's C6H12O2, which is 2n+2 for n=6 (saturated). So the NMR showing vinyl H rules out A.

Thus, the correct formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The key observations and reasoning are as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.
- Strong absorption peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system (e.g., an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl).

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of **vinyl hydrogens** indicates a double bond in the compound.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests a smaller ion fragment, possibly from a stable structure within the molecule.

### Molecular Formula Analysis:
The options provided are:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**

#### Key Observations:
1. **O-H and C=O Groups**: The FTIR data requires the compound to have both an O-H group and a carbonyl group. This implies the molecular formula must have at least two oxygen atoms. Options **B** and **D** (with only one oxygen) are therefore unlikely.
2. **Double Bond**: The ¹H NMR data shows vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of a double bond. This reduces the number of hydrogens in the molecule. A fully saturated compound like **C₆H₁₂O₂** (option A) does not fit the NMR data.
3. **Degrees of Unsaturation**: The formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** (option C) has two degrees of unsaturation, which can correspond to one double bond and one ring or two double bonds. This aligns with the presence of a double bond (from the NMR data) and the conjugated system suggested by the IR data.

### Mass Spectrometry Fragment:
The fragment at **m/z = 45** is consistent with a smaller ion, possibly from a stable fragment of the molecule. While the exact structure of the fragment is unclear, the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** (option C) provides a plausible framework for such a fragment.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two oxygen atoms (to account for the O-H and C=O groups), a double bond (to account for the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR), and a molecular formula that fits the mass spectrometry data. Among the options, **C₆H₁₀O₂** (option C) satisfies all the given data.
