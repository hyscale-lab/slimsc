Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. It's about the decay of a boson, X, with a mass of 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible decay channels.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Oh right, the interaction term between the boson X and the fermions. So the X boson is interacting with various fermions, and the decay products depend on which fermions are accessible.

Since it's about decays, I'm thinking about what fermions can be produced when the X boson decays. The key here is kinematical allowance—so the mass of the X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. Because in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products.

The X boson's mass is 6 GeV. Now, I need to think about the masses of the possible fermions mentioned in the options. Let me list the fermion masses:

Electron (e): negligible, about 0.0005 GeV.
Muon (μ): about 0.105 GeV.
Tau (τ): about 1.777 GeV.
Up quark (u): around 2 MeV (so 0.002 GeV).
Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV).
Strange (s): around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV).
Charm (c): about 1.5 GeV.
Bottom (b): around 4.5 GeV.
Top (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV. But wait, X is only 6 GeV, so top quarks are out of the question.

Okay, so the possible fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c, b. But we have to see if their pairs can be produced.

So when X decays into fermion-antifermion pairs, the total energy for each pair must be less than or equal to the mass of X. So for a pair like e+ e-, the sum is just twice the electron mass, which is negligible, so definitely allowed. Similarly, muon pair would be about 0.21 GeV, which is much less than 6 GeV. Tau pair would be about 3.55 GeV (since 2 * 1.777 ≈ 3.554). So 3.554 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so that's allowed.

What about quarks? For each quark pair, the sum is twice the quark mass. So u quarks: 0.004 GeV, way under. d: 0.0094 GeV, still way under. s: 0.2 GeV, which is under. c: 3 GeV (since 2 * 1.5 =3), which is less than 6 GeV. So c cbar is allowed. What about b quarks? The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, so twice that is 9 GeV. But X is 6 GeV, so 9 GeV is more than 6. That's not allowed. So X can't decay into b bbar. Therefore, any option that includes b bbar is incorrect.

Wait, let me check the options:

Option A: includes b bbar. So that's out because 2*m_b is about 9 GeV which is more than X's 6 GeV.

Option D: same, includes b bbar. So that's not possible. So A and D can be eliminated.

What about the other options? Let's see:

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So does that include any particles whose pair sum exceeds 6 GeV?

Tau pair is about 3.55 GeV, so allowed. c pair is 3 GeV, allowed. s is 0.2, u and d even less. Mu and e are way under. So all these are allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, and also top quarks. But top is 173 GeV, so twice that is way more than 6 GeV. So top can't be, so C is out.

So the only possible option is B or perhaps another option. Wait, option B is X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, what about the charm quark? 1.5 GeV each, so 3 GeV total. That's less than 6 GeV. So yes, c cbar is allowed.

Wait, but wait. Let's double-check the masses. Let me make a table:

Fermion | Mass (GeV) | 2m (GeV)
--- | --- | ---
e | ~0.0005 | ~0.001
μ | ~0.105 | ~0.21
τ | ~1.777 | ~3.554
u | ~0.002 | ~0.004
d | ~0.0047 | ~0.0094
s | ~0.1 | ~0.2
c | ~1.5 | ~3
b | ~4.5 | ~9
t | ~173 | ~346

So for each X → f fbar, 2m_f must be ≤ 6 GeV.

So which fermions have 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV?

All except b and t. Because 2m_b is ~9 GeV, which is more than 6.

So what about the options:

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All their 2m are <=6 GeV.

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option C: includes t, which is way over. So C is wrong.

So the allowed decay channels are all pairs except those where 2m_f >6 GeV.

So the options are B, perhaps, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options:

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, all those 2m are under 6 GeV. So B is correct.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So D is wrong.

So the answer must be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The decays depend on the fermion pairs \( f \bar{f} \) that the boson can produce, which is constrained by the condition that the total mass of the decay products, \( 2m_f \), must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraints**: The mass of \( X \) is 6 GeV. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the sum of the masses of the fermion pair, \( 2m_f \), must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Fermion Masses**:
   - \( e \): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV}, \, 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( \mu \): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV}, \, 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( \tau \): \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV}, \, 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( u \): \( m_u \approx 0.002 \, \text{GeV}, \, 2m_u \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( d \): \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV}, \, 2m_d \approx 0.0094 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( s \): \( m_s \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV}, \, 2m_s \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( c \): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV}, \, 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( b \): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV}, \, 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 9 > 6 \)).
   - \( t \): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV}, \, 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 346 > 6 \)).

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Eliminated**.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). All these fermion pairs satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Valid**.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Eliminated**.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Eliminated**.

### Conclusion:
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order are listed in **Option B**.

Answer: B
