Okay, so I've got this question about molecular spectroscopy, specifically about the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says we have a diatomic molecule made of atoms X and Y. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch it to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state of the molecule. So the next state would be the first excited state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the state is characterized by both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the rotational quantum number J. But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, also known as the rotation-vibration or quantum rotation-vibration model. So this model includes both vibrational and rotational energy changes.

But wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition from one state to another, which could involve a change in both vibrational and rotational energy. However, the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that implies the next higher energy state, which for this case would be the first excited state from the fundamental.

Wait, but what's the fundamental state in terms of vibrational and rotational quantum numbers? The ground state for vibration is n=0, and for rotation, the ground state is J=0 (since J can be 0,1,2,...). So the fundamental state is n=0, J=0.

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either increase its vibrational energy (n increases) or rotational energy (J increases), or both. But the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition is lower in energy: increasing n by 1 (vibrational) or increasing J by 1 (rotational)?

I remember that in diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy levels are more closely spaced than the rotational ones. Or wait, no, actually, the spacing between rotational states is smaller than the spacing between vibrational states. Because the rotational energy levels depend on J(J+1), so the spacing increases with J, but starting from a lower value than the vibrational spacing.

Wait, the vibrational energy spacing is ΔE_vib = hν, where ν is the vibrational frequency. The rotational energy spacing is ΔE_rot = B[ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ] = B(2J+3), where B is the rotational constant. The rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1). So the spacing between adjacent J levels is increasing with J. For J=0 → J=1, the energy difference is E_1 - E_0 = B*(2 - 0) = 2B. For J=1 → J=2, it's B*(6-2) =4B, etc.

But in the non-rigid rotor model, you also have to consider vibrational changes. So the total energy would be a combination of vibrational and rotational.

But the question is about the smallest possible energy increase. So the molecule can transition to a state where either n increases by 1, or J increases by 1, or both.

So which transition has a lower energy? The vibrational transition (n=0 → n=1) has an energy of hν, where ν is the vibrational frequency. The rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) has an energy of 2B. The question is which one is smaller, so that the photon has the lower momentum.

I need to calculate both hν and 2B, and see which is smaller. The photon's energy will be the smaller of these two, because that's the next possible state with the lowest energy.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is n=0, J=0. The next possible state with the lowest energy would be the one where either n or J increases by 1, whichever requires less energy. Because the next state after the fundamental state would be the one with the least possible energy increase.

So to find the minimum possible energy that the photon should have, we need to compute both the vibrational and rotational energy increments and take the smaller one.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition involves a change in both J and n. But for the lowest energy, probably it's a pure rotational or pure vibrational transition.

Wait, but the photon's energy is given by E_photon = h c / λ = h ν. But in this case, the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states. So if the energy needed for a vibrational transition (hν) is smaller than that for a rotational transition (2B), then the photon's energy will be hν. Otherwise, 2B.

Wait, but what is the value of B? The rotational constant B is given by (h/(8π² c I)) ), but wait, another formula: B = (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, I think the rotational constant B (also called the rotational energy constant) is given by B = (ħ²) / (2 I), where I is the moment of inertia, I = μ r², μ is the reduced mass, r is the bond length.

So let's compute B.

Given:

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) * amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg.

So Mx = 20 amu → 20 * 1.66e-27 = 3.32e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu → 3.32e-27 kg? Wait no:

Wait, 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

2 amu is 2 * 1.66e-27 = 3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * amu.

Wait, but let me compute that. The numerator is 20*2 =40, denominator is 22. So μ=40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but I can compute it in kg.

μ = (20 * My) / (20 + My) → wait, wait, no: the formula is μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

So Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 *2 ) / (20 +2 ) = 40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ (1.818 * 1.6605e-27) kg.

Calculating that: 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.017 → so μ ≈3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, let me check that calculation again:

1.818 * 1.6605 = let's compute:

1.8 *1.6605= about 3.0, 0.018 *1.6605 ≈0.03. So total ≈ 3.03e-27 kg.

So μ ≈3.03e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2 * 1e-10 meters = 2e-10 m.

So the moment of inertia I = μ R² = 3.03e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Compute that: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m². So I =3.03e-27 *4e-20 =1.212e-46 kg m².

Now compute B: B = ħ²/(2 I).

ħ is reduced Planck's constant. h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ = h/(2π) ≈1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J² s².

Then, 2 I =2 *1.212e-46 =2.424e-46 kg m².

So B= (1.112e-68) / (2.424e-46) = approx 4.586e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, 1.112e-68 divided by 2.424e-46 is (1.112 / 2.424 ) * 1e(-68 +46) = approx 0.459 *1e-22 =4.59e-23 J.

But wait, J is a unit of energy. So B is about 4.59e-23 J.

Now, the rotational energy change when J increases by 1:

ΔE_rot = B [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ] for J=0 → J=1.

Wait, for J=0, J+1=1. So (J+1) =1, J+2=2. So (1)(2) - (0)(1) )= 2.

So ΔE_rot = B * (2) = 2B = 2 *4.59e-23 =9.18e-23 J.

Alternatively, I might have gotten the formula wrong. Wait, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J +1). So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_1 - E_0 = B (1*2) - 0 =2B.

Yes, that's correct.

Now the vibrational energy change when n increases by 1. The vibrational frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_n = (n + 1/2)h w. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is ΔE_vib = h w.

Because E_1 - E_0 = (1 + 1/2) hw - (0 + 1/2) hw )= hw.

So ΔE_vib = h w.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

w =4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. The vibrational energy quantum is E_n = (n + 1/2) h bar w, but wait, no, wait, in the harmonic oscillator model, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) ħ ω. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is ħ ω.

Wait, so I should use ħ instead of h. So let me recalculate.

ΔE_vib = ħ * w.

ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

w =4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = (1.05457 *4 )e-20 = 4.2183e-20 J.

So now, comparing ΔE_rot and ΔE_vib.

ΔE_rot is 9.18e-23 J.

ΔE_vib is 4.2183e-20 J.

Which is smaller? 9.18e-23 is much smaller than 4.2e-20.

Wait, no. Wait, 9e-23 is less than 4e-20? Wait, yes, because 4e-20 is 400e-22, which is much larger than 9e-23.

So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one.

Wait, but wait, I think I got the energy levels wrong. Because the question says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which is a non-rigid rotor. So perhaps the transitions aren't just pure rotational or pure vibrational, but a combination. But for the lowest possible energy, the minimum photon energy needed would be the smaller of the two.

But in this case, the rotational transition is much lower in energy than the vibrational. So the photon's energy should be 2B, which is 9.18e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because the photon's momentum p is related to its energy E by E = p c, where c is the speed of light.

Wait, but wait, E = p c → p = E / c.

So using E_photon = 2B = 9.18e-23 J, and c is 3e8 m/s.

p = (9.18e-23 J ) / (3e8 m/s) )= 3.06e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are anywhere near that. The options are around 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns.

Wait, Ns is kg·m/s, so yes, the same as momentum.

Hmm, this suggests that either I made a mistake in my calculations, or
