Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see what I can remember. 

The problem says that the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Oh right, quantum mechanical operators like this are often related to angular momentum. Wait, the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So this must be the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. That makes sense because the Pauli matrices are used for spin-1/2 systems, like electrons or muons.

So, the operator P is a vector operator, and the components are:
P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

The question is about finding the eigenvector when the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, what's that mean? Oh, right, because the direction n can be expressed in spherical coordinates, but since it's in the x-z plane, the angle phi (azimuthal) is zero. So the direction is along some theta from the z-axis.

Wait, no—wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the vector n can be parameterized by an angle theta from the z-axis, and phi would be zero. So the direction is (sin theta, 0, cos theta) in x, y, z. So the operator P along n would be P·n = P_x sin theta cos phi + P_y sin theta sin phi + P_z cos theta. But since phi is zero, cos phi is 1, sin phi is 0. So P·n = P_x sin theta + P_z cos theta.

So the operator we're interested in is (P_x sin theta + P_z cos theta). And we need to find its eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but maybe there's a simpler approach. Since the operator is along an arbitrary direction, the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates can be written using the spherical basis.

Alternatively, maybe I should construct the matrix for P·n and then find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Let me write out P·n. Since it's in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so:

P·n = (P_x sin theta) + (P_z cos theta)

Let me compute that matrix. P_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], so sin theta times that is:
sin theta * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]

Similarly, P_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0], [0,-1]], so cos theta times that is:
cos theta * (ħ/2) [[1,0], [0,-1]]

Adding these together, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cos theta, sin theta ],
          [ sin theta, -cos theta ] ]

Wait, is that correct? Let me check:

First element (1,1): (ħ/2)(cos theta *1 + 0) = (ħ/2) cos theta.

Element (1,2): (ħ/2) (sin theta *1 + 0) = (ħ/2) sin theta.

Element (2,1): same as (1,2), because P_x is symmetric. So (ħ/2) sin theta.

Element (2,2): (ħ/2)(0 + (-1)*cos theta) = -(ħ/2) cos theta.

Yes, that looks right.

So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) times [ [cos theta, sin theta], [sin theta, -cos theta] ].

Now, the eigenvalues of a spin-1/2 operator along a direction should be ± ħ/2. Because the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, they become ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2.

To find the eigenvector, let's set up the eigenvalue equation: (P·n - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0

So, the matrix P·n is (ħ/2) * [[cos theta, sin theta], [sin theta, -cos theta]], and subtracting (ħ/2) I gives:

(ħ/2) [ [ cos theta -1, sin theta ], [sin theta, -cos theta -1 ] ]

Wait, no. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (P·n - (ħ/2) I) would be:

(ħ/2) [[ cos theta -1, sin theta ],
        [ sin theta, -cos theta -1 ] ]

Because each diagonal element is ( (ħ/2) cos theta ) - (ħ/2)*1 for (1,1) and ( (ħ/2) (-cos theta) ) - (ħ/2)*1 for (2,2).

So the matrix becomes:

ħ/2 [ [ cos theta -1, sin theta ],
        [ sin theta, -cos theta -1 ] ]

But I can factor out ħ/2, so the equation is:

[ [ cos theta -1, sin theta ],
  [ sin theta, -cos theta -1 ] ] * |v> = 0, where |v> is the eigenvector.

So, let me write the matrix for the equation:

[ [ cos theta -1, sin theta ],
  [ sin theta, -cos theta -1 ] ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero for non-trivial solutions. Wait, but since we're solving for eigenvectors, and the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, the matrix (P·n - λ I) has determinant zero. But perhaps I should directly find the eigenvector.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the eigenvalue equation in terms of the components. Let me call the eigenvector components (a, b)^T.

So,

[ (cos theta -1) * a + sin theta * b ] = 0
[ sin theta * a + ( -cos theta -1 ) * b ] = 0

These are two equations. Let me write them:

1) (cos theta -1) a + sin theta b = 0
2) sin theta a + (-cos theta -1) b = 0

Looking for non-trivial solutions, so the determinant must be zero, but perhaps the two equations are dependent. Let me see.

From equation 1: (cos theta -1) a = - sin theta b

So, a = [ - sin theta / (cos theta -1) ] * b

Simplify the denominator: cos theta -1 = -(1 - cos theta )

So,

a = [ - sin theta / ( - (1 - cos theta) ) ] b = [ sin theta / (1 - cos theta) ) ] b

Hmm, 1 - cos theta is 2 sin²(theta/2), and sin theta is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So let's substitute:

sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
1 - cos theta = 2 sin^2(theta/2)
So,

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ) ] b = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b = cot(theta/2) * b

So a = cot(theta/2) b

So, the eigenvector can be written as:

a = cot(theta/2) b
b = b

Let me choose b = 1 for simplicity, so a = cot(theta/2). Then the eigenvector is (cot(theta/2), 1).

But wait, eigenvectors can be scaled by any non-zero scalar, so this is a solution. But we need to normalize it.

The eigenvector is (cot(theta/2), 1). Let's compute its norm.

The square of the norm is |a|^2 + |b|^2. Since a is real, assuming theta is real, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have complex coefficients, but in this case, since the operator is Hermitian (because it's a component of angular momentum), the eigenvectors should be real or come in complex conjugate pairs. Wait, no, because the operator along n is Hermitian, so its eigenvectors can be taken as real, but perhaps not, but in this case, since the direction is along x-z, I think the eigenvectors might be real.

Wait, but looking at the components of the eigenvector, if theta is zero, the direction is along z, so the eigenvector would be (0,1), which is correct. Similarly, if theta is 90 degrees (pi/2), the direction is along x, and the eigenvector would be (1,0). Let's see: if theta is pi/2, then theta/2 is pi/4. So cot(pi/4)=1, so the vector is (1,1). Wait, but that's not normalized. Wait, when theta is pi/2, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the eigenvector should be (1,0) for P_x, but according to our expression, it's (1,1). Hmm, that suggests a mistake in my approach. Wait, maybe I messed up the derivation.

Wait, let's double-check the equations.

From equation 1: (cos theta -1) a + sin theta b =0
Equation 2: sin theta a + (-cos theta -1 ) b =0

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying. Let me re-derive.

Starting with equation 1:

(cos theta - 1) a + sin theta b =0 → equation (1)

Equation 2:

sin theta a + (-cos theta -1) b =0 → equation (2)

Let me solve these two equations. Since the system is homogeneous (equals zero), the determinant must be zero for non-trivial solutions. Let me compute the determinant.

Determinant D:
(cos theta -1)(-cos theta -1) - (sin theta)^2 = ?

Expanding:

= ( - (cos theta -1)(cos theta +1) ) - sin^2 theta
= [ - (cos^2 theta -1) ) ] - sin^2 theta
= [ - cos^2 theta +1 ] - sin^2 theta
= 1 - cos^2 theta - sin^2 theta
But cos^2 + sin^2 =1 → 1-1=0.

So determinant is zero, which confirms that non-trivial solutions exist.

Now, going back to equation (1):

(cos theta -1) a + sin theta b =0 → equation (1a)

Let me express a in terms of b.

(cos theta -1) a = - sin theta b → a = [ - sin theta / (cos theta -1) ] b

Which I can rewrite as:

a = [ sin theta / (1 - cos theta) ] b

Now, using the identity 1 - cos theta = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), we get:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ) ] b → a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b → a = cot(theta/2) b

So, the eigenvector can be written as (a, b) = (cot(theta/2) b, b)

But wait, for the case when theta is 0, the direction is along z. So theta =0, theta/2 is 0, cot(0) is infinite, which suggests a is infinite, but that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should parameterize the eigenvector differently. Let me think: when theta is 0, the direction is along z, so the eigenvector should be (0,1) for eigenvalue +ħ/2, since P_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So when theta=0, our expression (a, b) should be (0,1). Let's see: theta=0 → theta/2=0 → cot(0) is infinity, which suggests a is infinite, which is problematic. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the eigenvector can be expressed in terms of sin(theta/2) and cos(theta/2). Let me think about the general spin-1/2 states. The eigenstates for spin in direction (theta, phi) are given by:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓>

and 

|-> = sin(theta/2) |↑> - e^{i phi} cos(theta/2) |↓>

In our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So |+> would be cos(theta/2) |↑> + sin(theta/2) |↓>, which would correspond to (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ) in the basis (|↑>, |↓>).

Wait, but in our case, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvector should be |+> along n, which is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), but normalized. Wait, no, because the Pauli matrices' eigenstates are in that form. So in our case, since P·n is proportional to the Pauli matrices, the eigenvector would indeed be in that form.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's take the matrix for P·n, which is (ħ/2) times [[cos theta, sin theta], [sin theta, -cos theta ]].

Then, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So for eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector should satisfy (P·n - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

Let me compute (P·n - (ħ/2) I ):

(ħ/2) [ [cos theta -1, sin theta],
          [sin theta, -cos theta -1] ]

Setting up the equations (without the ħ/2 factor for simplicity):

[ (cos theta -1) a + sin theta b = 0 ]
[ sin theta a + (-cos theta -1) b = 0 ]

We can write this as:

(cos theta -1) a + sin theta b = 0 → equation A
sin theta a + (-cos theta -1) b = 0 → equation B

From equation A: a = [ - sin theta / (cos theta - 1) ] b → a = [ sin theta / (1 - cos theta) ) ] b → use identity 1 - cos theta = 2 sin^2(theta/2), sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ) ] b → a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b → a = cot(theta/2) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as (cot(theta/2) b, b ), which can be scaled by b. Let me choose b as 1 for simplicity, so a = cot(theta/2), and the vector is (cot(theta/2), 1).

But wait, when theta is 0, cot(theta/2) is cot(0) which approaches infinity, which isn't possible. Hmm, maybe I should parameterize it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the components in terms of sin and cos of theta/2, as in the standard spin-1/2 eigenstates.

Let me think: the standard eigenvector for spin up along (theta, phi) is:

( cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) )

But in our case, phi is zero, so it's ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

But wait, in our case, the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) * [[cos theta, sin theta], [sin theta, - cos theta ]].

Wait, let's compute the eigenvalues again. The eigenvalues are given by det( P·n - λ I )=0.

Alternatively, since P·n is a 2x2 matrix with trace Tr = (ħ/2)(cos theta - cos theta )=0, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvector for +ħ/2 should be proportional to ( sin theta/2, cos theta/2 -1 )? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the eigenvectors of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are sigma_x=[[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y=[[0,-i],[i,0]], sigma_z=[[1,0],[0,-1]].

The eigenvectors for sigma_z are (1,0) and (0,1) for eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively.

For sigma_x, the eigenvectors are (1,1) and (1,-1), but normalized.

Similarly, for sigma_y, the eigenvectors involve complex numbers.

But in our case, the operator is a combination of sigma_x and sigma_z, plus some cos theta and sin theta factors.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the general eigenstate for a spin in an arbitrary direction. The spin-up state along n would be:

|+> = ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, no, wait: the standard eigenstate for spin along (theta, phi) is:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

In our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane. So |+> would be ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

But wait, when theta is 0, along z, this gives (1,0), which is correct for P_z eigenvalue +ħ/2.

When theta is 90 degrees (pi/2), along x, this gives (0, 1), but for P_x, the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is when the state is (0,1) scaled by 1/sqrt(2), but wait no, for sigma_x, the eigenstates are (1,1) and (1,-1), normalized. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think: the eigenstate for spin up along x is (1,1)/sqrt(2), because sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, and |+x> = (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for spin along theta in x-z plane, the state is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), but normalized.

Wait, but when theta is pi/2, cos(theta/2)=cos(pi/4)=1/sqrt(2), and sin(theta/2)=1/sqrt(2), so the state is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is correct for sigma_x.

Wait, but earlier I thought the eigenvector came out as (cot(theta/2), 1), but in the standard approach it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in earlier derivation.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the equations.

We have:

Equation A: (cos theta - 1) a + sin theta b =0 → equation (1)
Equation B: sin theta a + (-cos theta -1) b =0 → equation (2)

Let me take equation (1):

(cos theta -1) a + sin theta b =0 → equation (1)

I can write this as:

a (cos theta -1) = - sin theta b → a = [ - sin theta / (cos theta -1) ) ] b

= [ sin theta / (1 - cos theta) ) ] b

As before.

Now, let me compute [ sin theta / (1 - cos theta) ) ].

Using the identities:

sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
1 - cos theta = 2 sin^2(theta/2)

So,

sin theta / (1 - cos theta) = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2 )

So, a = cot(theta/2) * b

So, the eigenvector is ( a, b ) = ( cot(theta/2) * b, b )

We can choose b =1 for simplicity, giving (cot(theta/2), 1)

But let's check when theta is pi/2.

theta = pi/2 → theta/2 = pi/4

cot(pi/4) = 1 → so the vector is (1,1). Let's compute the norm squared: 1^2 +1^2 =2 → normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), which matches the expected spin-up along x.

But earlier, I thought the standard eigenstate is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which for theta=pi/2 would be (cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4)) = (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), which matches.

Wait, but according to my earlier approach, when theta=pi/2, a=1, b=1, which after normalization gives (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), which is correct.

Wait, but according to the standard approach, the state is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which also for theta=pi/2 is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

So both approaches give the same result.

Wait, so it seems that the eigenvector is (cot(theta/2) b, b), which when b=1 gives (cot(theta/2), 1), but when normalized, becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), because:

Wait, let me compute the normalization.

The vector is (a, b) = (cot(theta/2) * b, b) → let's take b=1, so vector is (cot(theta/2),1).

Norm squared is (cot^2(theta/2) + 1 ) = csc^2(theta/2) → so the normalized vector is ( cot(theta/2) / csc(theta/2), 1 / csc(theta/2) )

Which is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Because cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), and 1/csc(theta/2) is sin(theta/2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, that makes sense. So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), and the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C.

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

But wait, the options are given as the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So option C is correct.

Wait, but what about the normalization? Because in the derivation, the vector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ) is already normalized, since cos² + sin² =1.

Yes, so the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but in the options, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which matches.

But let me look at the options again.

Option C: ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Option D: sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)

Wait, but in our case, the eigenvector elements are dimensionless (since they're components in the Hilbert space), so any factors of ħ would be part of the operator, not the eigenvector. So the elements should be just cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), as in option C.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement, the options are:

A) ( sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar )

B) ( cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

C) ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

D) ( sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) )

So option C is correct, but let me think again. Because the eigenvector is a spinor, the components are just complex numbers (or real in this case), so ħ wouldn't be part of them. So option C seems correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. The problem specifies that the operator P has components P_x = (ħ/2) * matrix, etc. So the operator is scaled by ħ/2, but the eigenvectors are dimensionless. So option C should be correct.

So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as a linear combination of $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, weighted by the direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator Construction**:  
   Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta.
   \]
   Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the resulting matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   \left(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I\right) |v\rangle = 0,
   \]
   where $I$ is the identity matrix. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ gives:
   \[
   \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Solving for Eigenvector**:  
   The eigenvector components $(a, b)$ satisfy the equations:
   \[
   (\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
   \]
   Solving these equations, the eigenvector is proportional to:
   \[
   (a, b) = \left(\cot\frac{\theta}{2}, 1\right).
   \]

4. **Normalization**:  
   The norm of the eigenvector is:
   \[
   \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{\cot^2\frac{\theta}{2} + 1} = \csc\frac{\theta}{2}.
   \]
   Normalizing the eigenvector gives:
   \[
   \left(\cos\frac{\theta}{2}, \sin\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This does not match the derived eigenvector, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and does not depend on $\theta$.

- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
  This is incorrect because the eigenvector components depend on $\theta/2$, not $\theta$, and $\phi$ is zero since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane.

- **Option C**: $(\cos\theta/2, \sin\theta/2)$  
  This matches the derived normalized eigenvector and is consistent with the standard spin-1/2 eigenstates.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos\theta/2, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin\theta/2)$  
  This is incorrect because it introduces unnecessary normalization factors and $\hbar$, which are not part of the eigenvector components.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is $(\cos\theta/2, \sin\theta/2)$, which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
