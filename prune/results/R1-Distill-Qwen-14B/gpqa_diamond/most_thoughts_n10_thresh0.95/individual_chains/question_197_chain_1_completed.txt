--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR shows strong peaks around 3400-2500 cm-¹. That usually indicates an O-H stretch, which could be from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. There's also a peak at 1720 cm-¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that suggests maybe a ketone or a carboxylic acid. But since 1720 is a bit lower than usual for a ketone (which is usually around 1700-1750), maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad O-H peak around 2500-3300. Oh wait, the first peak is 3400-2500, which is a broad region—maybe it's a carboxylic acid because the O-H stretch is broad and appears in that region. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but the 1720 suggests more towards a carbonyl, like a carboxylic acid or maybe an ester. But 1720 is more typical for a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the NMR data now. Let me parse through the peaks.

The 1H NMR has the following peaks:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Aromatic protons are usually around 7-8.5, but at 10.5, that's probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, wait, no. Alternatively, it could be a carbonyl oxygen adjacent proton, like in a carboxylic acid. The broad singlet would make sense for the -OH proton in a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, the OH proton in a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak, but where? It can be around 10-12 ppm, I think. So maybe that's the carboxylic acid OH. So that peak would be the -COOH proton.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. That's probably aromatic protons. Since it's a doublet, maybe they're para to each other. Like in a para-substituted benzene.

Then 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also a doublet, two protons. So perhaps we have a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. So maybe two substituents on the benzene ring.

Then 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet of one proton. That could be a CH adjacent to something, maybe a CH next to an oxygen or a branching point.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet of two protons. Could be adjacent to a CH group or part of a chain.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet of three protons. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 group. Like a CH2CH2CH3 structure, where the methyl is on a carbon next to another CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H. That's a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe a longer chain attached to the benzene.

Putting this together, the NMR suggests a benzene ring with substituents. The 8.0 and 7.2 doublets suggest that the ring has substituents at the para positions. So maybe 4-substituted benzene. The substituents could be a group and a methyl or another group.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. The IR had a carbonyl (1720 cm-¹) and a broad O-H around 10.5. So if this is a benzoic acid, then the substituent on the benzene is a COOH group. Wait, but the NMR at 10.5 is a singlet for 1H. Benzoic acid would have a COOH group, which has an O-H proton. So that fits with that peak.

So the benzene ring is likely para-substituted with a COOH group and another substituent. Let me think about the other substituent. The other peaks in the NMR are for a chain of some sort. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH adjacent to another group, perhaps connected to a branching point. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) and 1.4 (d,3H) and 0.9 (t,3H) suggest a chain like -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the splitting and integration might not fit that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group or something similar.

Wait, looking at the integration: 1H (2.9), 2H (1.7), 3H (1.4, d), 3H (0.9, t). So the 1.4 d and 0.9 t would suggest a chain where a CH has a methyl group (the 1.4 d) and a longer chain ending with a CH3. Like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something? Hmm.

Alternatively, think of an isobutyl group. Let's see: an isobutyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So maybe that.

Wait, let's sketch this. Benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent. Let's say the substituents are in para positions. So, the substituent on the benzene would be -COOH and maybe a branched alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is likely a methyl attached to a CH2. The 0.9 (t,3H) is a terminal methyl. So perhaps it's a butyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but the 2.9 (m,1H) and 1.7 (m,2H) could correspond to a -CH2-CH-CH2- chain. Maybe as in a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group has the structure CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, let me think. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, no, wait. No, the correct structure for isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), no, wait. Let's get the structure right. Isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, wait, perhaps it's -(CH2)2CHCH3, but that's a pentyl group. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH group attached to the benzene. Let me think.

Let me think of the structure. If the substituent is a propyl group, perhaps with a branching. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 (3H) which is likely a methyl group at the end of a chain. So perhaps it's an ethyl chain attached to something else. For example, a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH3 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently. The IR suggests a carbonyl and a carboxylic acid's OH.

So the compound is a benzoic acid. Then the substituent on the benzene ring is another group, perhaps an alkyl chain.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group at the para position.

Another option is A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Wait, but that would have the COOH group not on the benzene but on a side chain. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, let me check each option.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That structure would have a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position, and a propanoic acid group attached to the benzene at position 2. Wait, but in that case, the COOH would be on the propanoic acid side. So that would have a benzene ring with a substituent that's a propanoic acid attached. But the IR would have a carbonyl from the propanoic acid, but the NMR would show different shifts.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group attached at the para position. So the structure is:

Benzoic acid (COOH attached to benzene) and a sec-butyl group (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) attached at the para position.

Wait, no, sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, the correct structure of the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, no. Wait, butyl groups: The four carbons. The substituent is attached to the benzene ring. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- ? No, that's not right. Let me think again. A butyl group has four carbons. The sec-butyl group would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's three carbons after the point of attachment. Wait, no, the correct structure for sec-butyl is: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's a butyl group, but maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's a four-carbon chain? No, wait, no. Let me correct:

The butyl group has four carbons. The structure is:

- The primary butyl group is -CH2CH2CH2CH2-.

- The secondary butyl group (sec-butyl) is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's a three-carbon group, I think, because the branching is on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the substituent as a chain that leads to a branching.

In any case, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a methyl group at the end of a chain, probably attached to a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH2.

So, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group or something similar. Let me think of the structure that would give the given NMR peaks.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH group that's part of a chain. The 1.7 (m,2H) could be two protons on a CH2 next to that CH. Then, the 1.4 (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to the CH, and the 0.9 (t,3H) is the end of an ethyl chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So the structure would be:

Ph–COOH and Ph–(CH2)2CH(CH3) ?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)3CH3 group, but that would be a pentyl group, but the NMR doesn't quite fit.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests it's a CH2CH2CH3 group, perhaps as the end of a chain. So the substituent might be something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, if the substituent is a propyl group, but that may not match.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group, which is a isobutyl group. Let's see: isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's an isobutyl group: the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the substituent is attached to the benzene as -CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show peaks for the CH(CH3)2 group. Let me think.

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the two methyl groups attached to the CH. Wait, no, the isobutyl group has two CH3 groups attached to a central CH, which is attached to the benzene via a CH2.

Wait, the structure would be:

Benzene ring connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH that's connected to two CH3 groups. So the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 group (the one attached to the benzene) would have protons that are split into a quartet or something, but perhaps the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be those.

The CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups, but wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH which is attached to another group. So perhaps it's a CH(CH2CH3)CH2 group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group with a sec-structure.

Another approach: Let's look at the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

That would be a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1 (since it's para). The structure would be:

Ph–COOH and Ph–(CH2)CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Hmm, maybe.

Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should draw it.

Wait, the structure of the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent on the benzene is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH that has a CH2CH3 group.

So the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the benzene (the one attached to the CH) would have two protons. These could be in a triplet or multiplet due to coupling with adjacent groups.

- The CH group would have one proton, which could be in a multiplet around 2.9 ppm.

- The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (the terminal CH3), and the CH2 in between would have a quartet or something else.

Wait, but let's see the given NMR:

The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be the CH2 next to the benzene. The 2.9 ppm is the CH group. Then, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the methyl attached to the CH, but wait, no. Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl, which is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). So the CH has a CH2CH3 group attached.

So the CH would have one proton (2.9 ppm, m), and the CH2 would have two protons (1.7 ppm, m). The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet (0.9 ppm, 3H) and the adjacent CH2 would have a quartet at perhaps 1.4 ppm (but it's a doublet in the data). Hmm, not matching exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an iso-butyl group. Iso-butyl is -(CH2)C(CH3)2. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2.

In that case, the CH2 would have two protons, perhaps the 1.7 ppm peak. The C(CH3)2 would have a singlet for the six protons, but that's not present in the NMR data. Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would be a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm, maybe it's a different substituent.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data: the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. Then, the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) suggests a CH3 at the end of a chain. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the integration.

The 10.5 ppm (1H) is the COOH O-H.

The aromatic region: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That suggests a para-disubstituted benzene. So two substituents on the benzene ring, opposite each other. One is COOH, the other is another group.

So the other substituent must be an alkyl group that's causing the other NMR peaks.

So the substituent is an alkyl group, and the structure is Ph-COOH and Ph-R, where R is the substituent.

Looking at the substituent R, the NMR peaks are:

At 2.9 ppm (1H, m) – this is likely a CH adjacent to another group.

At 1.7 (2H, m) – perhaps a CH2 adjacent to the CH.

At 1.4 (3H, d) – a methyl group attached to a CH.

At 0.9 (3H, t) – a terminal methyl group.

So perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, that would make the substituent -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). So the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH with a CH2CH3 group.

So the structure would be:

Ph–COOH and Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3).

In this case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 (attached to benzene) would have two Hs. These could be a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH, but in the data, it's a multiplet at 1.7 ppm.

- The CH would have one H at 2.9 ppm, as a multiplet.

- Then, the CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm, and the CH2 adjacent would have a quartet at 1.4 ppm. But wait, in the data, the 1.4 is a doublet, which may not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3) group.

Wait, that would be a pentyl group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH has a methyl branch.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure.

Suppose the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. That would be a pentyl group with a branch. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. So the structure is Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3).

In that case:

The CH2 (attached to benzene) would have two protons. These might appear as a quartet if next to a CH, but in the data, it's a multiplet at 1.7 ppm.

The CH would have one proton at 2.9 ppm.

The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

The CH2 adjacent to the CH would be the one attached to the CH. Its protons would be split into a quartet, perhaps appearing at around 1.4 ppm as a doublet? No, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. But that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, but not in a straight chain.

Let me think again. The substituent's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (1H, m) – CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (2H, m) – CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (3H, d) – CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (3H, t) – CH3 at the end of a chain.

So maybe the structure is:

Ph–COOH and Ph–CH2–CH(CH3)CH2–CH3.

Wait, that would be a pentyl group. But the NMR doesn't match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3 group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So:

Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3).

In that case:

- The CH2 (attached to benzene) would have two Hs. That's 1.7 ppm (m).

- The CH would have one H (2.9 ppm).

- The adjacent CH2CH3 would have Hs. The CH2 would have two Hs, perhaps at 1.4 ppm (d, but why d?), and the CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t).

Wait, but the CH2CH3 group's CH2 would be next to the CH. So the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH and possibly the next CH2.

I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure of the substituent. Maybe I should look at the options and see which structure matches better.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's think about its structure.

sec-Butyl would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- ?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the structure of a sec-butyl group.

Okay, the sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The butyl group has four carbons. The substituent is attached to the second carbon, making it a secondary carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no. Wait, butyl groups: primary is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's a straight chain. The secondary (sec) would be where the substituent is attached to the second carbon of a butane chain.

So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is a CH2–CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, but that's only three carbons. Oh wait, no: benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So that's four carbons in total: benzene (attached to CH2), then CH, then CH2CH3.

Wait, but the substituent has four carbons in that case: benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no. Benzene (attached to a CH2 group), then a CH group connected to another CH2 group and a CH3.

So the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3).

In that structure, the CH2 (attached to benzene) has two protons. The CH has one proton, and the adjacent CH2 has two protons, which are attached to a CH3.

So the NMR for this substituent would be:

- The CH2 (attached to benzene) would have two Hs, maybe as a quartet (coupled with the CH), but in the data, this is at 1.7 ppm as a multiplet.

- The CH would have one H at 2.9 ppm.

- The CH2 adjacent to the CH would have two Hs. These would be split by the CH and possibly the CH3. Perhaps as a triplet or something else. But in the data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH.

Wait, that doesn't fit. Because in the substituent I'm considering, the CH2 would have two Hs, and the CH3 would be at the end.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me look at the options again:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure is benzene ring with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group at the para positions.

The substituent's structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So the substituent is a four-carbon chain attached to the benzene ring.

The NMR for this substituent would have:

- The CH2 (attached to benzene) would have two Hs, perhaps as a quartet if next to a CH.

- The CH would have one H, as a multiplet.

- The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet (0.9 ppm, 3H) and the adjacent CH2 would have a quartet.

Wait, but in the given data, 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would suggest a methyl attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is iso-butyl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. For example, -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). In that case, the structure would have a CH(CH3) attached to a CH2 group.

The NMR would then show:

- The CH2 adjacent to the benzene would have two Hs, perhaps as a quartet.

- The CH(CH3) would have one H at 2.9 ppm.

- The CH2 between the benzene and CH(CH3) would have two Hs, as a triplet or something.

- The CH3 attached to the CH would be a singlet, but in the data, it's a doublet at 1.4 ppm.

Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is itself attached to another CH2.

So perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3) group.

In that case, the CH2 (attached to benzene) would have two Hs. The CH has one H. The adjacent CH2 would have two Hs, which are attached to a CH3. So the CH2 would have a triplet, and the CH3 would have a triplet as well.

But according to the NMR, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), which is a CH3 at the end of a chain. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group, but that doesn't fit the integration. Because isopropyl would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups, but the data shows a triplet and a doublet.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction.

The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What does that do?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat, but another reaction is the use of P and HI for the reduction of esters or amides? Or maybe for removing functional groups.

Wait, red phosphorus with HI is often used to deoxygenate compounds. For example, it can reduce esters to alkanes or ketones to alkanes. So if the starting compound has a carbonyl group, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would likely reduce it.

Wait, for example, if X is a benzoic acid (which has a carbonyl group as COOH), then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the COOH group would be reduced. Benzoic acid (COOH) would be reduced to CH2OH? No, wait, usually, Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction? Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the Wolff-Kishner reaction uses hydrazine, heat, and strong base to eliminate the carbonyl group, forming an alkane. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI might be used to reduce a carbonyl group to a methylene group.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI would likely lead to the formation of an alkane. For example, a carboxylic acid (RCOOH) would be reduced to RCH2CH2PH? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is converted to CH2I.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: red phosphorus and HI are used for the deoxygenation of ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc. For example, a ketone (R2C=O) would be reduced to R2CH.

Similarly, an ester (RCOOR') would be reduced to RCH2OR' or something else. Wait, no, the ester would be deoxygenated as well.

But in our case, the starting compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. So, the COOH group would be reduced. Let me think: when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it is converted to a methyl group.

Wait, for example, COOH → CH2OH? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the COOH is reduced to a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is:

RCOOH → RCH2 + something.

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe the COOH group is converted to an alcohol, but that doesn't fit with the reagents.

Wait, let me think: the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. So, if X is a ketone, it would be reduced to an alkane. But in our case, X has a COOH group, so perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options for the product after reaction. Let's see the options:

Options for the product are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, but the reaction is X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. So, if X is a ketone, the product would lose the carbonyl group. If X is a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction would reduce the COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction converts a carboxylic acid to a methyl group, replacing the COOH with CH2I or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the carbonyl group to a CH2 group.

Let me think again: the starting compound X has IR showing a COOH group (broad O-H and 1720 cm-¹). The NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (COOH O-H). So X is a benzoic acid derivative.

When benzoic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the COOH group is reduced to a CH2 group. Let me check what reaction that would be. Oh, wait, the HWE (Hoffmann-Walden) reaction? No, that's for amines. Alternatively, maybe the COOH is converted to CH2I. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reduction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI gives a primary alcohol. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation, removing the oxygen and converting the COOH group into a methyl group. For example, RCOOH → RCH2.

Wait, but I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But given that the starting compound has a COOH group, perhaps it's first converted into an acid chloride, then something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the reduction of the COOH group. Let me think: in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, maybe the COOH is converted into a methyl group via a substitution mechanism. For example, the -OH in COOH could attack the phosphorus, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is deprotonated by the HI, and then the carbonyl oxygen is attacked by an iodide ion, leading to some kind of substitution.

Wait, maybe the reaction is similar to the reduction of a ketone to an alkane. For example, if X is a ketone, reaction with red phosphorus and HI would give an alkane. But in our case, X is a benzoic acid, so maybe the COOH group is reduced to a CH2 group.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then after reaction, the COOH would become a CH2 group, giving 4-(sec-butyl)toluene.

Wait, but none of the options match that. Let me check the options again.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's cumene (isopropyl benzene), but with an isobutyl group and a methyl in para positions.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So benzene with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4.

Wait, but the original compound X has a COOH group in para position. After reduction, the COOH becomes a CH2 group, which would be a methyl group attached to the benzene. So the product would have a methyl group (from COOH) and the substituent from the other group.

Wait, perhaps the product would have the substituent (like the alkyl group) and a methyl group at para positions.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which has a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4.

But wait, the starting compound X would have a COOH at position 4 and the substituent (like a sec-butyl) at position 1. Then, after reduction, the COOH becomes a methyl, so the product would have a methyl at position 4 and the substituent at position 1, which is option D.

But wait, let me think again. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then after reaction, the COOH becomes CH2, so the product is 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Which is option D.

So putting it all together:

X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

After reaction, the COOH group is reduced to CH2, so the product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data for Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The broad peak in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ region suggests an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet, characteristic of the O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to a branching point.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group adjacent to a CH group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH group.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal methyl group in a chain.

From the NMR data, the compound is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure consists of a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 4 and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂CH(CH₃)) at position 1.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for deoxygenation reactions, particularly reducing carbonyl groups to alkanes. In this case, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The resulting product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, where the benzene ring has a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.

### Option Analysis:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This structure does not match the starting compound or the reaction pathway.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** This product does not match the expected reduction of the carboxylic acid group.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting compound, not the product.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches the expected product after reduction of the carboxylic acid group.

### Final Answer:
The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

Answer: D
