Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The problem says that when observing this star, the brightness variations look similar to those caused by an exoplanet. The question is, what's the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the spots do?

Hmm. So I need to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar, where Rpl is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. The options are given as A to D.

I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the areas of the planet and the star. The formula for the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, assuming the planet is a perfect disk and the star is uniformly bright.

But wait, in this case, the star isn't uniformly bright. Instead, it's got dark spots on one hemisphere. So the observed brightness variation isn't just a simple occultation. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing towards us, they make the star appear dimmer. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing periodic brightness changes.

The problem states that the observed variation is similar to that of a planet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is the same as what a planet of a certain size would cause.

So first, let's calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star, so covering 20% of a hemisphere would be 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) = 0.1 π Rstar². Because a hemisphere's area is (4πR²)/2 = 2πR², right? Oh wait wait, no. The surface area of a sphere is 4πR². So a hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of a hemisphere is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

Wait, no. The problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that is covered by spots. So the area covered is 20% of the hemisphere's area. The hemisphere's area is 2πR². So spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But wait, because the star is a sphere, when it rotates, we see only one hemisphere at a time. So when the star rotates, the spot coverage that is on the far side (the other hemisphere) isn't visible. Oh, but in this scenario, only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view as the star turns, so the brightness variation would depend on how much of the spotted hemisphere is visible as the star rotates.

Wait, but the problem says the star is being observed, and because only one hemisphere is spotty, the brightness varies as the star rotates. So when the spots are on the near side (facing us), the brightness dips because those spots are cooler and emit less light. As the star spins, the spots rotate into and out of view.

So the brightness variation is due to the changing area of the spots that are visible from Earth. The maximum amplitude of the dip would occur when the entire spotted region is facing us. But wait, actually, the spots are on a single hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots move from being fully visible to not visible at all. So the variation in brightness would be a sinusoidal change as the spots come into view.

Wait, but to model this, perhaps we can think of the total change in flux as the fraction of the spotted area that's visible times the difference in brightness between the spots and the rest of the star.

Let me outline what I know:

- Star radius Rstar = R_sun (so same as the Sun's radius, but maybe the actual value doesn't matter because we're taking a ratio)
- Filling factor f = 20% (0.2) of the hemisphere is covered by spots. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2π Rstar²) = 0.4 π Rstar².
- The spots are cooler by 1000 K. The star's Teff is 6000 K. So the spots' Teff is 5000 K.

But wait, the brightness comes from the flux emitted. The flux from a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So the flux from the spots (F_spot) is σ * (5000)^4, and the flux from the rest of the star (F_star) is σ * (6000)^4.

The fractional change in brightness when the spots come into view depends on how much of the star's surface is covered by spots and the difference in flux.

But we need to model the flux as the spots rotate into and out of view. The maximum change occurs when the maximum amount of spotted area is visible.

Wait, but because the spots are on a hemisphere, as the star rotates, the maximum fraction of the spotted area that can be visible is when the star's rotation brings that hemisphere directly into our line of sight. So the maximum area of spots visible would be the entire 0.4 π Rstar².

Wait no, that's the area of spots on the hemisphere. But when the star rotates, the spots come into view in a way that depends on the viewing angle. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to model the change in flux based on the spot coverage.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the equivalent change in brightness as if the spots were a planet blocking the star's light, and then compare the two scenarios.

Wait, the question says that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to that of a planet transiting the star.

So the amplitude in the light curve for the spots (ΔF_spot) should be the same as the amplitude due to a planet of radius Rpl (ΔF_planet).

Wait, no. The question says, to produce the same amplitude, what is Rpl/Rstar?

So, first, compute ΔF_spot, then set ΔF_planet = ΔF_spot, and solve for Rpl.

So let's compute ΔF_spot first.

The star's total flux without any spots is F_total = σ * (6000)^4 * 4π Rstar².

But wait, the star's surface emits flux from each point. The total flux is the sum of all the flux emitted by each part of the star.

Without any spots, the star emits F0 = 4π Rstar² * σ (6000)^4.

When the spots are present on a hemisphere, the flux is F0 - F_spot + F_rest? Wait, no, because the spots are cooler, the total flux is less when they are on the near side.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to model the maximum and minimum flux.

When the entire hemisphere with spots is facing us, the flux is:

F_max = (F0 - F_spot + F_spot') ?

Wait, no. Because the spots are cooler, the flux from the spots is less than the surrounding area.

So the star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4π Rstar² * σ Tstar^4.

When there are spots covering area A_spot with temperature Tspot = Tstar - 1000 K, the flux becomes:

F = F0 - (A_spot * σ Tspot^4) + (A_spot * σ Tstar^4)

Wait no, that's not correct. Because when the spots are on the near side, the area that's spotted is now emitting at a lower flux. So the total flux would be:

F = (F0 - (A_spot) * σ (Tstar)^4) + (A_spot) * σ (Tspot)^4 )

So the change in flux is:

ΔF = F0 - F = (A_spot) [σ (Tstar)^4 - σ (Tspot)^4 ]

But wait, let's compute this more carefully.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = 4π Rstar² σ T_star^4.

When the spots are visible, their area A_spot is emitting at T_spot. So the flux becomes:

F = (4π Rstar² σ Tstar^4) - A_spot σ (Tstar^4 - Tspot^4 )

So the change in flux is ΔF = F0 - F = A_spot σ (Tstar^4 - Tspot^4 )

Because, when the spots are visible, the flux is lower.

The fractional change in flux is ΔF / F0 = [ A_spot σ (Tstar^4 - Tspot^4) ] / [4π Rstar² σ Tstar^4 ]

Simplify:

ΔF/F0 = (A_spot / (4 π Rstar² )) * (Tstar^4 - Tspot^4) / Tstar^4

A_spot is the area of the spots on the hemisphere, which we computed earlier as 0.4 π Rstar².

So substituting:

ΔF/F0 = (0.4 π Rstar²) / (4 π Rstar²) ) * ( (6000^4 - 5000^4) ) / 6000^4

Simplify the first fraction:

0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.4 /4 = 0.1.

So,

ΔF/F0 = 0.1 * [ (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4 ]

Compute the term in brackets:

(6000^4 - 5000^4) /6000^4 = 1 - (5000/6000)^4.

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈0.833333.

(5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈0.482253.

So,

1 - 0.482253 ≈0.517747.

So,

ΔF/F0 ≈0.1 * 0.517747 ≈0.051775.

So the fractional change is about 5.1775% of the star's flux.

But wait, that's when the entire spotted area is visible. However, because the spots are on a hemisphere, the maximum amount of spots that can be visible is when the spot hemisphere is fully visible— but wait, in reality, when the star is viewed from Earth, you can only see a hemisphere, so the spots are on one hemisphere, which is the same as the part we can see.

Wait no, no. Wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So when the star is viewed edge-on, we can see the entire hemisphere, but when viewed face-on, we don't see any spots because they're on the far side.

Wait, but the problem states that the star is being observed in such a way that the brightness variations are caused by rotational modulation. So the spots are on one fixed hemisphere, and as the star rotates, the spots come into and go out of view.

So the observed brightness variation will depend on the fraction of the spotted area that's visible as the star rotates.

Wait, perhaps I should model the maximum and minimum brightness. Let me think: when the star is viewed such that the entire spotted hemisphere is visible (edge-on), the brightness would be at minimum. When the star is viewed face-on (the other hemisphere is spotted), then the brightness would be normal.

Wait no, the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the star is facing us with the spotted side, we see all the spots. When it's facing us with the other side, which is unspotted, the spots are on the far side, so we don't see them.

So the maximum dip in brightness is when the entire spotted area is on the near side, and the minimum brightness is F = F0 - ΔF.

But wait, the change in flux is between when the spots are visible and when they aren't.

Wait, the star's brightness varies as it rotates because the spots come into view. So the maximum dip is when the maximum amount of spots is visible, and the minimum is when none are visible.

Wait, but in reality, the spots are on one side of the star. So as the star rotates, the amount of spotted area visible changes. The maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is visible, and the minimum is when the spotted area is on the far side (so no dip).

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so the maximum amount of the spotted hemisphere that can be seen is when the star is viewed edge-on. Wait, no, when viewed edge-on, you see a circle, which is a great circle, so the area is π R². But the hemisphere has area 2 π R².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the area calculation.

Wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4 π R². A hemisphere would have 2 π R². So if the star is viewed face-on, you see a circle of area π R². When viewed edge-on, you see the same area, π R². So regardless of orientation, the visible area is π R². So the hemisphere is 2 π R². When the star is viewed face-on, you see half the star. When viewed edge-on, you see the entire hemisphere but as a circle.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The star is a sphere. The surface area is 4 π R². A hemisphere is half of that, so 2 π R². When viewed from Earth, regardless of the viewing angle (edge-on, face-on, etc.), the area you can see is a circle with radius R, so area π R². So when the star is viewed edge-on, you see the entire hemisphere (as a circle), but when viewed face-on, you see a single point.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. When viewed edge-on, the star appears as a circle with radius R, giving an area of π R². When viewed face-on, it's a single point, so area zero. Wait, no, that's not true either. Wait, the area you can see is always π R² because the star is a sphere. For example, no matter the viewing angle, the area you see is π R² (the projected area). So the observed flux is always the same unless spots are on the far side or near side.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of what fraction of the star's surface we can see, which is always 1/2 (π R² / 2 π R² = 1/2) but that seems off.

Wait, no, the projected area is π R² regardless of the viewing angle. So the same amount of flux comes through, unless spots are on the far or near side.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe another approach: the maximum change in flux occurs when the entire spotted area is visible. So the maximum dip is when the entire area of the spots is on the near side.

So, the fractional change in flux is (A_spot / A_visible) * (F_spot - F_star) / F_star.

Wait, but A_visible is the area we can see, which is π Rstar². The area of the spots is A_spot = 0.4 π Rstar² (as calculated earlier).

So the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (π R²) ) = 0.4.

So the fractional change in flux when the spots are fully visible is 0.4 * (σ (5000)^4 - σ (6000)^4) / (σ (6000)^4 )

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the fluxes here. Let me think again.

When the spots are visible, the flux from those spots is F_spot = A_spot * σ (T_spot)^4.

The rest of the visible area (A_visible - A_spot) is at F_star = (A_visible - A_spot) * σ (T_star)^4.

So the total flux when spots are visible is:

F_visible = (A_visible - A_spot) * σ T_star^4 + A_spot * σ T_spot^4.

The total flux without any spots is F0 = A_visible * σ T_star^4.

So the change in flux when spots are visible is:

ΔF = F0 - F_visible = A_visible σ T_star^4 - [ (A_visible - A_spot) σ T_star^4 + A_spot σ T_spot^4 ]

= A_visible σ T_star^4 - A_visible σ T_star^4 + A_spot σ T_star^4 - A_spot σ T_spot^4

= A_spot σ (T_star^4 - T_spot^4 )

So the fractional change is:

ΔF/F0 = [A_spot σ (T_star^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / [ A_visible σ T_star^4 ]

Simplify:

= (A_spot / A_visible) * (T_star^4 - T_spot^4) / T_star^4

We have A_spot = 0.4 π R², A_visible = π R². So A_spot / A_visible = 0.4.

So,

ΔF/F0 = 0.4 * (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4

= 0.4 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈0.482253.

So,

ΔF/F0 ≈0.4 * (1 - 0.482253) ≈0.4 * 0.517747 ≈0.2071.

Wait, 0.4 * 0.5177 is about 0.207, which is 20.7% dip? That seems quite high. But wait, the total area of the spots is 0.4 of the visible area, and each spot is cooler, leading to a significant drop in flux.

But wait, earlier when I thought the change was about 5%, perhaps I was considering only a part of the spots being visible. But according to this, when the entire 0.4 area is covered by spots, the dip is about 20.7%.

Wait, but in reality, the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into view partially. The maximum dip would be when the entire 0.4 area is visible. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is 20.7% of the star's flux.

But wait, no. Wait the problem says the star has a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 of the hemisphere's area. The hemisphere is 2 pi R², so 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². The visible area is pi R², so when the spots are fully visible, their fraction is 0.4 pi R² / pi R² = 0.4, so 40% of the visible area. Hence, a 20.7% dip.

But the question says that the observed variation is similar to an exoplanet. So the dip caused by the planet would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2, because the planet blocks a part of the star's light.

Wait, so the planet would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So we have:

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = ΔF/F0_spot = 0.2071.

Wait, no. Wait, no. The planet's effect is a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2, so the fractional change would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But in the case of the spots, the maximum dip is 0.2071, which is about 20.7% of the star's light.

Wait, but in reality, the brightness variation due to the spots isn't a simple dip; it's a modulation as the spots rotate in and out of view. The amplitude of the variation would be the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, perhaps I need to model the brightness as a function of time. The star's brightness varies sinusoidally as the spots come into view. The amplitude of this variation would be the difference between the flux when the spots are fully visible and when they're not.

Wait, when the star shows the spotted hemisphere (maximum dip), the flux is F_visible = F0 - ΔF. When the star shows the unspotted hemisphere, the flux is F0 (since the spots are on the far side). So the variation between F0 and F_visible is ΔF.

Wait, but that can't be, because when the star rotates, the spots go from being fully visible to not visible. So the brightness variation is a sinusoidal curve with amplitude of ΔF/2, perhaps. Or maybe the peak-to-peak variation is 2*(ΔF/2) = ΔF.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as the flux varying between F0 (when no spots are visible) and F_visible (when all spots are visible), so the amplitude of the variation is (F0 - F_visible) = ΔF, but when the spots are only partially visible, the flux is somewhere in between.

Wait, but for an exoplanet transit, the dip is when the planet covers part of the star, so the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So in this problem, the maximum dip is ΔF/F0 = 0.2071, and the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But wait, the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which would be equal to the amplitude caused by the spots. But in the spot scenario, the maximum dip is 0.2071, so the planet's dip must be the same. Therefore:

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071.

So Rpl = Rstar * sqrt(0.2071).

Compute sqrt(0.2071):

0.2071 is approximately 0.2071, let's compute its square root.

Well, sqrt(0.25) is 0.5. sqrt(0.16) is 0.4. 0.2071 is between 0.16 and 0.25.

So let's see: 0.45^2 = 0.2025. Close to 0.2071.

0.45^2 = 0.2025.

0.455^2 = ?

0.455 * 0.455 = ?

Calculate 455 * 455: 455 * 400 = 182000, 455 *55=25025, so total 207025. So 0.455^2=0.207025. That's very close to 0.2071.

So sqrt(0.2071)=~0.455.

So Rpl/Rstar ≈0.455.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, none of the options are around 0.45. Hmm, did I make a mistake here?

Wait, maybe I messed up the spot area calculation. Let me recheck.

The problem states that the filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

The area of the visible part of the star is pi R² (since we see a circle of radius R when viewing the star).

So when the spots are fully visible, the fraction of the visible area covered is (0.4 pi R²) / (pi R²) )= 0.4.

So the fractional change in flux is 0.4 * (Tstar^4 - Tspot^4)/Tstar^4.

But wait, when the star is viewed such that the entire hemisphere is visible, the area is pi R², and the spots cover 0.4 pi R². So 0.4 is the fraction covered, leading to a dip of 0.4 * (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4.

Wait, but wait, in the exoplanet scenario, the dip is only when the planet is directly in front of the star, blocking a part of it. So the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So to get the same dip as the spot scenario, we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 equal to the spot's dip.

But wait, the spot's dip is 0.2071, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455, as I calculated before.

But the options don't have 0.45. Hmm. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait a minute, perhaps the situation is that the star's spots cause a variation that is not a simple dip but a periodic change as the spots rotate. So the amplitude of the variation would be half of the maximum dip, because the brightness goes from F0 to F_visible and back, making the peak-to-peak variation 2*(F0 - F_visible). But the amplitude of the variation (the maximum change from the mean) would be (F0 - F_visible)/2.

Wait no, in the case of the spots, the brightness varies between F0 (no spots visible) and F_visible (spots visible). So the actual variation is a sine-like curve whose amplitude is (F0 - F_visible)/2. Because the brightness goes from F0 (minimum) to F_visible (maximum). Wait, no, when the spots are visible, the flux is lower. So when the star is in the position where the spots are fully visible, the flux is at its minimum. So the brightness goes from F0 (when the spots are on the far side) to F_visible (when the spots are on the near side). So the amplitude of the variation is (F0 - F_visible) / 2, because the brightness goes from F0 (mean?) to F_visible (which is lower), and then back.

Wait, but how is the mean brightness calculated? The mean would be the average over time. Since the star spends half its rotation period with spots visible and half without? No, the star is continuously rotating, so the brightness varies sinusoidally.

Wait, perhaps the mean brightness is the same as F0 because, over a full rotation, the spots are only on one side. No, that's not correct because the spots are cooler.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The star emits with a certain average flux. When the spots are on the near side, the flux drops. So the mean flux would be lower than F0.

Wait, no. The star's total luminosity is the sum of all the flux emitted. If spots are on one hemisphere, whether they're visible or not depends on the viewing angle. So the average flux observed would be the same as when the spots are not present because the spots are on the back side half the time and front side the other half. Wait, no, because the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots are visible for half the rotation period and not visible for the other half. So the average flux would be the time-averaged flux.

So the average flux would be (F0 + F_visible)/2.

Wait, no. When the star is viewed edge-on, the spots are fully visible, so the flux is F_visible. When it's face-on, the spots are on the far side, so the flux is F0. But wait, the star is a sphere, so the spots are always on the same side. Therefore, as the star rotates, the fraction of the spotted area visible varies sinusoidally.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed brightness variation is sinusoidal with an amplitude of (F0 - F_visible)/2.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the brightness varying between F_visible (minimum) and F0 (maximum), making the amplitude (F0 - F_visible)/2.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on this. Let me try a different approach. The problem says that the brightness variations resemble those of an exoplanet. For an exoplanet, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So the amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

For the spots, the amplitude is the fractional change in brightness, which is the same as the spot's dip. So perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating the spot's dip.

Wait, perhaps the spot's effect is that the brightness varies in a sine-like curve with an amplitude of (F0 - F_visible)/2. So the maximum dip from the mean is (F0 - F_visible)/2.

Wait, but no. Let me think: when the spots are fully visible, the flux is F_visible. When they're not visible, the flux is F0. So the maximum change is F0 - F_visible. The average is (F0 + F_visible)/2. So the amplitude would be (F0 - F_visible)/2.

So the fractional amplitude is (F0 - F_visible)/(2 F0).

Ah, that's the correct approach. So the fractional change is (F0 - F_visible)/(2 F0).

So, let me recalculate.

ΔF_spot = F0 - F_visible = A_spot σ (Tstar^4 - Tspot^4 )

So, as before, ΔF_spot = A_spot σ (Tstar^4 - Tspot^4 )

Then,

amplitude = ΔF_spot / (2 F0 )

= [ A_spot σ (Tstar^4 - Tspot^4 ) ] / [ 2 * 4 π Rstar² σ Tstar^4 ]

Simplify:

= [ A_spot (Tstar^4 - Tspot^4 ) ] / [ 8 π Rstar² Tstar^4 ]

We know A_spot is 0.4 π Rstar².

Substitute:

= [ 0.4 π Rstar² (Tstar^4 - Tspot^4 ) ] / [8 π Rstar² Tstar^4 ]

The Rstar² and π terms cancel:

= 0.4 (Tstar^4 - Tspot^4 ) / (8 Tstar^4 )

= (0.4 /8) * (Tstar^4 - Tspot^4 ) / Tstar^4 

0.4/8 = 0.05.

So,

amplitude = 0.05 * (Tstar^4 - Tspot^4 ) / Tstar^4 

Which is:

0.05 * (1 - (Tspot/Tstar)^4 )

As Tspot = 5000 K, Tstar=6000 K.

(Tspot/Tstar) =5/6.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So,

1 - 0.482253 ≈0.517747.

Multiply by 0.05:

0.05 * 0.517747 ≈0.025887.

So the amplitude is about 2.5887% of F0.

Now, for the planet, the amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

We want (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.025887.

So,

Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.025887) ≈0.1609.

Hmm, that's approximately 0.16. But looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.11, or option A) ~0.39.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area calculation.

Wait, let me check again the area of the spots.

The star has one hemisphere covered with spots, and the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere.

So hemisphere area is 2 pi R².

Filling factor is 20% → 0.2 → A_spot = 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

But the area of the visible part of the star is pi R² (since we see a circle of radius R).

So when the star is viewed such that the entire hemisphere is visible, the visible area is pi R². So the fraction of the visible area that is spotted is (0.4 pi R²) / (pi R²) )= 0.4.

So, the area blocked by the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * pi R².

Wait, but for the planet, the area blocked is (pi (Rpl)^2), which is part of the star's visible area (pi Rstar^2). So the fractional area blocked is (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So in the planet case, the amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, not considering the temperature differences. Because when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light, which is at Tstar, so the dip is proportional to the area blocked.

But in the spot case, the dip is due to the spots being cooler, so the amplitude is different.

Wait, but in the problem, the star's brightness variation is due to spots, and we're to find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude in brightness variation.

Wait, the spot case's amplitude is 0.025887 (2.5887% of F0), and the planet's amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So setting (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.025887 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.025887) ≈0.1609.

But none of the options are close to 0.16. The options are 0.07, 0.11, 0.32, 0.39.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I confused the maximum dip with the amplitude. Let me re-express:

The brightness variation due to spots would be a sinusoidal function with a certain amplitude. The maximum dip would be when the spots are fully visible, and the maximum brightness is when the spots are on the far side (so no dip).

But in reality, the star's brightness varies as the spots rotate into and out of view. The variation would be a sinusoid with the amplitude being (F0 - F_visible)/2. Wait, no, because when you go from F_visible (minimum) to F0 (maximum), the change is F0 - F_visible.

But perhaps the amplitude as a percentage of the mean is (F0 - F_visible)/2, because the mean is (F0 + F_visible)/2, and the variation from the mean is (F0 - (F0 + F_visible)/2) ) = (F0 - F_visible)/2.

So the amplitude is (F0 - F_visible)/(2 F0 ) → which is what I calculated earlier as approximately 2.58%.

So that gives Rpl/Rstar ≈0.16, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the spot's effect is more complicated because the spots cover only a hemisphere. So when the star is viewed face-on, the spots are on the back, so no dip. When viewed edge-on, the spots are fully visible. So the brightness variation is a function of the cosine of the viewing angle.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation is modeled using the concept of the 'modulation' due to the spots on one hemisphere. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (A_spot / A_visible) × (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)/T_star^4.

Wait, perhaps that's a different approach. Let me think.

The brightness variation would be maximum when the spots are at the center of the visible disk, and minimum when they're at the edge. So the variation can be modeled as a function of the position of the spots.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation is caused by the spots rotating into and out of view, so the amplitude is (A_spot / A_visible) × (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)/T_star^4.

Wait, earlier calculation gave me 0.4 × (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.4 × 0.5177 ≈ 0.207, which is about 20.7% dip. But that can't be right because an exoplanet causing a 20% dip would have Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.207) ≈0.455.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area calculation.

Wait, the question says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area covered is 0.2 of the hemisphere's area, which is 0.2 × 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². The area of the star's disk as seen from Earth is pi R². So when the spot is directly in front of us (edge-on), the entire 0.4 pi R² is visible. So the fraction is 0.4 pi R² / pi R² = 0.4.

So the maximum dip is 0.4 × (6000^4 - 5000^4) / 6000^4 ≈0.4 ×0.5177 = 0.207.

But when the star is viewed face-on, the spots are on the far side, so no dip.

So the variation would be a sinusoidal curve with a peak-to-peak variation of 0.207 F0. The amplitude of the variation (from peak to peak) would be 0.207 F0. But the amplitude of the brightness when considering the mean is 0.207 F0 × (1/2) = 0.1035 F0.

So the amplitude is about 10.35% of F0.

But the planet's amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which should be equal to 0.1035.

Wait, but this is getting too confusing. Let me think again.

The problem says that the photometric observations show periodic variations due to rotational modulation. So the amplitude of the variation is the maximum change in brightness from the mean.

The mean brightness is F0, because on average, the spots are not visible. Wait, no, because the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots are visible for half the rotation period.

Wait, no. The star emits the same amount of flux regardless of the spots because the spots are on one side. But when viewed from Earth, the flux is lower when the spots are on the near side, higher when they're on the far side. Wait, no, the star's total flux is the sum of all emitted flux. The spots are cooler, so the star's total flux is lower than it would be without spots.

Wait, no. The star's total luminosity is the sum of all the flux it emits. The spots are cooler, so the star's total flux is lower than a star without spots. So the mean flux is lower.

Wait, perhaps the mean flux is:

F_mean = F0 * (1 - (A_spot × (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)) / (4 pi Rstar² T_star^4 )) )

Wait, no, perhaps the average flux is the sum of the flux from all parts of the star. So the spots contribute less flux, so the mean is lower.

But I'm getting stuck again. Let me instead think about the problem differently. The question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation, which is the same as if an exoplanet were causing the dip.

So the amplitude caused by the spots is the same as the amplitude caused by the planet.

The planet's amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

The spots' amplitude is the difference in brightness when the spots are visible versus when they're not. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation due to the spots as being the same as the planet's transit depth, so (Rpl/Rstar)^2 equals the spot's fractional change.

Earlier, I computed the fractional change as 0.2071, which would imply Rpl/Rstar ≈0.455, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area consideration.

Wait, perhaps the spot's area is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. Oh wait, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, not the entire star. So the area is 0.2 × 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

But when viewed from Earth, only a hemisphere is visible at any time, which is pi R². So the maximum fraction of the star's visible area covered by spots is (0.4 pi R²) / (pi R²) )= 0.4.

So the dip is 0.4 × (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 ≈0.4 ×0.5177 ≈0.2071. So the dip is 20.71% of F0.

But for the planet, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So if we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rpl/Rstar ≈0.455. No option matches.

Hmm. But the options don't have anything close to 0.45. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: when the star is observed, the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip is the same as that of a planet transiting.

But perhaps the planet would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2, and the spot's dip is (area fraction) × (temp difference). So perhaps we should model the dip as (f × (1 - (T_spot/T_star)^4 )).

Wait, the filling factor f is 0.2 for one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 × 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

The area of the star as seen from Earth is pi R².

So the fraction of the star's visible area covered by spots is (0.4 pi R²)/(pi R²) )= 0.4.

So the dip is 0.4 × (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈0.4 × 0.5177≈0.207.

So the dip is about 20.7% of F0.

But again, that would imply Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.207) ≈0.455, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation amplitude as the difference between when the spots are fully visible and when they're not. So the amplitude is 0.207 F0. But for the planet, the amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 F0.

So setting (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.207 → Rpl/Rstar ≈0.455.

But the options don't have 0.45, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the variation due to the change in the visible spots as the star rotates. So the brightness variation is a sine function with an amplitude of (delta F)/2.

Wait, earlier I calculated the amplitude as (F0 - F_visible)/(2 F0) ≈0.025887, which is 2.5887% of F0.

So for the planet, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.025887 → Rpl/Rstar≈0.1609.

Still no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the spots' temperature difference is 1000 K cooler, but the problem says Teff is 6000 K, and spots are 1000 K cooler. So T_spot = 5000 K.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of (T_spot / T_star)^4 is incorrect. Let me recompute.

T_spot = 5000 K, T_star =6000 K.

(5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 =0.517747.

So that part is correct.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the same as that of a planet, meaning the planet's transit depth is the same as the spot's amplitude.

But earlier I calculated the spot's amplitude as 0.2071, which would require Rpl/Rstar=0.455, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to model the spot's effect as a change in the star's light curve that mimics a planet's.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. It says the situation can "closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet." So perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as that of a planet, but considering the rotational period as the orbital period.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude, not the period.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's effect as if it were a planet, which would cause the same amplitude. So the planet's radius that causes a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 must be the same as the spot's dip.

But our calculations are leading us to about 0.45 Rstar, which isn't an option.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm. None of these are close to 0.45.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the spot area. Let me think again.

The star's radius is Rstar, and the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere.

One hemisphere has an area of 2 pi Rstar².

20% of that is 0.2 * 2 pi Rstar²= 0.4 pi Rstar².

But when the star is viewed from Earth, the visible area is pi Rstar².

So when the spots are fully visible, the fraction is 0.4 pi R² / pi R²= 0.4.

So the dip is 0.4 × (1 - (5/6)^4) = 0.4 ×0.5177≈0.207.

So the dip is 20.7% of F0.

But in the planet case, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So if the dip is the same, Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.207) ≈ 0.455.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of the spot's effect. Let me think about this differently.

The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions.

When the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is fully visible, the flux is:

F_visible = (pi R² - A_spot) * sigma (6000)^4 + A_spot * sigma (5000)^4.

The total flux without spots would be pi R² * sigma (6000)^4.

So the change in flux is delta F = F_total (no spots) - F_visible.

delta F = pi R² sigma (6000)^4 - [ (pi R² - A_spot) sigma (6000)^4 + A_spot sigma (5000)^4 ]

= pi R² sigma (6000)^4 - pi R² sigma (6000)^4 + A_spot sigma (6000)^4 - A_spot sigma (5000)^4

= A_spot sigma [ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 ]

So delta F / F_total (no spots) = [ A_spot sigma (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ pi R² sigma (6000^4 ) ]

= [ A_spot (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ pi R² (6000^4 ) ]

A_spot is 0.4 pi R².

So,

delta F / F_total = [0.4 pi R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ pi R² 6000^4 ]

= 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 

= 0.4 × (1 - (5/6)^4 )

= 0.4 × 0.5177 ≈0.2071.

So the dip is 20.71% of F_total.

But for an exoplanet, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So to get the same dip, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.2071) ≈0.455.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, but the exoplanet's radius is what? The options give Rpl/Rstar. So if the options don't have 0.45, perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation due to the spot coverage as a modulation, not the absolute dip. So the amplitude is (delta F)/2, where delta F is the maximum dip.

So if the maximum dip is 0.2071 F0, the amplitude is 0.2071 F0 / 2 ≈0.1035 F0.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈0.3217, which is approximately 0.32. That's option D.

Ah! That must be it. Because the brightness variation amplitude is the deviation from the mean, which is half the maximum dip.

So the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = delta F / 2.

So, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 / 2 ≈0.1035 → Rpl/Rstar ≈0.3217.

Looking at the options, D is ~0.32.

So the answer is D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The spots cause periodic brightness variations due to rotational modulation.
   - The amplitude of these variations is determined by the area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the rest of the star.

3. **Planet Analogy**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the exoplanet is proportional to \( (R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 \), where \( R_{\text{pl}} \) is the planet's radius.

### Analysis:
1. **Spot Area**:
   - The surface area of a hemisphere is \( 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The filling factor is 20%, so the area covered by spots is:
     \[
     A_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \times 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
     \]

2. **Fraction of Visible Area Covered by Spots**:
   - The visible area of the star is \( \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) (a circle of radius \( R_{\text{star}} \)).
   - The fraction of the visible area covered by spots is:
     \[
     f_{\text{spot}} = \frac{A_{\text{spot}}}{\pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{\pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.4.
     \]

3. **Flux Difference**:
   - The flux from a blackbody is proportional to \( T^4 \). The flux from the spots is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spot}} = \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 = \sigma (5000)^4.
     \]
   - The flux from the rest of the star is:
     \[
     F_{\text{star}} = \sigma T_{\text{star}}^4 = \sigma (6000)^4.
     \]
   - The fractional difference in flux per unit area is:
     \[
     \frac{F_{\text{star}} - F_{\text{spot}}}{F_{\text{star}}} = 1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}}\right)^4 = 1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4.
     \]
   - Compute \( \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \):
     \[
     \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.482253.
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.
     \]

4. **Maximum Brightness Dip**:
   - The maximum dip in brightness occurs when the entire spotted area is visible. The fractional change in flux is:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = f_{\text{spot}} \times \frac{F_{\text{star}} - F_{\text{spot}}}{F_{\text{star}}} = 0.4 \times 0.517747 \approx 0.2071.
     \]

5. **Amplitude of Brightness Variation**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is half the maximum dip:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{\Delta F_{\text{spot}}}{2} = \frac{0.2071}{2} \approx 0.1035.
     \]

6. **Planet Radius**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the planet is proportional to \( (R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 \). Setting this equal to the amplitude of the spot-induced variation:
     \[
     (R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}})^2 = 0.1035.
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately **0.32**. This corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
