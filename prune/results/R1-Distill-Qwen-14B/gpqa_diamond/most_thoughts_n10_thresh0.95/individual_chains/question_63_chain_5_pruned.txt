--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know.

The question is about a diatomic molecule consisting of elements X and Y. The given data are their masses (20 amu and 2 amu), the bond length (2 angstroms), and the angular frequency of vibration (4e14 rad/s). The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, wait. The quantum rotation-vibration model... I think that combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would involve a transition to the next higher energy level. But wait, what's the order here? Do we consider the rotation and vibration separately, or is it a combination?

I remember that in such models, the energy levels are quantized and can be treated as a product of rotational and vibrational contributions. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule are given by the combination of both rotational and vibrational states. So the total energy is E = E_rot + E_vib.

Wait, but in the case of a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are quantized, and the rotational ones too. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the selection rules).

Wait, no. Actually, the ground state is the state with the lowest possible vibrational (v=0) and the lowest rotational (J=0) quantum numbers. The next state could involve either an increase in vibrational state (v=1) or an increase in rotational state (J=1, assuming J starts at 0). But which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the initial and final states.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, what's the next lowest energy state after the fundamental state? The fundamental state is the lowest possible, so the next state would be the next higher energy level, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Which of these has the lower energy difference?

Hmm. So, I think the vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. For the ground state, v=0. The next vibrational state is v=1, which would have an energy of (1 + 1/2)ħω - (0 + 1/2)ħω = ħω higher than the ground state. So the energy difference ΔE_vib = ħω.

On the rotational side, the energy levels are given by E_rot = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. For J=0, E_rot =0. The next state would be J=1, which has E_rot = (2) ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I). So the energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = [ (2) - 0 ] * ħ²/(2I) → Wait, no. Wait, E_rot is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). For J=0, it's 0. For J=1, it's (1*2)ħ²/(2I) = (2ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). So the energy difference for rotation from J=0 to J=1 is ħ²/(I).

So which of these is larger: ħω or ħ²/(I)? That will determine whether the next state is a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, but in the question, the molecule is in the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state for a diatomic is when both v=0 and J=0. So the next state can be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. But which of these transitions requires less energy?

So I need to compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot and see which is smaller. The photon must have energy equal to the smaller of the two, because that's the 'lowest possible energy' state after the fundamental.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state is the one with the smallest possible energy increase. So I need to find which transition (vibrational or rotational) requires less energy.

First, compute the moment of inertia I, because that's needed for the rotational energy difference.

I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The reduced mass μ is calculated as (mX * mY)/(mX + mY). The masses are given in amu, so I should convert them to kg.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So mX is 20 amu → 20 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-26 kg. mY is 2 amu → 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (mX * mY) / (mX + mY) → ( (3.321e-26 kg) * (3.321e-27 kg) ) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

mX = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.321e-26 kg.

mY = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 kg )

Let me compute denominator first: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

Numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 ≈ (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 ≈ 11.028 * 1e-53 → 1.1028e-52 kg².

So μ ≈ 1.1028e-52 / 3.6531e-26 → Let's compute that.

1.1028e-52 / 3.6531e-26 = (1.1028 / 3.6531) ) * 1e-26 ≈ 0.3 * 1e-26 → approximately 3.0e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute 1.1028 / 3.6531:

3.6531 divided by 1.1028 is approximately 3.31 (since 1.1028 *3=3.308). So 1.1028 /3.6531 ≈ 0.3.

So μ ≈ 0.3e-26 kg → 3e-27 kg.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation:

3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 → (11.028) * 1e-53 = 1.1028e-52.

Denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26.

So 1.1028e-52 / 3.6531e-26 = (1.1028 / 3.6531) ) * 1e-26.

1.1028 /3.6531 ≈ 0.3018.

So μ ≈ 0.3018e-26 kg → 3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, that's about 3.0e-27 kg.

Now, the bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ * r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 → 2e-10 squared is 4e-20 m².

I = 3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² → 1.2072e-46 kg·m².

Now, the rotational energy difference ΔE_rot is given by:

ΔE_rot = [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ] * (ħ²)/(2I) → for J=0 to J=1.

Wait, no. Let's compute E_rot for J=1 and J=0.

E_rot(J=0) = 0.

E_rot(J=1) = (1*(1+1)) * ħ²/(2I) = (2) * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

Similarly, the vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = ħω.

So I need to compute which is smaller, ΔE_rot or ΔE_vib.

Let me compute ħ²/I.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

I is 1.2072e-46 kg·m².

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.2072) )e-22 → approx 0.921e-22 → 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2072) ) * 1e-22.

1.112 ÷ 1.2072 ≈ 0.921.

So ħ²/I ≈ 0.921e-22 J = 9.21e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = ħω.

ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) = (1.0545718e-34) *4e14 → 4.218e-20 J.

So ΔE_rot ≈ 9.21e-23 J, and ΔE_vib ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

Comparing the two, ΔE_rot (9.21e-23 J) is much smaller than ΔE_vib (4.22e-20 J). So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the rotational transition, not the vibrational one. So the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference.

But wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. Because the photon's energy is related to its momentum via E_photon = p_photon * c, where c is the speed of light.

Wait, no, that's not right. The energy of a photon is E = pc, where p is the momentum (since for a photon, E = hf and p = hf/c → E = pc).

So, E_photon = p_photon * c → p_photon = E_photon / c.

So, since the required energy is ΔE_rot = 9.21e-23 J, the momentum p would be (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) → Let's compute that.

9.21e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

9.21e-23 / 3e8 = (9.21 /3) * 1e-31 → 3.07 * 1e-31 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 1.9e-28 N·s.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, I'm getting a momentum of about 3e-31 kg·m/s. But the options are on the order of 1e-27 to 2e-28. That's way higher than what I'm getting. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the units. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference I'm considering is wrong. Maybe I should be considering the vibrational transition instead, because the rotational energy difference is so much smaller, but perhaps in reality, the vibrational transition is what's being considered here.

Wait, but the question states that the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, the non-rigid rotor model — I think that's the rotational model where the bond length isn't fixed, but that might include centrifugal distortion, but perhaps that's a red herring here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia. Let me go back.

Wait, bond length is given as 2 angstroms → 2e-10 m. The reduced mass calculation: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2 ) / (20 + 2) amu → (40)/(22) = 1.818 amu.

Wait, wait, that's a mistake I think I made earlier. Oh! Oh wait, earlier I computed the reduced mass in kg, but perhaps I should have done it correctly.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me recalculate that.

Ah, yes, I think that's the mistake. So μ is (mX * mY) / (mX + mY).

But I computed mX as 20 amu → 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

mY as 2 amu → 3.321e-27 kg.

So, μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 kg).

Wait, that's the same as before, so μ came out as about 3.0e-27 kg. But perhaps I made a mistake in that calculation.

Wait another approach: because the masses are 20 and 2 amu, the ratio is 20:2, so 10:1. So the reduced mass would be (20 * 2) / (20 +2) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1.818 amu → 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 2.999e-27 kg.

Which is about 3.0e-27 kg, same as before.

So I think that part was correct.

So, I = μ * r² = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg·m².

So, ħ²/(I) → (1.05e-34)^2 / 1.2e-46.

Wait, let me compute ħ squared again.

(1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 → approximately (1.05e-34)^2 = 1.1e-68 (J·s)^2.

So, 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 → approximately 9.17e-23 J.

Which, as before, is 9.17e-23 J.

But this is way smaller than the vibrational energy, which is 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, but according to the options, the momentum is 1e-27 N·s to 2e-28 N·s. But my calculation gives a momentum of about 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 N·s, since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that's way smaller than any of the options. So there's a mistake here.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should be looking at the vibrational transition because the rotational energy difference is so small that perhaps the photon's energy is not sufficient unless the transition is vibrational. Hmm, but why would the question ask for the next state with the lowest possible energy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recheck.

E_rot(J=1) = (1*(1+1)) * ħ²/(2I) → (2) * ħ²/(2I) → ħ²/(I).

So yes, correct.

Wait, but maybe I should be considering the selection rules. For a diatomic molecule, vibrational transitions are allowed if Δv = ±1, and rotational transitions may have ΔJ = ±1 (for electric dipole transitions). But that doesn't affect which transition is lower in energy; it's just about whether the transition is allowed.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the next energy level, which is a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes.

Wait, no, the next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy increase. So between the two options (rotational or vibrational), the rotational requires less energy, so that's the next state.

But then why the options are so much larger than my calculated value? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recompute.

Wait, another formula for rotational energy is E_rot = (J (J +1) ) * (ħ^2) / (2I), right?

So for J=0, E=0.

For J=1, E_rot = (1*2) * ħ²/(2I) = 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/I.

So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should be considering the Raman transitions, which allow for ΔJ=±2, but that doesn't change the energy calculation.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the moment of inertia. Let me double-check that.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R².

μ is 3e-27 kg.

I = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg·m².

Yes, that's correct.

So ħ^2/(I) = (1.05e-34)^2 / 1.2e-46 = 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 → approx 9e-23 J.

So, the energy difference for the rotational transition is 9e-23 J.

The photon's energy would be this, so its momentum is E/c → 9e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3e-31 kg·m/s = 3e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are anywhere near 1e-31. The options are A: 1.9e-28, B: 2.3e-27, C: 1.1e-27, D: 1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in units. Wait, 1 J = 1 N·m. So, E = p c → p = E/c → E in J, c in m/s, p in kg·m/s, which is the same as N·s.

Wait, so 9e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3e-31 kg·m/s = 3e-31 N·s.

Hmm, but none of the options are in that range. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition. Let me compute the momentum for the vibrational transition.

ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon = E/c = 4.218e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s = 1.406e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s. That's very close.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would the photon be matching the vibrational energy?

Ah, perhaps because in the rotation-vibration model, the molecule's energy levels are a combination of both. So the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0.

The next state would be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. But which is lower in energy?

Wait, if the rotational transition (J=1, v=0) has lower energy than the vibrational (v=1, J=0), then the photon should match the rotational transition. But the calculation shows that the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational. So the correct photon energy is the rotational one, but that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next higher state, which could be a combination of both vibrational and rotational changes. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering just the vibrational transition because the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. But when you absorb a photon, you might be considering the first allowed transition, which might be the vibrational one, despite the higher energy, due to selection rules or other factors.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the Raman transition for rotation, which might require lower energy, but in reality, in a real molecule, the vibrational transitions are more prominent in IR spectra. Alternatively, in the context of this question, perhaps the photon's energy corresponds to the fundamental vibrational transition, not the rotational one.

Wait, but the calculation shows that the rotational transition requires much less energy. So why is it not matching any options? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the transition to the next higher state, which is a combination of both vibrational and rotational transitions. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

The question states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0, whichever has the lower energy.

Wait, perhaps the rotational state's energy is lower, so the molecule would first go to J=1, v=0.

So the energy required is the rotational energy difference, which I calculated as about 9e-23 J, which gives a photon momentum of 3e-31 N·s, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor or miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia is being calculated incorrectly. Let me check all the steps again.

Masses: Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg → 1.818 *1.6605e-27 = approximately 2.999e-27 kg → about 3e-27 kg.

Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 → 3e-27 *4e-20 → 1.2e-46 kg·m².

Yes, that's correct.

So, ħ²/(I) → (1.05e-34)^2 / 1.2e-46 = 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.17e-23 J.

Hmm, that's correct.

So the photon's energy is 9.17e-23 J, and the momentum is p = E/c → 9.17e-23 /3e8 = 3.06e-31 kg·m/s = 3.06e-31 N·s.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.

Wait, but that's about three orders of magnitude higher than my calculated value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the order of magnitude.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational transition's energy, which I found to be 4.2e-20 J, leading to a photon momentum of 1.4e-28 N·s, which matches option D.

But why would the molecule transition to the vibrational state if the rotational transition requires less energy? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state, which could be a higher rotational state, but perhaps the selection rules allow only certain transitions. For example, in rotational transitions, ΔJ=±1, but the energy is lower than the vibrational transition. So the photon would need to match the rotational energy.

But since the options don't include that, perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor approximation, but the bond length might change when the molecule rotates. No, the non-rigid rotor model accounts for bond length changes, but that might affect the moment of inertia, but I'm not sure how that would change the energy calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should be considering the vibrational transition because the energy is higher than the rotational, but the question is asking for the photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state, which is the next higher energy level. So if the next state is higher in energy, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational, the photon's energy would be the difference between the two.

Wait, but that's not the case. The next state is the one with the lowest possible energy increase. So it should be the rotational transition.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor because the problem refers to the non-rigid rotor model. Maybe in this model, the rotational energy is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply considering the vibrational transition, leading to option D.

But I'm stuck. Let's consider that perhaps the correct transition is the vibrational one, and the rotational is not considered because perhaps the problem is only about the vibrational transition.

Wait, the question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So that model includes both rotation and vibration. But the initial state is the fundamental state, and the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition because that's the only way to get a photon momentum matching the options.

Wait, but why would it be the next state if the rotational transition requires less energy? That seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=1, J=0) state, which is a vibrational transition.

Let me compute the photon's momentum for that.

ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.0545718e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 /3e8 → 1.406e-28 kg·m/s = 1.406e-28 N·s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.

So perhaps the problem considers that the next state is the first vibrational state, not the rotational one. But that seems odd because the rotational transition requires less energy.

Unless, the question is considering that the rotational transition isn't allowed, but that's not mentioned in the question.

Wait, perhaps I should be considering the selection rules for rotational transitions. For a diatomic molecule, the rotational transitions (in the rigid rotor model) are allowed when ΔJ=±1, but only when there's a change in vibration as well. Wait, no, that's for Raman transitions.

Wait, in pure rotational spectra (like microwave), the selection rule is ΔJ=±1, but the vibrational quantum number v remains the same. So, perhaps the rotational transition is allowed, but in this case, it's a separate consideration.

Wait, but in the context of the problem, perhaps the molecule can absorb a photon that causes a change in rotational state, but that would require a lower energy than the vibrational transition. So the answer should be the rotational momentum, but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in terms of the energy level, which could be a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes. But I'm not sure how that's calculated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition because that's what the given angular frequency is for. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

But I'm really confused now. Let me try to see which option aligns with the vibrational transition.

Option D is 1.4e-28 N·s, which matches the calculation for the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the vibrational transition, leading to option D.

But why would the rotational transition not be considered? Maybe because the problem is presented in a way that the next state is the first vibrational state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total energy, considering both rotation and vibration. But that complicates things.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total energy for both (v=0, J=1) and (v=1, J=0) states and see which is lower.

Energy for (v=0, J=0): E = 0 + 0 = 0.

Energy for (v=0, J=1): E_rot = ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.17e-23 J. E_vib =0.

Energy for (v=1, J=0): E_vib = ħω=4.218e-20 J. E_rot=0.

So, the (v=0, J=1) state has lower energy than the (v=1, J=0) state. So the next state is (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon with momentum 3.07e-31 N·s. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule can only undergo vibrational transitions, ignoring rotational transitions, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rotational energy calculation. Let me check the formula again.

E_rot = [ J(J+1) ] * (ħ²)/(2I)

Wait, for J=0: E=0.

J=1: E= (1*2) * ħ²/(2I) = (2) * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/I → which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the next state is the lowest possible. So perhaps the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, and the next state could be (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Which is lower in energy?

We've calculated that (v=0, J=1) requires 9.17e-23 J, and (v=1, J=0) requires 4.218e-20 J. Therefore, the (v=0, J=1) state is lower in energy, so the photon should have energy corresponding to E_rot.

But that doesn't match any of the options.

So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the photon's energy as the sum of both rotational and vibrational transitions, but that would be even more energy.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next vibrational state, regardless of the rotational state, but that doesn't make sense if the rotational state requires less energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me compute it again.

I = μ r² = ( (20*2)/(22) ) amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should have converted the amu to kg correctly.

Wait, 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So, μ = (20 * 2) / (22) amu → 40/22 = 1.818 amu → 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 2.999e-27 kg → approximately 3.0e-27 kg.

So, I = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 * 4e-20 m² = 1.2e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ² = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 → approximately 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So, ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 → 9.267e-23 J.

So, the rotational energy difference is 9.267e-23 J.

Photon's energy E = 9.267e-23 J → p = E/c = 9.267e-23 / 3e8 → 3.089e-31 kg·m/s → 3.089e-31 N·s.

Which is nowhere near the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the change to the next vibrational state, which would require a photon momentum of 1.4e-28 N·s, matching option D.

But why would the molecule transition to a higher energy vibrational state when a lower energy rotational state is available. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the vibrational transition, not the rotational one, perhaps due to selection rules. But the question doesn't specify selection rules; it just asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in considering which transition is allowed. For example, in the rigid rotor model, pure rotational transitions are dipole allowed only if the molecule has a permanent dipole moment and ΔJ=±1. But the question doesn't specify if the molecule has a dipole moment. So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore rotational transitions and consider only vibrational
