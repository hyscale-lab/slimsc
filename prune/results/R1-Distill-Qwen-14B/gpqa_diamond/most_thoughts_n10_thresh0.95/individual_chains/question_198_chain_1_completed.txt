Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and see if I can figure it out.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The given concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Hmm. So, I think this involves the formation of complexes in solution. The stability constants (β) tell us how stable each complex is. Higher β means the complex is more stable.

Wait, what are the complexes here? I remember that for metal ions like Co(II), they can form complexes with SCN- ions. The possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n is the number of SCN- attached. So, for Co(II), the charge would be 2+ minus the charge from the SCN- ligands. Each SCN- is -1, so for each SCN bound, the overall charge decreases by 1. But wait, wait—no, the Co is +2, each SCN is -1, so if it's a neutral complex, like [Co(SCN)_n]^x, I need to figure that out.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible complexes. Let's see. The possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- I think. Because for each SCN, you lose a charge. So Co(II) is +2. If it binds one SCN-, which is -1, then the complex is +1. Two SCNs would make it (2+) - 2*(-1) = 0. Three SCNs would be -1, and four would be -2.

So the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that might be for the complexes [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- respectively.

So the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato means two SCN- ions attached, right? So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So we're looking for the fraction of Co that's in that complex.

I think the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum them up. But since there are four complexes, we'll have to calculate each and then see what's the percentage for the dithiocyanato one.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the stability constants and their concentrations. The general idea is that the fraction depends on the β values and the concentrations of the ions.

I remember that the fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is given by (β_n * [SCN]^n) ) / (1 + sum_{m=1 to 4} β_m [SCN]^m )

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The fraction f_n is given by (β_n [SCN]^n) / (denominator), where the denominator is the sum of all β_m [SCN]^m for m from 0 to 4, but wait, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, the general expression for the fraction of each complex includes the β term multiplied by the ligand concentration raised to the number of ligands. But wait, also, the metal is Co, so the metal concentration is [Co] = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the distribution of Co(II) into the different complexes. The total concentration of Co is the sum of the concentrations of all the complexes.

Each complex is formed as follows:

Co²+ + n SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}

The stability constant β_n is given by:

β_n = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} ] / ( [Co²+][SCN⁻]^n )

So, [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} = β_n [Co²+][SCN⁻]^n

Thus, the total [Co] is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n], which is:

[Co] = [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^2- 

Wait, no, because [Co²+] is the free ion, and the other terms are the complexes. So:

[Co] = [Co²+] + Σ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}, where n=1 to 4.

So each [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} is β_n [Co²+][SCN]^n.

Thus, [Co] = [Co²+] + [Co²+][SCN]^1 β1 + [Co²+][SCN]^2 β2 + [Co²+][SCN]^3 β3 + [Co²+][SCN]^4 β4

So, [Co²+] can be factored out:

[Co] = [Co²+] (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

We can solve for [Co²+]:

[Co²+] = [Co] / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Once [Co²+] is known, the concentration of each complex can be found.

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is [Co(SCN)2] / [Co]

Which equals (β2 [Co²+][SCN]^2 ) / [Co]

Substituting [Co²+] from earlier:

= (β2 [SCN]^2 * [Co] / D ) / [Co]

Where D is denominator (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Simplify: (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / D

So, the fraction is (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but wait. Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

c(Co) = 1e-2 M. That's the total cobalt concentration, so [Co] = 1e-2 M.

[SCN-] = 0.1 M.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So, compute each term in the denominator.

Compute each [SCN]^n:

n=0: 1
n=1: 0.1
n=2: 0.1^2 = 0.01
n=3: 0.1^3 = 0.001
n=4: 0.1^4=0.0001

So, denominator D = 1 + β1*(0.1) + β2*(0.01) + β3*(0.001) + β4*(0.0001 )

Compute each term:

β1*(0.1) = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2*(0.01) =40 * 0.01 = 0.4

β3*(0.001) =63 *0.001=0.063

β4*(0.0001)=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

So sum these:

0.9 + 0.4 =1.3

+0.063=1.363

+0.0016=1.3646

So denominator D is 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646?

Wait, wait. Wait, the denominator is the sum of 1 (n=0 term) plus the terms for n=1 to 4.

Wait, no, wait. When I wrote denominator D earlier as 1 + β1[SCN] + β2[SCN]^2 + ... , that is correct.

So D = 1 + (β1 * [SCN]^1 ) + (β2 * [SCN]^2 ) + (β3 * [SCN]^3 ) + (β4 * [SCN]^4 )

So D = 1 + 9*(0.1) +40*(0.01) +63*(0.001) +16*(0.0001 )

Compute each term:

9 *0.1 = 0.9

40 *0.01=0.4

63 *0.001=0.063

16 *0.0001=0.0016

Sum these: 0.9 +0.4=1.3; 1.3+0.063=1.363; 1.363+0.0016=1.3646.

So D=1 +1.3646=2.3646.

So the denominator is 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for n=2 (the dithiocyanato complex) is (β2 * [SCN]^2 ) / D.

Which is (40 * 0.01 ) / 2.3646.

Compute numerator: 40 *0.01=0.4.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ let's compute that.

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

Wait, 0.4 divided by 2.3646. Let me compute it with more precision.

2.3646 ≈ 2.3646.

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

So that's about 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

So the percentage would be approximately 16.9%.

But wait, that would be the fraction. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Because the fraction is (β2 [SCN]^2) / D, which is (40 * (0.1)^2 ) / (2.3646) = (40 *0.01)/2.3646 = 0.4/2.3646≈ 0.169, which is about 16.9%.

But wait, wait a second. The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Are the dithiocyanato complexes blue? I remember that [Co(SCN)_2] is blue, but [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is pink, so maybe I have the complexes right.

Wait, but the options have 16.9% as option D. So according to this, that's the answer. But wait, let me check steps again.

Wait, wait. Another way to think is perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. For example, some sources define the formation of [CoSCN]^+ as the first complex, so β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN-]) =9.

Then, for [Co(SCN)_2], β2 would be the formation constant for the second ligand. So β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN+][SCN-]).

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the stability constants. Because in some cases, the stability constants are given for each addition step, not the overall formation.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So I think each β represents the overall formation constant for the n-th complex.

Hmm. Let me clarify. The stability constant βn is defined as [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^n )

So for each n, the β is the overall constant for that complex.

So yes, the approach I took earlier is correct.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

But looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because sometimes, the fraction is calculated as (βn [SCN]^n ) / D, where D is the sum from n=0 to 4 of βn [SCN]^n.

Wait, but wait, β0 would be the stability constant for the free ion, which is 1 (since [Co²+]/([Co²+][SCN]^0 )=1). So yes, the denominator is 1 + β1[SCN] + β2[SCN]^2 + β3[SCN]^3 + β4[SCN]^4.

So the calculation seems correct.

So the fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the initial approach I took gives me that. So the answer would be D.


To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( [\text{Co}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants:  
  \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \)

The stability constant \( \beta_n \) for a complex [Co(SCN)_n] is defined as:  
\[
\beta_n = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_n}]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^n}
\]

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:
\[
[\text{Co}] = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}]
\]

Using the stability constants, the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \) and \( [\text{SCN}^-] \). Factoring out \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \), the total cobalt concentration becomes:
\[
[\text{Co}] = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right)
\]

Let the denominator be:
\[
D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

Substituting \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \) and the given \( \beta \) values:
\[
D = 1 + (9 \cdot 0.1) + (40 \cdot 0.1^2) + (63 \cdot 0.1^3) + (16 \cdot 0.1^4)
\]
\[
D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of cobalt in the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]) is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D}
\]
\[
f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot 0.1^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Thus, the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is:
\[
f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.
