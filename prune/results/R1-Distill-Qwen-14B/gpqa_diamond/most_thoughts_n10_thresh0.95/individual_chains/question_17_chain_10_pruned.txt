Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is probably CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA. So, the complex is stable because of the high formation constant, K. 

The problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²+] in the solution. 

Right, the formation constant K is given by the formula K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Wait, but EDTA is usually in its deprotonated form when it complexes. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so I guess we don't have to worry about the different protonated forms of EDTA. That simplifies things.

So, the formation constant K is 5e10, which is a really large number. So the complex is stable, meaning that [Ca²+] should be very small because almost all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex.

Wait, the initial solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. But what's the stoichiometry here? Each Ca²+ combines with one EDTA^4- (I think EDTA is usually Y^4- when deprotonated). So the complex is CaY²-.

So, the formation reaction is Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²-. And K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, in solution, the concentration of Y^4- is determined by the speciation of EDTA. Hmm, but the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I might not need to calculate the alpha fraction of EDTA. Maybe I can assume that EDTA is present in its Y^4- form, making the calculation straightforward.

Wait, but the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, before any dissociation, the concentration of CaY²- is 0.02 M. But then, some of this complex dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-.

Wait, the initial concentration is 0.02 M CaY²-. Let me denote the change as dissociation. Let me set up an ICE table.

Initial:
[CaY²-] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0 (since before dissociation)
[Y^4-] = 0

Change:
[CaY²-] decreases by x
[Ca²+] increases by x
[Y^4-] increases by x

At equilibrium:
[CaY²-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is large, x is small)
[Ca²+] = x
[Y^4-] = x

So, K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10

Wait, no. K is 5e10, so 0.02/(x²) =5e10. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, wait: K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

So, substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

5e10 = (0.02 - x)/(x * x) 

But since K is so large, x is very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate
