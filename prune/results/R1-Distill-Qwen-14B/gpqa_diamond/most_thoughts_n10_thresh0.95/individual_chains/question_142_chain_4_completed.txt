Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. Hmm, let's start by recalling what a density matrix represents. I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. For a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix with trace 1.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait a second, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because each of the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ has an equal weight of 1/2.

So, the density matrix ρ must be a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements as 1/2. Let me write it out:

ρ = [[1/2, 0],
     [0, 1/2]]

Right, that's the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2. Now, I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector in 3D space. The Bloch vector has components (x, y, z), where each component is related to the parameters in the density matrix.

The general form of a qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. So, let me expand that. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So, I can write ρ as:

ρ = (1/2) [I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z]

Given that ρ is diagonal, the σ_x and σ_y terms (which are off-diagonal) must vanish. Because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]] and σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], their contributions would add terms to the off-diagonal of ρ. But in our case, ρ is diagonal, so the coefficients of σ_x and σ_y must be zero. That means r_x and r_y are zero.

Looking at the diagonal terms, the identity matrix contributes 1/2 to each diagonal element. The σ_z matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so when multiplied by r_z, it adds (1/2) r_z to the (1,1) element and subtracts (1/2) r_z from the (2,2) element. 

Our ρ has both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. So, let's set up the equations. From the (1,1) element:

1/2 = (1/2) * 1 + (1/2) r_z * 1

Wait, that would be (1/2)(1 + r_z) = 1/2. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives 1 + r_z = 1, so r_z = 0. Wait, but that can't be right because the σ_z term would affect the (2,2) element as well. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The general form is ρ = (I + r_z σ_z + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y)/2.

So, expanding σ_z gives [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, when you multiply by r_z, you get [[r_z, 0],[0, -r_z]]. Then, adding the identity matrix:

I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so I + r·σ becomes [[1 + r_z, 0], [0, 1 - r_z]]. Then, divide by 2:

ρ = [[(1 + r_z)/2, 0], [0, (1 - r_z)/2]]

Comparing this to our given ρ, which is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], we can set up the equations:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 - r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

So, r_z is zero. And since r_x and r_y are zero from earlier, the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). 

Wait, but what's the geometrical position in the qubit space? The Bloch vector's tip is at (r_x, r_y, r_z). If all components are zero, that would be the origin. So the point is (0,0,0). 

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a qubit, which is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \). The general form of a single-qubit density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), since it is diagonal, the off-diagonal terms (contributions from \( \sigma_x \) and \( \sigma_y \)) must vanish, implying \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). 

From the diagonal terms, the contributions from \( \sigma_z \) are also zero because the diagonal elements of \( \rho \) are equal. This implies \( r_z = 0 \). Therefore, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the state is at the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \( r = (1, 1, 0) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different state.  
B) \( r = (0, 0, 1) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to the state \( |1\rangle \).  
C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \): Correct, as this matches the origin in the Bloch sphere.  
D) \( r = (1, 1, 1) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.**

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
