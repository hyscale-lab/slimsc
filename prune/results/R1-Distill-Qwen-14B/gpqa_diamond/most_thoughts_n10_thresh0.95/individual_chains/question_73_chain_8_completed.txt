Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see. The question is about finding their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Oh boy, I need to think this through step by step.

Alright, so the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, I remember that you can't just subtract the speeds normally because of the velocity addition formula.

Right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. Oh yeah, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, but wait, which one is moving relative to whom? Oh, in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So the relative speed of B as seen from A's frame would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c is -0.1c. So the relative speed is negative, but since speed is a magnitude, maybe we take the absolute value. Wait, but the question says relative speed, so perhaps the sign doesn't matter, but the options have positive values. So the relative speed's magnitude is 0.1c? Wait, let me compute the denominator.

Denominator: 1 - (0.5 * 0.6)c² / c². The c² cancels, so 1 - (0.3) = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the magnitude is about 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have mixed up the reference frames. Let me clarify: when you're moving at u in the lab frame, and another object is moving at v, then from your frame, their speed is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(c²)). So in this case, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, then from A's perspective, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) ) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.1428c in the opposite direction, but since the question says 'relative speed', it's probably just the magnitude, 0.14c. So options C and D have that.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each has their own gamma factor.

Wait, each astronaut's energy is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy, mc². So for astronaut A (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E_A = gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B (mass 3m, speed 0.5c): gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C is E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc², which is less. So the correct energy is 5.96 mc².

Wait, but wait, the options: option B says E=4.96 mc², and option C is 5.96. So C has the right relative speed and the right energy. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the velocities. The relative speed calculation might be the other way around. Let me double-check. Oh wait, in the problem, are the astronauts moving in the same direction? Yes, both positive x-direction, so astronaut A is at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(denominator) which is negative, but the magnitude is 0.1c over 0.7, which is 0.1428c, so about 0.14c. So option C and D have that.

But the energy, when I calculated, is about 5.96 mc², so that's option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one object as seen from another in special relativity is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut A is moving at \( u = 0.6c \), and astronaut B is moving at \( v = 0.5c \), both in the positive x-direction. Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

- Numerator: \( 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c \)
- Denominator: \( 1 - (0.5 \cdot 0.6) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but since the question asks for the relative speed, we take the magnitude:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### Energy of Astronaut A
- Mass: \( 2m \)
- Speed: \( 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy: \( E_A = \gamma \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2 \)

#### Energy of Astronaut B
- Mass: \( 3m \)
- Speed: \( 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy: \( E_B = \gamma \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2 \)

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).
- The total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
