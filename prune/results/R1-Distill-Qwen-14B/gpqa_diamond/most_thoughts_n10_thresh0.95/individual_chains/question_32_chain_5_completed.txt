Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons, so Li-6, I think. Hmm, right, because Lithium usually has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. 

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me check. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, that makes the mass number 3 + 3 = 6. So yes, Li-6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. 

The problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases. The energy required would be the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

The formula I need is probably the total energy E = gamma * m_0 * c². But wait, I'm given the speed, so I can find gamma first. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can calculate that.

Wait, the speed is 0.96c. Let me compute gamma for v=0.96c. 

Calculating gamma: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's compute (0.96)^2. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that division: 1 divided by 0.28 is about 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, the rest mass is the mass of the nucleus. So I need the mass of Li-6 in kilograms. But wait, how do I find that? I remember that the atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. The mass number for Li-6 is 6. So the mass would be 6 * u. 

Wait, but wait. The actual mass of a nucleus isn't exactly mass number times u because of binding energy. But I think in this problem, they're probably assuming the rest mass is just based on the mass number, treating it as a heavy particle. Or perhaps they're using the atomic mass as the rest mass. Hmm, but for the sake of solving this, maybe I should proceed with the given approach.

So, let me compute m_0. Li-6 has a mass number A=6. So m_0 = 6 * u. Let me calculate that: 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg = approximately 9.9632344e-27 kg.

Wait, but wait a minute, perhaps I should convert that into grams or something, but let me see what the energy units are. The options are in GeV, so I probably need to compute this in units that can convert to GeV.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the rest mass energy in MeV or GeV. Oh wait, I think the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the rest mass would be approximately (3 * 938 + 3 * 939) MeV. Let me compute that: 3*938 is 2814, 3*939 is 2817. Sum is 5631 MeV, which is 5.631 GeV. So m_0 c² is approximately 5.631 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less than that because the binding energy reduces the total mass due to the mass-energy equivalence. Wait, but since the problem is about relativistic energy, perhaps it's using the rest mass energy as if it were a single particle with mass equal to the sum of the nucleons. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Hmm. But perhaps for this problem, the approximation is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe I can use the exact atomic mass. 

Wait, but I don't have the exact value, so perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass energy as m_0 c² = (mass number) * (average mass of nucleon) in GeV. Let's proceed with that.

So, m_0 c² is approximately 5.631 GeV. Then, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by this. Gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.631 GeV.

Calculating that: 3.5714 * 5.631. Let's compute 3 *5.631 is 16.893, 0.5714 *5.631 is approx 3.215. So total is about 20.108 GeV.

But wait, looking at the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, and option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made an error in the approximation. Let me be more precise.

Wait, let me recompute gamma. Let me compute it more accurately. v = 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.571428571.

Now, for m_0 c², perhaps a more precise calculation is needed. Let me think again. Each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. 

So m_0 c² = (3 * 938.272 + 3 * 939.565) MeV.

Calculating that: 3*(938.272 +939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV. So that's 5.633511 GeV.

So E = gamma * m_0 c² = 3.571428571 * 5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately:

3.571428571 * 5.633511.

Hmm, 3 *5.633511 = 16.900533.

0.571428571 is approximately 4/7 (since 4/7 is about 0.5714).

So 0.571428571 *5.633511 = ?

Let me compute 5.633511 * 0.571428571.

5.633511 * 0.5 = 2.8167555.

5.633511 * 0.071428571 ≈ 5.633511 * 0.071428571.

0.07 is about 0.07, so 5.633511 * 0.07 = 0.39434577.

0.001428571 is approximately 1/700. So 5.633511 * 0.001428571 ≈ 0.008051.

So summing together: 0.39434577 + 0.008051 ≈ 0.402397.

So total of 5.633511 * 0.571428571 ≈ 2.8167555 + 0.402397 ≈ 3.2191525.

So the total E is 16.900533 + 3.2191525 = 20.1196855 GeV, approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made some approximations. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more precisely.

Let me compute 3.571428571 * 5.633511.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as 35/10 * 5.633511. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using exact fractions. Let me see: 3.571428571 is 25/7 (since 25/7 ≈3.571428571). So let me compute (25/7) * 5.633511.

25 *5.633511 = 140.837775. Divided by 7: 140.837775 /7 ≈ 20.119682 GeV. So about 20.1197 GeV.

But the options have option C as 20.132, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation of the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is not exactly 5.6335 GeV. Maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the mass to be calculated as (A * u) in kg, then converted to GeV.

Wait, so perhaps the exact approach is better. Let me compute the rest mass energy using the atomic mass in kg.

The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). Wait, because the exact mass is needed. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact value. Let me think: the standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but that's for Li-7. Li-6 has a natural abundance, but perhaps for the problem, the mass is given as 6 u? Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass of the nucleus is 6 u.

Wait, but then u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg, so 6 u is 9.9632344e-27 kg.

So the rest mass energy m_0 c² = 9.9632344e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Wait, but 3e8 squared is 9e16 m²/s².

So m_0 c² = 9.9632344e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² = 8.96691096e-10 J.

Now, converting joules to GeV. I know that 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV = 1.60218e-10 J.

So m_0 c² is 8.96691096e-10 J. Divided by 1.60218e-10 J/GeV gives approximately 5.6 GeV. Wait, let me compute:

8.96691096e-10 / 1.60218e-10 = (8.96691096 / 1.60218) ≈ 5.6.

Wait, wait, 8.96691096e-10 / 1.60218e-10 = 8.96691096 / 1.60218 ≈ 5.6 (because 5.6 *1.60218 is about 8.971, which is close to 8.9669). So m_0 c² ≈5.6 GeV.

But wait, earlier calculation when considering individual protons and neutrons, we had about 5.6335 GeV. So perhaps using 5.6 GeV is an underestimation, but perhaps the problem expects using the exact mass as 6 u, leading to m_0 c² ≈5.56 GeV? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the exact calculation using precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the relativistic energy formula, but using the rest mass as 6 u, which gives m_0 c² = 5.56 GeV. Then, gamma is 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 *5.56 ≈ 20 GeV. But let me compute that.

Wait, let me compute 3.5714 *5.56.

3 *5.56=16.68.

0.5714 *5.56 = let's compute 5.56 *0.5 = 2.78, 5.56 *0.0714 ≈ 0.396. So total 2.78 +0.396 ≈3.176.

So 16.68 +3.176 =19.856 GeV. Hmm, which is about 19.86, but none of the options match that. The options have C as 20.132 and D as 21.419.

Wait, perhaps the way I calculated the rest mass is incorrect. Maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the entire Li-6 nucleus, which may have a lower mass than the sum of its nucleons due to binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the precise rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me see. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 atomic mass units. Because I remember that the mass of a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c², and the proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², but the nucleus has a binding energy. So the mass of the nucleus is (sum of protons and neutrons' masses) minus the binding energy (divided by c²), but that's a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the binding energy and just calculate based on A=6, so m_0 c² =6 * (mass of a nucleon). But what's the average mass of a nucleon? Let's see, the proton is 938.272 MeV, neutron is 939.565 MeV. So the average is (938.272 + 939.565)/2 = 938.9185 MeV per nucleon. So for 6 nucleons, that's 6 * 938.9185 = 5,633.511 MeV, or 5.633511 GeV.

So using this, E = gamma * m_0 c^2 = 3.57142857 *5.633511 = ?

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 *0.5 =2.8167555.

5.633511 *0.07142857 = let me compute it as 5.633511 * (1/14) ≈0.40239364.

So 2.8167555 +0.40239364 =3.21914914.

So total E =16.900533 +3.21914914 =20.119682 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the precise calculation would lead to 20.1197, which rounds to 20.120 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I should consider more precise values for gamma and the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I computed gamma as 3.57142857, but maybe it's more precise. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² =0.96^2 =0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 =3.57142857....

So that seems correct.

Now, perhaps the rest mass calculation is more precise. Let's compute m_0 c² as 6 * u, with u=1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m_0 c² =6 *1.66053906660e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Compute (3e8)^2 =9e16.

So m_0 c² =6 *1.66053906660e-27 *9e16.

Multiply 6 *1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632344e-27 kg.

Then multiply by 9e16 m²/s²: 9.9632344e-27 *9e16 = 8.96691096e-10 J.

Convert Joules to GeV: 1 GeV =1.602176634e-10 J.

So m_0 c² =8.96691096e-10 J /1.602176634e-10 J/GeV = approx (8.96691096 /1.602176634) GeV.

Compute 8.96691096 /1.602176634:

1.602176634 *5.6 = 1.602176634 *5 =8.01088317; 1.602176634 *0.6=0.96130598. Sum:8.01088317 +0.96130598=8.97218915.

But 8.96691096 is less than that, so the value is slightly less than 5.6. Let me compute 8.96691096 /1.602176634:

Dividing 8.96691096 by 1.602176634:

Let me approximate:

1.602176634 *5.6 =8.97218915, which is more than 8.9669. So 5.6 is a slight overestimation.

Compute 5.6 *1.602176634 =8.97218915.

So 8.96691096 =5.6 *1.602176634 - (8.97218915 -8.96691096).

The difference is 8.97218915 -8.96691096 =0.00527819.

So 5.6 - (0.00527819 /1.602176634) ≈5.6 -0.003294 ≈5.596706 GeV.

So m_0 c² ≈5.5967 GeV.

Hmm, that's a bit different from the earlier 5.6335 GeV. So which is correct?

Ah, perhaps I should use the exact atomic mass of Li-6, which is around 6.0151 u. Wait, because when you have a nucleus, the mass is slightly less than the sum of the individual nucleons. The mass defect is due to binding energy, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact atomic mass, including the binding energy.

Wait, so the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0151 atomic mass units. Therefore, m_0 c² =6.0151 u * c².

So let's compute that.

6.0151 u =6.0151 *1.66053906660e-27 kg = approx 9.9891e-27 kg.

Then, m_0 c² =9.9891e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 =9.9891e-27 *9e16 =8.99019e-10 J.

Convert to GeV: 8.99019e-10 J / (1.602176634e-10 J/GeV) =approx 5.61 GeV.

So m_0 c² is about 5.61 GeV.

Then, E =gamma * m_0 c² =3.57142857 *5.61 ≈?

3.57142857 *5.61.

3 *5.61=16.83.

0.57142857 *5.61 ≈3.2 (since 0.5*5.61=2.805, 0.07142857 *5.61≈0.402, so total 3.207).

So E≈16.83 +3.207=20.037 GeV, approximately 20.04 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when using the exact sum of nucleons, I got 20.1197 GeV. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the precise atomic mass of Li-6, which is 6.0151 u, leading to m_0 c² ≈5.61 GeV, and E≈20.04 GeV. But none of the options exactly match that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using precise values without approximations.

Let me try a different approach. Let me use more precise numbers.

Gamma: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Now, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0151 u. So m_0 c² =6.0151 u * c².

1 u = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m_0 c² =6.0151 *1.66053906660e-27 kg * (3e8)^2.

Compute step by step:

6.0151 *1.66053906660e-27 = let's compute 6 *1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632344e-27 kg. 0.0151 *1.66053906660e-27 = approx 2.5031e-29 kg. So total is approximately 9.9632344e-27 + 2.5031e-29 ≈9.9882654e-27 kg.

Then, m_0 c² =9.9882654e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 =9.9882654e-27 *9e16 =8.98943886e-10 J.

Convert to GeV: 8.98943886e-10 J / (1.602176634e-10 J/GeV) = approx 5.61 GeV.

So E =3.5714285714 *5.61 = ?

3.5714285714 *5.61.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *5.61.

Breaking it down:

3.5714285714 *5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 *0.61 =?

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.6 =2.14285714284.

3.5714285714 *0.01 =0.035714285714.

So 0.61 part is 2.14285714284 +0.035714285714=2.17857142855.

Total E=17.857142857 +2.17857142855=20.0357142855 GeV.

So approximately 20.036 GeV.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. Hmm, but that's a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me check another approach. Let me use the exact formula and precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the rest mass in terms of the total nucleon mass, not considering binding energy. So let's compute using 6 nucleons, each about 938.9 MeV/c² on average.

Wait, each proton is 938.272 MeV, each neutron 939.565 MeV. So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total is 3*(938.272 +939.565) = 3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV, so 5.633511 GeV.

So E =3.5714285714 *5.633511 =?

Calculating it precisely:

3.5714285714 *5.633511.

Let me compute (3 + 0.5714285714) *5.633511.

3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.5714285714 *5.633511.

Let me compute 5.633511 * (4/7) because 0.5714285714 is 4/7.

4/7 *5.633511 = (4 *5.633511) /7.

4 *5.633511=22.534044.

Divide by 7: 22.534044 /7 =3.21914914.

So total E=16.900533 +3.21914914=20.119682 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV, which is 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. The difference is about 0.012 GeV, which is 12 MeV. That's a small difference, perhaps due to more precise gamma calculation or more precise rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me recompute gamma with more decimal places.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714285714...

So that part is precise.

Perhaps I should use more precise mass values for the nucleons.

Proton mass: 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass: 939.565 MeV/c².

So m_0 c² =3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So E=3.5714285714 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *5.633511.

Calculating precisely:

3.5714285714 ×5.633511.

Let me compute 3 ×5.633511 =16.900533.

0.5714285714 ×5.633511.

0.5 ×5.633511 =2.8167555.

0.0714285714 ×5.633511 = let's compute 5.633511 ×0.0714285714.

5.633511 ×0.0714285714.

Since 0.0714285714 is approximately 1/14.

5.633511 /14 ≈0.40239364.

So 0.5 part is 2.8167555, 0.0714285714 part is 0.40239364.

Sum:2.8167555 +0.40239364=3.21914914.

So total E=16.900533 +3.21914914=20.119682 GeV.

Now, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm. So perhaps there's a miscalculation somewhere, or maybe the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving and the question is about the total energy, which includes the kinetic energy. Or perhaps it's about the kinetic energy, but the question says 'energy of the collider', which is typically the kinetic energy provided. Wait, no, usually the energy given in such contexts refers to the total relativistic energy.

Wait, wait, the question says: What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c? So the energy given is the kinetic energy, or the total energy?

Hmm, that's a crucial point. If the question is asking for the total energy, then it's gamma * m c². But if it's asking for the kinetic energy, it's (gamma -1) * m c².

Wait, the problem states: "the energy of the RHIC". RHIC accelerators typically accelerate ions to a certain kinetic energy. Wait, but sometimes, the energy referred to is the total energy. I'm a bit confused about that. Let me think.

In particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy imparted to the particles, but sometimes it's the total energy (relativistic). So I need to clarify this.

If the energy is the kinetic energy (K), then K = (gamma -1) m c².

If it's the total energy (E), E = gamma m c².

So in the problem statement, it says "the energy of the RHIC", which is usually the kinetic energy provided to the ions. So we should calculate the kinetic energy, which would be (gamma -1) * m c².

So let me compute that.

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

So gamma -1 = 2.5714285714.

m c² is 5.633511 GeV.

So K =2.5714285714 *5.633511 GeV.

Calculating that: 2 *5.633511=11.267022.

0.5714285714 *5.633511=3.21914914.

So total K=11.267022 +3.21914914=14.486171 GeV.

But wait, the options are all above 18 GeV except option A, which is 18.475 GeV. But that's lower than 14.486 GeV, which is not in the options. So this suggests that the problem is not referring to the kinetic energy, but the total energy.

So perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the correct energy is approximately 20.1197 GeV, which rounds to 20.12 GeV. Among the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

But why is there a discrepancy? Let me think again. Perhaps the problem expects using the exact value of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute 0.96^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=3.5714285714.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using beta=0.96, so gamma= 3.5714285714.

So I think the correct approach is to compute E=gamma * m c² =20.1197 GeV. So the closest option is C:20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the exact rest mass energy using the exact mass of Li-6, which is 6.0151 atomic mass units.

So 6.0151 u =6.0151 *1.66053906660e-27 kg = approximately 9.9891e-27 kg.

Then, m c² =9.9891e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 =9.9891e-27 *9e16 =8.99019e-10 J.

Convert to GeV: 8.99019e-10 J / (1.602176634e-10 J/GeV) =5.61 GeV.

So E=gamma *5.61 =3.5714285714 *5.61 =20.036 GeV.

Again, this is close to option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the atomic mass.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01512379 atomic mass units. So let's compute that.

m_0 c² =6.01512379 u * c².

1 u =1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m_0 c² =6.01512379 *1.66053906660e-27 kg * (3e8)^2.

Compute:

6.01512379 *1.66053906660e-27 = 6 *1.660539... is 9.9632344e-27, plus 0.01512379 *1.660539e-27 = approximately 2.503e-29.

So total m_0 =9.9632344e-27 + 2.503e-29 =9.988264e-27 kg.

Then, m_0 c² =9.988264e-27 kg * (9e16 m²/s²) =8.9894376e-10 J.

Convert to GeV: 8.9894376e-10 J / 1.602176634e-10 J/GeV =5.61 GeV.

So E =3.5714285714 *5.61 =20.0357 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options match exactly. So perhaps the problem expects an approximate answer, and the closest option is C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I should compute the exact value using precise constants.

Let me compute gamma and m c² precisely.

Gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =3.5714285714.

m_0 c² using exact Li-6 mass:6.01512379 u * c².

1 u =1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m_0 c² =6.01512379 *1.66053906660e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Compute:

6.01512379 *1.66053906660e-27 =6.01512379 *1.66053906660e-27.

Let me compute 6 *1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632344e-27.

0.01512379 *1.66053906660e-27 = 0.01512379 *1.66053906660e-27 ≈2.503e-29.

Total m_0 =9.9632344e-27 + 2.503e-29 =9.988264e-27 kg.

Then, m_0 c² =9.988264e-27 *9e16 =8.9894376e-10 J.

Convert to GeV:8.9894376e-10 J /1.602176634e-10 J/GeV =5.61 GeV.

E=gamma * m_0 c² =3.5714285714 *5.61 =20.0357 GeV.

Hmm, still not matching exactly.

Wait, perhaps it's time to look at the options again. The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So option C is 20.132, which is about 0.1 GeV higher than our calculated 20.0357 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rest mass. Let me check with more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01512379 u. So m_0 c² =6.01512379 u * c².

Using a calculator, 6.01512379 *1.66053906660e-27 kg =?

Calculating 6.01512379 *1.66053906660e-27:

= (6 +0.01512379) *1.66053906660e-27

=6 *1.66053906660e-27 + 0.01512379 *1.66053906660e-27

=9.9632344e-27 + 2.503993e-29

=9.98827433e-27 kg.

Then, m_0 c² =9.98827433e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Which is 9.98827433e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² =8.989446897e-10 J.

Convert to GeV:

8.989446897e-10 J /1.602176634e-10 J/GeV = 5.61 GeV.

E=gamma *5.61 GeV =3.5714285714 *5.61.

Calculating 3.5714285714 *5.61:

Let me compute 3 *5.61=16.83.

0.5714285714 *5.61 =3.21914914.

Total E=20.0491 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5.61 *3.5714285714 precisely.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

3.5714285714 ×5.61.

=3 ×5.61 =16.83.

0.5714285714 ×5.61.

Let me compute:

5.61 ×0.5 =2.805.

5.61 ×0.0714285714 = approx 0.402393642.

Sum:2.805 +0.402393642 =3.207393642.

Total E=16.83 +3.207393642 =20.037393642 GeV.

So approximately 20.0374 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects using the rest mass as 6 u, leading to m c²=6 *931.5 MeV (since 1 u ≈931.5 MeV/c²).

So 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

Then E=3.5714285714 *5.589=?

3.5714285714 *5.589.

3*5.589=16.767.

0.5714285714 *5.589 ≈3.203.

Total E=16.767 +3.203=19.97 GeV.

Hmm, closer to 20 GeV, but not matching any option exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use beta =0.96 and compute gamma as 3.5714, and rest mass as 6 u leading to m c²=5.589 GeV.

E=3.5714 *5.589=20.03 GeV.

Still, this is about 20.03 GeV, but the option C is 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a different approach, like calculating the kinetic energy as a percentage of the total energy.

Wait, but I think I'm going in circles here. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 20.12 GeV, which is closest to option C:20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation, and the actual rest mass energy is higher. Let me check another approach.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is charged, and I should account for the charge. No, the charge doesn't affect the mass significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the mass of the entire atom, including electrons. But Li-6 has three electrons, each about 0.511 MeV. So adding 3 *0.511=1.533 MeV, which is negligible compared to GeV scales.

So, I think I've done all the calculations correctly, and the answer should be approximately 20.12 GeV, which aligns with option C:20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy \( E \) of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 c^2 \) is the rest mass energy of the nucleus, and \( v = 0.96c \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed \( v = 0.96c \), so:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number \( A = 6 \). The rest mass energy of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is approximately:

- Proton: \( 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
- Neutron: \( 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)

For Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass energy is:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 3 \cdot 938.272 + 3 \cdot 939.565 = 3 \cdot (938.272 + 939.565) = 3 \cdot 1877.837 \, \text{MeV} = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m_0 c^2 = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \cdot 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3 \cdot 5.633511 = 16.900533, \quad 0.5714 \cdot 5.633511 \approx 3.219149.
\]

Adding these together:

\[
E = 16.900533 + 3.219149 \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy \( E \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \) is closest to option **C: 20.132 GeV**. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding or slight differences in the assumed rest mass values.

### Final Answer
The energy of the RHIC required for the Li-6 nucleus to reach a speed of \( 0.96c \) is approximately **20.132 GeV**.

**Answer: C**
