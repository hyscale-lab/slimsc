Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem is about a star whose surface is partially covered by dark spots. When the star doesn't have spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and when 40% of its surface is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without vs. with spots.

Hmm. I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels in a star's atmosphere is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem mentions that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Angstroms. That's in the far UV, right? Because 1448 Å is about 0.1448 nm, which is in the extreme ultraviolet or maybe even X-ray range. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Oh, wait, probably it's used to calculate the energy difference between the two levels.

So first, I think I need to calculate the energy difference E between level 2 and level 1. The energy of a photon is E = hc/lambda, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and lambda is wavelength.

Let me note down the constants:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
1 Angstrom = 1e-10 m, so 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = hc/(lambda)
E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7)
Let me compute that. 

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Wait, but for the Boltzmann factor, we usually use energy in terms of eV or k*T in eV. Maybe I should convert E to eV because k (Boltzmann constant) is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So E in eV: 1.372e-18 J * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) = approx 8.56 eV.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So 1.372e-18 J is (1.372e-18)/(1.6e-19) ≈ 8.575 eV. Yeah, that seems right.

So E = 8.575 eV. But wait, E is the energy difference between the two levels, so E2 - E1 = 8.575 eV. That's a big difference, but perhaps that's correct for a transition in the far UV.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. That would be the photon emitted when an electron falls from level 2 to level 1, so E = E2 - E1 = hc/lambda.

But in the Boltzmann equation, what matters is the ratio of the number of atoms in the two states, n2 and n1. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So the ratio is proportional to exp( - E / (k T) ), where E is the energy difference.

Wait, no, wait: the exponent is negative (E2-E1)/(k T), so if E2 > E1, then higher energy level is level 2. So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n2/n1 increases. But in this problem, when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't have spots (6000 K). So when the star has spots, the photosphere is cooler.

So the ratio n2/n1 is (g2/g1) exp( - E/(k T) )

Without spots, T is 6000 K. With spots, T is 5500 K. So at lower T, the exponential term is smaller because E/(k T) is larger, so the exponent is more negative. So exp(-x) is smaller when x is larger. So n2/n1 will be smaller when T is lower. Hence, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Which matches the problem statement.

So the ratio without spots (T=6000 K) is (g2/g1) exp(-E/(k*6000)), and with spots (T=5500 K) is (g2/g1) exp(-E/(k*5500)). So the factor by which the ratio changes is [n2/n1 without] / [n2/n1 with] = [exp(-E/(k*6000))]/[exp(-E/(k*5500))] = exp( E/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Wait, let me compute that.

So:

Factor = exp( (E) / (k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Wait, no:

Wait, the exponent in the ratio when without is exp( -E/(k T) ), and when with is exp( -E/(k T') ), so the ratio (without/with) is exp( [ -E/(k T) + E/(k T') ] )

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ratio without spots is R1 = exp( - E/(k*T1) ), and with spots R2 = exp( - E/(k*T2) ), where T1=6000, T2=5500.

So the ratio R1/R2 = exp( - E/(k T1) ) / exp( - E/(k T2) ) ) = exp( E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because:

exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a-b)

So a = -E/(k T1)
b = -E/(k T2)
a - b = (-E/(k T1)) - (-E/(k T2)) ) = E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So the factor is exp( E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, substituting the numbers:

E = 8.575 eV.

k is Boltzmann's constant in eV/K. So k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

Wait, but E is in eV, so let me compute E/(k) first.

E/(k) = 8.575 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.575 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approx 100,000 K? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 8.575 divided by 8.617e-5 is 8.575 / 8.617e-5 = let's compute that.

8.575 / 8.617e-5 = (8.575 / 8.617) * 1e5 ≈ (approx 0.995) * 1e5 ≈ 99,500 K.

Wait, that's a huge number. So E/(k) ≈ ~1e5 K.

Wait, but that makes sense because E in eV is a measure of energy, and k*T for typical stellar temperatures (like 6000 K) is about 0.0086 eV (since k=8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K ≈ 0.517 eV? Wait, wait, no: k*T where T=6000 K is 8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K = 0.517 eV. So E=8.575 eV is about 16 times higher than k*T. So E/(k T) ≈ 16. So at T=6000 K, exp(-E/(k T)) is exp(-16), which is a very small number, like 1.1e-7. So n2/n1 is tiny, meaning most atoms are in the lower level.

But back to the factor. So the factor is exp( (E/(k)) * (1/T2 -1/T1) )

Plugging in the numbers:

E/(k) = 8.575 eV / 8.617e-5 eV/K ≈ 8.575 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 100,000 K? Wait, 8.575 / 8.617e-5 equals approximately 99,516 K.

Wait, 8.575 / 8.617e-5 = 8.575 / (0.00008617) = approximately 99,500 K.

So E/(k) ≈ 99,500 K.

So (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^(-1).

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000≈1.667e-4. So the difference is 1.51e-5 K^-1.

So the exponent is 99,500 * 1.51e-5 ≈ (99,500 * 1.51e-5) ≈ (99,500 * 0.0000151) ≈ let's compute that.

99,500 * 0.0000151 = 99,500 * 1.51e-5.

99,500 * 1.51e-5 = (99,500 * 1.51 ) * 1e-5.

99,500 *1.51 = calculate: 99,500 *1 =99,500; 99,500 *0.5=49,750; so 99,500 +49,750=149,250. So 149,250 *1e-5 = 1.4925.

So the exponent is approximately 1.4925.

So the factor is exp(1.4925) ≈ e^1.4925 ≈ let's compute that.

e^1 is 2.718, e^1.4 is about 4.055, e^1.5 is about 4.4817. 1.4925 is just a bit less than 1.5, so perhaps around 4.45 or so.

Wait, let me compute e^1.4925 more accurately.

I know that ln(4.45) is approximately 1.4923, so e^1.4923 is about 4.45. So the factor is approximately 4.45.

Wait, but wait: the problem states that the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. The factor is R_without / R_with = exp(1.4925) ≈4.45.

Which would mean that the ratio without spots is about 4.45 times larger than when it has spots. So the factor is about 4.45. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer is C.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the exponent right? Let me double-check.

Wait, the factor is exp( (E/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, T1 is 6000 K (no spots), T2 is 5500 K (with spots). So 1/T2 is 1/5500, which is bigger than 1/6000. So (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive. So the exponent is positive: (E/k) * positive. So the factor is exp(positive) = greater than 1. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots, which matches the problem statement.

So the factor is about e^1.4925 ≈4.45, so option C is ~4.5, which is the correct answer.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(E\) is the energy difference between the two levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The problem provides the following information:

- When the star does not have spots, \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\).
- When the star has spots, \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\).
- The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\), so the energy difference is calculated as:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Substituting these values:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting \(E\) to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
E \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.575 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The ratio of the populations of the two energy levels is proportional to \(\exp(-E / (kT))\), where \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{E}{k} = \frac{8.575}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,500 \, \text{K},
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(99,500 \times 1.51 \times 10^{-5}\right) \approx \exp(1.4925).
\]

Using \(e^{1.4925} \approx 4.45\), the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.45. This matches option C.
