Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me think through this.

The problem states that the first astronaut has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the second has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The options are about their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, wait. I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them directly like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, I think it's (u + v) when adding, but for relative velocity, it's different. Let me get that right.

Wait, no, the formula for the relative velocity of an object as seen from another frame moving at velocity V is (u - V)/(1 - (uV)/(c²)). Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference of their speeds divided by that factor. But wait, wait a second. Both are moving in the same direction, so the relative velocity of the second astronaut from the first's perspective would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - v1 v2/c²).

So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Wait, no, wait! Wait, the problem says the first is 2m moving at 0.6c, the second is 3m moving at 0.5c. So from the first astronaut's perspective, the second is moving at a relative velocity. So the relative speed would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, wait, no, I think I have it backwards. Because if the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c in the same direction, then from the first's frame, the second is moving slower. So the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The formula is (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/(c²)), where u is the speed of the second object in the first frame, and v is the speed of the first frame relative to the second. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. When you have two objects moving in the same direction, from the perspective of the first object, the second is moving at (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Wait, so v1 is 0.6c (the speed of the first astronaut in lab frame), and v2 is 0.5c (speed of the second astronaut in lab frame). So the relative speed v_rel would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. v2 is 0.5c, v1 is 0.6c. So numerator is 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = -0.142857... c, which is approximately -0.14c. But since speed is a magnitude, it would be 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So that's one part done.

Now for the total energy of the system. Hmm, each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So I need to compute the energy for each and then sum them.

Wait, but wait, the masses are 2m and 3m. So for the first astronaut, mass is 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma for 0.6c is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So the energy E1 is gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 mc². So looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in calculating the relative speed
