Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I think I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. So, let's imagine the structure. It's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to the cyclohexane. Additionally, there's a carbaldehyde group, which is a -CHO. Wait, so the cyclohexane has two substituents? Or maybe the substituent is a group that includes the carbaldehyde?

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the parent chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means the cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde group attached. The substituent is at position 1, which is the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group and another substituent, which is a methyl group attached to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So that substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) attached to the cyclohexane at position 1.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally. So the cyclohexane ring has a -CH2-CHO group attached, but wait, no, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the cyclohexane. So the cyclohexane has a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group at position 1 and a -CHO group as another substituent. Hmm, but wait, maybe the main chain is different. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and that's attached to the cyclohexane. So perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane with a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a -CHO group attached at position 1.

Wait, maybe I should think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond) attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a -C≡C- group? Wait, ethynyl group is a substituent where the triple bond is between two carbons, one attached to the cyclohexane. So it's cyclohexane attached to a -C≡CH group.

So the starting material is cyclohexane with a triple bond (ethynyl) group. Now, the target molecule seems to have a -CHO group and a hydroxyl group attached via a methyl group. So perhaps the ethynyl group is being functionalized in some way.

Let me think about the steps needed to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. The target has a carbonyl group (aldehyde), a hydroxyl group on a methyl, and a cyclohexyl group attached to that methyl.

So maybe the process involves adding functional groups to the triple bond. One common approach with alkynes is to reduce them. Or perhaps to do some kind of addition, like hydration or oxidation.

Looking at the options provided, the reagents in the options are combinations of different reactions. Let's see what each option does.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. Then H2 with Pd is hydrogenation, which would add hydrogen. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or oxidation. H2SO4 and HgSO4 with H2O sounds like a hydration or oxidation reaction, possibly oxymercuration or something else.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li in liquid NH3; O3 and H2O; NH4OH. NaNH2 again, with ethyl chloride as a methylating agent? Wait, ethyl chloride is an ethylating agent. Then Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or deprotonation. O3 is ozone, which is used in ozonolysis to break double bonds. Then NH4OH is ammonium hydroxide, maybe for workup.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2 with Pd-CaCO3 (which is probably a catalyst for hydrogenation); O3 with (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2. So, again, NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Then hydrogenation, then ozonolysis with a reductive workup (since (CH3)2S is a reductive workup agent), and then Ba(OH)2, which could be for elimination or oxidation.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li in liq NH3; O3 with (CH3)2S; NH4OH. NaNH2 with methanol—so perhaps a deprotonation followed by alkylation? Methanol as a methylating agent? Then Li in NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. Ozone again, followed by a reductive workup.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall process. The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is itself attached to the main cyclohexane. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group. So perhaps the starting alkyne is being converted into a diol, then oxidized or functionalized further.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an enol, which can then undergo some aldol addition or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and a methylating agent. NaNH2 is a strong base, which can deprotonate things. Maybe the alkyne is deprotonated, and then methyl chloride acts as an electrophile, adding a methyl group. But wait, alkyne protons are acidic, but in ethynylcyclohexane, the alkyne is probably at a terminal position—so the triple bond is R-C≡CH. Deprotonating with NaNH2 would give R-C≡C- - (a strong base would deprotonate it). Then methyl chloride could provide a methyl group via an SN2 reaction, perhaps forming R-C≡C-CH3? Or maybe adding a methyl group elsewhere.

Wait, wait. Maybe the first step is to alkylate the alkyne. So, ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH) reacts with NaNH2 (a strong base) to deprotonate the terminal alkyne to R-C≡C- -Na+. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the alkyne, giving R-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, wait, maybe it's R-C≡C-CH3. Because the base deprotonates, and then methyl chloride (a good electrophile) would attack, adding a methyl group to the alkyne. So R-C≡C-CH3 would be formed. So that's a propargyl group?

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent or something else. Maybe another possibility is that the alkyne is converted into a ketone or aldehyde via some reaction.

But let's think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) and a hydroxyl group on a methyl attached to another cyclohexane. So perhaps the process involves introducing both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group is being converted into a propargyl alcohol or something similar. Let's think about each option.

Looking at option C's steps again: step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That might add a methyl group to the alkyne. So ethynylcyclohexane would become propargylcyclohexane (R-C≡C-CH3). Then step 2 is hydrogenation with H2 and Pd-calcium carbonate. Hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a metal catalyst would typically hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So R-C≡C-CH3 would become R-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would typically yield a single bond, but I think it would add two hydrogens across the triple bond. Wait, wait, no. Hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically reduce it to a cis-alkene if it's Lindlar's catalyst, but without that, it would hydrogenate all the way to a single bond. So R-C≡C-CH3 would become R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a single bond between the two carbons.

Wait, but wait, R is the cyclohexane ring. So R-C≡C-CH3 becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be. Because the triple bond is R-C≡C-CH3, so hydrogenation would add two H's to each carbon, turning it into R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the propargyl group becomes a propyl group. Then, what's next? Step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But if the previous step had hydrogenated the triple bond to a single bond, then there is no double bond. So that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond was hydrogenated to a double bond in step 2? Wait, no, because without a catalyst like Lindlar's, Pd would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, not an alkene. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation and alkylation to form an alkyne with a substituent, then hydrogenation to form a trans or cis double bond, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the first reagent, NaNH2, is used for deprotonation to form a strong base, which then reacts with an alkyl halide to add a group.

Wait, maybe I should think about each option and what each step does.

Let's look at option C again:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: So this would deprotonate the ethynyl group (since alkyne protons are acidic) to form a sodium acetylide. Then, methyl chloride would methylate it, adding a methyl group to the alkyne. So R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate: This would hydrogenate the triple bond. Since it's using H2 and a metal catalyst, the alkyne would be hydrogenated to a single bond. So R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozone with (CH3)2S: Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds. But if in step 2 we had a single bond, there's no double bond to cleave. So that doesn't make sense. So perhaps this option is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in step 2. What if step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, forming a double bond?

Wait, but H2 and Pd usually hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. But if the catalyst is Lindlar's (which is poisoned), it would hydrogenate to cis double bonds. But in the options, it's just H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which I think is for full hydrogenation. So maybe step 3 in option C is not applicable, which makes this option unlikely.

Let me check option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: So NaNH2 is a strong base. Reacting ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide. Then, methanol would perhaps methylate the acetylide? Wait, but methanol is a poor electrophile. Wait, maybe the reaction here is different. Alternatively, perhaps methanol is used as a proton source after deprotonation. Or maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction. Hmm, I'm not sure.

2. Li in liquid NH3: That's a strong base, typically used for elimination reactions or deprotonation. So perhaps this step is for deprotonating something else, maybe forming a stronger base.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So if in a previous step a double bond was formed, this would break it into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: Ammonium hydroxide, perhaps for workup, like hydrolysis.

Alternatively, maybe the steps are: alkyne -> some diene -> ozonolysis, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the target molecule.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a -CHO group. So it's possible that the starting alkyne is converted into a diol, then oxidized or functionalized.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first converted into an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then subjected to some other reactions.

Another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps a substitution reaction occurred, introducing a hydroxyl group on a methyl attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then into a carbonyl group via oxidation, and then some kind of addition occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to a Grignard reaction. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about each reagent step by step.

The first step in all options is NaNH2 and a methylating agent or methanol. So NaNH2 is a strong base, used to deprotonate acidic protons. The ethynyl group (sp-hybridized) has protons that are acidic (pKa around 25), so NaNH2 would deprotonate it. Then, the resulting acetylide would react with an alkyl halide (like methyl chloride) in an alkylation, adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

So, ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH) becomes R-C≡C-CH3 after step 1 in options A, C, and D. Option B uses ethyl chloride, so R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Wait, so in option D, step 1 is with methanol. So after deprotonation, the acetylide (R-C≡C-) would react with methanol. But methanol isn't a good methylating agent; maybe it's for something else, like forming an ether? Or perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol, giving R-C≡C-OCH3. But that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

But assuming that step 1 adds a methyl group to the alkyne, let's proceed.

So, step 1: R-C≡C-CH3.

Next, step 2 in option C is H2/Pd. So hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond. So R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would require a double bond, but there's none. So that's a problem.

In option B, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, might cause elimination. If the molecule after step 1 is R-C≡C-CH2CH3 (from ethyl chloride), then Li/NH3 would abstract a proton, perhaps leading to an elimination, forming a double bond. So R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-C≡C-CH2CH2Li? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Li in NH3 would deprotonate the ethyl group and cause elimination, forming a double bond. So maybe R-C≡C-CH2CH2Li would lose a proton and form R-C≡C-CH=CH2. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne after step 1 is R-C≡C-CH3, and step 2 is Li/NH3. Which is a strong base, maybe causing deprotonation and elimination. So R-C≡C-CH3 → R-C≡C-CH2Li, which then eliminates to form a triple bond again? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe step 2 in option B is a deprotonation and elimination to form a longer alkyne. But I'm not confident.

Option A's step 2 is H2/Pd. So that would hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond. So R-C≡C-CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. If we have R-CH2-CH2-CH3, Ba(OH)2 would induce elimination to form a double bond, but that requires adjacent H's and a good leaving group, which isn't present here. So that might not work.

Option D's step 2 is Li in liq NH3. So, after adding a methyl group in step 1, perhaps Li in NH3 would deprotonate a proton adjacent to the alkyne, leading to elimination and forming a double bond. So R-C≡C-CH3 → R-C≡C-CH2Li, but without a leaving group, elimination might not occur. Alternatively, maybe the Li would abstract a proton from the cyclohexane ring, leading to a more substituted double bond when elimination happens. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: looking for the formation of a carbonyl group (aldehyde) in the target. So perhaps one of the steps involves oxidation of an alcohol to a carbonyl.

So, perhaps in the process, the alkyne is converted into an alcohol, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Let me think about this. If the alkyne is converted into an enol, then oxidized. Alternatively, if the alkyne is converted into a diol, then one of the diol groups is oxidized.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a cis-diol via hydration (using HgSO4 and H2SO4), which is step 3 in option A. But option A's step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the problem.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group (aldehyde) and another substituent which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. Let me think about possible reactions.

One way to convert an alkyne to a carbonyl is via oxidation. Ozonolysis of an alkyne can produce diketones, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the alkyne could be reduced to a cis-alkene and then oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then oxidized to a ketone, but that wouldn't directly give an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the possible steps again.

Step 1 in all options involves NaNH2, which deprotonates the alkyne. Then, a methylating agent (like methyl chloride) adds a methyl group, making R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2 varies. It could be another alkylation, hydrogenation, or elimination.

Then, in some options, there's ozonolysis, which suggests breaking double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the process is as follows:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate with NaNH2 → acetylide.
2. Alkylation with methyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH3.
3. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a trans-alkene (if using Lindlar's catalyst) or a cis-alkene (using another catalyst), but without, it becomes an alkane.
Wait, but without a catalyst, H2 and Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Hmm, but then how do we get a double bond for ozonolysis?

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a diene via some reaction.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the target has two substituents on the cyclohexane. So maybe the alkyne is converted into a diol, which then undergoes some kind of substitution or oxidation.

Wait, think about the target's structure again. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxymethyl) group attached to the cyclohexane, along with a -CHO group. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a hydroxymethyl group, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps after the alkyne is functionalized, it's converted into an alcohol, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrolyzed to a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexane ring with substituents. Maybe the alkyne is used to form a side chain that then undergoes ring-opening or some other reaction.

But perhaps I should look at each option again.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. Li in NH3 → strong base, perhaps elimination to form a double bond.
So R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-C≡C-CH=CH2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Li abstracts a proton, leading to a more substituted double bond.

Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So if after step 2, we have R-C≡C-CH=CH2, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. But wait, ozonolysis of a diene would produce multiple carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is now a diene.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit lost. Let me think of each option's steps and see which one logically leads to the target.

Option C's steps:

1. R-C≡C-CH3.
2. Hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Ozonolysis: but no double bond, so nothing to cleave. So maybe this isn't the right path.

Option D:

1. R-C≡C-CH3 (after step 1 with methanol; wait, earlier I was unsure about this step).
2. Li in NH3: strong base, perhaps deprotonating somewhere else.
3. Ozonolysis: again, requires a double bond, which I don't see yet.

Option A:

1. R-C≡C-CH3.
2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Ba(OH)2: strong base, perhaps elimination.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: mercuric sulfate and sulfuric acid, which is used in oxidation reactions, perhaps like the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, but where would the Ba(OH)2 lead here? After step 2, we have R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination, but without a good leaving group, I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is forming an epoxide, but that requires a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the process is different. Maybe the alkyne is converted into a diol first, then further functionalized.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a cis-diol via hydration. So R-C≡C-CH3 → R-C(OH)2-CH3. Then, perhaps oxidation of the diol to a carbonyl.

But I'm not seeing that process in the options. Let me check the options again.

Option B's steps after step 1 would be: ethyl chloride gives R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2 is Li in NH3, which could deprotonate and cause elimination, forming a double bond. So R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-C≡C-CH=CH2? Or perhaps the triple bond is converted into a double bond. Wait, no. Li in NH3 is a strong base, but I'm not sure about its reaction with alkynes.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is deprotonated, leading to an alkyne with a lithium species, which then reacts further.

This is getting a bit complicated. Perhaps I should think about the possible products of each option.

Looking for the target, which has both a cyclohexane ring and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. So perhaps the alkyne is used to form a side chain that is then functionalized to introduce the hydroxymethyl and aldehyde groups.

Wait, perhaps the process is as follows:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to form R-C≡C-CH3.
2. Then, the alkyne is hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Ozonolysis of a double bond (but where?), but maybe the hydrogenation was partial to form a double bond.

Wait, maybe in option C, step 2 is a partial hydrogenation. But I thought H2/Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. For example, using O3 to cleave a triple bond into two carbonyls. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, another thought: the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via oxidation. For example, using O3 followed by a reductive workup. But that might not directly give a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrolyzed to a ketone. For example, oxidative cleavage of an alkyne with O3 would give two carboxylic acids or ketones, depending on substitution.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group, not a ketone. So perhaps one of the carbonyls is an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

But I'm not sure how that would fit into the reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, then one of the diols is oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option C again.

Step 1: R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So that can't be right.

In option B, step 3 is O3 and H2O, then NH4OH. So if step 2 forms a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it. But where would the double bond come from?

Wait, maybe step 2 in option B is elimination to form a double bond. So R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-C≡C-CH=CH2 via elimination.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. So R-C≡C-CH=CH2 → after ozonolysis, perhaps R-C≡C-CHO and another aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls, but the triple bond is still there.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for the sequence of reagents that could introduce both the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct pathway is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to form R-C≡C-CH3.
2. Hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Ozonolysis to break the molecule into fragments with carbonyl groups.
4. Workup to form the desired groups.

But I'm not seeing how that would lead to the target structure.

Another possibility: The alkyne is converted into a diol (R-CH2-C(OH)H-CH3), then subjected to oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but that would require a diol formation step, which I don't see in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-diol, then oxidized.

Wait, but the reagents in the options don't seem to include a diol formation step.

Wait, let me think about the target's structure again. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxymethyl) group attached to the cyclohexane. So it's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)methyl group attached to the main cyclohexane. So perhaps the alkyne is used to form a side chain that then undergoes a substitution reaction to introduce the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, which then reacts with something else.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of each option's possible outcome.

Option C:

1. R-C≡C-CH3.
2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. O3 with (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing happens. So this option is unlikely.

Option B:

1. R-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. Li in NH3 → maybe elimination to form a double bond: R-C≡C-CH=CH2.
3. O3 → cleaves the double bond into R-C≡C-CHO and another aldehyde.
4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps neutralizing any acidic groups.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So I'm not sure how this would form.

Option D:

1. R-C≡C-CH3.
2. Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination to form R-C≡C-CH2Li, but without a leaving group, elimination might not occur. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.
3. O3 → but again, no double bond, so nothing.
4. NH4OH → perhaps hydrolysis.

Hmm. I'm not seeing it.

Option A:

1. R-C≡C-CH3.
2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Ba(OH)2 → strong base; maybe elimination. But without adjacent leaving groups, elimination is unlikely. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used for epoxidation, but that requires a double bond.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → this is a typical setup for oxidation, perhaps of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, R-CH2-CH2-CH3, step 3 with Ba(OH)2 doesn't do much. Then step 4 is oxidation, but without an alcohol, that wouldn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to R-C≡C-CH3.
2. Hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Oxidized to introduce a carbonyl group.
But wait, R-CH2-CH2-CH3 is a propane chain attached to the cyclohexane. Oxidation of propane chains typically doesn't form carbonyls unless there's a functional group to oxidize.

Wait, perhaps the chain is longer, and oxidation can occur at a certain position.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol first, then oxidized.

But the options don't seem to include a diol formation step.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane with a substituent that includes a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. So perhaps the alkyne is used to form a bridge between two cyclohexane rings.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a geminal diol, which then undergoes a ring-forming reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, but that requires a double bond.

I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should consider the answer based on the most plausible reagent sequence.

Looking at the target, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne is alkylated.
2. Hydrogenated to a cis-alkene (using Lindlar's catalyst?).
3. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. Workup to form the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups.

So which option includes this sequence?

Looking at option C:

1. Alkylation to R-C≡C-CH3.
2. Hydrogenation to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But without a double bond, ozonolysis wouldn't work.
So perhaps this is not the right option.

Option B:

1. Alkylation with ethyl chloride to R-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. Li/NH3: perhaps elimination to form a double bond → R-C≡C-CH=CH2.
3. Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls. So R-C≡C-CHO and another aldehyde.
But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which doesn't directly come from this.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps all the steps in option C:

1. Alkylation → R-C≡C-CH3.
2. Hydrogenation → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Ozonolysis → but no double bond, so nothing. So this can't be right.

Option D:

1. Alkylation with methanol → if step 1 is deprotonation and then methanol provides a methyl group, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.
2. Li/NH3 → maybe elimination to form a double bond.
3. Ozonolysis → cleaves into carbonyls.
4. NH4OH → workup.

But without knowing exactly what each step does, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing how. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule is formed via the following steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to form a propargyl group (R-C≡C-CH3).
2. This is then hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Ozonolysis isn't applicable here, so perhaps that's followed by another oxidation step to form a carbonyl.

But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via oxidation. Ozonolysis is used for breaking double bonds, but perhaps in some cases, it can cleave triple bonds as well, though I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a cis-diol via hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4. Then, one of the diol's OH groups is oxidized to a carbonyl group, forming a ketone or aldehyde.

But looking at the options, I don't see a step that includes HgSO4 and H2SO4 except option A's step 4. Let me check option A.

Option A:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH3.
2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Ba(OH)2 → strong base. Maybe dehydrogenation or elimination.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxidation.

So, after step 2, we have R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Step 3 is Ba(OH)2, perhaps for elimination. But without a good leaving group, elimination might not occur. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 may induce some kind of ring formation or other reaction.

Step 4: H2SO4 and HgSO4, H2O. This is a typical setup for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation or for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones, but without an alcohol, not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 3 is forming an epoxide, but that requires a double bond, which isn't present.

Alternatively, maybe step 4 is for oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone, but where would the alcohol come from?

Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think about why.

Option C's steps:

1. Alkylation → R-C≡C-CH3.
2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. O3 with (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing.
4. Ba(OH)2 → base.

This doesn't make sense, so perhaps option C isn't the answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated.
2. Hydrogenated to a double bond (using a different catalyst, but in the options, it's H2/Pd which may not do that).
3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyls.
4. Workup to form aldehyde and hydroxymethyl.

But none of the options have that exact sequence.

Wait, looking back, perhaps option C's step 3 uses O3 with (CH3)2S as a reductive workup. So, if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it.

But how would step 2 produce a double bond?

Oh, wait! Maybe step 2 is not a full hydrogenation but a catalytic hydrogenation that stops at the double bond. But I thought that without a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's, H2 and Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene using H2 and Lindlar's catalyst (which isn't mentioned in the options). But the options don't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkyne with a longer chain, then hydrogenated to a double bond.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the alkylation step introduces a methyl group, which is then functionalized to form the hydroxymethyl group.

So, step 1: R-C≡C-CH3.
Step 2: Hydrogenate to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
Step 3: Ozonolysis → nothing as there's no double bond.
Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to R-C≡C-CH3.
2. Hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Oxidized to form an aldehyde at one end and a hydroxymethyl group at the other.

But I don't see how that would work.

I think I've spent a lot of time thinking, but I'm not entirely certain. Based on the options, I'll have to make an educated guess.

I think the correct answer is option C. Here's why:

After alkylation (step 1), the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3. Step 2 hydrogenates it to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Step 3's ozonolysis doesn't do anything, which is a problem. So maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct. Step 1: deprotonate and methylate to R-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: Li in NH3 abstracts a proton, causing elimination to form a double bond, R-C≡C-CH2-CH2Li → R-C≡C-CH=CH2. Then step 3: ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into two aldehydes. Then step 4: NH4OH workup.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps one of the aldehydes is further functionalized to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, but I'm not seeing how that would happen.

Another possibility: the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But without the appropriate reagents for that, it's unclear.

I think I'll go with option C as the answer, though I'm not entirely confident. But wait, let me think again.

Option C's steps:

1. Alkylation → R-C≡C-CH3.
2. Hydrogenation → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Ozonolysis → nothing.
4. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination, but without a leaving group, nothing happens.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxidation, then the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Option A:

1. Alkylation → R-C≡C-CH3.
2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Ba(OH)2 → strong base, perhaps for elimination.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxidation.

Wait, after step 2, we have R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Step 3 could be dehydrogenation to form a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could induce some kind of elimination, but without adjacent H's and a leaving group, I don't think that's possible.

So I'm really not sure. I think I'll have to make a guess based on elimination.

Wait, the target has a hydroxymethyl group, which suggests an alcohol. So perhaps one of the steps introduces an alcohol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Looking at the options, which one includes an oxidation step after introducing an alcohol?

Option A's step 4 could be oxidation. So if step 3 introduces an alcohol, step 4 oxidizes it.

But how would step 3 introduce an alcohol? Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, not an oxidizing agent.

Hmm.

I think the correct answer is option C. But I'm not very confident.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the analysis of the options involves understanding the sequence of reactions and how they transform the starting material into the target molecule. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. The key steps likely involve alkylation, hydrogenation, and functionalization to introduce the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it to form R-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but without a leaving group or adjacent hydrogens, elimination is unlikely.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Oxidation, but no clear intermediate alcohol or other functional group to oxidize.

This sequence does not lead to the desired product, as ozonolysis is missing, and the steps do not introduce the hydroxymethyl group.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne to form R-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, potentially causing elimination to form a double bond, yielding R-C≡C-CH=CH₂.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, producing carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup.

While ozonolysis could introduce carbonyl groups, this sequence does not clearly explain the formation of the hydroxymethyl group or the cyclohexyl substitution.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne to form R-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after hydrogenation, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but no clear reaction pathway for forming the hydroxymethyl group.

This sequence fails to produce the target molecule due to the lack of a double bond for ozonolysis and the absence of steps to introduce the hydroxymethyl group.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne, but methanol is a poor methylating agent, making this step unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, potentially causing elimination or deprotonation.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not clearly formed in previous steps.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup.

This sequence is ambiguous and does not provide a clear pathway to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating all options, none of the sequences perfectly aligns with the steps required to synthesize the target molecule. However, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible despite its shortcomings, as it includes steps that partially align with the transformations needed, even though the sequence is incomplete or unclear in certain steps.
