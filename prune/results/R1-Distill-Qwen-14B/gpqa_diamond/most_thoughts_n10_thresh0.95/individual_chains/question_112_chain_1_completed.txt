Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

The options given are A to D with different probability pairs and average values.

Hmm. Okay, so first, let me break down the problem.

First part: The given state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I think I need to normalize this state to find the actual coefficients because the problem says it's proportional, not equal. So the state is not normalized yet; I'll have to find the normalization factor.

Second part: Find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of operator A. The matrix of A is given. Let me write that matrix out.

The matrix A is a 2x2 matrix because it's dealing with spin states (up and down). The diagonal elements are zero (since A_ij is hbar/2 only when i≠j, and zero otherwise). So it's a 2x2 matrix where the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2 and the diagonal are zero.

Wait, no. Wait, A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, the elements are:

A = [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

So that's a matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

Wait, but this is the matrix of the operator A in the computational basis (|up>, |down>), right? Because the eigenstates of the z-projection are |up> and |down>.

But the problem says that the operator has eigenstates, and I need to find the probabilities of measuring in those eigenstates. So perhaps I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator A.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. It says, "the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij..." So the operator has matrix A in the basis of |up> and |down>. So the eigenstates are the eigenvectors of matrix A.

So my plan is:

1. Normalize the given state |alpha>.
2. Find the eigenstates (eigenvectors) of operator A.
3. Express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.
4. The probabilities will be the squares of the coefficients of each eigenstate in this expansion.
5. Compute the average value of operator A, which is the expectation value of A in state |alpha>.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since the operator A is given by matrix A, the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Yes, that could be another approach. So perhaps I can compute the expectation value directly without finding the eigenstates.

Wait, but the question also asks for the probability of measuring each eigenstate. So I think I need to express |alpha> as a linear combination of the eigenstates of A, and then the coefficients' squares give the probabilities.

Alternatively, if I can find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of A, then I can change the basis of |alpha> to those eigenstates and find the probabilities.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, normalize the state |alpha>.

The state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

So, compute the norm squared:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
|2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So alpha is (1+i, 2-i) divided by sqrt(7).

Next, find the eigenstates of operator A.

The operator A in matrix form is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

So A = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

To find the eigenvalues, compute the characteristic equation det(A - λI )=0.

Which is |( -λ   ħ/2 )
         ( ħ/2  -λ ) |

The determinant is (λ^2) - (ħ^2/4) = 0.

So λ^2 = (ħ^2/4), so λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Now, find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I ) v = 0

Which gives:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [v1]   = 0
[ ħ/2   -ħ/2 ] [v2]

So the equations are:

(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). To make it a unit vector, it's (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

(A + (ħ/2) I ) v =0.

Which gives:

[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [v1] =0
[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [v2]

Equation: (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = -v2.

So eigenvector is (1, -1), normalized to (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait no, wait a second. Let me write the eigenvectors as column vectors. For λ= ħ/2, the eigenvector is (1,1)^T, and for λ= -ħ/2, it's (1, -1)^T.

So, the eigenstates are:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, wait, actually, in the standard basis, |up> is [1; 0], |down> is [0;1].

So the eigenstates are:

For λ= ħ/2, the eigenvector is (1,1)^T, so |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

For λ= -ħ/2, the eigenvector is (1, -1)^T, so |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but in any case, the next step is to express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

So, let me compute the coefficients c_+ and c_- such that |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Compute c_+ = < + | alpha >.

Similarly, c_- = < - | alpha >.

Because the eigenstates are orthonormal, the coefficients are given by the inner products.

Let me compute c_+.

c_+ = < + | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)), (1/sqrt(2)) ]  [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Multiplying these:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Factor out 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)):

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(14) )

Simplify numerator:

1 + i + 2 - i = 3.

So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute c_- = < - | alpha >.

The eigenstate |-> is (1, -1)/sqrt(2). So its bra is [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)].

So:

c_- = [1/sqrt(2)]*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + [-1/sqrt(2)]*(2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Factor out 1/(sqrt(14)):

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)

Simplify numerator:

1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Now, the probability of measuring + is |c_+|^2, and the probability of measuring - is |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3^2)/(14) ) =9/14 ≈0.642857.

Compute |c_-|^2: [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, wait, let's double-check.

Wait, |c_- |^2 is [ ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14) ] multiplied by its conjugate, which is ( -1 -2i ) / sqrt(14).

So |c_-|^2 = [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-2i) + (2i)(-1) + (2i)(-2i) ] /14.

Wait, no, more accurately, |a + bi|^2 = a² + b².

Wait, let me compute ( -1 + 2i ) * ( -1 -2i ) = (-1)^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - (-4) = 5.

So |c_-|^2 = 5/(14).

So probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36. That would be approximately matching these fractions.

But wait, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857..., which rounds to 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places. So option A is a candidate.

Now, the average value of the operator A is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is the operator whose eigenstates are |+> and |->, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2, the expectation value is |c_+|^2 * (ħ/2) + |c_-|^2 * ( - ħ/2 ). Because when you measure in |+>, you get ħ/2, and in |->, you get -ħ/2.

Wait, that's correct. Because expectation value is sum (prob_i * eigenvalue_i).

So:

<A> = (9/14)( ħ/2 ) + (5/14)( - ħ/2 )

= [ (9 -5) * ħ/2 ] /14

= (4 * ħ/2 ) /14

= (2 ħ ) /14.

= ħ/7.

So the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A's average is ħ/7. So that would make option A correct.

Wait, but let me compute <A> directly to cross-verify.

Because I can compute it as the standard expectation value:

<A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], and |alpha> is (1+i, 2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Compute A |alpha>:

A |alpha> is:

[ 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7),
  (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Which simplifies to:

[ (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate of |alpha> dotted with A|alpha>.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= (1 -i)(2 -i) (ħ/(2*7)) + (2 +i)(1 +i) (ħ/(2*7)).

Compute each term:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i * 2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2=-1)
= 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i + i*1 + i^2
= 2 +3i -1
=1 +3i.

So putting it all together:

[ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ] * (ħ/(14) )

= (2) * (ħ/(14)) )

= ħ/(7).

Which matches the earlier calculation. So the average is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.357 (≈0.36), and the average is ħ/7. So the correct option is A: 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7.


To solve the problem, we proceed as follows:

### 1. Normalize the given state
The state is given as proportional to \( | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, we calculate the norm squared:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]

The total norm squared is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### 2. Eigenstates and eigenvalues of operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenstates and eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \):

\[
\det \begin{bmatrix}
-\lambda & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & -\lambda
\end{bmatrix} = \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 = 0.
\]

The eigenvalues are \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenvectors are:

- For \( \lambda = \frac{\hbar}{2} \): \( |+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \),
- For \( \lambda = -\frac{\hbar}{2} \): \( |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \).

### 3. Express \( | \alpha \rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
The coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) are calculated as:

\[
c_+ = \langle + | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]

\[
c_- = \langle - | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are:

\[
P(+\rangle) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\rangle) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### 4. Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_-|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
