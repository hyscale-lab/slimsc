Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star doesn't have spots, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes—when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels is about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is assumed to be in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Hmm. Okay, so I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation and how the population of energy levels changes with temperature. Because when the temperature changes, the ratio of atoms in different energy levels changes according to the Boltzmann factor.

So, the Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(kT)). Here, g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, when the star isn't spotted, the Teff is 6000 K. When it is spotted, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But wait, the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, right? But the question says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So, the overall blackbody emission is at a lower temperature.

But wait, the star's surface isn't uniformly at 5500 K when it has spots. Actually, 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler, and the rest (60%) is at 6000 K. But the question says the overall effective temperature (the average) is 5500 K. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that. Do I need to calculate the actual temperature of the spots, or is the effective temp of the entire star being considered as 5500 K?

Wait, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered. So, the effective temperature is an average. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the effective temperature is what determines the ratio, so when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K.

Wait, but the problem is about the photosphere's effective temperature. So in the presence of spots, the photosphere's effective temperature is lower. So in the photosphere, the temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So, the ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels would change based on this temperature.

Wait no, wait. No, the spots are cooler regions, but the overall photosphere's effective temperature is lower. So when considering the overall photosphere, the effective temperature is 5500 K.

But wait, the photosphere itself isn't just one temperature. But in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), each small region can be considered in its own local conditions. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, those spots are at a lower temperature than the rest. But the problem says that the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the star's overall flux is as if it were a blackbody at 5500 K. But for the purpose of the photospheric layers (the areas not covered by spots) are still at 6000 K, and the spots are cooler.

Wait, but the problem says that when 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K. Therefore, when computing the ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels, the temperature to use is 5500 K for when the star has spots, and 6000 K when it doesn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature, but the rest of the photosphere remains at 6000 K. So the average flux is lower, but the regions not covered by spots are at 6000 K. But the question is about the ratio in the photosphere. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says, "when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't.

Wait, but the problem is about the factor by which the ratio changes when the star is spotless (T=6000 K) compared to when it has spots (T=5500 K). So the ratio (n1/n2) when not spotted is higher than when spotted.

Because the ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ). Wait, no, wait. Let me be precise. The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So, R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(kT) )

So if T decreases, then the exponent ΔE/(kT) increases because T is in the denominator. So if the temperature goes down, the ratio R increases. Because when T is lower, the exponential term is larger, which makes R larger.

But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, but according to this, when T decreases (from 6000 K to 5500 K), R should increase, meaning n1/n2 is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that would imply that R went down. So perhaps I have the levels reversed?

Wait, maybe the ratio they're talking about is n2/n1. Because in that case, if T decreases, n2/n1 would decrease because the exponential term becomes smaller.

Let me clarify. Let me define R as the ratio n2/n1. So R = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) )

If ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making R smaller. So n2/n1 decreases as T decreases.

So when the star has spots (T=5500 K), R is lower than when T=6000 K. So the ratio R (n2/n1) is lower when T is lower. That aligns with the problem's statement that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

So, the question is asking for the factor by which R changes when the star is spotless (T=6000 K) compared to when it has spots (T=5500 K). So the factor is R_spotless / R_spotted.

So we need to calculate (R1 / R2), where R1 is at T=6000 K and R2 at T=5500 K.

Wait, no. The problem says when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. Wait, no, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower (5500 K), R is lower. So when the star has spots (R_spotted = R2), R2 is lower. So the factor is R1 (at 6000 K) divided by R2 (at 5500 K). Because when you go from spotless to spotted, R decreases.

So the factor is (R1 / R2) = [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) ].

Simplifying, the g factors cancel (assuming they are the same in numerator and denominator). So the ratio becomes exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) )

So the factor is exponential of (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1).

But wait, we can compute (ΔE) from the wavelength given. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy difference between the two levels is related to the photon's energy: ΔE = hc / λ.

So let's compute ΔE.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Let me compute that:

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) J.

Calculating that: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, let's compute it more accurately.

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373.

So ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

But we usually express energy in terms of eV. So let's convert J to eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So ΔE in eV is (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ (1.373 / 0.1602) ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, let me compute that again. (1.373e-18) / (1.602e-19) = (1.373 / 0.1602) * 1e1 = 8.57 times 10^0? Wait:

Wait, 1e-18 / 1e-19 = 10. So 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 = (1.373 / 1.602) * (1e-18 / 1e-19) ) 

Which is (0.857) * 10 = 8.57 approx. So ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV.

Now, K is Boltzmann's constant, which is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 K ≈ 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 99,500 K.

Wait, that's the same as (ΔE in eV) * 11605 K/eV.

Because another way: 1 eV ≈ 11605 K. So 8.57 eV ≈ 8.57 * 11605 ≈ 99,500 K. So that's consistent.

So, ΔE/(k) ≈ 99,500 K.

Now, the exponent in the ratio factor is (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Wait, T1 is the temperature when the star is spotless: 6000 K.

T2 is when the star has spots: 5500 K.

So, 1/T2 is 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1.

1/T1 is 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1.

So, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1.818e-4 - 1.667e-4) = 0.151e-4 ≈ 1.51e-5 K^-1.

So, ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = 99500 K * (1.51e-5 K^-1 )

Calculating that: 99500 * 1.51e-5 ≈ (99500 * 1.51) ) * 1e-5.

99500 * 1.51: 100,000 * 1.51 = 151,000. But minus 500 *1.51, which is 755. So 151,000 - 755 = 150,245.

Multiply by 1e-5: 150,245e-5 = 15.0245.

So the exponent is approximately 15.0245.

So the factor is exp(15.0245 ). Let me compute that.

Hmm, exp(15) is about 3,269,017. But wait, 15 is a big exponent.

Wait, let me think. Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, wait, the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1).

But since 1/T2 is less than 1/T1 (because T2 is larger than T1), the difference is positive.

But wait, wait, when T1 is 6000 K and T2 is 5500 K, 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1 because 5500 is less than 6000. So 1/5500 is larger than 1/6000.

Wait, no, wait: 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818, 1/6000≈0.0001667. So yes, 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1.

So, (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive. So the exponent is positive, and factor is exp(positive number), which is a large number. So the ratio R1/R2 = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )) )

Wait, but wait, earlier calculation gave exponent of approximately 15, which is a huge number. So exp(15) is about 3.27 million. That's way too big, but looking at the options, the highest given is about 7.8.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me retrace.

Wait, wait! The problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels. So perhaps I have the ratio reversed.

Wait, in the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(kT) )

So when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so n2/n1 is lower.

Thus, the ratio (n2/n1) when spotless is higher than when spotted.

So, the factor is (n2/n1)_spotless / (n2/n1)_spotted.

Which would be [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

So the g factors cancel, and we have exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] )

Wait, so that's the same as I did before, which gives a large exponent.

But perhaps I messed up the values of T1 and T2.

Wait, when the star is spotless, T is 6000 K (T1 = 6000 K).

When spotted, T is 5500 K (T2 = 5500 K).

So, 1/T2 is 1/5500, 1/T1 is 1/6000.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (6000 -5500)/(5500 * 6000) ) = (500)/(5500*6000) )

Wait, that's 500/(33,000,000) ) = 1/66,000.

Wait, that's 1.515e-5 K^-1.

Wait, I think I might have miscalculated 1/5500 - 1/6000 earlier.

Let me compute 1/5500 = approximately 0.000181818.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667.

Subtracting the two:

0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

Which is 1.5151e-5.

So, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 1.515e-5 K^-1.

And ΔE/(k) is about 99500 K, as before.

So, 99500 K * 1.515e-5 K^-1 = 99500 * 1.515e-5.

Compute 99500 * 1.515e-5.

99500 is approximately 1e5.

1e5 * 1.515e-5 = 1.515.

But 99500 is 9.95e4, so 9.95e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.95 * 1.515 * (1e4 * 1e-5) )

= 15.047 * 0.1 = 1.5047.

Wait, so the exponent is approximately 1.5047.

So the factor is exp(1.5047) ≈ e^1.5047.

e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.6 is around 4.953. So 1.5047 is just under 1.5, so e^1.5047 is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately.

We can compute e^1.5047.

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.50408.

Because ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(4.5)=1.50408, ln(5)=1.609.

So e^1.50408 is 4.5.

So e^1.5047 is about 4.502.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from being spotless (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels is given by:

\[
R = \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right).
\]

The factor by which the ratio changes when the star transitions from being spotless to having spots is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{R_{\text{spotless}}}{R_{\text{spotted}}} = \frac{\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (spotless) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spotted).

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta E\)
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Using the relation \(1 \, \text{eV} \approx 11605 \, \text{K}\), the energy difference in terms of temperature is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx 8.57 \times 11605 \approx 99500 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the Exponent
The difference in inverse temperatures is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

The exponent in the factor is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99500 \times 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.505.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star transitions from being spotless to having spots.
