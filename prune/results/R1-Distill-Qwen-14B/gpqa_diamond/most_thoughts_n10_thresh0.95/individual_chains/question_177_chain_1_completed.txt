Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read it again and figure out what's going on. So, there are two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2. Oh, wait, and the mass is also 1.5 times larger. Interesting. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's probably the peak wavelength due to their temperatures, right? So, same peak wavelength implies same temperature, I think. Because according to black body radiation, the peak λ is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ is the same, then T is the same for both stars.

But wait, the question is about their luminosities. The question says that when they computed the luminosity using the black body formula, they found that Star 1's luminosity is greater than Star 2's by a certain factor. And the options are around 2.2 to 2.35, so somewhere around sqrt(5) which is about 2.236, or maybe 2.25, which is 9/4. Hmm.

Wait, the question says that the masses are the same factor larger. But mass doesn't directly affect luminosity unless it's about other factors, like maybe if they were fusing different elements, but the question says to assume they're black bodies. Oh, right, so we can just use the black body formula for luminosity. So the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, if both stars have the same temperature, since their peak wavelengths are the same, then L is proportional to R². Because L ∝ R² T⁴, and T is same, then L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Because R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So that suggests that L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but the question says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is about the speed towards or away from us. So that would affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but the problem says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, so maybe that's the rest wavelength, or perhaps the peak was measured in the rest frame, meaning that the Doppler shift doesn't affect the temperature determination? Wait, no. Because if a star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted. So the actual temperature would be corrected for the Doppler effect.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the observed wavelengths (the ones they measured) are the same. But the actual temperatures must be determined by considering their velocities. Because if a star is moving towards us (like Star 2 at 700 km/s), its light would be blueshifted, so the observed peak wavelength would be shorter. Conversely, if a star is moving away, the wavelength would be redshifted. But in this case, Star 1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength. Star 2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that would imply that after Doppler shift, the observed λ_peak is the same for both stars.

So, the peak wavelength emitted (λ_emitted) is related to temperature via Wien's law: λ_peak ~ 1/T. But because of Doppler shift, the observed wavelength λ_obs is λ_emitted multiplied by (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity (if moving away, v_r is positive, else negative). Wait, the Doppler shift formula is a bit more precise. The relativistic Doppler effect for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ) when moving away. Wait, no, maybe I should think more carefully.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + β) / (1 - β) ), where β = v/c. But wait, wait. Alternatively, the non-relativistic approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative if approaching). So if Star 2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its observed λ would be blueshifted, which would be shorter than the rest wavelength.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. So, the observed λ_peak for Star 1 is λ1 = λ_rest1 * (1 + v1/c). But v1 is zero, so λ1 = λ_rest1. For Star 2, λ2_observed = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). But since λ1_observed = λ2_observed, then λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, let me clarify. Because Star 2 is moving towards us (v2 = 700 km/s, which is positive if moving away, negative if towards?), wait no, the sign depends on convention. If v_r is the radial velocity, where positive is moving away (redshift), negative is moving towards (blueshift). So Star 1 has v_r = 0, so no Doppler shift. Star 2 has v_r = -700 km/s (since moving towards). So λ_obs for Star 2 is λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c ) = λ_rest2 * (1 - 700e3 / c ). Where c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s.

Wait, 700 km/s is 700 / 3e5 = about 0.002333... So 1 - 0.002333 is approximately 0.997667. So λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 0.997667. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. So λ_obs1 = λ_rest1, and λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 0.997667. But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, so λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 0.997667.

But from Wien's law, λ_rest is inversely proportional to T. So λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * T2 / T1. Because λ ∝ 1/T. So, substituting: λ_rest1 = (λ_rest2) * (T2 / T1) ).

But from the Doppler shift, λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 0.997667.

So (T2 / T1) = 0.997667.

So T2 = T1 * 0.997667.

But how does that affect the luminosity calculation?

So, the luminosity of a star is L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since both stars have the same observed wavelength at their brightest, but Star 2 is moving towards us, the actual temperatures are different because T2 is T1 * 0.997667.

Wait, that complicates things. So I think I initially thought that T1 = T2, but that's not correct. Because the observed wavelengths are the same, but the rest wavelengths are different due to Doppler shift, which implies different temperatures.

So, let me re-express this.

Let me denote:

For Star 1: v1 = 0 => λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star 2: v2 = 700 km/s, moving towards us => λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 - v2/c).

But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So, λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 - v2/c).

But λ_rest = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K), so:

λ_rest1 = (b / T1) and λ_rest2 = (b / T2).

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 - v2/c).

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 - v2/c).

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T2 = T1 (1 - v2/c).

So,

T2 = T1 (1 - (700e3) / (3e5)).

Calculate 700e3 / 3e5: 700,000 / 300,000 = 7/3 ≈ 2.3333... but wait, 700e3 is 700,000 and 3e5 is 300,000: 700e3 / 3e5 = 7/3 ≈ 2.3333. Wait, but that's greater than 1, which would make (1 - 700e3 / 3e5) negative, which can't be possible for temperature. Oh wait, no. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, v2 is negative in the formula. Let me check the Doppler formula again.

Wait, the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is λ_obs = λ_source * sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) ), where β = v/c. But for small velocities, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_source (1 - β). So in this case, because Star_2 is moving towards us (v_r is negative), the observed wavelength is shorter.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula.

The Doppler shift formula for the observed wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer (v is negative) is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + β) / (1 - β) )

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When a source emits light and moves towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter than the emitted. So the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), where β = v/c and v is positive when moving towards. Wait, no, I think the formula can be written as:

λ_obs = λ_rest * ( (1 - β) / (1 + β) )^{1/2}, when the source is moving towards.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula, but perhaps I can just rely on the fact that the observed λ_peak is the same for both stars, so the product of their rest λ and their respective Doppler factors must be equal.

But perhaps it's easier to proceed with the approximation. Since 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), the relativistic effects are small, so using the non-relativistic approximation would be acceptable.

So, the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

But wait, wait: if the star is moving towards us, v_r is negative, right? Because v_r is the radial velocity; positive when moving away, negative when approaching.

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), but v_r is the component of the velocity along the line of sight. So if the star is moving towards us, v_r is negative, so (1 + v_r/c) becomes (1 - |v_r|/c ). So for Star 2, which has v_r = -700 km/s (since moving towards us), the observed wavelength is λ_rest2 * (1 + (-700e3 / 3e5) ) = λ_rest2 * (1 - 0.002333... ) ≈ λ_rest2 * 0.997667.

But since the observed wavelengths are the same, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 - 700e3 / 3e5 )

But λ_rest is proportional to 1/T, so:

1/T1 = (1/T2 ) * (1 - 700e3 / 3e5 )

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 - 700e3 / 3e5 )^{-1}

Compute (1 - 0.0023333) = 0.99766667, so 1/0.99766667 ≈ 1.002334.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.002334.

So, the temperature of Star_2 is a bit higher than Star_1.

Wait, but earlier I thought T2 = T1 * 0.997667, which is lower. But that must have been a mistake because I neglected the reciprocal. So actually, T2 is higher than T1.

Hmm, so Star 2 is hotter than Star 1. But Star 1 has a larger radius and mass. So when computing luminosity, which depends on R² T⁴, we have to factor in both.

So, Luminosity L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

Therefore, the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

We know that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2 )^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 )

= ( (2.25 R2² ) * T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

= 2.25 * ( T1 / T2 )^4.

But we found that T2 = T1 * 1.002334.

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002334 ≈ 0.99767.

So,

( T1 / T2 )^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4.

Let me compute that. 0.99767^4. Let's compute it:

First, 0.99767 ≈ 1 - 0.00233.

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x + 6x² -4x³ + x^4. For small x, higher terms are negligible.

x = 0.00233.

4x = 0.00932.

6x² = 6*(0.00233)^2 ≈ 6 * 0.00000543 ≈ 0.00003258.

So, 1 - 4x + 6x² ≈ 1 - 0.00932 + 0.00003258 ≈ 0.99071258.

So, (0.99767)^4 ≈ approximately 0.9907.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * (1 - 0.0093) = 2.25 - (2.25 * 0.0093) ≈ 2.25 - 0.020925 ≈ 2.229.

So, approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, option B is ~2.32, A is ~2.25.

Wait, but perhaps the approximation is not accurate enough. Maybe I should compute (0.997667)^4 more precisely.

Let me compute 0.997667^2 first.

0.997667 * 0.997667.

Compute 1 * 1 = 1.

(1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a², where a = 0.002333.

So 0.997667^2 = (1 - 0.002333)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2.

= 1 - 0.004666 + 0.00000544.

≈ 0.99533944.

Then, square that to get the fourth power.

(0.99533944)^2 = ?

Again, a = 0.00466056.

(1 - 0.00466056)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00466056 + (0.00466056)^2.

= 1 - 0.00932112 + 0.00002172.

≈ 0.9906986.

So (0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.9906986.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9906986 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

Which is about 2.23, so option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but the initial assumption that T2 is higher than T1 based on the Doppler shift seems counterintuitive because the observed wavelength is the same. Let me double-check.

The observed wavelength for Star_1 is λ_rest1, since it's not moving. For Star_2, which is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is λ_rest2 * (1 - v2/c). Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 - v2/c).

But λ_rest = b / T, so:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 - v2/c)

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 - v2/c )

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T2 = T1 * (1 - v2/c )^{-1}

v2 is 700 km/s, so v2/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 0.00233333.

So,

(1 - v2/c ) = 0.99766667

Thus,

T2 = T1 * (0.99766667)^{-1} ≈ T1 * 1.00233333.

So yes, T2 is a bit higher than T1.

Therefore, in the luminosity formula, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4 = 2.25 * (1 / 1.00233333)^4.

Which is approximately 2.25 * (0.9976667)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990698 ≈ 2.229.

So the factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since \(L \propto R^2 T^4\), the ratio of the luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
From the problem, \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Substituting this into the radius term:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = \left(\frac{1.5 R_2}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. This implies that the observed wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) are equal for both stars. Using Wien's law, the rest wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto \frac{1}{T}
\]

For Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}\). For Star_2, which has a radial velocity of \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) (moving toward us), the observed wavelength is blueshifted:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate the rest wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T\), we get:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{v_2}{c}}
\]

The speed of light \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), so:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.002333} \approx 1.002334
\]

So:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002334} \approx 0.997667
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Term in Luminosity Ratio
The temperature term in the luminosity ratio is \((T_1 / T_2)^4\). Substituting \(T_1 / T_2 \approx 0.997667\):

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (0.997667)^4
\]

Using the approximation \((1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x\) for small \(x\), where \(x = 0.002333\):

\[
(0.997667)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.002333) = 1 - 0.009332 \approx 0.990698
\]

### Step 4: Final Luminosity Ratio
Combining the radius and temperature terms:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot 0.990698 \approx 2.229
\]

### Conclusion
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately \(2.23\).
