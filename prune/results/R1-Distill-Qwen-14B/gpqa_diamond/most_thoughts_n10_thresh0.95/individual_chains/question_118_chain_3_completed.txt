Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is. Hmm, it's about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. I remember that enols can undergo certain reactions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

First, I should probably draw the structure of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Cyclopentene has a five-membered ring with a double bond. The enol part would have an adjacent double bond. So, the structure would be a cyclopentane ring with a double bond at the 1 position. The substituents are two methyl groups at the 4 position. Wait, cyclopentane has five carbons, so numbering would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the methyl groups on C4, which is adjacent to C5 and C3. So the structure is cyclopentene (the enol form), with two methyl groups on carbon 4.

Now, the reaction is with bromine. Bromine usually adds across double bonds in alkenes. But wait, the starting material is an enol, which is a conjugated dienol? No, wait, cyclopent-1-enol has a double bond between C1 and C2 and an -OH group on C2? Or wait, enol structure. Oh right, an enol is a compound with a double bond adjacent to an -OH group. So, in this case, the enol is at the 1 position, so the structure would have a ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and an -OH on C2.

Wait, cyclopent-1-enol would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl group on C2. So the structure is a five-membered ring with C1 double bonded to C2, and C2 has an -OH group. And there are two methyl groups attached to C4.

So when bromine (Br2) reacts with an enol, what happens? I recall that bromine adds to double bonds via an electrophilic addition. But enols are conjugated with the adjacent -OH group. So when Br2 adds to the double bond, it might form a dibromide, but the presence of the hydroxyl group could influence the reaction.

Wait, but wait a second. Enols are also subject to keto-enol tautomerism. So, perhaps when bromine is present, the enol form will react. Or, maybe the reaction is different. Alternatively, could it be an addition of bromine to the double bond, followed by some kind of acid workup or other process?

Wait, no, in this case, the reaction is just between the enol and bromine. So, perhaps bromine adds across the double bond. The double bond in the enol is between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 would lead to vicinal dibromide. But wait, the enol has an -OH group on C2, so adding Br to C1 and C2 might lead to something else.

Wait, but when bromine adds to a double bond adjacent to an -OH group, the reaction can sometimes proceed through a different mechanism. Oh right, in some cases, the bromine can add in a conjugate fashion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the enol might undergo some kind of acid-base reaction with bromine, but I think that's less likely here.

Wait, another thought: could the enol react in such a way that the hydroxyl group is involved in the reaction? For example, perhaps the -OH could act as a nucleophile and attack the bromine, but that's probably not the main pathway. Alternatively, the double bond could undergo electrophilic addition with Br2, as in the standard dibromination of alkenes.

So, in the case of cyclopent-1-enol, adding Br2 would add across the double bond between C1 and C2, resulting in a vicinal dibromide. So the product would have Br on C1 and Br on C2. Also, the ring would remain intact, and the methyl groups would be on C4.

But wait, the structure after adding Br would have two Brs on adjacent carbons. Looking at the options, I see options A and D are dibromides, while B and C are mono-bromides.

Wait, but the options are about the major outcome. If Br2 adds, then dibromide is the expected product. So options A and D are dibromides.

Now, looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Option D is (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So both are dibromides with two Brs on C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl group is still present as an -ol.

Wait, but wait: in the reaction, does the -OH group stay as is, or is there any elimination or other change? Because when Br2 adds to an enol, maybe the OH group remains, leading to a vicinal dibromide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a diol or something else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The starting material is an enol, which is an alcohol with a conjugated double bond. When you add bromine to a double bond, the typical result is a dibromide. So, the product should have Br on C1 and C2. So the product should have two Brs on adjacent carbons.

But wait, in the structure of the starting material, the -OH is on C2. So after adding Br to C1 and C2, the Br would be on the same carbon as the -OH. So the structure becomes 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Wait, but wait another thing. When you add Br2 to a double bond, it's a diaddition. So the cyclopentenol would have the double bond between C1 and C2, with OH on C2. Adding Br would mean C1 gets Br and C2 gets Br. So the product would be 1,2-dibromocyclopentanol, with substituents as per the starting material.

Looking at the options, A and D are 1,2-dibromo. So the next thing is the stereochemistry. The starting cyclopentenol: when Br2 adds, the addition is anti, right? Because Br adds from opposite sides, leading to a trans dibromide.

Wait, but the starting compound is a cyclopentene, so the ring is fixed. The addition of Br would have to fit the ring's structure. Let me imagine the structure. So in the enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C2. So when Br2 adds, Br would attach to C1 and C2. The ring structure would maintain, and the stereochemistry would depend on how the Br adds.

Wait, but in a ring, the double bond is part of the ring. Adding Br across the double bond would break the ring's double bond, but the ring remains otherwise. So in the product, the ring is now a single bond between C1 and C2, with Br on each.

So the product would be a cyclopentanol with Br on C1 and C2, and methyl groups on C4. Now, the options have either (1R,2S) or (1R,2R) configurations.

Hmm, I need to determine the stereochemistry of the addition. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2.

When Br2 adds, the bromine ions approach from the opposite sides of the double bond, leading to anti addition. So, if the starting enol has a certain configuration, the Brs will add in a trans fashion.

Wait, but since it's a ring, the addition of Br in an anti fashion may lead to a certain stereochemistry. Let's imagine the enol structure. The cyclopentene ring is flat. The double bond between C1 and C2. The OH is on C2 in a certain position. When Br adds across, the Brs will be on opposite faces.

But to determine the R/S configuration, I think I need to draw the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the reaction. Another possibility is that the enol could undergo a different reaction, such as oxidation. Wait, but bromine is more of an addition reagent, not an oxidizing agent. Unless it's in a specific condition.

Wait, another thought: sometimes enols can undergo halogenation in a way that the OH is replaced by a halogen. But that's usually in acidic conditions, like the formation of an enol ether, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed reaction, but the question doesn't specify conditions. It just says reaction with bromine, so I think it's the addition to the double bond.

So, the product would be a vicinal dibromide. Now, looking back at the options, options A and D are dibromides, and B and C are mono-bromides.

Wait, but another possibility is that the enol could form a cyclic bromonium ion, leading to a different product. But I think the main reaction would be the addition of Br2 across the double bond.

So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Now, the options A and D present this.

So the next thing is to determine whether the stereochemistry is R and S or both R.

In the addition of Br2 to a double bond, the bromines add anti to each other. So if the starting enol has a certain configuration, the Brs would end up on opposite sides.

Wait, the starting enol has a certain configuration. Let's imagine the cyclopentenol. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C2. The substituents are two methyl groups on C4.

In the enol, the OH is on C2, and the ring is such that C4 has two methyl groups. So the enol has the structure where the ring is cyclopentane with a double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH on C2. The substituents on C4 are both methyl groups.

When Br2 adds, the Brs add across the double bond. The ring is rigid, so the addition would affect the configuration around C1 and C2.

Assuming the starting enol has the OH in a certain position, the Brs would add anti. So the Br on C1 and C2 would be on opposite sides.

Let me assign the configuration. Let's say the starting enol is in a certain chair-like conformation, but perhaps that's getting too detailed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a trans dibromide because of the anti addition. So the Brs are on opposite faces.

But wait, in a ring structure, the addition of Br2 to a cyclopentene would form a vicinal dibromide with the Brs on adjacent carbons and opposite configurations.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the exact stereochemistry, but looking at the options, A is (1R,2S) and D is (1R,2R). So which one is it?

Wait, perhaps the initial configuration of the enol affects the final product's stereochemistry. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the enol has a double bond between C1 and C2, with the OH on C2. The methyl groups are on C4.

In the enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. When Br2 adds, the Brs will add to each carbon in a trans manner.

So, the configuration of the starting material's double bond would influence the product's configuration. Let me imagine looking down the double bond. The groups on each carbon would be as follows:

On C1: substituents are the ring (C5 connected to C1 and C2), and the two other substituents are, say, the two adjacent ring carbons. On C2: substituents are the ring (C1 and C3) and the OH group.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the chair-like transition state. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: the product's stereochemistry depends on the geometry of the starting double bond. If the starting double bond is in a certain configuration (cis or trans), but in a cyclopentene, the double bond is in a fixed conformation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction proceeds with bromine adding to the less substituted side or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the major outcome is the diastereomer formed. The options A and D are diastereomers because their configurations are different.

But without knowing the exact starting structure's configuration, perhaps the question is more about recognizing that the product is a vicinal dibromide with OH present, so the correct option is either A or D.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: (1R,2S)

Option D: (1R,2R)

If the addition is anti, then the Br on C1 is on the opposite side of the Br on C2.

But in the enol, the OH is on C2. So when the double bond opens, the Br adds to both sides. Let me imagine the double bond as C1=C2-OH.

When Br2 adds, the Brs add to opposite faces. So if the OH is on the same face as one of the Brs, then their configurations would be opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a trans dibromide, leading to (1R,2S) or (1S,2R) configuration.

Wait, if the two Brs are on opposite faces, then the configurations would be R and S. For example, if C1 is R and C2 is S.

Alternatively, both could be R or both S, but that would imply a syn addition, which is not the case for Br2 addition.

Wait, no, Br2 addition is anti, so the Brs are on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration. Therefore, the two Brs would have opposite configurations if the substituents are arranged such that their priorities are higher on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities.

In the product, the two Brs are on C1 and C2. Let's consider the substituents around each carbon.

On C1: The substituents are Br, two CH2 groups (since it's a cyclopentane ring), and the ring.

Wait, no, in the ring, each carbon is connected to two ring carbons. So for C1, substituents are Br, two CH2 (or CH) groups, and the ring. Wait, perhaps it's a cyclopentane ring, so each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons, and two substituents. So, for C1, substituents are Br, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and the ring itself?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to pick based on the presence of the OH group and the dibromide.

But looking at the options, A and D both have the OH group, so that's correct, while B and C don't. So the major product should be a dibromide, so options A or D.

Wait, but wait another thought. The starting material is an enol, which is in equilibrium with the keto form. Would the reaction proceed through the enol or the ketone? Because if the enol is more reactive, but sometimes the ketone form is more stable.

Wait, I think enols are more reactive towards electrophilic addition because the adjacent lone pair can stabilize the transition state. So the enol form would react, leading to the dibromide.

But if the reaction conditions favor the keto form, then the double bond wouldn't be there, but I don't think that's the case here. The question states that the starting material is the enol, so it's likely the reactive form.

So, the reaction is addition of Br2 to the enol's double bond, making a vicinal dibromide, with the OH group remaining.

Now, considering the options again, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, with either (1R,2S) or (1R,2R) configuration.

But how to decide between A and D?

Wait, perhaps the addition of Br2 leads to a trans-dibromide, which would correspond to the (1R,2S) configuration. Or perhaps it's (1S,2R). But without knowing the starting configuration, it's challenging.

Wait, another approach: when the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the OH on C2, adding Br across would lead to a trans arrangement. So the Br on C1 and C2 are on opposite sides.

Assuming the OH is on the same face as one Br, then the other Br is on the opposite face.

Wait, for the cyclopentane ring, the addition of Br would make the two Brs on adjacent carbons in a trans configuration.

But perhaps in this case, the product would have a specific stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a racemic mixture, but the options only give specific configurations, so that's probably not it.

Alternatively, maybe the correct product is the meso compound, but looking at the options, none of them are meso. Option A is (1R,2S), which is a pair of enantiomers if the compound is chiral. Option D is (1R,2R), which would have a plane of symmetry if the two Brs are on the same side.

Wait, perhaps the product is a meso compound. Let me check. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C1 and C2, then the configurations would be (1R,2R), which would make it a meso compound. Alternatively, if it's (1R,2S), which would be chiral, not meso.

So, if the product is a meso compound, the configuration would be (1R,2R) because the two Brs are on the same side, leading to a plane of symmetry. But wait, adding Br2 in an anti fashion would lead the Brs to be on opposite sides, making them trans, which in a five-membered ring wouldn't necessarily be a meso compound.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the most stable product. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a dibromide but instead forms a bromoketone.

Wait, another possibility: the enol could react with bromine in a different way. Enols can undergo electrophilic attack, but I'm not sure about bromine's role here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enol is more reactive due to the conjugated system, leading to a bromohydrin formation. But wait, bromohydrin formation typically involves a reaction with water and a bromine source, like NBS in presence of water. Oh, but in this case, it's just Br2. So maybe that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a halogenation of the enol to form a ketone. Wait, the enol can tautomerize to a ketone, but I'm not sure how Br2 would react in that case.

Wait, if the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, then the reaction with Br2 would not proceed because the double bond is gone. But if the reaction is with the enol, the double bond would react.

So, perhaps the initial assumption that the product is a dibromide is correct.

If so, then options A and D are possible. Now, to choose between them, perhaps the major outcome is the product with the Brs in a particular configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a bromonium ion formation, which then leads to the opening with Br- attack from the opposite side. But in a ring, this can lead to a specific configuration.

Hmm. Another approach: considering the ring structure, adding Br2 would lead to a trans-dibromide. So the Brs are on opposite sides of the ring.

So, if the ring is in a chair-like conformation, the Brs would be axial or equatorial. But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the product is the trans dibromide, which would have (1R,2S) configuration if the substituents are arranged that way.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another way to think is that the addition of Br2 to an enol leads to the formation of a diastereomer, but I'm not sure about the exact configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction results in the formation of a bromoketone. Wait, that's another possibility. Enols can react with halogens to form ketones, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, wait a second. When an enol reacts with bromine, it can undergo a process where the bromine replaces the hydroxyl group, leading to a ketone and the release of HBr. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Wait, the reaction of an enol with Br2 could lead to a substitution where the OH is replaced by Br, but that would require a good leaving group, which OH isn't. Alternatively, perhaps the enol can lose water to form a double bond, but that might not be the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol is oxidized, but bromine isn't a strong oxidizing agent for that.

Another angle: if the enol isn't reactive enough, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as expected. But that's unlikely because the question gives options indicating a reaction occurs.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of possible diastereomers. In the product, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and the OH is on C2, the product can have different configurations.

Wait, the product would have two stereogenic centers at C1 and C2. The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, doesn't have any stereogenic centers because the double bond makes it planar. So when Br2 adds, it creates two new stereogenic centers.

So the product can be either a racemic mixture, a pair of enantiomers, or a meso compound. But looking at the options, A is (1R,2S), which would be a meso compound if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. D is (1R,2R), which would be a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, is the product a meso compound? For a meso compound, the molecule must have a plane of symmetry. In this case, if the two Brs are on the same side of the ring, and the substituents (methyl groups) are on the opposite side, then a plane of symmetry might exist.

If the product is a meso compound, then the configuration would be (1R,2R) because the two stereogenic centers are mirror images, making the molecule achiral overall. Wait, no, wait: a meso compound can have stereogenic centers but be achiral due to a plane of symmetry.

So, for example, tartaric acid is a meso compound with two stereogenic centers and a plane of symmetry.

So, in our case, if the two Brs are on the same side (cis addition), then the molecule might be a meso compound. But wait, Br2 adds in a trans fashion, so the Brs would be on opposite sides, leading to a trans-dibromide.

So in that case, the product would be a trans-dibromide, which may or may not be a meso compound.

Wait, but if the two Brs are on opposite sides, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. Otherwise, it's chiral.

So, to determine if the product is a meso compound, I need to imagine the structure. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The product would have Br on C1 and C2, and two methyl groups on C4.

If the Brs are on opposite sides, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Looking at the structure: cyclopentane ring, Br on C1 and C2 (trans), and methyl groups on C4. Let's imagine the ring. C1 is adjacent to C5 and C2. C2 is adjacent to C1 and C3. C4 has two methyl groups.

If the Brs are on opposite sides, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C4 axis. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral, and the product would be a pair of enantiomers. But the options show specific configurations, not a racemic mixture.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible products.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, options B and C are mono-bromides. So perhaps the reaction leads to a single Br addition, not a dibromide. Could that be?

Wait, but bromine typically adds two Brs across a double bond. Unless under specific conditions where only one Br adds, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the enol reacts in a way that the OH group is replaced by Br. That would be a substitution reaction. But OH is a poor leaving group unless in acidic conditions. The question doesn't specify, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is acid-catalyzed, but I don't think the question implies that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is with HBr instead of Br2, leading to a bromohydrin. But the question uses Br2, so that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ring's double bond is more strained, making it more reactive, leading to a different product. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening, but that's unlikely as cyclopentene is a stable ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. How could that happen?

If the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, then reacts with Br2. But the ketone doesn't have a double bond, so Br2 wouldn't add. Alternatively, perhaps the enol loses a water molecule to form the ketone, and then Br2 adds somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe the enol reacts with Br2 in a way that the Br adds to the carbonyl carbon, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possible reaction mechanism: the enol could undergo a halogenation at the alpha position. But that's usually done with something like NBS and light, or in a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a bromoketone via the enol mechanism.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think: the reaction is between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and Br2. The enol has a conjugated double bond and an -OH group. The reaction is likely to be an addition across the double bond, leading to a dibromide. But why are options B and C present?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not an addition but an oxidation. Wait, bromine can act as an oxidizing agent under certain conditions, but I'm not sure about that here.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol is a good nucleophile and attacks Br2, but I think that's less likely.

Wait, another possible reaction: the enol could lose water to form the ketone (cyclopentanone), and then undergo bromination. But cyclopentanone doesn't have a double bond, so Br2 wouldn't add. Unless it's a ketone that can undergo some kind of bromination, like the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskyl reaction, which brominates the alpha position. But that requires the presence of a catalyst like a carboxylic acid or another acid.

So, without such conditions, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed that way. The question doesn't specify any conditions, just the reaction between the enol and Br2.

Hmm. I think I'm going in circles here. To proceed, I'll make an educated guess.

The most likely reaction is the addition of Br2 across the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide. Among the options, A and D are dibromides. The stereochemistry depends on the addition being anti, leading to a trans-dibromide. So, considering the possible configurations, the product would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R), which would be a pair of enantiomers, making the compound chiral.

But looking at the options, A is (1R,2S) and D is (1R,2R). So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A or D. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a bromoketone, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enol's double bond is not the reactive site. Maybe the reaction is a bromination of the methyl groups, but that's unlikely without a catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol is more reactive than the ketone, so the Br2 adds to the double bond, making a vicinal dibromide. So, the product is a 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Now, the options A and D have this structure. So the choice comes down to their stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps looking for the correct configuration. Let's say the double bond is in a certain configuration, leading to the Brs adding in a way that creates either R and S or R and R configurations.

But without the actual structure, it's hard to determine. Maybe the correct answer is option A: (1R,2S). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a bromoketone via oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, considering that the enol is more reactive, maybe the product is a diol. But that doesn't match the options.

Hmm. To sum up, I think the reaction is an addition of Br2 to the double bond in the enol, leading to a vicinal dibromide with the OH group present. So the product is either option A or D.

Between A and D, I think the correct configuration is (1R,2S), which would correspond to a trans addition. But since the options don't specify, perhaps either is possible. However, the correct answer is either A or D.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D is (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

If the Brs are added in a cis fashion, which they are not, because Br2 adds in anti, then the configuration would be (1R,2R). But if the addition is anti, then they would be trans, leading to (1R,2S) or (1S,2R).

Hmm. I'm making this more complicated than it should be. Maybe the correct answer is option A: (1R,2S).

Alternatively, perhaps the product is option D because the addition leads to both Brs being on the same face, making the configuration (1R,2R). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the major product is the dibromide where the Brs are on the same face, leading to a meso compound, which would be (1R,2R). But earlier I thought Br2 adds in anti, which would make the Brs trans.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the answer based on the options. The correct product is a vicinal dibromide, so options A and D. Since the question asks for the major outcome, perhaps the stereochemistry is such that the Brs are on opposite sides, leading to trans, which would have (1R,2S) and (1S,2R) configurations. But the options only have (1R,2S) and (1R,2R).

So perhaps the correct answer is (1R,2S), which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a meso compound, which would have (1R,2R) configuration, making option D correct.

Wait, but the meso compound would have both Brs on the same side. If Br2 adds in trans, that would not form a meso compound. So perhaps option A is the correct one.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: in the addition of Br2 to an enol, the result is a vicinal dibromide with the OH group retained. The product should have two chiral centers with opposite configurations, leading to a pair of enantiomers. So the product would not be a meso compound, but a racemic mixture. But the options don't present a racemic mix; instead, they present specific configurations.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product is a single enantiomer, but that's unlikely unless there's some kind of steric control in the reaction.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a choice. Given the options, I think the correct answer is option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.


The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine involves the addition of Br₂ across the double bond in the enol structure. The enol has a conjugated system with a double bond between C1 and C2 and an -OH group on C2. Bromine typically adds across double bonds via anti addition, leading to a vicinal dibromide. The methyl groups on C4 remain unchanged during the reaction.

The product is a 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, with two stereogenic centers at C1 and C2. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the anti addition of bromine, resulting in a trans-dibromide. This anti addition leads to the configurations (1R,2S) or (1S,2R), which are enantiomers. Among the given options, (1R,2S) is listed as option A, while (1R,2R) is listed as option D. Since the reaction produces a trans-dibromide, the correct configuration is (1R,2S), corresponding to option A.

Options B and C, which represent mono-brominated products, are incorrect because bromine adds across the double bond, not to a single position. Therefore, the major outcome of the reaction is the formation of (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.
