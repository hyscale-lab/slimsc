Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics often describe the geometry of a space, like in general relativity or differential geometry. The area of a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. Wait, but I'm not sure how that applies here. Maybe the metric is for a 2D space embedded in some way.

Let me break it down. The metric is in terms of x and y, so it's a 2-dimensional metric. The general form is ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), which suggests it's conformally flat because the coefficients for dx² and dy² are the same. Conformal metrics are easier to handle because they can be expressed as a scaling factor times the flat metric.

So, the area element in such a metric is usually sqrt(det g) dx dy. For a conformally flat metric, the determinant is just g², because the metric tensor is diagonal with both components equal to g. So in this case, g = 32/(4 - x² - y²). Therefore, the determinant is g² = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2. The square root of that would be 32 / (4 - x² - y²).

Wait, but the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy, so that would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the area of the pseudosphere. Oh, wait, maybe the metric describes a pseudosphere? Or perhaps it's a coordinate representation of a pseudosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps this metric is for a surface of constant negative curvature. Because a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. So the Gaussian curvature K would be negative.

I remember that for a metric of the form ds² = λ² (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(2λ²)) * (Δλ) ), where Δ is the Laplacian in 2D. Or wait, maybe another formula. Alternatively, for a metric f²(dx² + dy²), the curvature is (1/(2 f²)) * Δ f, where Δ is the Laplacian in flat space.

Wait another approach, perhaps using the formula for Gaussian curvature of a conformal metric. The formula is K = - (1/(2 f)) * Δ f, where f is the conformal factor and Δ is the flat Laplacian. Wait, let me get that right. Or wait, another formula: K = - (1/(4 f³)) ∇² f, where ∇² is the Laplacian in Euclidean space.

Hmm, maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature for this metric to see if it's constant.

Let me compute K for this metric. The metric is f² dx² + f² dy², where f = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)). So f = sqrt(32)/(sqrt(4 - r²)), where r² = x² + y². Wait, let me write f in terms of r. f(r) = sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - r²). 

The Gaussian curvature for a 2D metric can be computed using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 f)) * (d/dx (f * (1/f) ) + d/dy (f * (1/f) )) ) → Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, another formula: 

For a metric ds² = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is K = - e^{-2φ} (Δφ), where Δ is the flat Laplacian. So in this case, φ = (1/2) ln(f²) = ln(f) = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²). 

So φ = C - (1/2) ln(4 - r²), where C is a constant.

The Laplacian of φ in 2D is Δφ = (1/r) d/dr (r dφ/dr). Let's compute that.

dφ/dr = (1/2) * [ (2r) / (4 - r²) ) ] * (-1) → Wait, let me compute it correctly. 

φ = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²). So dφ/dr = (1/2) * [ 0 ] - (1/2) * [ (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) ] → So dφ/dr = (1/2) * (2r)/(4 - r²) ) → dφ/dr = r / (4 - r²).

Then, r dφ/dr = r * [ r / (4 - r²) ] = r² / (4 - r²).

Taking derivative with respect to r: d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ] = [ (2r)(4 - r²) + r² * 2r ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, let me compute that. Numerator: 2r(4 - r²) + 2r³ = 8r - 2r³ + 2r³ = 8r. So the entire term is 8r/(4 - r²)^2.

But wait, the Laplacian is (1/r) * d/dr (r dφ/dr ). So that's (1/r) * (8r) / (4 - r²)^2 ) → 8 / (4 - r²)^2.

So Δφ = 8 / (4 - r²)^2.

Then, K = - e^{-2φ} * Δφ. But e^{-2φ} is e^{-2 [ (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²) ] } = e^{- ln(32)} * e^{ ln(4 - r²) } = (4 - r²)/32.

So K = - [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * [8/(4 - r²)^2 ] ) → Simplify this:

(4 - r²) cancels with (4 - r²)^2 → denominator is (4 - r²).

So K = - (8) / [32 (4 - r²) ] → 8/(32) = 1/4, so K = -(1)/(4 (4 - r²)).

Wait, but wait. That's not a constant. Because K depends on r, which is the radial coordinate. So that would imply that the curvature isn't constant, which contradicts the definition of a pseudosphere (which has constant negative curvature). Hmm, that's confusing. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, maybe I messed up the sign somewhere. Let me double-check the formula for K. Oh, right: the formula is K = - e^{-2φ} Δφ. So let's recompute.

Δφ = 8 / (4 - r²)^2.

e^{-2φ} is (4 - r²)/32.

So K = - [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * [8/(4 - r²)^2 ] = - [ 8 (4 - r²) ) ] / [32 (4 - r²)^2 ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

8/32 is 1/4. (4 - r²) in numerator and (4 - r²)^2 in denominator gives 1/(4 - r²). So K= - [ (1/4) * 1/(4 - r^2) ) ] = -1/(4 (4 - r^2)).

Hmm, so this suggests that the curvature depends on r, which implies it's not constant. But a pseudosphere should have constant curvature. That's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the formula for K?

Wait another thought: perhaps the metric is written for a different kind of surface. Maybe it's a hyperbolic plane in some coordinates, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, but pseudospheres in 3D have finite area, but maybe in 2D, the metric describes a hyperbolic plane, which is infinite in extent, so its area would be infinite? Or perhaps the question is about the area of a specific region, like a sphere of radius r=2?

Wait, the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2". Wait, pseudosphere in 3D is a surface of revolution, like a tractricoid. But in 2D, a pseudosphere is represented as a hyperbolic plane with negative curvature, which is infinite in extent. So its area would be infinite.

But wait, maybe in this metric, the space is compact or something else. Let's see: the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that the radius squared (x² + y²) must be less than 4 for the denominator to be positive. So the domain is x² + y² < 4. So the metric is only defined within a circle of radius 2. So the area would be the integral of the area element over this domain.

Wait, the area element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. So the area would be the integral over x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. Let's switch to polar coordinates, since it's symmetric. Let r² = x² + y². Then, the area becomes ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So, the integral becomes 2π * 32 ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let me make a substitution: Let u = 4 - r². Then, du/dr = -2r → -(du)/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 [ (1/u) * (-du/2) ].

Which is (32 * 2π) * (1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to 0) (1/u) (-du) ) → I think I might have messed up the signs. Let me write it again:

The integral is ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

With substitution u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = (-du)/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ 1/u ] * ( -du/2 ) from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2).

So the integral is (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du = (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0 = (-1/2) [ ln 0 - ln4 ].

Wait, ln 0 is negative infinity. So this integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite. So the correct answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So maybe the confusion is in the definition. Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a space that is a pseudosphere, but with finite area. But according to the metric, the space is the region where x² + y² <4, and the area integral diverges, implying infinite area.

So looking at the options, option D is +infty, which would be the correct answer.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric in 2D, where the conformal factor is \( f(x, y) = \sqrt{\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}} \). The area element for such a metric is \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy\), which simplifies to:

\[
\text{Area element} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate this area element over the domain where the metric is defined. The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) implies that \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), meaning the domain is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. Switching to polar coordinates (\( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), \( \theta \) from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \)), the area becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) gives a factor of \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
\text{Area} = 2\pi \cdot 32 \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \) evaluates to \( \ln u \), so:

\[
-\frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln 4 - \ln 0\right].
\]

Here, \( \ln 0 \) is \(-\infty\), causing the integral to diverge. This means the area is infinite. Therefore, the total area of the pseudosphere described by this metric is infinite.
