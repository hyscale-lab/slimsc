Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit detection. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the planet's orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, found via the RV method. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh wait, orbital period is the time it takes to orbit the star. So if Planet_1's period is shorter, it's closer to its star since period is related to distance via Kepler's third law. Right, shorter period means smaller orbit radius.

Both planets have circular orbits, so we don't have to worry about eccentricity affecting the transit probability. That simplifies things.

The host stars have the same radii, but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. Wait, same radius but different mass? That's interesting. More massive stars are usually larger, but maybe Planet_1's star is just a main-sequence star, while Planet_2's is slightly evolved but same radius—maybe a subgiant or something?

Transit probability is given by the formula: P = (R_planet / R_star)² * (R_star / a_planet) ) ? Wait, no, I think the formula is the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size, squared, multiplied by the ratio of the star's size to the semi-major axis. That is, P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p) * something... Wait, let me think. The probability is the area of the planet's disk over the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit intersects our line of sight. Oh right, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s)), because the orbital distance affects how likely the alignment is.

Wait, no. I think the formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p). Because the probability depends on the area of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. So the chance is higher when the planet is larger, the star is smaller, and the planet is closer.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I remember that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 times (1 / a_p), where a_p is the semi-major axis. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 times (R_s / a_p) because of the solid angle or something. Hmm.

Wait, the transit probability formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p) / (1 + (R_s / a_p)) ). Or perhaps more accurately, it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p)^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p) / (1 + (R_s / a_p)). Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, another approach. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet to the area of the star, multiplied by the relative size of the star to the orbit. So, the probability is higher when the planet is larger, the star is smaller, and the planet is closer (so a_p is smaller).

Wait, another way: the geometric probability of a transit is approximately (R_p + R_s) / a_p, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think about it. The chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with ours is proportional to (R_s + R_p) / a_p. But since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's roughly R_s / a_p. Then multiplied by (R_p / R_s)^2 because that's the area ratio. So overall, the probability is proportional to (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a_p) = (R_p^2) / (R_s * a_p).

Wait, that seems more correct. So the probability P is proportional to (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s/a_p) = (R_p^2) / ( R_s a_p ). But wait, R_s is in both the numerator and denominator. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s/a_p), so that the total is (R_p^2)/(R_s a_p).

Wait, let's think about it again. The transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p) *
