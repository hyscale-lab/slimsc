Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> describing an electron. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I guess they form a basis, probably the standard basis for spin-1/2 systems.

The question then asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, so that would be a 2x2 matrix because we have two basis states (up and down). Let me think about what that matrix looks like.

So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix would be:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, but wait, that's if the matrix is 2x2. Because for i=1, j=2 and i=2, j=1, they're both hbar/2. So the operator A is:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Wait, but wait, that matrix is traceless (trace is zero) and equals (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). So it's actually the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) times σ_x. So the operator A is proportional to the spin-x operator, which has eigenstates along the x-axis.

Now, the problem says to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator A. That means we need to find the eigenstates of A and then compute the probabilities of |alpha> being in each eigenstate.

Additionally, we need to find the average value (expectation value) of operator A.

So first, let me get |alpha> normalized. The initial state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's write this as a vector. Since |up> is the first basis state, say [1,0], and |down> is [0,1].

So |alpha> is [1+i, 2-i]^T. Let's compute the norm of this vector to find the normalization factor.

The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = (1 +1) + (4 +2i -2i +1) = 2 + (5) = 7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so the normalized state is (1/sqrt(7))[1+i, 2-i]^T.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Next, the operator A has eigenstates. Since A is proportional to σ_x, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of spin in the x-direction. The eigenvalues of A would be ± (ħ/2), since σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, so A has eigenvalues (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so for A = (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(+1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2.

The eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x. The eigenstates |+x> and |-x> can be written as superpositions of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, actually, no. Wait, wait a second, I think I got that wrong. Let me correct that. The eigenstates of σ_x are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates are indeed (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but wait, I think the signs are correct. Let me confirm.

Alternatively, sometimes people define |+x> as a state where spin is up along x, but perhaps I should check that.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but I'm not entirely sure about the signs. Let me think: when you apply σ_x to |+x>, you get |+x> multiplied by +1, and to |-x>, you get multiplied by -1.

Wait, but perhaps I should just proceed by finding the eigenvectors of A. So A is a 2x2 matrix with [0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0]. Let me write it as (ħ/2) times [0,1;1,0], which is σ_x scaled by ħ/2.

The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A are (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1).

The eigenvectors for σ_x are the same as for A, because they're scalar multiples. So for σ_x, the eigenvectors for +1 are (1,1)^T, and for -1 are (1,-1)^T, up to normalization.

So the eigenstates of A are:

|e1> = [1, 1]^T / sqrt(2)
|e2> = [1, -1]^T / sqrt(2)

So now, the state |alpha> can be expressed in terms of these eigenstates. The probability of measuring the eigenstate |e1> is the square of the amplitude of |e1> in |alpha>, and similarly for |e2>.

Wait, no. Wait, because the eigenvectors are |e1> and |e2>, so we can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |e1> and |e2>, and the coefficients squared give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate |e1> and |e2>, then square the magnitude to get the probabilities.

Wait, but let's make sure that |e1> and |e2> are orthonormal. Yes, because they're eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator and distinct eigenvalues, so they must be orthogonal.

So, let me compute the inner product of |alpha> with |e1> and |e2>.

First, |alpha> is (1+i, 2-i)^T / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent |alpha> as a vector:

|alpha> = (1+i, 2-i) / sqrt(7)

Similarly, |e1> = (1,1)/sqrt(2)
|e2> = (1,-1)/sqrt(2)

So the inner product <e1| alpha> is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1, 1) multiplied by (1+i, 2-i)/sqrt(7).

So let's compute that:

(1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i) = (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i = 3.

So the inner product is 3/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14)

The probability is the square of the modulus: (3)^2 / (14) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643. Looking at the options, option A has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, which would add to 1. Because 0.64 + 0.36 = 1, but 9/14 is about 0.642857, and the other would be 5/14, which is approximately 0.357143.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, let's compute the inner product correctly.

So <e1|alpha> is (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i) ] / sqrt(7).

Calculating the numerator: (1+i) + (2 -i) = (1 + 2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0i = 3.

So numerator is 3, denominator is sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) = sqrt(14).

So the inner product is 3/sqrt(14). The modulus squared is (3^2)/(14) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, for |e2>, the inner product is <e2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1)(1+i) + (-1)(2-i) ] / sqrt(7).

Compute the numerator: (1+i) *1 + (-1)(2 - i) = (1+i) -2 + i.

Which is 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

The modulus squared is |(-1 + 2i)|^2 / 14.

|(-1 + 2i)|^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5.

So, the probability for |e2> is 5/14 ≈ 0.357143.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357143. So the probabilities are roughly 64.28% and 35.71%, but none of the options exactly match these. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 0.64 and 0.36. 0.64 is 64%, which is about 9/14 (≈0.642857), and 0.36 is 36%, which is about 5/14 (≈0.3571), but 5/14 is about 0.3571, which is closer to 0.36, but not exact. So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.6428, which would be 0.64 if rounded, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which rounds to 0.36, so option A's first part would be correct.

Now, the average value (expectation value) of operator A is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is represented by [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], and |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T, we can compute this matrix product.

So let's compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute |alpha> as [a, b]^T, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2-i)/sqrt(7).

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So A |alpha> is [ (0*a + (ħ/2)*b ), ( (ħ/2)*a + 0*b ) ]^T.

So first component is (ħ/2) * b = (ħ/2) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7)
Second component is (ħ/2)*a = (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7)

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is a* (first component) + b* (second component).

So:

= a * ( (ħ/2)*b ) + b * ( (ħ/2)*a )

Factor out (ħ/2):

= (ħ/2) [ a*b + b*a ]

= (ħ/2) [ 2 Re(a*b*) ]

Wait, because a*b + b*a = 2 Re(a b^*). Let's compute a and b.

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So a*b^* = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

Because the conjugate of b is (2 + i)/sqrt(7).

Multiply numerator: (1+i)(2 +i) = 1*2 + 1*i + i*2 + i*i.

= 2 + i + 2i + i².

i² is -1, so 2 + 3i -1 = (1) + 3i.

So a*b^* = (1 + 3i) / 7.

The real part is 1/7, so 2 Re(a*b^*) is 2*(1/7) )= 2/7.

Wait, wait:

Wait, a*b^* is (1+i)(2+i)/(7), and (1+i)(2+i) = 1*2 + 1*i + i*2 + i*i = 2 +i +2i + i² = 2+3i + (-1) = 1 +3i. So a*b^* = (1 +3i)/7.

The real part of this is 1/7, so 2 Re(a b^*) is 2*(1/7) )= 2/7.

So, <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So the expectation value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A has average value ħ/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.643 and 5/14≈ 0.357, which rounds to 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

So option A is: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says "0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7".

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the expectation value calculation.

Alternative approach: compute <alpha| A |alpha> using the matrix elements.

So |alpha> is [a, b]^T = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

A is [[0, ħ/2],[ ħ/2, 0 ]]

So A |alpha> = [ (0 * a) + (ħ/2)*b, (ħ/2)*a + 0 * b ]^T.

So the first component is (ħ/2) * b = (ħ/2) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7)
The second component is (ħ/2) * a = (ħ/2) * (1 + i)/sqrt(7)

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is a* (first component) + b* (second component).

a* is (1-i)/sqrt(7), right? Because a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), so the conjugate is (1-i)/sqrt(7).

So:

a* * first component: [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2) * (2 - i) / sqrt(7) ) ]

= (ħ/2) * (1 - i)(2 - i) /7

Similarly, b* is (2 + i)/sqrt(7), since b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

b* * second component: [ (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2) (1 + i)/sqrt(7) )

= (ħ/2) * (2 + i)(1 + i) /7

So sum these two terms.

Compute (1 - i)(2 - i):

1*2 = 2
1*(-i) = -i
(-i)*2 = -2i
(-i)*(-i) = i² = -1

So (1-i)(2-i) = 2 -i -2i + (-1) = (2-1) + (-3i) = 1 -3i.

So the first term becomes (ħ/2) * (1 -3i)/7.

Second term: (2 + i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 + 2i +i + i².

i² is -1, so 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So the second term is (ħ/2) * (1 +3i)/7.

Adding the two terms:

(ħ/2)( (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) /7

= (ħ/2)( 2 ) /7

= (ħ/2) * 2 /7 = ħ/7.

Yes, same result. So the average value is ħ/7, which matches option A.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A is the one that has 0.64 and 0.36, and hbar/7.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state and operator. The state describing the electron is proportional to \( | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) has a matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, \( \sigma_x \), and its eigenstates are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), corresponding to the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \).

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( | \alpha \rangle \)
The given state is \( | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, we calculate the norm:

\[
\| | \alpha \rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix} 1+i \\ 2-i \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute probabilities of measuring in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring the system in \( |+x\rangle \) is the square of the magnitude of the inner product \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \):

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix} 1+i \\ 2-i \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i) \right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
(1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i) = 1 + i + 2 - i = 3.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad P(+x) = \left| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

Similarly, the probability of measuring the system in \( |-x\rangle \) is the square of the magnitude of the inner product \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \):

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix} 1+i \\ 2-i \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1)(1+i) + (-1)(2-i) \right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
(1)(1+i) + (-1)(2-i) = 1 + i - 2 + i = -1 + 2i.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad P(-x) = \left| \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + (2)^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the expectation value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using \( | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix} 1+i \\ 2-i \end{bmatrix} \) and \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), we compute:

\[
A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix} 1+i \\ 2-i \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix} 2-i \\ 1+i \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Then:

\[
\langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix} 1-i & 2+i \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix} 2-i \\ 1+i \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)}{7} \right).
\]

Compute each term:

\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 2 - i - 2i + i^2 = 2 - 3i - 1 = 1 - 3i,
\]
\[
(2+i)(1+i) = 2 + 2i + i + i^2 = 2 + 3i - 1 = 1 + 3i.
\]

Adding these:

\[
(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively. The expectation value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
