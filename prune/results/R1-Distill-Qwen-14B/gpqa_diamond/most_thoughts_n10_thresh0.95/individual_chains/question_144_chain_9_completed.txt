Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's think this through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like decay length = c * τ * β, where τ is the lifetime, c is the speed of light, and β is the velocity over the speed of light.

But how do I find τ? I think the lifetime is related to the width Γ through the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the lifetime and energy uncertainty (which is Γ) are inversely related. The formula is τ ≈ ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but let me make sure the units are right here.

So Γ is given as 320 MeV. I know that ħ has units of GeV·s when using natural units, but wait, no, actually, in particle physics, energies and lifetimes are connected using ħ c, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the natural unit system (like in particle physics) uses ħ = c = 1. So the relation between width and lifetime would be τ ≈ 1 / Γ, but the units would be in GeV^-1. Oh, so I need to convert that into seconds. Because 1 GeV^-1 is a certain number of seconds.

But wait, I think the general formula is τ = ħ / (Γ), but let's check the units.

The width Γ is given in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Let's compute this. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, calculating that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's see. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, to find the decay length, which is L = c * τ * β. But wait, what's β?

Beta is the ratio of the particle's velocity to the speed of light. Since X is a meson, it's a boson, but I think for high-energy particles, beta is approximately 1. So I can approximate β ≈ 1.

So L ≈ c * τ. Oh wait no, wait. Because the mean lifetime is τ, and velocity is approximately c, so the distance would be c * τ.

So c is about 3e8 m/s. So let's compute L = c * τ.

L = (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Wait, that's 6.17e-16 meters. But looking at the options, they are all around 4e-15 or 5e-15 or similar. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach. Maybe I should calculate the velocity beta more accurately. Because beta isn't exactly 1, especially if the particle is not ultra-relativistic.

Wait, but 8 GeV production energy and a mass of 1.2 GeV suggests that the particle is highly relativistic. Because the energy is much larger than the rest mass. So E ≈ pc when E >> m. So p = E/c. But let's compute beta.

Beta is v/c. The relativistic relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So p c = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) / c^2? Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute beta as:

gamma = E / (m c^2). So gamma is E / (m c^2). Let's compute gamma.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma ≈ 6.6667.

Then, beta can be found from gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/gamma. So 1 - beta^2 = 1/(gamma^2), so beta^2 = 1 - 1/(gamma^2) = (gamma^2 - 1)/gamma^2.

gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is about 44.4444. So beta squared is (44.4444 -1)/44.4444 = 43.4444 /44.4444 ≈ 0.97777.

So beta is sqrt(0.97777) ≈ 0.9888. So beta is approximately 0.9888, which is close to 1 but slightly less.

So in that case, the decay length L = c * tau * beta.

Wait, so tau is 2.056875e-24 s, and beta is 0.9888. So L = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9888.

Compute that: 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16, then multiply by 0.9888: about 6.170625e-16 * 0.9888 ≈ 6.105e-16 meters.

Hmm, that's 6.1e-16 m. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, another approach: the relation between the width and the lifetime is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think I might have the formula wrong. Let me think again. The natural unit system uses ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

So with Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV, so tau is (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's correct.

So then L = c * tau * beta.

Wait, but the options are in the order of 1e-15 meters, and my calculation is 6e-16 meters, but that's close to option D: 4.0655e-16 m. But my calculation is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong gamma. Let's double-check the gamma calculation.

E = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, so E = 8 GeV, m c^2 = 1.2 GeV.

So gamma = E / (m c^2) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So that's correct. So beta is about 0.9888, as I did earlier.

Wait, maybe the production energy is different from the meson's energy? Or perhaps I should compute the meson's velocity using E being the total energy.

Wait, perhaps the meson's energy is E_X =8 GeV. So E = gamma m c^2, so gamma is 8 /1.2 = 6.6667. So correct.

An alternative approach: using the formula for mean decay length. Mean decay length L is c * tau * beta, which is (c tau) * beta.

Wait, c tau is the mean decay length if beta is 1. If beta is less than 1, then L is less than c tau.

Wait, let me compute c tau: c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So c tau = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.1706e-16 meters.

Now multiply by beta: 6.1706e-16 * 0.9888 ≈ 6.105e-16 m. But the options don't have that.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D, 4.0655e-16. Hmm, but that's about 2/3 of my calculation. So maybe I miscalculated beta.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating beta. Let's compute it more accurately.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

gamma squared is (6.6666667)^2 = 44.444444.

So beta squared is (gamma^2 -1)/gamma^2 = (44.444444 -1) /44.444444 = 43.444444 /44.444444 = approximately 0.9777777.

So beta is sqrt(0.9777777) ≈ 0.988838.

So beta is about 0.988838.

Wait, and so L = c tau beta = 6.1706e-16 m * 0.988838 ≈ 6.105e-16 m.

Hmm, but none of the options are close to that. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of tau.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. I remember that for a particle moving with velocity v, the mean decay length is L = gamma c tau.

Wait, because L = gamma v tau. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1-beta^2), and v = beta c. So L = gamma * beta c tau. Hmm, or wait, tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the rest frame. The dilated lifetime is gamma tau. So L = v * gamma tau.

Wait, wait, let's clarify.

The mean proper lifetime is tau. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. And the distance is velocity times time: v * gamma tau. So L = gamma tau v.

But v is beta c, so L = gamma tau beta c.

But another way, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

But in any case, perhaps I should compute gamma beta.

Because gamma times beta is equal to (gamma) * (sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)).

Alternatively, gamma beta = sqrt( (gamma^2) (1 - 1/gamma^2) ) = sqrt( gamma^2 -1 ).

Wait, gamma beta = sqrt(gamma^2 -1). Because gamma^2 beta^2 = gamma^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2) )= gamma^2 -1.

So sqrt(gamma^2 -1) = gamma beta.

In our case, gamma is 6.6666667, so gamma^2 is 44.444444.

So sqrt(44.444444 -1) = sqrt(43.444444) ≈ 6.589.

So gamma beta ≈6.589.

So L = gamma beta c tau.

So tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

c tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.1706e-16 m.

Then, L = 6.589 * 6.1706e-16 m.

Wait, that can't be right because that would be 4.065e-15 meters.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, L = gamma beta * c tau.

Wait, wait, c tau is (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) =6.1706e-16 m.

Then, L = gamma beta * (c tau). But wait, gamma beta is 6.589, so 6.589 * 6.1706e-16 m =4.065e-15 m. Oh, which matches option C:5.0223e-15, or option B:4.0655e-15.

Wait, 4.065e-15 m is option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, so I must have messed up the formula earlier. Because earlier I thought L = c tau beta, but perhaps the correct formula is L = gamma beta c tau.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The proper lifetime is tau. The lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma tau. The velocity is beta c. So the decay length is v * gamma tau = beta c gamma tau.

Which is L = beta gamma c tau.

So with beta gamma being sqrt(gamma^2 -1), which is 6.589.

So L = 6.589 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) 

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, c tau is 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 =6.1706e-16 m.

Then L = 6.589 * 6.1706e-16 m =4.065e-15 meters.

So that's 4.065e-15 m, which is option B:4.0655 *10^-15 m.

But wait, why do I suddenly have a different approach? Let me think again about the basics.

The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. The velocity is beta c, so the mean decay length is L = velocity × lifetime = beta c × gamma tau.

So L = beta gamma c tau.

Alternatively, L = gamma beta c tau.

So, yes, that's the correct formula. So my initial approach of L = c tau beta was correct, but perhaps I should have considered the gamma factor. Wait, because tau in the rest frame is the proper lifetime, so when you boost to the lab frame, the lifetime becomes gamma tau.

So the decay length is v * t, where t is the lab frame time. The lab frame time is gamma tau. v = beta c.

So L = beta c gamma tau.

Which is the same as gamma beta c tau.

So let me compute this.

gamma beta =6.589, as before.

c tau = 6.1706e-16 m.

So L = 6.589 * 6.1706e-16 = let's compute 6.589 *6.1706e-16.

6 *6.1706e-16 is 3.702e-15, 0.589 *6.1706e-16 is about 3.634e-16.

Adding them together: 3.702e-15 + 3.634e-16 = approximately 4.065e-15 meters.

So the correct answer is option B:4.0655 * 10^-15 m.

So looking back, the options are:

A)5.0223e-16,

B)4.0655e-15,

C)5.0223e-15,

D)4.0655e-16.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy of the meson, and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) is its mass. Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.977777} \approx 0.9888
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \gamma \beta \)
The product \( \gamma \beta \) is:

\[
\gamma \beta = \sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1} = \sqrt{(6.6667)^2 - 1} = \sqrt{44.4444 - 1} = \sqrt{43.4444} \approx 6.589
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \gamma \beta = 6.589 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.589 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Then, multiply by \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
L = 6.589 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} = 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**
