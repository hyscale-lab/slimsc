Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through. The question is about identifying the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me break it down.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different A and B reagents.

Hmm, so starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is acetone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. When ketones react with something like NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- which is a nucleophile. So in a ketone, the carbonyl group (C=O) is attacked by the CN-.

But wait, what's the product here? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The molecule would have a nitrile group (CN) attached to a carbon which is also connected to a hydroxyl (OH) and a methyl group (CH3), and another CH2 group maybe.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it adds CN- as a nucleophile, the mechanism should be nucleophilic addition. The CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, forming a new bond and the oxygen would have a negative charge, which then gets protonated. But wait, what about after that? Oh, right, in such reactions, like the addition of HCN to ketones, the product is a cyanohydrin.

So the product of adding CN- to a ketone is a cyanohydrin, which has the structure R2C(OH)CN. Wait, but in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see. So butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product should be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons, but in the product, the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but the name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on the first carbon, and the hydroxyl and methyl on the second. So the structure is CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait no, butane is four carbons. So it's:

The nitrile is on carbon 1: CN
Then carbon 2: has a hydroxyl (OH) and a methyl (CH3) group.
Then a CH2 and a CH3? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me just think about the reaction.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one (acetone) reacts with NaCN (a source of CN-) in the presence of reagent A. The product is a cyanohydrin.

So for the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone, the typical reagent is HCN, but here it's NaCN. But NaCN in water might not be enough, since it's a weak nucleophile in aqueous solution. Or maybe in the presence of an acid catalyst, like H3O+? Because in acid, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic, making the nucleophilic attack easier.

Wait, but sometimes, when NaCN is used, maybe it's in a polar aprotic solvent with a base, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, the reaction of ketones with HCN (or CN-) gives a cyanohydrin. HCN is a weak acid, so in a solution that is acidic, the CN- would be protonated to HCN, which is a weaker nucleophile. That's not helpful. Wait, no, wait: maybe the reaction is more efficient under basic conditions. Or perhaps in a solution where the CN- is deprotonated. But in aqueous solution, CN- is a weak base, so maybe you need an acid catalyst to help the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses a source of CN- and an acid. Wait, but in the first step, the product is a cyanohydrin, which is formed when the ketone undergoes nucleophilic addition with CN-.

So the general reaction is:

R2CO + CN- → R2C(OH)CN

But for this to happen, maybe the conditions are acidic. I think that in the presence of an acid, the carbonyl is protonated, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack.

So reagent A might be something that provides an acidic environment. Let's look at the options. The options for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

H3O+ is a strong acid, so that would make sense for providing the acidic conditions needed to protonate the carbonyl group, making the nucleophilic attack by CN- easier. Alternatively, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ (acidic) as well as SO3^2- which is a good nucleophile, but in this case, perhaps the H+ is the key.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses HCN, but in this case, the reagent is NaCN and another acid. So, perhaps the solution is that A is H3O+, making an acidic environment for the nucleophilic addition.

So in the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the starting material is a nitrile group (CN) attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group and a benzyl group. The product is a carboxylic acid (COOH) on that same carbon, along with the hydroxyl and benzyl groups.

So, the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? The typical way is hydrolysis of the nitrile. The hydrolysis of nitriles can be done under acidic or basic conditions. Let me think.

In acidic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. But in basic conditions, they hydrolyze to carboxylates, which can then be acidified. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl with heat can lead to the formation of the carboxylic acid.

So the reagent B must provide the acidic environment for this hydrolysis. The options for B are HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid). HCl is a strong acid, which would provide the necessary H+ ions for the hydrolysis. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so perhaps it's not strong enough unless heated or under certain conditions.

Wait, but the reaction is written as reacting with B (H2O). So perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. Nitrile hydrolysis usually requires water in the presence of an acid or base catalyst, possibly with heat.

So for the second reaction, the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid, reagent B is likely a strong acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have B as HCl and CH3COOH. Let's think: which is more likely to be the right catalyst for this reaction?

Strong acid like HCl would be better for hydrolyzing nitriles to carboxylic acids. So B would be HCl.

Wait, but in the options, each option pairs A and B. Let me look at the options.

Option A: A = H3O+, B= HCl.

Option B: A = H3O+, B= CH3COOH.

Option C: A= NaHSO3, B= HCl.

Option D: A= NaHSO3, B= CH3COOH.

So if the first reaction requires A to be H3O+, that would mean options A or B. The second reaction requires B to be HCl. So that would make option A correct (A=H3O+, B=HCl).

Alternatively, let me check. Wait, in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. So the actual reagent is H2O, but perhaps the reaction requires acid catalysis. So the reagent B is HCl, which would provide the acidic condition for the hydrolysis.

So, putting it all together, the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, and the second uses HCl as B. So the correct option is option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one (acetone) to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the presence of NaCN and reagent A. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where CN⁻ acts as the nucleophile, forming a cyanohydrin. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acidic environment is required to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent A to provide the necessary acidic conditions.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid. Such hydrolysis typically requires an acidic catalyst to facilitate the reaction. Among the options, HCl (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent B to provide the necessary acidic environment for the hydrolysis.

Based on the analysis, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
