Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says it's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. The mass is negligible, so maybe I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I have to choose between A, B, C, D.

Wait, energy in a system of charges usually refers to electrostatic potential energy. Because if all the charges are fixed, there's no kinetic energy involved. So I should calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the system.

Electrostatic potential energy for a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But since the charges are identical and all are either at P or at 2m from P, I should calculate the potential energy between each pair.

The formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, for multiple charges, you have to consider each pair. So in this case, there are two groups: the 12 charges at 2m and the 13th at P.

So I think I need to calculate two parts: the potential energy between the 12 charges at 2m and the fixed charge at P, and the potential energy between all pairs of the 12 charges themselves.

Let me structure this:

1. The energy between the fixed charge at P (let's call it Q) and each of the 12 charges at 2m distance (each q). So each of these 12 pairs contributes U1 = k*(Q*q)/(r).

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total for this part would be 12 * U1.

2. The energy between all pairs of the 12 charges at 2m apart. Each of these 12 charges is at the same point or same distance from each other? Wait, wait, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are on a sphere of radius 2m around P. Therefore, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, but what about the distance between any two of the 12 charges?

Oh wait, wait. The problem says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So, each charge is at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other are not specified. However, the minimum potential energy would occur when the charges are as far apart as possible from each other. Wait, no, wait: for like charges, to minimize the potential energy, you want them as far away as possible. Because potential energy for like charges is positive, so minimizing it would mean arranging them where their mutual repulsion is the least, which would be when they're as far apart as possible.

Wait, but in this case, the 12 charges are at fixed points 2m from P. So their positions are on a sphere. What's the minimum potential energy for them? Since all are the same charge, to minimize the potential energy (which is a sum of pairwise potentials), we need to arrange them in a way that the sum of 1/r terms is minimized.

Wait, but wait. Since all the 12 charges are identical and fixed at 2m from P, their positions relative to each other can vary. The potential energy between any two of them depends on their separation. So if we can arrange them such that each pair is as far apart as possible, then the potential energy would be minimized because each term 1/r would be smaller, making each U positive but the sum as small as possible.

Wait, but the minimal potential energy would actually occur when the potential energy is as negative as possible, but wait, in this case, all charges are positive? Wait, no, the problem says each has charge 2e, which is positive if e is the elementary charge (which it is, 1.6e-19 C). So, all 12 charges are positive.

Wait, wait a minute, if all the charges are positive, then the potential energy between each pair is positive because U = k*(q1*q2)/r, and both are positive. So, the potential energy is positive, and we want the sum to be as small as possible (since it's the total potential energy of the system). So, to minimize the potential energy, we need to minimize the sum of these positive terms. To do that, we want each pair to be as far apart as possible, because that makes each term smaller.

But since all the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P, their positions are on a sphere of radius 2m. The maximum separation between any two charges would be when they are diametrically opposed, so 4m apart. But arranging all 12 to be as far apart as possible isn't straightforward; perhaps the minimal potential energy would be when they form a regular icosahedron or something, but I'm not sure. Wait, but the problem states that the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P. Wait, no, the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. So, their mutual distances can vary, but the distance from P is fixed.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, so perhaps we can assume that each of the 12 charges is at the same distance from each other as 2m? No, that's not possible because if they're all on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two would be more than zero but less than 4m.

Wait, but the problem requires the minimal energy. So perhaps the minimal potential energy configuration is when all the 12 charges are as far apart as possible, which would mean that each pair is as far apart as possible. But I'm not sure how to calculate that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, and the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is not considered, but that seems unlikely. Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy of the entire system. So perhaps I should consider both the potential energy between the 12 charges and the fixed charge, and also the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Let me think. The total potential energy U_total is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So:

U_total = U_between_12_and_fixed + U_between_12_charges.

So, U_between_12_and_fixed: each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the fixed charge. So each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). But wait, the fixed charge is only one, so it's 12 pairs.

Wait, each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge. So that's 12 * [k*(2e)(2e) / (2m)].

Wait, let me
