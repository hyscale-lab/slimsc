Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you consider all possible higher-dimensional operators that could be added to the Standard Model Lagrangian, respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries exactly must these operators respect?

The question lists four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The options are combinations of these. I think I need to remember what each symmetry entails and which ones are automatically respected by the SMEFT construction.

First, let me recall what each symmetry is. Lorentz symmetry has to do with how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames, involving transformations like boosts, rotations, etc. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity symmetry. CPT symmetry combines Charge, Parity, and Time reversal, and is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, especially those with spin-½ particles.

In SMEFT, operators are classified by their dimension and the fields they involve. But when you construct these operators, you have to ensure that the theory remains consistent. I remember that SMEFT operators are built respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the SM itself has certain symmetries, like gauge invariance (SU(2), SU(3), U(1)), Lorentz invariance, and others.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is definitely one of the big ones. Because the SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory, any effective operator should preserve that. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. That means option 1 is definitely in the correct answer.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But wait, SMEFT is an effective theory, which is usually considered in a low-energy or effective field theory (EFT) sense. EFTs can have operators of higher dimensions, but are they necessarily Poincare-invariant? Well, I think that in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to be Lorentz invariant, but Poincare symmetry might not necessarily be preserved because effective operators can involve terms that break translation invariance. Wait, no. Wait, translation invariance is part of Poincare symmetry, so if the theory is a Lorentz-invariant EFT, it's also translation-invariant, meaning it's Poincare-invariant. Because the effective theory is built in such a way as to maintain the same symmetries as the underlying theory. Since the Standard Model is Poincare-invariant, the SMEFT should also respect that. So operator terms in SMEFT should be Poincare-invariant. So option 2 (Poincare symmetry) must also be respected. So both 1 and 2 are correct. Wait, but I'm not so sure about this. Because in EFTs, sometimes you have operators that aren't Poincare-invariant. Wait, no. Wait, when you add operators, each operator must individually be Poincare-invariant. Because otherwise, the theory would not make sense. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, meaning 2 is correct. So any operator in the SMEFT must be Poincare-symmetric.

Wait, but wait. Poincare symmetry includes not just Lorentz and translations, but also the combination, like boosts and so on. So if an operator is Lorentz-invariant, is it automatically Poincare-invariant? Or is it the other way around? Hmm. I think that because the operators are in a field theory, they must be Poincare-invariant. So I think both 1 and 2 are correct. So the SMEFT respects both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry.

Next, CP symmetry. The SM is not CP-symmetric, right? Because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So in the SM, you have CP violation. Therefore, the SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP symmetry because the underlying theory doesn't. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, so not all operators must respect CP. So option 3 (CP symmetry) is not necessarily a symmetry that must be respected.

Wait, but wait. The SMEFT is supposed to include all possible operators that are consistent with the symmetries of the SM. Wait, no. The SM doesn't have CP symmetry, so the SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP. So the operators don't have to be CP-symmetric. Therefore, option 3 is not a symmetry that must be respected. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, so not all operators must respect it. So answer is that 3 is not a required symmetry.

Now, CPT symmetry. The SM is a CPT-symmetric theory. I remember that in quantum field theory, especially for theories with spin-½ particles, CPT symmetry is a fundamental requirement. So the SMEFT must also respect CPT symmetry because the underlying theory does. So any operator in SMEFT must be such that when you apply CPT, the operator transforms in a way consistent with the theory.

Wait, but wait. For each operator, you can have it or its CPT-conjugate. Because if an operator is allowed, so is its CPT-conjugate. So the operators don't necessarily have to be CPT-symmetric themselves, but the theory as a whole must respect CPT symmetry. Hmm, I think that the SMEFT requires that all terms are such that the entire Lagrangian is CPT-invariant. So the operators must appear in pairs that are CPT-conjugates. But each individual operator doesn't have to be CPT-symmetric. So the question is about whether all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

Wait, the question is, which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So for each operator, when you apply the symmetry, it must transform appropriately. Or perhaps it's that the Lagrangian must transform in a certain way. Maybe each operator is written in a way that respects the symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT operators must be individually CPT-invariant. Because in the effective theory, which is a Lorentz-invariant theory, each operator must have a CPT transformation that leaves it invariant. Or maybe not. Wait, I think that for the effective theory to be CPT-invariant, the sum of the operators must transform in a way that the theory remains consistent. That doesn't necessarily mean each operator must be CPT-invariant, but that their combination must be. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The SMEFT is an effective theory that must be consistent with the underlying QFT (like the SM). So if the SM respects CPT, the SMEFT must as well. Therefore, any operator added must not violate CPT. But does that mean that each operator must respect CPT? Or can they violate CPT as long as the sum doesn't?

Wait, no. Because individual operators can have terms that are not CPT-invariant, but when combined, the entire Lagrangian remains CPT-invariant. But I think that's not how it works. Because the effective theory must be CPT-invariant, so each operator must be part of a set that ensures this. But operators in the SMEFT are typically written as renormalizable operators, each of which is CPT-invariant on its own. Or perhaps not necessarily.

Wait, for example, the operator (Dμ ψ)† D^μ ψ is CPT-invariant. But operators like ψ† ψ are not, but they are not allowed because they would violate other symmetries. Hmm, perhaps all the operators are individually CPT-invariant.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the key point is that CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in the effective theory, so all operators must be CPT-invariant. So option 4 (CPT symmetry) must be respected by all operators.

So putting it all together:

1. Lorentz symmetry: must be respected. Correct.

2. Poincare symmetry: must be respected. Correct.

3. CP symmetry: not necessarily. SM doesn't have it, so operators can violate it. So incorrect.

4. CPT symmetry: must be respected. Correct.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1,2,4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Poincare symmetry is automatically included if Lorentz and translations are considered. So if the operators must respect Poincare symmetry, then option 2 is correct. So the correct answer would include 1,2,4.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Which is option C.

Wait, but I'm not certain about option 2. Do the operators have to individually respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translation symmetry. In the SMEFT, operators are written in a way that their form is invariant under Lorentz transformations. But for translation invariance, the operators are local, so each operator is a local term, which respects translation invariance. So yeah, the operators must be Poincare-invariant.

Thus, the correct answer should include 1,2,4. So the option C) 1,2,4.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian while respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model (SM) is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and SMEFT extends the SM by adding operators that must preserve this symmetry. Operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz-invariant, so Lorentz symmetry must be respected. **Correct**.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT is an effective field theory, its operators are local and respect translation invariance. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry must also be respected. **Correct**.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM is not CP-symmetric due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. Since SMEFT includes all possible operators consistent with the SM symmetries, it does not require CP symmetry to be preserved. Operators in SMEFT can violate CP. **Incorrect**.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM is CPT-symmetric, and SMEFT must respect this symmetry as it is an effective theory of the SM. While individual operators may not be CPT-invariant, the entire theory must remain CPT-invariant. Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected. **Correct**.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct combination is **1, 2, 4**.

**Answer: C**
