Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about a chemical reaction involving Substance X and Liquid Y. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question says that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an isotope that's heavier than the usual. That suggests maybe something like chlorine, which has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37, or something similar.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule must be something like H2O, but wait, H2O has 8 neutrons (oxygen has 8) and 2 H which have 0 each. No, that's not right. Maybe something else. Oh wait, what about NH3? No, NH3 has 14 neutrons (N has 7, H has 0 each) and 14 protons (N has 7, H each has 1, so 7 +3=10 protons? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe the molecule is CH4? No, CH4 would have 6 protons (from C) plus 4 H, so 10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, H is 0. So 6. So 10 vs 6, no. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the gas is CO2? No, because CO2 has 12 protons (C) + 16 (O) ×2. Wait, total protons would be 12 + 16×2 = 44. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 each. So total neutrons: 6 + 8×2=22. Not same as protons.

Hmm, perhaps the gas is something like O2? O2 has 16×2=32, so 32 protons and 32 neutrons (since O is 8 protons and 8 neutrons each). Oh wait, because each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Oh wait, same number of protons and neutrons. So that fits. So W is O2? But wait, O2 is a diatomic gas,
