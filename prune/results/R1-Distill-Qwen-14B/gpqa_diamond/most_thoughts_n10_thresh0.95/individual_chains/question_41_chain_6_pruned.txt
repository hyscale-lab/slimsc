Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that in a medium, the speed of light is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. But wait, that's the speed in the medium when it's at rest. What happens when the medium itself is moving? Oh right, this probably involves some kind of relativistic consideration, but wait, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, according to Einstein's theory. But here the medium is moving, so maybe the speed of light in the medium as observed from the lab frame changes?

Wait a second, no. Because the speed of light in a vacuum is always c regardless of the observer's frame. But wait, in this problem, the light is inside a moving medium (glass). So the speed of the light relative to the lab would depend on both the medium's motion and the light's speed within it. Oh, but wait, the light's speed in the glass isn't v_glass = c/n in the glass's rest frame, but how does that translate when the glass is moving?

So maybe I should think about it using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and light is moving at u' = c/n in the glass's frame. So I need to find u, the speed of the light in the lab frame, using the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² ). But wait, that's when you're moving from one frame to another. So in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light's speed in the glass frame is u' = c/n. But wait, the direction here is important. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then in the glass frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

Wait, let me clarify the directions. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So when the glass is moving towards the observer, the light is moving towards the observer as well, but perhaps with a speed that's less than c because it's in the glass.

Wait, no. The light is propagating through the glass towards the observer, and the glass itself is moving towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and within the glass, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n towards the observer.

Wait, but in the glass's rest frame, the light moves at c/n towards the observer. So to find the speed in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, I need to apply a Lorentz transformation.

Wait, but wait, the lab frame is the stationary frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, so the glass's rest frame is moving at speed v relative to the lab. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u' = c/n towards the observer (same direction as the glass's motion). So to find u, the speed in the lab frame, we use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

But wait, in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, so the lab is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the lab frame as the rest frame, and the glass as moving at velocity v towards the observer.

In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is u' = c/n towards the observer (same direction as the glass's motion in the lab frame). So when we apply the velocity addition formula, we'll use u' and v to find the lab frame speed u.

So substituting into the formula:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² )

But c is given as 1 in this problem, so c=1. So the denominator becomes 1 + u' * v.

So u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v )

Since u' is c/n, which is 1/n.

So substituting u' = 1/n:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

Let me compute that.

Numerator: (1 + n v ) / n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So the entire expression becomes [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ) ].

The n denominators cancel, so numerator is (1 + n v) and denominator is (n +v). So u = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, so that would match option A, which is (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, but wait, what if the glass is moving towards the observer and the light is moving in the same direction. Does that affect the sign? Let me think about the signs. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer as well, then both v and u' are positive in the same direction. So their sum is positive. So the calculation as done earlier should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the medium is moving, the observed speed inside is (c/n) + v, but that's only in the non-relativistic case, which would just be option B if v is zero, but the options don't have that. Wait, no. Let me think. If the medium is moving at velocity v, and the light's speed in the medium is (c/n), then in the lab frame, the light's speed would be (c/n) + v. But wait, only if velocities are additive classically. That would be the case when v is much less than c. But that would give (1/n) + v, which would be (1 + n v)/n. But that's not one of the options. Wait, option A is (1 +n v)/(n + v), which is different.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the velocity addition would be u = u' + v. So if u' is (1/n), then u would be (1/n) + v. But that's different from option A's numerator and denominator.

Wait, but according to our earlier relativistic calculation, we get (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that's option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. Let me think again. Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, so in the lab frame, the glass is approaching the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass, which is towards the observer. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at u'=c/n towards the observer. So when the glass is moving at v towards the observer, the lab frame would see the light moving at (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² ), as per the velocity addition.

So with u'=1/n, v positive, the calculation leads to (1/n + v)/(1 + (v)/(n)). Wait, because u' * v is (1/n)*v = v/n.

Wait, let me recompute:

u = (u' + v) / [ 1 + (u’ * v) ]

u’ = 1/n, so:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (v/n) )

We can factor the denominator as (n + v)/n, so denominator is (n + v)/n.

So u = [ (1 + n v
