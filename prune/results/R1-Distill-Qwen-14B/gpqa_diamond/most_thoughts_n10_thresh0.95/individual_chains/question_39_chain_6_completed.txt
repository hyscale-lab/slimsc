Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's read it again. 

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region. 

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, no, that can't be right because the wave function must be continuous and probably normalized. But in reality, the wave function should be zero outside the allowed region if the particle is confined there. 

Wait, maybe the given wave function isn't the actual wave function but a part of it. Because the wave function is described as that in a part of space where the particle can exist. So, maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So, the correct wave function must have nodes outside this interval.

But wait, the way the question is phrased, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i in the region where the particle can exist. And the particle was found only between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero outside of that. 

Wait, but the given expression for the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that looks like a complex number. Because i is the imaginary unit. Oh wait, that might be an issue because the wave function needs to have a non-zero probability amplitude where the particle exists. But having an imaginary component would complicate normalization unless perhaps the real and imaginary parts are part of a larger wave function. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function. But probably, the wave function should be real in this case because it's a stationary state or something. Or maybe it's a typo, and the 0.5i is part of the denominator? Or perhaps the expression is a/sqrt(1+x) minus 0.5i, but that would make the wave function complex. 

Wait, but the wave function can be complex. So maybe that's okay. But the modulus squared will be the probability density. So the modulus of the wave function is |a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i|. Hmm, but then the probability density would be [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because when you square a complex number, (a + ib)^2 is a² + b² if a and b are real. Wait, no, the modulus squared is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 because (a + ib)(a - ib) is a² + b². So, the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But in the regions where the particle is not found (x <1 and x>3), the wave function must be zero. So, the wave function must be zero outside x=1 to x=3. But the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that suggests that the wave function is non-zero only in a certain region. Wait but when x approaches 1, sqrt(1+1) is sqrt(2), so 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, but the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the given expression is only valid for x between 1 and 3. So, for x <1 or x>3, the wave function is zero. But the given wave function, when x is outside, would that be zero?

No, because for x <1, 1+x is less than 2, but the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Which is non-zero. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3, and the given expression is valid only in that region. So the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1<=x<=3, and zero elsewhere.

But then, the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because when you measure the position, all the particles are found in this region, so the total probability is 1.

So let's write down the probability density as |psi(x)|^2 = (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2.

Which is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

The integral from x=1 to x=3 of this must be 1.

So,

Integral [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

We can split this into two integrals:

a² * integral (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 * integral (1) dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

So,

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), and ln(2) is subtracted, so 2 ln(2) - ln(2)=ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So,

a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute that. ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a² ≈ 0.7213, so a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Close to 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.69314718056.

So 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root: sqrt(0.7213) is about 0.849. So yes, approximately 0.85.

So the correct answer is option B) 0.85.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given wave function and use normalization to determine the value of \( a \). The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), and it must be normalized such that the total probability is 1. Thus, we integrate \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx \)
2. \( 0.25 \int_1^3 1 dx \)

For the first integral, \( \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \) evaluated from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):

\[
\ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

Thus, the first term becomes \( a^2 \ln(2) \).

For the second integral, \( \int_1^3 1 dx = 3 - 1 = 2 \), so the second term is \( 0.25 \times 2 = 0.5 \).

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is closest to \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option B.

**Answer: B**
