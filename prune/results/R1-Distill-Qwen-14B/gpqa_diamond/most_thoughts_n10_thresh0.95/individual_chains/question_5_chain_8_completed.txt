Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector is +ħ/2. 

Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P might represent components of angular momentum. Oh right, because spin operators usually have that structure. So the operator P here is probably the spin operator component along the direction n.

The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write down the given matrices.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. That's the Pauli Z matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, but the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n must be something like (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane. So the operator P would be along this direction, which can be written as P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, right? Because the direction is arbitrary but lies in x-z, so no y-component.

Wait, wait. So the operator we're considering is P·n_hat, where n_hat is the unit vector in the direction of n. Since n is in the x-z plane, n can be written as (a, 0, b), and the unit vector would be (a/sqrt(a² + b²), 0, b/sqrt(a² + b²)). But for an arbitrary direction, perhaps parametrized by an angle θ. Let me think: in the x-z plane, the direction can be expressed using an angle θ from the z-axis. So, n_hat would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle, so x = sinθ cosφ, but since φ is zero here (because in x-z plane), x is sinθ and z is cosθ.

Wait, but the operator in the direction n is P·n_hat. So P·n_hat = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, this becomes P·n_hat = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

And the eigenvalue equation is (P·n_hat) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the operator is (sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z) and it's being applied to the eigenvector |ψ> to give (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, but let me write the matrices. Since each component is multiplied by ħ/2, let me factor that out. So P_x = (ħ/2)σ_x, P_z = (ħ/2)σ_z, where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

So P·n_hat = (sinθ)(ħ/2 σ_x) + (cosθ)(ħ/2 σ_z) = (ħ/2) (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z).

So the operator is (ħ/2) (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z).

The eigenvalue equation is then:

(ħ/2) (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the equation should be:

(ħ/2) (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) (1) |ψ>.

Wait, so I can divide both sides by (ħ/2):

(sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So the eigenvalue equation is (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) |ψ> = 1 |ψ>.

Hmm, so I'm looking for eigenvectors of the matrix M = sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, let me write out M. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So,

M = sinθ [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which gives:

M = [[ cosθ, sinθ ],
     [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me do the matrix multiplication correctly.

Each element:

M[0][0] = sinθ * 0 + cosθ *1 = cosθ.

M[0][1] = sinθ *1 + cosθ * 0 = sinθ.

M[1][0] = same as M[0][1] because σ_x is symmetric. So M[1][0] = sinθ.

M[1][1] = sinθ *0 + cosθ * (-1) = -cosθ.

Wait, wait, the σ_z matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so when multiplied by cosθ, it becomes [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]].

Adding to σ_x multiplied by sinθ, which is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]], so summing:

M becomes:

[ [ cosθ + 0, 0 + sinθ ],
  [ sinθ +0, 0 + (-cosθ) ] ]

So M is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Because σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so when multiplied by cosθ, it's [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. Then σ_x * sinθ is [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]]. So adding the two matrices:

cosθ in (1,1), sinθ in (1,2) and (2,1), and -cosθ in (2,2).

So M is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So now, to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

The eigenvalue equation is M |ψ> = 1 |ψ>, or (M - I)|ψ> = 0.

So let's write M - I:

[ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

The determinant of this matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

So determinant = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = 0.

Let me compute this.

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = ( -cos²θ -cosθ + cosθ + 1 ) = (-cos²θ +1 ) = sin²θ.

Then subtracting (sinθ)^2: sin²θ - sin²θ = 0. So the determinant is zero as expected.

So the equations are:

(cosθ -1) x + sinθ y = 0

sinθ x + (-cosθ -1) y = 0

Let me write the first equation:

(cosθ - 1) x + sinθ y = 0 --> equation 1.

And the second equation:

sinθ x + (-cosθ -1) y = 0 --> equation 2.

So equation 1 is (cosθ -1) x = - sinθ y.

Assuming y is not zero, we can write x = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] y.

Simplify the expression for x in terms of y.

Wait, cosθ -1 is the denominator. Let me compute -sinθ/(cosθ - 1).

Hmm, I can factor out a negative from denominator: (cosθ -1) = -(1 - cosθ).

So -sinθ / ( -(1 - cosθ) ) = sinθ/(1 - cosθ).

So x = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] y.

Hmm, perhaps we can write this as x = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] y.

I remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So substituting:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin²(θ/2)] ) = [cos(θ/2)] / [sin(θ/2)] = cot(θ/2).

So x = cot(θ/2) y.

So x = [cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2)] y.

So the ratio x/y is cot(θ/2). So let's set y = sin(θ/2) * a, then x = cos(θ/2) a, where a is a normalization factor.

Wait, let me see: Let me represent the eigenvector as [x, y]^T.

Then x = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] y = cot(θ/2) y.

So, let me write x = [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) ] y.

Let me choose y = sin(θ/2) * k, then x = cos(θ/2) *k.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2) k, sin(θ/2) k ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me see. Let me set y = k sin(θ/2) --> then x = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * k sin(θ/2) ) = k cos(θ/2).

So the vector is [ k cos(θ/2), k sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, that would make the vector [k cos(θ/2), k sin(θ/2)]. But let's plug into equation 2 to verify.

Equation 2: sinθ x + (-cosθ -1) y = 0.

Substituting x= k cos(θ/2), y = k sin(θ/2).

So sinθ * k cos(θ/2) + (-cosθ -1) * k sin(θ/2) = 0.

Factor out k:

k [ sinθ cos(θ/2) + (-cosθ -1) sin(θ/2) ] = 0.

Let me compute the terms inside.

First term: sinθ cos(θ/2).

We know that sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So sinθ cos(θ/2) = 2 sin(θ/2) cos²(θ/2).

Second term: (-cosθ -1) sin(θ/2).

We can write cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) -1. So cosθ + 1 = 2 cos²(θ/2).

So (-cosθ -1) = - (cosθ +1) = -2 cos²(θ/2).

So the second term becomes (-2 cos²(θ/2)) sin(θ/2).

Putting it all together:

[2 sin(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) ] + [ -2 cos²(θ/2) sin(θ/2) ] = 2 sin(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) - 2 sin(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) ) = 0.

So it satisfies equation 2.

So the eigenvector is [ k cos(θ/2), k sin(θ/2) ].

But we can choose k to normalize it. The norm squared is |k|^2 [ cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) ] = |k|^2. So to normalize, set |k|=1. So k=1, assuming real numbers, but wait, the eigenvectors can have complex factors, but in this case, since P is hermitian, the eigenstates are real.

Wait, no, the spin matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvectors can be chosen as real.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), but with some factors involving ħ. Wait, no, let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) (√(2/3)ħ, √(1/3)ħ )

B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ )

C) (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) )

D) (√(2/3)ħ cos(θ/2), √(1/3)ħ sin(θ/2) )

Wait, but in our case, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But looking at option C, that's exactly what we have. So option C would be the answer, right?

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So the direction is given by the unit vector n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So θ here in the options is the same θ as the direction in x-z plane.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the eigenvector, the angle is θ/2. So the answer would be (cos(θ/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches option C.

But wait, let me recheck the setup. The operator is P · n, where n is in x-z plane. So the eigenvector is along the spin-up direction for that axis. The eigenstate for spin-up along an arbitrary direction (theta, 0, phi=0) would be |+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

In this case, phi is zero because n is in x-z plane (so phi=0). So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So that's exactly option C.

But looking at the options, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so yeah, that's the correct answer.

Wait, but the options have some with ħ. Like option D has sqrt(2/3) ħ multiplied. But in our calculation, the eigenvector elements are dimensionless, right? Since in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are scaled by ħ/2, but the eigenvectors are dimensionless. So the options with ħ in them (like A, D) probably have an error, because ħ is part of the operator's scaling, not the vector.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator's components are given as (ħ/2) times matrices. So the eigenvectors are spinors, which are dimensionless. So the options that include ħ must be incorrect.

So option C is the correct one, as it's a normalized vector of cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which are dimensionless.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $\hbar/2$ times specific 2x2 matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parametrized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator along $\vec{n}$
The operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$. Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, we have:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]
Using the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]
we find:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} \right) |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle.
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, we get:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This simplifies to the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta \, x + \sin\theta \, y = x, \quad \sin\theta \, x - \cos\theta \, y = y.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the eigenvector
From the first equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)x + \sin\theta \, y = 0 \implies x = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} y.
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
x = \cot(\theta/2) y.
\]
Let $y = \sin(\theta/2)$, then $x = \cos(\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector is:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Normalizing this vector (since $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$), the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
