Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with coordination complexes and stability constants yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the different cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, first, I remember that stability constants (β) indicate the tendency of a metal to form complexes with ligands. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. Each β corresponds to a different complex. For Co(II) with SCN-, I think the complexes are Co(SCN)_n where n is 1 to 4. So, the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^, [Co(SCN)_3]^{2-}, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-}. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the charges, but maybe that doesn't matter for the calculation.

The question specifically asks about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I believe is the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} complex. So that's the second complex, so β2 is 40.

The problem is to find the percentage of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} relative to all possible Co species. So, I guess I need to calculate the fraction of Co that is in this particular complex.

I remember that when multiple complexes are possible, the distribution of the metal between them can be determined using the stability constants. The general approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step and calculate their concentrations using the given β values.

But wait, the solution involves a competition among four possible complexes. Each complex formation is a stepwise process, so the overall formation constant for each complex depends on the previous steps. For example, the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} would involve two steps: first forming the monomeric complex and then adding another SCN-.

But maybe I should think in terms of the total concentration of Co. Let's denote the concentration of free Co^2+ as [Co^2+], and the concentrations of the complexes as [CoSCN], [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3], and [Co(SCN)_4]. The total cobalt concentration c_total is the sum of all these species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4] = 0.01 M.

But wait, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, which I think includes all these species. So, the sum is 0.01 M.

The stability constants are given as β1 to β4. Stability constants are for the formation of each complex step. So, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+ formation from Co^2+ and SCN-:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+ ; β1 = [ [CoSCN]^+ ] / ( [Co^2+] [SCN^-] )

Similarly, β2 is the stability constant for the next step, which would be [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}. So, each successive β represents adding another SCN-.

Wait, but I think that the overall formation constant for the n-th complex is the product of the individual β's up to that step. So, for the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, the overall β would be β1 * β2.

Wait, no. Stability constants are usually given for the overall formation. But in some cases, they're given stepwise. Hmm. Wait, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So each β corresponds to the nth complex.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the stability constant for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, is β1=9. The second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, has β2=40. Wait, but that's not stepwise; each β is the overall constant for that complex. So, for example, β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-.

Similarly, β2 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} from [CoSCN]^+ and another SCN^-.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the overall formation constants would be cumulative. Maybe each β is the stepwise formation constant. So the way the complexes form is stepwise, each step adding another SCN-.

Alternatively, maybe the β's are the overall stability constants. Let me think: for each complex, βn is the formation constant for the n-th complex. So, [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} has a βn of 9 for n=1, 40 for n=2, etc.

But to get the concentration of each complex, I think I need to model the formation step by step.

Let me consider all the possible complexes:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} ; βn is the overall stability constant for each n.

Wait, but in this case, the stepwise β may be given. Hmm, perhaps it's stepwise, meaning that each β is the constant for adding one SCN- to the previous complex.

So, the formation of [CoSCN]^+ would have a stability constant β1 = 9.

The formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} from [CoSCN]^+ and SCN^- would have a stability constant β2 = 40.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^{3-} would form from [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} and SCN^- with β3=63.

And [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-} forms from [Co(SCN)_3]^{3-} and SCN^- with β4=16.

If that's the case, then the overall formation constants (for each complex) would be the product of the β's up to that point.

Wait, but actually, no. The overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of the first n β's. Because each step adds a SCN-.

So, for [CoSCN]^+, the overall β is β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, the overall β is β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360.

For [Co(SCN)_3]^{3-}, it's β1*β2*β3 = 9*40*63= let's see, 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

And for [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-}, the overall β is 9*40*63*16. Hmm, that's a big number.

But wait, the problem is that the stability constants are given for each step. So, perhaps the approach is to model the distribution of each complex.

The key is to express each complex's concentration in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x.

Then, the concentration of [CoSCN]^+ is β1 * x * [SCN^-].

Similarly, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is β1 * β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2.

Wait, no. Because each step adds another SCN, so the concentration would be [Co(SCN)_n] = β1 * β2 * ... * βn * x * [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but that's for the overall formation. So, for the nth complex, [Co(SCN)_n] = β1 * β2 * ... * βn * x * [SCN-]^n.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again. For each step, the concentration of the next complex depends on the previous one. So, [CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * s, where s is [SCN^-].

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * s = β2 * β1 * x * s^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^{3-} = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} * s = β3 * β2 * β1 * x * s^3.

And [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-} = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3]^{3-} * s = β4 * β3 * β2 * β1 * x * s^4.

So, all these concentrations are in terms of x and [SCN^-].

But the total Co concentration is the sum of all these species plus x, the free Co^2+.

So,

x + (β1 x s) + (β1 β2 x s^2) + (β1 β2 β3 x s^3) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 x s^4) ) = c_total = 0.01 M.

We can factor x:

x [ 1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s^2 + β1 β2 β3 s^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4 ] = 0.01.

So,

x = 0.01 / [1 + β1 s + β1 β2 s^2 + β1 β2 β3 s^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 s^4 ].

Once we have x, we can find the concentration of each complex.

But wait, in the problem, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, so s = 0.1.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

s = 0.1.

Compute each term:

Term 0: 1
Term 1: β1 s = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9
Term 2: β1 β2 s^2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6
Term3: β1 β2 β3 s^3= 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3.

Let's compute that.

9 *40=360.

360 *63=22680.

s^3 is 0.001.

So term3 = 22680 *0.001 = 22.68.

Term4: β1β2β3β4 s^4 = 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

s^4 is 0.0001.

So term4= 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Now sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

x =0.01 / 64.468 ≈ 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.000155 M.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.01 / 64.468.

Well, 64.468 is approximately 64.468.

So 0.01 /64.468 = 1/(6446.8) ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

So x ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 x s =9 * x *0.1 = 0.9 x.

So [CoSCN]^+ = 0.9 *1.55e-4 = 1.395e-4.

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}= β1 β2 x s^2 = 9*40 x (0.1)^2=360 * x *0.01 =3.6 x.

3.6 *1.55e-4 =5.58e-4.

[Co(SCN)_3]^{3-} = β1 β2 β3 x s^3 =9*40*63 x * (0.1)^3.

Which is 22680 x *0.001= 22.68 x.

22.68 *1.55e-4 = approx 3.517e-3.

Wait, 22.68 * 1.55e-4.

22.68 * 1.55 = approx 35.172. So 35.172e-4 = 3.5172e-3.

Then [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-}= β1β2β3β4 x s^4= 9*40*63*16 x (0.1)^4.

Which is 362880 x * 0.0001=36.288 x.

36.288 *1.55e-4 = 5.624e-3.

Wait, 36.288 * 1.55 is about 56.24, so 56.24e-4=5.624e-3.

Now, let me list all the concentrations.

[Co^2+] = x ≈1.55e-4 M.

[CoSCN]^+ = 0.9e-4=1.395e-4.

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}=5.58e-4.

[Co(SCN)_3]^{3-}=3.517e-3.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{4-}=5.624e-3.

Wait, let me check the sum to see if it adds up to 0.01.

Adding all concentrations:

1.55e-4 (x) +1.395e-4 (CoSCN) = approx 3.0e-4.

3.0e-4 +5.58e-4 = 8.58e-4.

8.58e-4 +3.517e-3 = 4.3758e-3.

4.3758e-3 +5.624e-3 = 9.9998e-3 ≈0.01, which matches the total. So the calculations seem correct.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in my calculation for [CoSCN]^+.

Wait, earlier, I thought [CoSCN]^+ is 0.9 x. Let me recalculate.

0.9 * x where x is 1.55e-4.

So 0.9 * 1.55e-4 = 1.395e-4.

Yes, correct.

And [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}=3.6 x =3.6*1.55e-4=5.58e-4.

Yes.

So the concentration of the second complex [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is 5.58e-4 M.

So the fraction of this complex relative to the total Co is [Co(SCN)_2] / c_total.

So, 5.58e-4 / 0.01 = 0.0558, or 5.58%. Wait, that's around 5.58%.

But wait, the options don't have anything near 5%. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the terms wrong in the denominator. Let me recheck.

Each term in the denominator sum is:

Term 0: 1.

Term1: β1 s =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: β1 β2 s²=9*40*0.01= 360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 s³=9*40*63*(0.1)^3.

Wait, 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*(0.1)^3 =22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1β2β3β4 s^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Compute that: 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

Then, (0.1)^4=0.0001.

362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the denominator sum is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288=64.468. Correct.

So x=0.01/64.468 ≈ 0.000155 M.

Wait, but then [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}=3.6 x=3.6 *0.000155=0.000558 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is 0.000558 M.

Total Co concentration is 0.01 M, so the fraction is 0.000558 / 0.01 =0.0558 or 5.58%.

But the options don't have that. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood which complex is the blue dithiocyanato. Maybe the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} complex. But according to my calculation, its concentration is only about 5.58%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculate the concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps the stability constants are given as overall constants, not stepwise. Let me think about that.

If the β's are overall stability constants, then for each complex, the formation is:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, βn.

In that case, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] is given by βn * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but then, each [Co(SCN)_n] is βn x s^n.

So the total cobalt would be x + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n].

Which is x + β1 x s + β2 x s² + β3 x s^3 + β4 x s^4 = c_total.

Thus,

x [1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4 ] = c_total.

Wait, but that's different from before. Because now, each complex's concentration is βn x s^n, not the product of β's up to n.

Wait, but no, the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So, in that model, the denominator would be 1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s^3 + β4 s^4.

Hmm, so that's different from the previous approach where each β was a stepwise constant.

So, perhaps I was mistaken before, and the correct approach is the second one, where each β is the overall constant for each complex.

This would change the denominator.

Let me re-calculate using this approach.

So, in this case, the denominator is:

1 + β1 s + β2 s² + β3 s³ + β4 s^4.

Plugging in the numbers:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, s=0.1.

Compute each term:

Term0:1.

Term1:9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2:40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

Term3:63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

Term4:16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum: 1+0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

x =0.01 /2.3646 ≈0.00423 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 x s =9 * 0.00423 *0.1 =9 *0.000423=0.003807 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}=β2 x s²=40 *0.00423 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.00423 *0.01=40 *0.0000423=0.001692 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^{3-}=β3 x s^3=63 *0.00423 *0.001=63 *0.00000423=0.00026589 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{4-}=β4 x s^4=16 *0.00423 *0.0001=16 *0.000000423=0.000006768 M.

Now, check the total Co:

x + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4].

x is 0.00423.

[CoSCN] =0.003807.

[Co(SCN)_2]=0.001692.

[Co(SCN)_3]=0.00026589.

[Co(SCN)_4]=0.000006768.

Adding all together:

0.00423 +0.003807=0.008037.

+0.001692=0.009729.

+0.00026589=0.009995.

+0.000006768=0.010001768. Approximately 0.01, which matches the c_total.

So, the concentrations are correct.

Now, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.

Its concentration is 0.001692 M.

Total Co is 0.01 M.

So, the fraction is 0.001692 / 0.01 =0.1692, or 16.92%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

So the answer would be D.

Wait, but why did the previous approach give a different result?

Ah, because I think I initially assumed the β's were stepwise, but if they're overall, the approach changes. But in this case, the problem states the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, etc. So, the way I did in the second approach is correct because each β is the overall constant for each complex, not stepwise.

So, the correct fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)\(_2\)]\(^{2+}\), among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (\(β_1 = 9\), \(β_2 = 40\), \(β_3 = 63\), \(β_4 = 16\)) and the total cobalt concentration (\(c_{\text{total}} = 0.01 \, \text{M}\)) and thiocyanate concentration (\([SCN^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\)).

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:  
   The stability constants (\(β_n\)) represent the overall formation constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes. The concentration of each complex is proportional to \(β_n [Co^{2+}] [SCN^-]^n\).

2. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:
   \[
   c_{\text{total}} = [Co^{2+}] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} + [Co(SCN)_3]^{3-} + [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-}.
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for each complex in terms of \([Co^{2+}]\), the equation becomes:
   \[
   c_{\text{total}} = [Co^{2+}] \left( 1 + β_1 [SCN^-] + β_2 [SCN^-]^2 + β_3 [SCN^-]^3 + β_4 [SCN^-]^4 \right).
   \]

3. **Denominator Calculation**:  
   Using \(β_1 = 9\), \(β_2 = 40\), \(β_3 = 63\), \(β_4 = 16\), and \([SCN^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\), compute each term:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   \text{Term 1: } & 1 \\
   \text{Term 2: } & β_1 [SCN^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \\
   \text{Term 3: } & β_2 [SCN^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \\
   \text{Term 4: } & β_3 [SCN^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \\
   \text{Term 5: } & β_4 [SCN^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \\
   \end{align*}
   \]
   Summing these terms gives the denominator:
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
   \]

4. **Free Cobalt Ion Concentration**:  
   Solve for \([Co^{2+}]\) using \(c_{\text{total}} = 0.01 \, \text{M}\):
   \[
   [Co^{2+}] = \frac{c_{\text{total}}}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.00423 \, \text{M}.
   \]

5. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)\(_2\)]\(^{2+}\)**:  
   The concentration of the blue dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} = β_2 [Co^{2+}] [SCN^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.00423 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.001692 \, \text{M}.
   \]

6. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)\(_2\)]\(^{2+}\)**:  
   The percentage of the blue complex is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}}{c_{\text{total}}} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.001692}{0.01} \cdot 100 \approx 16.9\%.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

**Answer: D**
