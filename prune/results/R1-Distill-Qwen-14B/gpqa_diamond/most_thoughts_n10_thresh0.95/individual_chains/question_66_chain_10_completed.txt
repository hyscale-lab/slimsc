Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT is a framework that includes the Standard Model (SM) plus some higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension, so like dimension 6, 7, etc. But the question is about the symmetries these operators must respect.

The question asks which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, and the effective operators are just higher-dimensional terms built from the SM fields. So any operator in SMEFT should transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So yes, Lorentz symmetry must be respected. So 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz transformations plus translations, right? So it's the full symmetry of spacetime in relativity. But I'm not sure if all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare. Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's valid below some cutoff scale. Effective theories usually respect the same symmetries as the original theory. The SM respects Poincare, so SMEFT should too. Because the effective operators are built from SM fields in a way that maintains Poincare symmetry. So 2 should also be correct.

Now, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. I remember that the SM doesn't respect CP symmetry. For example, CP violation occurs in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, then SMEFT, which includes SM interactions, shouldn't require operators to respect CP either. In fact, some SMEFT operators can explicitly violate CP. So 3 (CP) is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators. So option 3 is out.

CPT symmetry: CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I think this is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, including the SM. The CPT theorem states that in any Lorentz-invariant QFT, CPT symmetry is respected. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT. Because the theorem says that the combination of CPT is always a symmetry. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

Putting it together: The operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. Wait, no, let me check the options again. The options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

Wait, the question is about which symmetries "must be respected by all operators". So, from my reasoning, the correct ones are 1,2,4. So option C is correct. But wait, I recall that Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, it doesn't respect translations, which would make it non-local, right? So SMEFT does respect Poincare symmetry, so all operators must. So yes, 2 is included.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Do all SMEFT operators need to respect Poincare symmetry? Let me think: SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, and it's also translationally invariant because it's a field theory. So yes, Poincare is respected. So 2 is correct.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So option C is the choice.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory because it is constructed from the Standard Model (SM), which respects Lorentz symmetry. Higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT are built from SM fields in a way that maintains Lorentz invariance. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory and respects the same symmetries as the SM, it must also respect Poincaré symmetry. This ensures the theory remains consistent with spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is observed in processes like neutral meson oscillations. Since SMEFT includes SM interactions, it does not require operators to respect CP symmetry. Some SMEFT operators can explicitly violate CP. Thus, CP symmetry is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, including the SM and SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
