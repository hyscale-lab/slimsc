Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, which probably relates to their temperatures. The radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. But wait, the radial velocity might not directly affect the luminosity calculation here. Hmm.

The problem says the astronomers assume the stars are black bodies. So I'll need to use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates luminosity to radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since we're comparing the luminosities of the two stars, the constants will cancel out, so I can just use L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴).

Wait, but I don't have their temperatures. Oh, but the peak wavelengths are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

So T1 = T2. That means when I calculate L1/L2, the temperatures will cancel out because they're equal. So L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴) = (R1² / R2²) * 1.

Since R1 is 1.5 times R2, substituting R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1² = (1.5)^2 * R2² = 2.25 R2². So L1/L2 = 2.25. Wait, that's option A, which is ~2.25. But wait, the options don't include A as the correct one. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem statement says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Oh wait, does that affect the temperature? Because the radial velocity could relate to the Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength would shift. But wait, the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe I need to consider Doppler shift to find their actual temperatures?

Wait, let me think. The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect. The formula is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), where v_r is the radial velocity in terms of the speed of light. But wait, no, that's the relativistic Doppler effect formula. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, it's approximately λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity.

But the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same. Oh, so the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. But their actual λ_max (before considering Doppler shift) might be different.

Wait, so let's model this. Let's say Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so its light is redshifted, making its observed λ_max longer. But Star_1 is stationary, so its observed λ_max is the same as its rest λ_max. Since the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, but Star_2 is moving, its actual λ_max (rest frame) is shorter.

Wait, no. If Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max would be longer than its rest λ_max. Star_1's observed λ_max is the same as its rest λ_max. But the problem says that the observed λ_max for both stars are the same.

So, for Star_1: λ_max1 (observed) = λ_max1 (rest) because v_r1 = 0.

For Star_2: λ_max2 (observed) = λ_max2 (rest) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2 / c) / (1 - v_r2 / c) ) )

But λ_max1 (observed) = λ_max2 (observed) = λ.

So λ = λ1 (rest) = λ2 (rest) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

Wait, but λ is the same for both. So λ1 = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

But also, from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1 = b / T1 and λ2_rest = b / T2.

So substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

We can cancel b from both sides.

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

So T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v_r2/c) / (1 + v_r2/c) )

Hmm, but wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me plug in the numbers.

v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let me convert that to a fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is 700/3e5 ≈ 0.002333... or about 0.233% the speed of light. So v_r2/c is approximately 0.002333.

So (1 + v_r2/c) ≈ 1.002333, (1 - v_r2/c) ≈ 0.997667.

So the sqrt( (1.002333)/(0.997667) ) ≈ sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.002338.

So T1 ≈ T2 * 1.002338.

Wait, but since T1 is larger than T2 (because when a star is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, implying a lower temperature, but in this case, because the observed wavelengths are the same, the actual T2 must be lower than T1, so T1 is higher.)

Wait, no, let me think again. If the star is moving away (v_r positive), the observed wavelength is longer. So λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c). So if λ_observed is the same for both stars, then Star_2's λ_rest must be smaller than Star_1's.

Because Star_2 is moving away, so λ_observed = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c) = λ1_rest.

Wait, no, Star_1 is stationary, so λ1_rest = λ1_observed. Star_2 has λ2_observed = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c). But λ1_observed = λ2_observed. So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c).

So λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

But from Wien's law, λ is inversely proportional to T. So λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2. So substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, that's different from what I had before. Because when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, which implies a lower temperature because T is inversely proportional. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength would be longer than its rest wavelength, but in this case, the observed wavelengths are the same. So the real T2 must be lower than T1 in such a way that when you apply the Doppler shift, the observed λ becomes the same as Star_1.

Wait, let me rephrase:

Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_rest (because v_r1=0)

Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c ), since v_r2 is positive (moving away, so redshift).

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs => λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c )

Which implies that λ1_rest > λ2_rest because (1 + v/c) is greater than 1.

But since λ is inversely proportional to T, λ1_rest > λ2_rest implies T1 < T2.

Wait, that can't be right because Star_1 is more massive and larger. Wait, but mass doesn't directly determine luminosity in this case because we're assuming blackbody radiation, which depends on radius and temperature.

Wait, let me think about this again. If the observed λ_max is same for both, but Star_2 is moving away, then its rest frame λ_max is smaller than Star_1's.

Wait, because when Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer. So for their observed λ's to be equal, Star_2's rest λ must be smaller. Because when you redshift a smaller λ, you get λ_obs same as Star_1's.

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c )

But λ_max is b / T. So λ1_rest = b / T1 ; λ2_rest = b / T2.

So, substituting:

b/T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So T1 is T2 divided by a value slightly larger than 1, which makes T1 smaller than T2. Wait, that's unexpected because Star_1 is larger in radius and mass. But wait, Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's, but if T1 is lower, then the luminosity might not be as much as I initially thought.

Wait, no, let me correct. Earlier, without considering Doppler shift, I thought T1 = T2, which would make L1 = (1.5)^2 L2 = 2.25 L2. But now, considering Doppler shift, T1 is actually lower than T2.

Wait, that can't be. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the initial assumption that T1 = T2 was incorrect because the radial velocity affects the observed wavelength. So, I need to compute the actual temperatures of both stars, considering the Doppler shift.

So, let's think again.

Star_1: stationary. So λ1_max (observed) = λ1_max (rest) = b / T1.

Star_2: moving away. So λ2_max (observed) = λ2_max (rest) * (1 + v_r2/c) = b / T2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

But observed λ's are equal: λ1_max = λ2_max_observed.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Divide both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Now, calculating the factor (1 + v_r2/c). v_r2 = 700 km/s. c is about 3e5 km/s = 300,000 km/s.

v_r2/c = 700 / 300000 ≈ 0.0023333.

So 1 + 0.0023333 = 1.0023333.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.0023333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.0023333) [using 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x]

So T1 ≈ T2 * (0.9976667).

So the temperature of Star_1 is approximately 0.9976667 times that of Star_2.

Wait, but that would mean T1 is slightly less than T2. Hmmm. But I thought that a larger star might have a higher luminosity if the temperature is similar, but here the temperature of Star_1 is lower than Star_2.

So, now the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is:

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / (R2² T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 * 0.9976667 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002333).

So let's compute T1^4 / T2^4.

T1^4 = (T2 * 0.9976667)^4 ≈ T2^4 * (0.9976667)^4.

Let me compute (0.9976667)^4 approximately.

0.9976667 is approximately 0.997667.

(0.997667)^2 = (approx) (1 - 0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 0.995332 - 0.0000054 ≈ ~0.995327.

Then, (0.997667)^4 ≈ (0.995327)^2 ≈ approximately 0.99067.

So approximately 0.99067.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 ) * (0.99067) / 1

Because (1.5)^2 is 2.25, and 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.2275.

Wait, 2.25 * 0.99067 = let's compute:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

But wait, 0.99067 is a bit more than 0.99. Let me compute precisely 2.25 * 0.99067.

0.99067 = 0.99 + 0.00067.

So 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.00067 ≈ 0.0015075.

Adding them: 2.2275 + 0.0015075 ≈ 2.2290075.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, 2.229 is close to option D, ~2.23.

Wait, but earlier I approximated (0.9976667)^4 as ~0.99067. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.9976667^4.

First, calculate 0.9976667 squared:

0.9976667 * 0.9976667.

Let me compute 0.9976667 * 0.9976667:

= (1 - 0.0023333)^2

= 1 - 2 * 0.0023333 + (0.0023333)^2

= 1 - 0.0046666 + 0.00000544

= 0.99533884.

Wait, 2 * 0.0023333 is 0.0046666, so 1 - 0.004
