Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the formula is something like distance r = 1 / (plx * some constant), maybe? Like, a larger parallax means a closer star because the parallax angle is bigger.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So as we look further out (increasing r), how does the number of stars in that region change? The options are various power laws of r, like r squared, r cubed, etc.

Wait, the number of stars varies as 1/(plx^5). I need to relate this to distance. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, I can write plx = k / r, where k is some constant. So plx = k/r. Therefore, 1/(plx^5) would be equal to (r/k)^5. Because (k/r)^5 is 1/(r^5 k^5), so 1/(plx^5) is equal to (r^5)/(k^5). So number of stars N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm getting this right. Let's think about it again. If N varies with 1/(plx^5), and plx is proportional to 1/r, then substituting, N is proportional to (1/( (1/r) )^5 ) = r^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive because as you go further, there are fewer stars. Or wait, the question says "number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So when plx is small (which is when r is large), 1/plx^5 is a large number. So N increases as r increases. But wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, in reality, the number of stars you see should increase up to a point because there are more stars in a larger volume, but the density might drop. Hmm, but the question gives a specific relation, so I should go with the math.

Let me go through it again. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = k / r, where k is the constant of proportionality. So plx = k/r → r = k/(plx). So if plx increases, r decreases, and vice versa.

Given that N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N = C * (1/plx^5), where C is some constant. Substitute plx = k/r into this.

N = C * (1/( (k/r)^5 )) = C * (r^5)/(k^5). So N is proportional to r^5. Because the constants (like C and k) are just scaling factors, the dependence is r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5. But wait, that suggests that as we look further away, the number of stars in a region increases. Is that realistic? Well, in reality, the number of stars in a volume increases with the volume, which is r^3. So why is this giving r^5?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the context. The question is about a specific region of the sky. So perhaps it's considering a fixed area, and varying distance. So with a larger distance, the volume of the region increases, so the number of stars in that volume would increase. But the relation given here is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So with plx being inversely proportional to r, N ∝ r^5.

Alternatively, maybe the way the number of stars is distributed in the galaxy affects this. Like, if the number of stars in a shell at radius r is proportional to r^2 (like surface brightness), but that's another matter.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars in that region of the sky as a function of distance. So per unit range of distance, r. Hmm, the question says "per unit range of distance, r". So perhaps the number of stars as you go from r to r + dr is proportional to N(r) dr.

Wait, the initial statement says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So maybe N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx ∝ 1/r, so N ∝ r^5.

So the answer would be option B, which is ~ r^5.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because typically, the number of stars in a volume (like a sphere) increases with r^3, but perhaps this is a different scenario. Maybe the question is saying that the number of stars observed in a given region (like a small area) at a distance r is proportional to 1/(plx^5). So for a fixed area, the number of stars at that distance is N = C * (1/plx^5) = C * r^5. Because when you look at a small area, the number of stars you can see depends on how far away they are.

Wait, but parallax is the inverse of distance, so higher parallax means closer stars. So as parallax decreases (r increases), 1/plx^5 becomes larger. So N increases as r^5. So per unit distance, more stars are added as you go further. But that would imply that the number of stars increases a lot with distance, which seems counterintuitive because you'd expect that the density of stars might drop. But perhaps in this specific scenario, it's a different distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the relation. Wait, maybe I should think about how parallax relates to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/r (with r in parsecs). So r = 1/plx.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Substituting r into this gives N ∝ (1/( (1/r) )^5 ) = r^5.

So the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases by r^5.

So the answer should be B) ~ r^5.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{k}{r} \), where \( k \) is a constant. Substituting this into the given relation, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{k}{r}\right)^5} = \frac{r^5}{k^5}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars \( N \) is proportional to \( r^5 \). Thus, as the distance \( r \) increases, the number of stars in the region of the sky increases with the fifth power of distance.

The reasoning aligns with the mathematical relationship provided, even though it may seem counterintuitive compared to typical volume-based expectations. The question explicitly focuses on the given proportionality, so the conclusion is based on the substitution and the resulting dependence.

Answer: B
