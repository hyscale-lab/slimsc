Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question involves two reactions and asks for the suitable reagents A and B. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing different reagents.

First, looking at the first reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, under what conditions does that happen?

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When I add NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. But I think the product would be something like (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Oh wait, but in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that's pentanenitrile with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one is four carbons, adding CN would make it five? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When the CN adds, it becomes (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that's five carbons? No, because the ketone is at position 2 of four carbons. So adding CN would give a four-carbon chain with the CN on the same carbon as the hydroxyl? Wait, maybe I should think about it as a ketone reacting to form a cyanohydrin.

Yes! So the reaction of a ketone with CN- (from NaCN) forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst. Oh right, because the mechanism involves the carbonyl oxygen getting protonated, making it a better electrophile. So NaCN would supply the CN-, but without an acid, the reaction might not proceed efficiently.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is likely an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B) or maybe another acid like H2SO4 or something else. Looking at the options, A and B have H3O+ as A. Options C and D have NaHSO3 as A.

Wait, but what's the role of reagent A in the first step? Since it's a nucleophilic addition, we need to protonate the carbonyl to make the carbonyl carbon more positive. So H3O+ would be the acid catalyst here. So in the first reaction, A is H3O+. So that would point me to options A or B.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. It's reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form the corresponding acid. Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The typical way to convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is by strong acid hydrolysis, usually with HCl under reflux. Alternatively, using H2O and an acid catalyst.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think. When you hydrolyze nitriles with strong acid, like HCl, you get a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you get a carboxylate. Oh, but in the reaction given, the reagent B is H2O, but the question says reagent B is H2O, but also I think it might be part of the hydrolysis conditions.

Wait, the second reaction is: [hydroxybutanenitrile] + B (H2O) → [hydroxybutanoic acid]. So the reagent B is H2O. But maybe more accurately, the reagent is something that helps in the hydrolysis. Because just adding water without any catalyst might not be sufficient.

Wait, the nitrile to carboxylic acid usually requires acid or base. For example, using HCl (like HCl in H2O) as a catalyst. Or maybe using a strong acid like sulfuric acid.

So in the second reaction, the reagent B is the condition for the hydrolysis. So what is B? The options for B are HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Looking at the options, in option A, B is HCl. Option B has B as CH3COOH. So if I think about the nitrile hydrolysis, HCl is a strong acid and would be suitable. Alternatively, maybe another acid.

Wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The OH is on the same carbon as the CN. So in the product, that becomes a COOH. So the nitrile is at the end of the chain.

Wait, but the molecule is more complex because it's a 2-(4-benzylphenyl) substituent. But that's just a substituent; the main chain is butanenitrile converting to butanoic acid.

So, nitrile to carboxylic acid under acidic conditions. For that, I think you need either a strong acid like HCl or maybe something else.

Wait, what's the typical reagent for nitrile to carboxylic acid? I think strong acid hydrolysis. For example, HCl in H2O, heat, and reflux, that's a common method.

Alternatively, sometimes it's done under basic conditions followed by acid workup, but in this case, the reaction is with H2O and B.

So, for the second reaction, reagent B is probably HCl as the acid catalyst, because H2O alone might not be enough. So looking at the options, which ones have B as HCl? Let me check.

Option A: B = HCl. So that would make sense.

Wait, but let me recheck the first part. For the first reaction, the reagent is A. If A is H3O+, which is in options A and B, that would make sense. So the first reaction uses H3O+ as a catalyst.

So, putting it together, in option A, A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

Let me check all options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. Possible.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH. Hmm, CH3COOH is a weaker acid. Would that be sufficient for nitrile hydrolysis? I'm not sure. I think hydrolysis of nitriles to acids typically requires a strong acid like HCl.

So option A would be correct.

Wait, but what about the possibility that in the second reaction, the conditions are aqueous HCl? So B is HCl.

Looking back, the first reaction uses H3O+ as a catalyst, which is a strong acid. So if A is H3O+, that would be correct.

Therefore, the correct option is A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for this step, as it facilitates the protonation and subsequent addition of CN⁻.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This conversion typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as HCl, to drive the hydrolysis reaction. While CH₃COOH (a weaker acid) might not be sufficient for this transformation, HCl provides the necessary acidic environment to efficiently convert the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Given these considerations, the correct pairing of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
