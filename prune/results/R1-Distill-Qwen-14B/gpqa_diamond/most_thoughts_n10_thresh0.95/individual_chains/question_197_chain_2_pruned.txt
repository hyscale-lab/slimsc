Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these problems can get tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find the final product. The options are A to D, so I'll have to figure out what X is first, then determine what happens when it reacts under those conditions.

First, let's look at the spectroscopic data. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching, maybe from a carbonyl group like a carboxylic acid. But wait, there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably from a ketone or a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids also have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3000. Hmm, but the IR here has a 1720, which is typical for a ketone. Wait, but the range 3400–2500 might be an aldehyde or maybe an alcohol, but more likely an acid.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a really high chemical shift, which usually corresponds to an aldehyde proton. Wait no, aldehydes are around 9-10, but sometimes more deshielded. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid -OH proton is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad and maybe around that region. But in the NMR, the 10.5 is a singlet, which doesn't fit a carboxylic acid because those are usually broad and might not be a singlet if there's exchange.

Then looking at the other NMR signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets with 2H each suggests a para-substituted structure. Like maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents or a single substituent like a carbonyl group. 

There's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be a methylene adjacent to something like an oxygen or a carbonyl. Maybe a CH next to an ester or ketone. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be another set of methylene groups, perhaps part of a chain attached to the ring. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of three protons, maybe a methyl group attached to a CH2. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative, but wait, the IR has a strong carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe a ketone. Let me think.

Wait, another thought: the IR has 1720 cm-1, which could also be an ester or a ketone. Let's think about the NMR. The broad singlet at 10.5 is likely an aldehyde proton. So if it's an aldehyde, that would fit with a peak around 1720. Wait no, an aldehyde's carbonyl is around 1720 cm-1, so that fits. So maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde, like benzaldehyde with substituents.

But wait, the NMR also shows some other peaks. Let's try to sketch a possible structure.

The aromatic region: two doublets, each 2H. So maybe the substituent is in the para position. Let's say the benzene has a substituent that's an aldehyde group and another group. Wait, but if it's benzaldehyde, the aldehyde is in the para position to another group. Or perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with an aldehyde and another substituent.

But wait, perhaps the structure is more complicated. Let me think about the other NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or an ester. Or maybe it's a CH group next to a carbonyl. The 1.7 (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group, perhaps part of a chain attached to the benzene. The 1.4 (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to an adjacent CH2, maybe like a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is an aromatic aldehyde with an ethyl group attached. Let me think: perhaps the benzene ring has an aldehyde group (giving the 10.5 ppm peak) and another substituent which is an ethyl group or something more complex. Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is a terminal CH2CH2CH3? Or perhaps a butyl group.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9, which is a typical terminal methyl group, so maybe a propyl chain. Let's see: like a CH2CH2CH3 group. But the 1.4 ppm is a d (doublet) of 3H. A doublet for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to something that splits into two. Wait, in an ethyl group, the CH3 would be a triplet, but maybe it's a branching. Or perhaps a isopropyl group. For example, a CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a d (3H), perhaps a methyl attached to a CH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a branched chain. Let me try to imagine. The benzene has an aldehyde group, and another substituent which is a chain leading to a tertiary carbon. Let's say the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)2 or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR has 1720 cm-1, which is also the region for esters. So perhaps the compound is an ester. Alternatively, a ketone. But the NMR has that 10.5 ppm peak, which is more likely an aldehyde. So maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the aldehyde is part of a larger structure. Let's consider if the molecule has a benzaldehyde group and an ester group or a ketone, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1720 cm-1 is from a ketone. Then, the 10.5 ppm peak would not be an aldehyde but possibly an acidic proton elsewhere. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. If it's a ketone, where would the other oxygen be? Maybe a carbonyl group attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So that supports the presence of a benzene ring, which we also see in the NMR with the aromatic protons.

So, putting this together, the structure could be a substituted benzaldehyde. Let me think about the substituents. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) and a quartet? Or, perhaps it’s part of an ethyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene ring. But the NMR also shows a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). Hmm, a d at 1.4 for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, perhaps as part of an isopropyl group or a secondary carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, maybe a propyl group with branching. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group, but that would be a neopentyl group.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group connected to an oxygen. For example, in an ether or an ester, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH next to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with an ethyl group and a methyl group attached. But I'm not getting enough info from that.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group, but then where do the other signals come into play?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's think about the NMR. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be the end of a butyl group, like CH2CH2CH2CH3. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be the next two CH2 groups, and the 1.4 (d,3H) might not fit that. Alternatively, maybe it's a branching point.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the benzene has a substituent that's a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Then, the NMR would have peaks for each part. Let me think: the CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH that's split into a multiplet, maybe around 2.9 ppm. The adjacent CH2 would be around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet. Then, the terminal methyl at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a bit confusing. Because if we have a CH2 connected to a CH(CH2CH3), then the CH2 would be between them. The 1.4 could be a CH3 attached to a CH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group, but that would require more protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm, but that might complicate the NMR.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. So, a branch at the second carbon. That would give a CH2 group next to a CH that's connected to two CH3 groups. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would correspond to two CH3 groups on the same carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2CH3 group (a butyl group). Then, the NMR would have a triplet at 0.9 for the terminal CH3, a quartet for the adjacent CH2, and a triplet for the next CH2, etc. But in the given NMR, there's no quartet. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the IR data. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. If it's a ketone, the NMR wouldn't have an aldehyde proton. So maybe it's an ester. An ester carbonyl is also around 1720. But the NMR at 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which could be an aldehyde. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the compound is a phenol derivative. The IR 3400–2500 could be O-H from a phenol. But then a strong carbonyl at 1720 would suggest another group, like an ester or a ketone. But if it's a phenol with an ester, the NMR would have a broad O-H peak, which could be around 10 ppm, but as a broad singlet. That might fit.

So, let me think of a phenol with an ester group or a ketone. But the NMR also has peaks at 2.9, 1.7, etc., which suggest some aliphatic chains.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzophenone derivative, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted acetophenone. Acetophenone is a benzene ring with a ketone (COCH3) group. But then in the NMR, the acetophenone's methyl would be around 2.6 ppm as a singlet. But here, the NMR has a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which doesn't fit. So maybe not.

Wait, another angle: The reaction with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when aldehydes react with HI and red phosphorus, it's a test for aldehydes. Red phosphorus reacts with HI to produce H-I, and the aldehyde group is converted to a primary alcohol. Wait, no, wait: I think the reaction is called the Hinsberg reaction, but that's for amines. Wait, no, alternatively, maybe it's the reduction of an aldehyde to an alcohol.

Wait, let's think. Red phosphorus and HI is a reagent used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for ketones and aldehydes to form alkanes. Wait, no, Wolff-Kishner uses NH2NH2 and then heat with a base like KOH. Alternatively, maybe it's a Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's the reaction of an aldehyde with HI and red phosphorus in the presence of a catalyst. Wait, I think that red phosphorus and HI are used to generate the HI for the reaction, perhaps as a reducing agent. Or maybe it's a way to dehydrate something.

Wait, I think that when aldehydes or ketones react with HI and red phosphorus, it's used in the elimination reaction to form alkenes. Wait, no, maybe that's with other reagents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alcohol from an aldehyde. If X is an aldehyde, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus might reduce it to a primary alcohol. So the product would have an -OH group.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would imply that the starting material was a benzaldehyde derivative, which upon oxidation would form benzoic acid. But how does HI and red phosphorus do that? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. If X is an ester, then under acidic or basic conditions, it would hydrolyze. But I'm not sure what reaction conditions are here.

Wait, another thought: when an aldehyde is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can undergo a substitution reaction. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's a way to form a mercaptan or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogenation reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a benzaldehyde to a benzyl alcohol. So if X is benzaldehyde, then the product would be benzyl alcohol. But looking at the options, none are benzyl alcohol. So maybe X has a more complex structure.

Wait, perhaps I should first figure out the structure of X. Let's go back to the NMR and IR.

The IR has strong peaks at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl. The 3400–2500 cm-1 could be O-H (from an acid or alcohol) or maybe an aldehyde C-H stretch. Wait, aldehydes have a
