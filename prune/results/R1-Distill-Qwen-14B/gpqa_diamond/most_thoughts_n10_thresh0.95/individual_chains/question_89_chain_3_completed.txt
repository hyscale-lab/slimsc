--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm going to try to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what's given here.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of like four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. 

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so probably a ketone or an ester. The ¹H NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let me think about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base, and heating with dibromide usually suggests an elimination reaction, possibly forming an epoxide or a ketone via elimination and some ring-opening. Wait, no, more likely, in the presence of KOH, the dibromide might undergo an E2 elimination. But wait, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when KOH is added, each Br is on adjacent positions, so elimination would form an alkene. But wait, the IR has a carbonyl, not a C=C. Oh, wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann-type elimination? Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, it could undergo a double dehydrohalogenation to form an allene, but that might not form a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening when the two Br are in a certain position. Alternatively, perhaps the Br atoms are in positions that allow for a Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement, but those usually involve isocyanates or similar.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (halides on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo elimination to form alkenes. But here, maybe the dihalide isn't vicinal. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on carbons that are two apart? Because in the adamantane structure, the positions are in a certain arrangement. Wait, adamantane's structure is four fused six-membered rings. The 1 and 3 positions—wait, maybe they’re on adjacent carbons in the structure. So perhaps elimination would form a double bond, but then where’s the carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the KOH isn't just eliminating. Maybe each Br is on a bridgehead position, making elimination difficult. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening. Oh, wait, another reaction—when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can lead to the formation of a ketone via a pinacol-like rearrangement. Pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol (pinacol) upon dehydration and elimination of water forms a carbonyl. But in this case, it's a dihalide, so perhaps it's a similar concept. Wait, if it's a dihalide on adjacent carbons, maybe the base abstracts a beta-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br⁻ and the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about the product. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong, probably carbonyl. So product 1 is likely a ketone. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules upon treatment with KOH, forming a ketone.

So, the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is that each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. When KOH is added, each Br is adjacent to a position that can form a carbonyl. So, perhaps each bridgehead Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. But wait, if both Br are on adjacent bridgeheads, when they eliminate HBr, they would form a double bond, but that's not a ketone. Alternatively, maybe each Br on adjacent bridgeheads is eliminated, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group. Or perhaps it's a single elimination, but considering the product’s NMR.

Looking at the NMR of product 1: the peaks are 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). So, 2H at 4.79 ppm. That's a deshielded region, perhaps an oxygen-bearing proton, like an ether or a carbonyl group. Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. So maybe the 4.79 ppm is a CH₂ group next to an oxygen, like in an epoxide? No, because epoxides are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm for the CH₂. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but the IR doesn't show an OH peak, but the product is a solid, so maybe it's an ether? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is adamantanone. Because when a dihalide on bridgeheads is treated with strong base, it can lose two equivalents of HBr to form a ketone. For example, in the case of 1,2-dibromoethane, elimination would form ethylene, but in a more complex molecule like adamantane, the elimination could form a carbonyl. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form 1,3-adamantanone? Wait, but 1,3 positions are across the ring; maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgeheads, so elimination would form a carbonyl in between.

Alternatively, considering the structure: when you have a dihalide on adjacent bridgeheads, elimination of two HBr molecules would form a double bond between those bridgeheads. But that would give an allene, which doesn't fit with a carbonyl. So, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Another possibility is that the dihalide undergoes a nucleophilic substitution. But with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a SN2 reaction on each carbon, but that would require each Br being on a primary carbon, which they aren't in adamantane. So substitution is unlikely.

Another thought: in the presence of KOH, the dihalide can form a base-induced elimination, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. For example, vicinal dihalides, when treated with a strong base like KOH, can form alkenes. But in the case of a bridgehead dihalide, the geometry might allow for the formation of a ketone via a different mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the dibromide is treated with KOH, and each Br is eliminated, leading to the formation of a ketone. Maybe each bridgehead loses Br- and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. But how? Let me imagine the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so each bridgehead is connected to two CH2 groups. So, if each bridgehead has a Br, then eliminating HBr from each would form a carbonyl group where each Br was. But that would require each Br to lose H and form a carbonyl, which would probably result in a diketone. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination, would form a ketone in the same positions where the Br were.

Wait, let's think about the structure. If each Br is on a bridgehead, then eliminating two HBr would form two ketone groups? That would be 1,3-diketone. But I'm not sure how the NMR would look for that.

Alternatively, maybe only one of the Br leaves, but that would not explain the IR peak for one carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single elimination forming a single carbonyl group. But how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Hofmann elimination, but that usually applies to amides. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol rearrangement. Wait, the pinacol rearrangement is for 1,2-diols. But here, it's 1,3-dibromo, so maybe it's a similar idea. Or perhaps it's a Still reaction or some other elimination.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of double elimination. Each Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. So, each Br is on a bridgehead, and each bridgehead is connected to another bridgehead. So, when both Br leave, the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl, which would be at each bridgehead. But that would give a diketone. However, the NMR doesn't show a peak for a carbonyl, but wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So, product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen. Maybe it's an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a carbonyl next to a CH₂ group. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetal or a ketal.

Wait, another possibility: the product is an epoxide. But then the IR would show a peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the epoxide C-O-C stretch. But the given IR is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So, that's not it.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol. But in that case, the IR might show an OH stretch, which isn't mentioned. So, it's more likely a ketone.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. 4.79 (2H) — perhaps a CH₂ group near an electronegative atom, like oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) must be the bridgehead and adjacent CH₂ groups in the adamantane structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH₂ group further away.

So, putting this together, product 1 is likely a ketone. Let me imagine the structure: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr, perhaps forming a ketone at each bridgehead. Wait, but that would be a 1,3-diketone. Alternatively, perhaps the two bridgeheads lose HBr, and a single ketone is formed.

Wait, perhaps each bridgehead was adjacent to another bridgehead with a Br, so elimination would form a single ketone in the middle. Hmm, but the adamantane structure is rigid, so maybe the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgeheads, leading to a situation where elimination of HBr from each forms a carbonyl group in between.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1-adamantanol, but that would be a secondary alcohol. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so it's a ketone. So, 1-adamantone?

Wait, 1-adamantone would have a ketone at the bridgehead. The NMR would show the CH₂ groups adjacent to the ketone. The bridgehead CH₂ groups in adamantane are typically around 2.5-2.7 ppm. So, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) might correspond to the bridgehead and adjacent CH₂ groups. The 4.79 (2H) could be a CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl, perhaps as a single CH₂ group. But in adamantane, the carbonyl would be at a bridgehead, so the adjacent CH₂ would be in the same environment as others.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not a ketone but an ester. But the IR would have a carbonyl around 1720, which could be ester or ketone. If it's an ester, the NMR might show an OCH₂ group, which would explain the 4.79 (2H).

Wait, but heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH might not form an ester. Esterification usually involves acid and alcohol. But KOH is basic, so perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but in that case, maybe elimination is more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but then the IR wouldn't show the carbonyl. So, I'm more confident it's a ketone.

So, moving on. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(PrO)3?), which is a strong Lewis acid. This is often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a ketone, which is an acyl group. So, perhaps product 2 is formed via a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, and adamantane is a polycyclic structure but not aromatic. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different type of reaction.

Wait, another possibility: AlCl3 is used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes, but that's when an alkene reacts with a peracid. Alternatively, perhaps product 1, being a ketone, reacts with Al isopropoxide in some way. I'm not too sure about this step. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts type alkylation, but product 1 is a ketone, not an alkyl halide. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is being alkylated here. Wait, but product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's undergoing some acylation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is being used in a Claisen or aldol condensation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening. For instance, if product 1 is an epoxide, but we thought earlier that wasn't the case. Hmm.

Wait, I'm stuck on this step. Let me think again. Product 1 is a ketone, IR 1720. Then, product 1 is heated with excess Al isopropoxide. What reactions involve ketones and Al-based Lewis acids? Maybe the ketone is undergoing some kind of alkylation or acylation, but without an electrophilic source, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but again, the IR doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a hemiacetal or acetal, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so it's more likely a ketone. Maybe the Al isopropoxide is facilitating a reaction where the ketone undergoes some kind of condensation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a nitrile, but the IR doesn't support that. Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on and see if the next steps make sense, then backtrack.

Product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis of alkenes typically cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. The ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. But the question is about product 3's NMR.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an alkene. So, when product 1 (a ketone) is treated with Al isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes a reaction to form an enol, which then could react further. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a dienone, and the Al isopropoxide is used to facilitate some cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the second step is a conjugate addition or some elimination. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone that undergoes a Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent (like from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide) would form an alkene. But the problem doesn't mention any phosphine or such, so maybe not.

Alternatively, the Al isopropoxide could be a catalyst for some elimination reaction. Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's involved in a benzoin condensation or another condensation, but without a partner, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol that undergoes dehydration to form an alkene. But earlier steps don't suggest that. Hmm. I'm not confident, but let's proceed.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it. At low temps (-78°C), ozonolysis tends to form ozonides which upon work up (like with dimethyl sulfide) give aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substitution of the double bond.

Product 3 would thus have carbonyl groups where the double bond was cleaved.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, excluding those that exchange with D₂O.

So, first, I need to figure out the structure of product 3.

Let me try to reconstruct the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (ketone) via KOH elimination.

2. Product 1 → product 2 via Al isopropoxide. Let's assume product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination of the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the Al isopropoxide is a catalyst for a dehydration of the ketone to form an alkene. But wait, in the presence of a ketone, how would that happen? Maybe product 1 is a diol, and the Al isopropoxide facilitates elimination to form an alkene. But earlier, product 1's IR doesn't suggest an OH group.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol. But I thought the IR showed a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I was wrong about product 1.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Then, the IR would show the epoxide C-O-C stretch around 1250 cm⁻¹, but the given IR is at 1720, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an acetal. But then the IR would show a C-O-C stretch, not a carbonyl.

Wait, the IR is at 1720, which could be a ketone or an ester. If it's a ketone, then product 1 is a ketone. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a reaction to form an enol, which then could form an alkene upon dehydration. Or perhaps the Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid that helps in the formation of an enol, leading to an elimination reaction.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone (like 1-adamantone), then under Lewis acid conditions, maybe it undergoes some kind of keto-enol tautomerism, and then elimination to form an alkene. But I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the Al isopropoxide is used in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but as I said earlier, that requires an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a dienone, and the Al isopropoxide helps in some cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol, and the Al isopropoxide helps in elimination to form an alkene. But without an OH peak in IR, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR of product 1 again. The 1H NMR has 4.79 (2H), which could be a CH₂ adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) are probably the bridgehead CH₂ groups. The 1.94 (2H) might be a CH₂ in a more shielded environment.

If product 1 is a secondary alcohol, the 4.79 would be the OH-bearing CH₂, but the IR doesn't show an OH. Alternatively, it's an ether, but then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 is a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. For example, in a ketone like cyclohexanone, the adjacent CH₂ groups are around δ 2.2-2.5. But in adamantane, the structure is different.

Wait, maybe the 4.79 is a bridgehead CH₂ group that's adjacent to a carbonyl. So, for product 1, the structure is a ketone, and the NMR shows the adjacent CH₂ as 4.79. That might make sense.

So, product 1 is a ketone, such as 1-adamantone. Then, product 2 is formed by treating with Al isopropoxide. Perhaps the ketone is being converted into an enol, which then could eliminate to form an alkene.

Wait, but enol formation usually requires acidic conditions, and Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. So, maybe it's helping to form a better leaving group, leading to elimination.

If product 1 is 1-adamantone, the reaction with a Lewis acid might lead to the formation of an enol, which could then undergo elimination to form a conjugated diene or an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is being converted into an alkyne, but that's less likely.

Wait, another possibility: the Al isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for a pinacol-like rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol is dehydrated to form a ketone. But product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's undergoing a reverse pinacol rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is being used in a benzoin condensation, but that's usually for aldehydes.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress on this step. Let's proceed under the assumption that product 2 is an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Product 3's NMR: the most deshielded hydrogen would be near a carbonyl group, perhaps. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring hydrogens.

But in the ozonolysis step, if product 2 is an alkene, then product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. Let's imagine that product 2 is an alkene in a ring structure, perhaps a cyclopropane or another ring.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic compound with an alkene. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups, leading to a diketone or similar.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible structures.

If product 1 is 1-adamantone, then product 2 could be an alkene formed by elimination from the ketone. For example, in the presence of a Lewis acid, the ketone might lose a proton to form an enol, which then could eliminate to form an alkene. So, product 2 would have a double bond adjacent to the ketone.

Then, ozonolysis would break that double bond. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene, for example, would give two carbonyl groups. But if the alkene is isolated, ozonolysis would give two carbonyls as well.

Product 3 would thus be a compound with two additional carbonyl groups.

But I'm not getting the exact structure. Let's think about the NMR. The most deshielded hydrogen would be next to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl.

In an aldehyde, the hydrogen is usually around 9-10 ppm. But if it's a ketone, the adjacent H would be in a different region.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is a cyclohexene ring, part of the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break the ring, perhaps, forming two ketone groups.

But in that case, product 3 might have a diketone structure, and the H's next to the ketone would be deshielded.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a dialdehyde, which would have H's around 9-10 ppm, but the question says to exclude those that exchange with D₂O. So, maybe the most deshielded H is next to a ketone.

Wait, for example, if the ozonolysis produces two ketones, the adjacent CH₂ groups would be next to the carbonyl. So, in the NMR, those H's would be around 2.1-2.5 ppm, maybe as a triplet or something else.

But the question is about the coupling pattern. Let's think about the structure.

Suppose the ozonolysis creates two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH₂ group. Each of these CH₂ groups would be next to a carbonyl, and perhaps also adjacent to other CH₂ groups. So, each H in the CH₂ would have neighboring H's.

For example, a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl and another CH₂ group. So each H on the CH₂ would couple with the adjacent H on the same CH₂ (geminal coupling, but that's usually negligible) and with the H's on the neighboring CH₂ group (vicinal coupling).

Wait, but in the NMR, the splitting comes from neighboring non-equivalent H's. So, if each H is adjacent to two H's on the same CH₂ and two H's on the neighboring CH₂, the coupling would be more complex.

Wait, but in reality, each H on the CH₂ would have two neighboring H's on the same group (geminal, but usually not split) and two neighboring H's on the adjacent group (vicinal coupling). So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets? Or a doublet of triplets?

Wait, let's model it with a simple example. Suppose we have a structure like CH₂-CO-R next to another CH₂-CO-R. Each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂. So each H in the first CH₂ is next to two H's in the second CH₂.

So, each H would have two neighboring H's from the adjacent group. So, for each H, the splitting would be into a triplet due to coupling with two equivalent H's on the adjacent CH₂.

Wait, no, wait. Each H in the CH₂ group would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH₂. If the two H's are equivalent, then each H would split into a triplet (n+1, where n=2). So, each H would be a triplet. But wait, if the coupling is between two sets of two H's, perhaps there's more splitting.

Alternatively, maybe each H is coupled to two H's on each adjacent CH₂. For example, if each CH₂ has two H's and each is coupled to the two H's on the neighboring CH₂, then each H would have four neighboring H's, but that's not possible as they are all equivalent or not.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as each H on a CH₂ group is coupled with two H's from the adjacent group. But if those two are equivalent, it's a triplet. But if they are not equivalent (like in a geminal coupling?), it becomes more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two H's, but each coupling is to a different set. For example, each H is coupled to two H's on one adjacent CH₂ and another two on another. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-CO-R. Then, each CH₂ is between two carbonyls. Each H on the middle CH₂ would be next to two H's on each adjacent CH₂.

Wait, no, in that case, each CH₂ is between two carbonyls. So, each CH₂ group's H's would be adjacent to another CH₂ group. So, each H would have two neighboring H's on each side. But since each side's H's are equivalent, each H would couple with two H's, leading to triplet splitting.

Alternatively, if the two adjacent H's are on the same carbon (like each H on CH₂ is adjacent to two H's on the next CH₂), then each H would be split by two H's, leading to a triplet.

But if there are two different coupling constants, perhaps the splitting is more complex. For example, two different J values, leading to a doublet of doublets, or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let me think of a specific structure. Suppose product 3 has a structure like:

O= C - CH₂ - CH₂ - C=O

So, the central CH₂ is between two carbonyl groups. Each H on the central CH₂ is adjacent to two H's on each side. But in reality, the two CH₂ groups are identical, so the coupling would be between equivalent H's, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but each H on the central CH₂ would be adjacent to two H's on each neighboring CH₂, but those H's are on different carbons, so perhaps the coupling would be between two separate sets. Hmm.

Alternatively, considering the structure:

R-CO-CH₂-CH₂-CO-R

Each H on the CH₂ groups would be next to two H's on the adjacent CH₂ group. So, each H would split into a triplet due to coupling with two H's. But if the coupling is between two separate pairs, maybe it's a doublet of doublets.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of the coupling in terms of number of neighboring H's.

Each H in the CH₂ group has two neighboring H's on the same CH₂ (but these don't split each other, as they are geminal and equivalent). Then, each H is also adjacent to two H's on the neighboring CH₂ group (on either side). So, each H would have two neighboring H's on one side and two on the other. But since the neighboring groups are equivalent, perhaps the coupling would be similar on both sides.

Wait, but each H is actually adjacent to four H's? No, because each H is on a CH₂ between two CO groups. So, each H is on a CH₂, and the adjacent groups are CH₂ on either side. So, each H on a CH₂ is next to two H's on the left and two on the right. But in reality, each H is only coupled to the H's on the adjacent CH₂ groups, which are each two H's.

So, for each H, there are two H's on the left (coupling with them) and two on the right (coupling with them). But since the left and right are equivalent (same environment), perhaps the coupling constants are the same. So, each H is coupled to four H's, but in reality, that's two sets of two H's with the same J value.

Wait, but in NMR, each coupling is considered independently. So, each H would have two neighboring environments, each with two H's. So, the splitting would be (n+1) for each set. So, for two sets of two H's each, the splitting would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9, leading to a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is only coupled to one set of two H's, leading to a triplet. But that doesn't account for all the couplings.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose we have a structure like CH₂=CH₂, which upon ozonolysis would form two formaldehyde molecules (but that's not relevant here). Alternatively, imagine a cyclic structure where ozonolysis produces a chain with two CH₂ groups next to carbonyls.

Wait, another approach: the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be the one closest to the carbonyl group. So, let's say it's a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. Each H in that CH₂ would be split by the H's on the adjacent CH₂ group.

So, if each H is adjacent to two H's on the neighboring CH₂, then each H would be a triplet. But wait, if each H is coupled with two H's on the same side and two on the other, perhaps the splitting is a triplet of triplets.

Wait, for example, if each H is coupled with two H's on one adjacent CH₂ (J1) and two H's on another adjacent CH₂ (J2), and J1 and J2 are different, then each H would be a doublet of doublets. But if J1 and J2 are the same, it would be a triplet.

But in reality, the adjacent CH₂ groups might be equivalent, so J1 and J2 are the same. So, each H would be coupled to four equivalent H's, leading to a quintet (n=4, so 5 peaks). But that's option D) pentet.

Wait, but earlier I thought the splitting would be a triplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two H's from one adjacent CH₂ and two from another, but they are in the same environment, leading to a quartet.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to think of a specific example. Suppose we have a structure like:

O= C - CH₂ - CH₂ - C=O

Each CH₂ group has two H's. The central CH₂ (if any) is between two carbonyls. Wait, no, in this case, each CH₂ is between a carbonyl and another CH₂.

So, each H in the first CH₂ (left) is adjacent to two H's in the middle CH₂. Similarly, each H in the middle CH₂ is adjacent to two H's on each side.

So, in the middle CH₂, each H is adjacent to two H's on the left and two on the right. So, for each H in the middle CH₂, n=2 (left) + n=2 (right) = 4. But since the left and right are symmetric, perhaps the coupling is considered as a single set of four H's. So, the splitting would be a quintet (n=4, so 5 peaks).

Wait, but that would give a quintet. However, the options don't have a quintet as an option. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Wait, the options include D) pentet. So, if the splitting is a quartet, which is four peaks, but the options have D as 'pentet' (which I think is a typo for quintet, i.e., five peaks). So, perhaps the correct splitting is a pentet.

But wait, how would a pentet arise? A pentet would be n=4, such as coupling with four equivalent H's. So, each H is coupled with four equivalent H's. For example, if a CH₂ group is adjacent to a CH₂ group with four H's (but that's not possible because a CH₂ group only has two H's). Alternatively, if a CH group is adjacent to four H's, but that's not likely either.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two H's from two different adjacent groups, each with two H's, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let's think: each H in the CH₂ group is coupled with two H's from one adjacent CH₂ and two from another. So, first, each H is split by the two H's from the first group into a triplet. Then, each of those peaks is further split by the two H's from the second group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are the same, it might collapse into a quintet, but that's only if the two J values are identical, which is less likely in this scenario.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that each H is coupled with two H's from one adjacent group and one H from another, leading to a doublet of triplets, which is option C.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about the structure again.

If product 3 is a diketone, with a structure like:

O= C - CH₂ - CH₂ - C=O

Then, each CH₂ group's H's are adjacent to two H's on the neighboring CH₂. So, each H is coupled with two H's, leading to a triplet. But what about the other adjacent H's?

Wait, each H in the CH₂ group is adjacent to two H's on the same CH₂ (but these are geminal and don't split) and two H's on each neighboring CH₂. So, each H is coupled with four H's in total: two on each side. But since the two on each side are equivalent, the coupling would be considered as two separate sets.

So, the first split is into a triplet due to coupling with two H's on one side. Then, each of those peaks is split again by coupling with two H's on the other side, leading to a triplet of triplets. So, the most deshielded H would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two H's on one side and one H on the other, leading to a different splitting.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the H's are only adjacent to two H's in total. For example, if the CH₂ is part of a chain where each H is only next to two H's (like in a simple ethylene glycol structure), then the splitting would be a triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Based on the options, I'm leaning towards a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves determining the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, formed through a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Formation of Product 1**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C leads to a carbonyl-containing product, as indicated by the IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹. This suggests the formation of a ketone, likely 1-adamantone, through elimination of two HBr molecules. The ¹H NMR data supports this:  
   - **4.79 ppm (2H)**: Likely a CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl.  
   - **2.41–2.23 ppm (10H)**: Bridgehead and adjacent CH₂ groups in the adamantane structure.  
   - **1.94 ppm (2H)**: A CH₂ group further from the carbonyl.

2. **Reaction 2: Formation of Product 2**  
   Treating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide likely facilitates a reaction that introduces an alkene. This could involve enol formation and subsequent elimination, resulting in a conjugated or isolated alkene within the adamantane framework.

3. **Reaction 3: Formation of Product 3**  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts alkenes into carbonyl compounds. Thus, product 3 likely contains carbonyl groups where the double bond was cleaved.

4. **Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Hydrogen in Product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group is coupled to two hydrogens on the same CH₂ group (geminal coupling, negligible) and two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group (vicinal coupling). Since the coupling constants (J values) for the two adjacent CH₂ groups are equivalent, the splitting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.

Critical analysis of the options:  
- **A) Triplet**: This would occur if each hydrogen were coupled to only two equivalent hydrogens. However, the presence of two distinct coupling constants (one for each adjacent CH₂ group) makes this unlikely.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This matches the scenario where each hydrogen is coupled to two hydrogens on one adjacent CH₂ group (first triplet) and two hydrogens on another adjacent CH₂ group (second triplet).  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would occur if one coupling constant were distinct from the other, but the symmetry of the structure suggests equivalent coupling constants.  
- **D) Pentet**: A pentet would arise if a hydrogen were coupled to four equivalent hydrogens, which is not consistent with the structure.

Thus, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern. 

Answer: B
