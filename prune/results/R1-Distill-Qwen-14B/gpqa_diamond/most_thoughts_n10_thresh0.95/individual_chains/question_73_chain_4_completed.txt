Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right. I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because of the theory of relativity. Oh wait, the formula for relative velocity is different. I think it's not as simple as v1 - v2. Let me recall the formula.

Oh yeah, the relative velocity formula from special relativity. If object 1 is moving at speed u1 and object 2 at u2 relative to the same frame, their relative speed u_rel is given by (u1 - u2) / (1 - (u1 u2)/c²). Because velocities don't just add up normally when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, wait. So in this problem, both astronauts are moving in the same direction. So object 1 (2m) is moving at 0.6c, and object 2 (3m) at 0.5c. So from the perspective of astronaut 2, what's the speed of astronaut 1?

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Let me think. Because when you're calculating the relative speed of one object from another's frame, you take u = (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1 u2)/(c^2)). So in this case, if I want to find the speed of astronaut 1 (2m) as seen by astronaut 2 (3m), I would plug u1 =0.6c and u2=0.5c.

Wait no, wait. No, wait. Because astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c. So from the perspective of astronaut 2, astronaut 1 is moving at u_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² )

Let me compute that. Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1-0.3=0.7. So u_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Oh, approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have relative speeds of 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. The system consists of both astronauts. So I think I need to calculate the total relativistic energy of each and sum them.

Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75).

Hmm, sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) which is (√3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So 1/0.8660 is approximately 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower than our calculation.

So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, which matches option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relativistic motion of the two astronauts and calculate both the relative speed and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative velocity formula from special relativity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) (for the astronaut with mass \(2m\)) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\) (for the astronaut with mass \(3m\)). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut (\(2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the second astronaut (\(3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:
