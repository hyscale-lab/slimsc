Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and think through each step.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably E2, forming an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the elimination would form an alkene between carbons 1 and 3. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons, right? Because in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads. So if it's 1,3-dibromo, maybe they are on adjacent bridgeheads. So elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe 1,2-diadamantadiene? Hmm, not exactly sure. Alternatively, it might form a diene.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a deshielded area, maybe an alcohol or an ether. But wait, when dihalides eliminate, they form alkenes. Oh wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so substitution would require a good leaving group. But dihalides are more likely to eliminate, especially with a strong base. Oh, but wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Let's think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH would probably form an alkene. Then, when that alkene is formed, perhaps the product isn't an alcohol. But the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's around the region of an alcohol or an ether. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a di-elimination, producing an alkene. But then, how does that lead to an -OH group? Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't the alkene but something else. Wait, another thought: Maybe the base is causing a ring-opening. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, highly strained but stable. But with two bromines, perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to a ring opening, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, but with two bromines, perhaps both are replaced. Wait, KOH with excess would lead to substitution for each Br. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane + 2 KOH would give 1,3-diol? Or wait, no, 1,3-diols would have hydroxyl groups, but the NMR at ~4.8 ppm is 2H—maybe two equivalent hydroxyl groups? Or perhaps it's a geminal diol, but that's not applicable here. Wait, wait—actually, if each Br is replaced by OH, but wait, in the reaction, two equivalents of KOH would be used. So if each Br is replaced by an OH, the product would be 1,3-diol. But the NMR shows 4.79 (2H). So perhaps the OH groups are adjacent and form a diol, but how would that look in the NMR?

Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide ring. But no, epoxide protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but I'm not certain. Or perhaps it's a vicinal diol, but again, the integration is 2H. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an alkene. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, that's a big clue. So product 1 has a carbonyl. So the initial reaction with KOH and heat must form a carbonyl. How does that happen?

Wait, maybe the dihalide undergoes elimination to form an alkene, but then there's an oxidation step. Or perhaps KOH is causing an elimination followed by some oxidation? No, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that usually gives alkenes, not carbonyls.

Wait, another angle: When vicinal dihalides react with aqueous KOH, sometimes they can form epoxides if the conditions are right. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then that alkene could be further oxidized. But again, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. The IR at 1720 cm^-1 indicates a carbonyl, probably a ketone since that's a common peak. So how do we get a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Another possibility: Maybe the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, losing HBr twice to form a diene, but that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single elimination to form an alkene, but again, how does that form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a dihalide, and the KOH isn't acting as a base but as a nucleophile. So perhaps a substitution reaction occurs. But with two bromines, maybe both are replaced by something else. But if KOH is used, then perhaps we get a diol. But if the product has a carbonyl, perhaps the diol undergoes some tautomerism or rearrangement. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think differently. The product has an IR peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. So how do we get a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation followed by some oxidation. But again, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbene or something else. I'm not very confident here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene. Then, perhaps under basic conditions, some peroxide or other oxidizing agent is present, but the question doesn't mention that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the NMR. Product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet for two hydrogens. So maybe they're part of an -OCH2O- group, like a diether? Or perhaps an -OCH2- group as in a hemiacetal or something. But then the IR is a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: The product is a diketone. But if the structure is adamantane, adding two ketone groups would require losing two H2Os or something. But how?

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH in such a way that each Br is replaced by an OH, but then the structure rearranges. But again, the NMR doesn't show broad peaks which would be typical for OH groups. The 4.79 is in the range of maybe an ether or an ester.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. The NMR would have peaks around 3-4 ppm for epoxide protons. But 4.79 is higher, so maybe not.

Wait, another angle: The IR peak suggests a carbonyl. Product 1 is made from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. Could it be that the dihalide is undergoing a double elimination to form a cyclopropane ring? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe we're forming an ester or a ketone via some elimination and substitution. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the product is an alcohol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretch, which is usually around 3200-3600 cm^-1. So the absence of that suggests it's not an alcohol. So the IR at 1720 must be from a ketone, ester, or maybe an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But then the NMR would have more peaks. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is part of an ester group, but I don't see how that would form from KOH and dibromide.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an -OH, but then some elimination occurs, forming a carbonyl. But that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via a double elimination, but I'm not sure how. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the dihalide to form a diol, which then loses water to form a carbonyl. But that would require some dehydration. But under what conditions? If it's heated, maybe the diol could lose water to form a carbonyl. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-diol → heating leads to dehydration to form a ketone. But that would require the diol to lose two water molecules to form two carbonyl groups? But that seems unlikely unless the structure allows it.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is 1,3-diol, and upon heating, one of the OH groups loses a proton to form an alkene and a water, but that would lead back to an alkene, not a ketone.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the next step to see if that helps. Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So if product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a ketone, and heating with Al(i-Pr)3 would facilitate some kind of alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. So maybe product 2 is an acylium ion or something, but then ozone is bubbled through it. Wait, no, product 2 is ozonized to form product 3.

Wait, the third step is ozonolysis. Ozone is used to cleave alkenes, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into smaller fragments with carbonyl groups.

But wait, product 1 is the result of the first reaction. So let me go back. Product
