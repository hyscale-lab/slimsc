Alright, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. Okay, the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially with light, special relativity might come into play. But wait, the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's an inertial frame, so we can use special relativity principles.

So the setup is: a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam. The observer is in the laboratory, which I assume is a stationary frame. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. When light travels through a medium, its speed changes. The standard formula is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But here, the medium itself (the glass) is moving. So how does the motion of the medium affect the observed speed of light in that medium?

Let me think about this. Normally, when a medium is moving, the way light propagates through it might be affected. I remember from the Michelson-Morley experiment that they tried to measure the speed of light in different directions in the ether, but found no difference, which led to the conclusion that there's no ether and we need relativity.

But in this case, the glass is moving through the lab frame. So for someone in the lab, how does the light's speed look?

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass frame, the light's speed is c/n, right? Because the glass's own index of refraction slows down the light. But from the lab frame, the glass is moving, so we need to apply a Lorentz transformation or something.

Wait, but special relativity says that the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So regardless of the motion of the source or the medium, the observed speed is c. But wait, that's in a vacuum. What about when the medium is moving?

Oh, wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's break it down. When light is in a medium, its speed is v = c/n. But if the medium itself is moving, does that affect the speed observed in the lab? So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light.

So from the lab's perspective, the light beam is moving through the moving glass. But the speed of light in the medium is c/n, but the medium is moving, so the lab would see the light's speed as... hmm, I'm not sure. Wait, in Newtonian mechanics, velocities add up. So if the medium is moving at v, and the light in the medium is moving at v_light_medium = c/n relative to the medium, then in the lab frame, the light's speed would be v_light_lab = v_light_medium + v, which is (c/n) + v.

Wait, that's the Newtonian approach, but Newtonian mechanics don't account for relativity. Since v is presumably a significant fraction of c, we can't use that method. So we need to use special relativity.

In special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula for adding velocities is different. The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, that's when you're transforming from one frame to another that's moving at velocity v.

But in this problem, the medium (glass) is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light_medium = c/n. So from the lab frame, what is the speed of the light? Do I apply the velocity addition formula?

Wait, that's exactly what I should do. Because in the glass's rest frame, the light is going at v = c/n. So the lab sees the glass moving at v, so we can use the relativistic velocity addition to find the lab's measurement of the light's speed.

So applying the formula: u' = (u + v_glass) / (1 + (u * v_glass)/c² )

Here, u is the velocity of light as measured in the glass frame, which is c/n. And v_glass is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab, which is v.

So substituting, u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v (c/n) ) / c² = 1 + v/(n c)

So, u' = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + (v)/(n c) ]

Hmm, but let's see if this makes sense. Let me factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator: (c + n v) / n

Denominator: (n c + v) / (n c)

Wait, wait, denominator is 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v )/(n c )

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel out:

[ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but n c + v is same as v + n c, and (c + n v) is same as (n v + c). So let me write this as:

u' = (c (n v + c )) / (n c + v )

Wait, wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator again.

Wait, u' = [ (c/n + v) ] / [1 + (v (c/n))/c² ]

Let me compute the denominator: 1 + v (c/n) / c² = 1 + v/(n c )

So, denominator is (n c + v)/(n c )

So, u' = (c/n + v) * (n c )/(n c + v )

Multiply numerator and denominator:

[ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ n c ] / (n c + v )

The n's cancel:

(c + n v ) * c / (n c + v )

Hmm, so u' = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 1, which is c. Wait, because in relativity, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the frame. So if u' is the speed measured in the lab, it should be c.

Wait, but that can't be right because the medium is moving, so how can the speed remain c? Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity addition.

Wait, no. Wait, the light is in a medium that's moving, but the speed of light in that medium is c/n in the medium's frame. So according to the lab frame, the speed can't be more than c. Hmm, but according to our previous calculation, u' is c (n v + c )/(n c + v )

Wait, let me check with some numbers. Suppose that n=1 (vacuum), and v is some velocity. Then, u' would be c (v + c )/(c + v ) = c. So that makes sense. So in that case, the speed is c.

What if v=0? Then u' = c (c)/(n c ) = c/(n ), but that's the speed of light in the medium. Wait, no, because in that case, the medium is stationary, so according to the lab, the speed is c/n. But according to the velocity addition, when v=0, u'= (c/n +0)/(1 + 0 )=c/n. So that's correct.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, when the glass is moving at velocity v, the lab measures the speed of light as [ (c/n + v ) ] / [ 1 + (v c)/(n c² ) ] = [ (c + n v )/(n) ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ) ] 

Which is [ (c + n v )/(n) ] * [n c/(n c + v) ) ]

Which becomes [ (c + n v ) * c ] / (n c + v )

So, is this equal to c?

Wait, that would require that (c + n v ) * c = c (n c + v )

Which would mean c + n v = n c + v 

Which would imply c = n c + v - n v => c(1 -n )= v (1 -n )

Which implies v = c, but that's only possible if 1 -n is non-zero, which it isn't when n=1. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about this differently. The speed of light in the medium is c/n in the medium's frame. But when the medium is moving, the lab's measurement should still be c because that's what relativity says. Wait, but that can't be correct because the medium is moving. Or is it?

Wait, actually, no. Relativity says that in any inertial frame, the speed of light is c. So regardless of the medium's motion, the lab measures the speed of light as c. So the correct answer should be B) 1, since c=1 in the problem.

Wait, but in the initial scenario, the light is moving through a medium which is itself moving. But in reality, the speed of light is always c in the lab frame. So the answer is B.

But wait, that doesn't seem right because the medium's velocity is affecting the light. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up reference frames. Let me think: the light is emitted in the glass, which is moving. So in the lab's frame, the light must still move at c.

So the correct answer is B) 1.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. Then, using the velocity addition formula, the lab would see the light moving at (c/n + v ) / (1 + (c v)/(n c²) ) = (c + n v)/(n (1 + v/(n c)) )

Wait, but this could be rewritten as [ (c + n v ) ] / [n ( (n c + v )/(n c) ) ) ] 

Which becomes [ (c + n v ) * n c ] / [n (n c + v ) ) ] 

Simplify: (c (c + n v )) / (n c + v )

Wait, but if n=1, this gives (c (c + v )) / (c + v ) ) = c. So, for n=1, it works.

If the glass is moving at v=0, then u' = (c + 0 )/(n c + 0 ) * n c ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let me try plugging in numbers. Let’s take n=2, v=0.5 c.

In the glass's frame, light speed is c/2. So in the lab frame, using the velocity addition formula, u' = ( (c/2) + 0.5 c ) / (1 + ( (c/2)*0.5 c ) / c² )

Denominator: 1 + ( (0.5 c^2 )/(2 c² ) ) = 1 + (0.5 / 2 ) = 1 + 0.25 = 1.25.

Numerator: (0.5 c + 0.5 c ) = c.

So u' = c / 1.25 = 0.8 c.

Wait, but according to relativity, in the lab frame, the speed should be c. But according to this calculation, it's 0.8 c. That's a contradiction.

Hmm, that suggests that my approach is wrong. Because according to relativity, the speed of light should always be c. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm considering the velocity of the light in the medium as c/n in the medium's frame, but maybe that's not correct in a moving medium.

Wait, no, in the medium's frame, the light's speed is c/n. But when the medium is moving, perhaps the speed doesn't just add linearly. Or perhaps the assumption that the speed in the medium is c/n is valid only in its rest frame.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up two different concepts. The speed of light in a medium is c/n in the medium's rest frame, but when the medium is moving, the lab frame would see the light speed as c, regardless. So perhaps the correct answer is B) 1.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results when I plug in numbers. So I'm confused. Let me think again.

Another approach: Consider that the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So whether the medium is moving or not, the speed of light in the lab frame is c. So the correct answer is B) 1.

But why did the velocity addition formula give a different result earlier? Because in that calculation, perhaps I misapplied it. Or perhaps the assumption that the light speed in the medium's frame is c/n is wrong when the medium is moving.

Wait, in the medium's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But when the medium is moving, perhaps the light's speed is different. Wait, no, because in any inertial frame, the speed of light is c. Or wait, no, that's not the case when the light is inside a medium.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think about this again. In a medium at rest, the speed is c/n. But when the medium moves, the lab (inertial) frame measures the speed as c, not c/n. Because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So the correct answer is B.

So the options are:

A) (1 +n v)/(n +v)

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

So the answer should be B) 1.


The problem involves determining the speed of light in a glass medium relative to a laboratory frame, where the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam. The index of refraction of the glass is \( n \), and the speed of light in a vacuum is \( c = 1 \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Speed of Light in a Medium**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( c/n \), where \( c = 1 \), so the speed becomes \( 1/n \).

2. **Relativity of Light Speed**: According to the principles of special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is always \( c \), regardless of the motion of the source, medium, or observer. This means that even though the glass is moving, the laboratory frame will still measure the speed of light as \( c \).

3. **Velocity Addition Formula**: While the relativistic velocity addition formula could be used to calculate the speed of an object in a moving medium, it is unnecessary here because the speed of light is invariant and always \( c \) in any inertial frame.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: \( (1 + n v)/(n + v) \) does not represent the invariant speed of light and is incorrect.
   - **Option B**: \( 1 \) corresponds to the speed of light in a vacuum (\( c = 1 \)) and is consistent with the principles of special relativity.
   - **Option C**: \( (1 + n v)/(n - v) \) is incorrect as it does not represent the invariant speed of light.
   - **Option D**: \( (1 - n v)/(n + v) \) is also incorrect for the same reason.

### Conclusion:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory frame is always \( c \), which corresponds to \( 1 \) in the given units (\( c = 1 \)).

**Answer: B**
