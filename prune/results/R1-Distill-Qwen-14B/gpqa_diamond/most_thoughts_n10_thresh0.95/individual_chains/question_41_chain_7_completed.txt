Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. It's about the speed of light in a moving medium, which sounds a bit tricky. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, this medium itself is moving. So does the motion of the medium affect the observed speed of light inside it?

Wait, from what I recall, in special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the observer's motion or the source's motion. But here, the light is in a medium, not a vacuum. So how does that work?

The glass is moving toward the observer, same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer as well, but the glass is moving along with it. Or wait, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Let me clarify the setup.

The light is inside the glass, which is moving. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light beam?

Wait, the speed of light in the medium is v = c/n. But if the medium itself is moving, does that add to the speed? Like, if the medium is moving at velocity v, then maybe the light's speed as observed would be v_medium + v? But I'm not sure if that's correct because of relativity.

Wait, but in classical mechanics, velocities add up linearly. So if the medium is moving at v, and light's speed in the medium is c/n, then the observed speed would be (c/n) + v? But wait, that can't be right because if the medium is moving quickly, the speed might approach c, which would violate relativity. Or maybe I'm mixing different concepts here.

Wait, another approach. The glass's motion is in the same direction as the light beam. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it. So the glass is moving at velocity v, and within it, the light is moving at v_l = c/n relative to the glass. So what's the speed of the light as observed in the lab?

In classical terms, you might just add the velocities: v_light = v_glass + v_light_in_medium. So that would be v_total = v + (c/n). But wait, the options don't look like that. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option B is 1, which is just c. But that's only if the velocity addition somehow cancels out. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, but I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. So you have to use the velocity addition formula. But does that apply here?

Wait, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So in the glass, the speed is 1/n. But if the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Alternatively, perhaps the motion of the medium doesn't affect the speed of light in it. Because from the lab frame, the light is moving at v = c/n in the frame of the glass, which itself is moving at velocity v. So maybe using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, the relativistic formula for adding velocities is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But in this case, u is the speed of light in the medium's frame, which is 1/n. Wait, but wait: no, because the medium is moving, and the light is moving within it. So perhaps from the lab frame, what is the speed of the light.

Wait, the medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So the light's velocity in the medium is (1/n) in that direction. So in the lab frame, the light's velocity would be u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (v*(1/n)) / c² ). But since c=1, that's ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/(n) ) ).

Wait, let me compute that. Let me write it as u = [ (1 + n v ) /n ] / [ (n + v ) /n ] = (1 +n v)/(n + v) ) * (n /n )? Wait wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, the formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² ). Since c=1, it's (u + v)/(1 + u v).

Here, u is the speed of the light in the medium's frame. So u = 1/n. So substituting, the observed speed u' is ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) * v ).

Hmm, let's compute that:

Numerator: (1 + n v)/n.

Denominator: (n + v)/n.

So when you divide them, the n in numerator and denominator cancels:

(1 + n v)/n divided by (n + v)/n is (1 +n v)/(n +v).

Wait, so u' is (1 +n v)/(n +v). Let me look at the options.

Option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). That's what I got. So that would be the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait, but wait. The question is, what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. Now, the speed of light in the glass is 1/n. But because the glass is moving, the observed speed is as per the relativistic addition.

Wait, but the options include (1 +n v)/(n +v), which is option A. So that would be the answer. But let me think again.

Alternatively, I might have confused whether it's the medium moving towards or away. Since the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is also moving in the same direction, perhaps the relative speed adds.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So their velocities add up.

But wait, the beam is inside the glass, so in the glass's frame, the beam is moving at v = 1/n. So from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, the observed speed would be higher.

But according to the relativistic velocity addition, it's u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² ). Since c=1, that's (u +v)/(1 + u v).

So with u = 1/n, the observed speed is (1/n +v) / (1 + v/(n)).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

Numerator: 1 +n v.

Denominator: n + v.

So it's (1 +n v)/(n + v), which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \), and the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass itself is \( v_{\text{glass}} = \frac{1}{n} \). The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer.

From the observer's perspective in the laboratory, the observed speed of light \( u' \) is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass itself.
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.
- \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{1}{n} v}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the observed speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \)**.
