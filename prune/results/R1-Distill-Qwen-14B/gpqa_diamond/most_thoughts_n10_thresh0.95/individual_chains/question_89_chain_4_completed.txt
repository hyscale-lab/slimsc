--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon with a lot of carbon-carbon bonds, but the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane must have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons or something. 

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), a multiplet between 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and a peak at 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which I think is a carbonyl group (C=O). 

So, KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with it, especially under heating, elimination reactions usually happen. So, if we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH would probably lead to an elimination, forming a double bond—like an E2 mechanism. But wait, if two adjacent bromines are present, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't adjacent; the positions are 1 and 3, which are not adjacent on the adamantane structure. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, another possibility: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-diX) react with a strong base, they eliminate to form alkenes. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are on carbons that are two apart. Maybe it's a dihalide that's not vicinal, so elimination might not form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a dehydrohalogenation, but that typically requires adjacent leaving groups. Oh wait, maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of cyclization.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone or an ester or something. So perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but some kind of substitution or oxidation.

Wait, KOH is a strong base but not oxidizing. Wait, wait, maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when KOH is used, it leads to an elimination to form an epoxide? No, wait, that's when there's a vicinal dihalide, and it forms an epoxide upon treatment with something like H2O or base. Hmm, but that would require adjacent Br atoms. So maybe that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the base is causing the formation of a ketone via some elimination. But where would the carbonyl come from? Oh, I'm getting confused. Let's think about the possible structures.

Adamantane is a diamondoid molecule with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on two bridgehead carbons that are separated by a certain number of bonds. When heated with KOH, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But that would require a good leaving group. Wait, but KOH is a strong base; perhaps it's an E2 elimination.

Wait, another thought: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can form a ketone if the two halogens are on adjacent carbons. But in this case, the halogens are on 1 and 3 positions, which are not adjacent. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. But for that, the two bromines would have to be on adjacent carbons, maybe. If they're not, how can that happen?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening. For example, adamantane is a very rigid molecule; perhaps the dihalide can't undergo elimination because the rings are too strained. Alternatively, maybe KOH is causing a Hofmann elimination or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the IR, which shows a strong carbonyl, maybe the product is a ketone. So where would the ketone come from? If two bromides are on adjacent carbons, perhaps elimination would form a double bond, but if dehydrohalogenation isn't possible, maybe the base is causing a substitution. Wait, that doesn't make sense for substitution.

Wait, wait, another possibility: maybe the dihalide undergoes a double elimination. For example, two dehydrohalogenation steps. If each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps each elimination forms a double bond, but then... But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when treated with KOH, it forms a diepoxide? No, that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, the NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's upfield for a CH2 group. Maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen. So maybe it's an epoxide group, but the IR doesn't show a peak for an epoxide (which is around 1200-1300 cm-1 for the C-O-C stretch). The IR here shows 1720, which is carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, let's think: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes you can get a ketone if the two halogens are on adjacent carbons and the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. But in this case, the halogens are at 1 and 3 positions, which are not adjacent. So maybe it's a different kind of elimination.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So perhaps the product is an epoxide? No, because the epoxide's carbonyl is at lower wavenumbers, around 800-1000 cm-1. Alternatively, it's a ketone.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexanone derivative. But how? Let me try to think about the reaction.

1,3-dibromoadamantane: each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. When KOH is added and heated, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but where? Because it's a bridgehead, elimination might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, wait! Another possibility: when a geminal dihalide (two halogens on the same carbon) is treated with a strong base, it can form a ketone. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a geminal dihalide. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps KOH is causing the dihalide to form a diketone? But that would require two eliminations, each forming a carbonyl. I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopentanone or something similar. But I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol. But the IR doesn't show an O-H stretch, unless it's an ether. But the IR of 1720 is more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But then the IR would show the C-O stretch around 1200 cm-1. But the given IR is 1720, so maybe a ketone.

So, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, each Br is removed, and a carbonyl group is formed. But how?

Wait, in the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH is added, each Br is replaced by an O- group. But then, perhaps the two O- groups could deprotonate and form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the two dehydrohalogenation steps happen, each removing a Br and a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH, which is a base, and the two Brs leave, forming a new bond, which would be a double bond or a ring. But not sure.

Wait, the 1H NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a deshielded region, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, maybe it's a methylene group next to an oxygen, like in an ether or an epoxide.

But wait, the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, the product is a ketone, and the 4.79 ppm is something else, like an adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, let's think about the structure of adamantane. If the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and elimination occurs, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgeheads, and elimination could form a bridge across, resulting in a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is adamantanone, which is a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the next part of the problem. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3. The question is about the 1H NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

So, perhaps, the first step gives a ketone, product 1. Then, product 2 is formed by some kind of reaction with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's being used in a different reaction.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts reactions, but product 1 is a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but product 2 is treated with ozone. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl groups. So perhaps product 2 has a double bond.

Wait, let's tie this together. Product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. What reaction would that be? Maybe the ketone undergoes some kind of elimination, forming an alkene. Because when a ketone is treated with a strong Lewis acid, perhaps it can undergo elimination to form an alkene via an enolization.

Wait, but another possibility: product 1 is an epoxide. Then, treating it with aluminum isopropoxide would do something else, maybe opening the epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol. Because when a dihalide is treated with a base, sometimes it can form a diol via substitution. But then the IR would show O-H stretches, which aren't mentioned here. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, let me think: if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed by heating with aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but then the IR would show the C-O-C stretch. The IR given is 1720, which is more of a carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone.

So, product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is formed by reaction with aluminum isopropoxide. What could that be? Maybe a Claisen rearrangement? Or perhaps a elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, another possibility: when a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, it can promote the formation of an enol ether via an enolization. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone undergoes a Wittig reaction. But for a Wittig reaction, a ylide is needed, which is usually generated from an alkyl halide and triphenylphosphine. So perhaps that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe product 2 is an alkene, as ozonolysis is next. So if product 2 is an alkene, then product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which are carbonyl compounds.

But how does product 1 (a ketone) become product 2 (an alkene) when treated with Al(OiPr)3?

Wait, could product 1 be a diol, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 undergoes elimination to form an alkene? Because Al(OiPr)3 is a strong Lewis acid and can catalyze such eliminations.

But wait, product 1's NMR doesn't show broad O-H peaks, so it's not likely a diol. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. But the IR doesn't show an ester carbonyl (which is around 1740-1720 cm-1). Wait, the IR is at 1720, which is in the range for a ketone or an ester. Hmm.

Wait, product 1's NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H). That could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen. Let's say it's adjacent to an oxygen like in an ether or an epoxide. But the IR is 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's an ester group. Wait, but I don't see an ester in the product unless there's an oxygen elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl, like in an acetal or something. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. Then, upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3, maybe some rearrangement occurs. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the IR first. 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, suggesting a carbonyl. So product 1 is likely a ketone. The NMR has a 2H peak at 4.79 ppm. That's a region where a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom would appear—like an ether or an ester. But in a ketone, perhaps that's a methylene next to the carbonyl.

Wait, the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is two bromines on bridgeheads. If the base KOH is causing elimination, perhaps it's eliminating two bromides and forming a bridge. For example, each Br is on a bridgehead, and upon elimination, a bridge is formed with a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone, but that's speculative.

Wait, but considering the NMR data, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group adjacent to oxygen, such as in a diethyl ketone or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a methylene group in a cyclopropane ring or something else.

Wait, considering that the NMR also has a multiplet for 10H between 2.41-2.23 ppm. That's a lot of hydrogens, likely in a structure like a cyclohexane ring where the hydrogens are all around 2 ppm. So perhaps the molecule has a cyclohexane ring attached to a carbonyl group.

So, putting it all together: product 1 is a ketone, perhaps adamantanone or a similar structure. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3. Maybe this is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would require an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination.

Wait, another angle: if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bridged bicyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is product 1 with a new double bond formed. So, when product 1 (a ketone) is treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, maybe it undergoes an elimination, forming a double bond. Because when a ketone has a beta hydrogen, a base can abstract it, leading to the formation of an enol (which tautomerizes to the ketone), but that doesn't form an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps a neighboring group participation or some other mechanism.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an alkene formed by elimination. But earlier I thought product 1 isn't a diol because the IR doesn't show O-H stretch. But perhaps the solvent is D2O, so the O-H protons would have exchanged and not appear in the NMR. So, if product 1 is a diol, and then treated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a strong Lewis acid, perhaps it can cause dehydration, forming an alkene.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, if product 1 is a diol, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it could lose water, forming an alkene. Then, product 2 would be an alkene. Ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups.

But earlier I thought product 1's IR would show O-H if it were a diol, but if the O-H protons exchanged with D2O, they wouldn't show up. So perhaps product 1 is a diol, product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product.

So, let's piece it together:

1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. KOH could cause a substitution, replacing each Br with OH, forming a diol. So product 1 would be 1,3-diol adamantane. Then, product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a strong Lewis acid, and could facilitate elimination of water, forming an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene, perhaps 1,3-adamantadiene or similar.

Then, product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkene typically cleaves it into two carbonyl groups. The conditions are important: ozone is bubbled at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. That's a standard reductive work-up, which would break the ozonides into carbonyl compounds without over-oxidizing.

Now, the question is about the 1H NMR of product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one nearest to the carbonyl groups, perhaps in a conjugated system.

But wait, let's think about the structure after ozonolysis. If product 2 is a cyclic diene (like bicyclic with a double bond), ozonolysis would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyl groups.

But the exact structure would determine the NMR. Let's assume that product 3 is a diketone or two ketones connected in a certain way.

But I'm not exactly sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is converted into an alkene, which upon ozonolysis forms two carbonyls. Then, in the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Wait, in product 3, perhaps the structure is a diepoxide or a diketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pair of carbonyl compounds, each with a certain number of protons.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So, perhaps in product 3, there is a proton that is split due to coupling with adjacent protons.

Let me think about the possible structure. Suppose the alkene in product 2 is between two bridgeheads. Ozonolysis would cleave each end, forming two carbonyl groups. The resulting structure might have two ketones, each with a methylene group attached.

Wait, perhaps product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl. The protons on the CH2 would be deshielded and split based on their neighboring protons.

If the CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl, the protons would be deshielded. Each hydrogen on CH2 would couple with neighboring Hs. Let's say each CH2 group is between two carbonyls. But perhaps it's not.

Wait, another possibility: after ozonolysis, product 3 might have a structure where a CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups, leading to each CH2 proton being split by adjacent Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that's next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group. So, each H would couple with two sets of neighboring Hs.

Wait, maybe the structure after ozonolysis is something like (CH2)2(CO)R. So, the CH2 groups would be adjacent to each other and to the carbonyl. So, each CH2 would have Hs that are split by their adjacent Hs.

If each CH2 has two neighboring Hs from another CH2 group, each H would have coupling with two Hs, leading to a triplet. But wait, if each H is coupling with two equivalent Hs, that would give a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more complex, leading to more coupling partners.

Wait, the product after ozonolysis could be a diketone with a CH2 group between them. So, perhaps it's O=C-O-CH2-CH2-O-C=O or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the most deshielded H in product 3 would be near a carbonyl group. Suppose it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. If the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H on the CH2 would have coupling with two adjacent Hs (from the neighboring CH2) and perhaps also with any vicinal Hs.

Wait, but in that case, each H would have coupling with two Hs on one side and two on the other, but perhaps they are equivalent, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H would see two Hs on each adjacent carbon. Wait, but that's a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclopropane ring with two carbonyl groups attached. But that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis produces a diketone where the two carbonyls are connected by a single CH2 group. So, the structure would be O=C-(CH2)n-C=O. For n=1, that would be O=C-CH2-C=O. The CH2 group would have each H coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (if any), but wait, in this case, it's just a single CH2 between two carbonyls.

So, each H on the CH2 would have two adjacent Hs (like in a CH2 group), but since each H is next to another CH2 group, perhaps they are split into a triplet.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible NMR pattern. The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H, excluding those that exchange.

If the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and perhaps next to another CH2 group, each H could couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH2. Wait, but each CH2 has two Hs, so each H on the middle CH2 would couple with two Hs on one side and two on the other. But that's four Hs, leading to a pentet. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH group, but that's less likely.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the options given.

Options are:
A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

What would cause a triplet? If each H is coupled with two equivalent Hs. So, perhaps each H is next to a CH2 group, which has two Hs.

Alternatively, if a H is adjacent to a CH2 group, each H would split into a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the CH2.

Wait, suppose the structure after ozonolysis is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the middle CH2 groups would each have their Hs coupled with each other. But wait, no, each end CH2 would be adjacent to a carbonyl and perhaps another CH2.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the middle CH2 groups would have Hs that are next to another CH2, leading to splitting. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CHO, then the CH2 protons would be next to a CHO group. But that's not likely from ozonolysis of a simple diene.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis breaks a four-membered ring, producing two carbonyl groups connected by a single CH2 group. So the structure would be O=C-CH2-C=O. Then, each CH2 would have two Hs. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl, so deshielded. The coupling would be between the Hs on the CH2 group and any neighboring Hs. But in this case, each CH2 is between two carbonyls, so perhaps each H is coupled with the other H on the same CH2 and any from adjacent groups. Hmm, but in this case, perhaps each H on CH2 is coupled with only one other H (the one on the same CH2), leading to a doublet. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps adjacent groups have more Hs.

Wait, maybe the structure is more complex. Suppose after ozonolysis, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2 group. So, O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each CH2 group is between two carbonyls. Then, each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the neighboring CH2 group. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

In that case, the most deshielded H (on the CH2 between the carbonyls) would be a triplet. So the answer would be A) triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 group is connected to another CH2, so each H would have coupling with two Hs on each adjacent CH2, leading to more splitting. For example, each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, but if those are equivalent, it would be a triplet. But if they are not equivalent, it might be a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, if each H is coupled with two Hs on one adjacent CH2 and two on another, but they are not equivalent, then the splitting would be more complex. For example, each H would couple with two Hs from one neighboring group (say, a triplet) and two from another neighboring group (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

But if all the neighboring Hs are equivalent, it would be a triplet.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recap:

Product 3 is the ozonolysis product of product 2, which was formed by treating product 1 (a diol perhaps) with Al(OiPr)3, which may have formed an alkene. Ozonolysis of this alkene would break it into two carbonyl groups. The product 3's NMR would show the Hs adjacent to these carbonyls.

Assuming product 3 is a diketone with a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, each CH2 group's Hs would be next to two others. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the other CH2, leading to a triplet coupling pattern.

Alternatively, if the CH2 groups are each adjacent to only one other CH2 group, each H would have two neighbors, leading to a triplet.

So, the correct answer would be a triplet, which is option A.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C likely results in a substitution reaction, replacing the bromine atoms with hydroxyl groups. This forms a diol (1,3-dioladamantane) as product 1. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is consistent with a carbonyl group, but this could also arise from the diol under specific conditions (e.g., if partially dehydrated). The ¹H NMR data supports this interpretation: the 4.79 ppm (2H) signal corresponds to a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom, and the 1.94 ppm (2H) signal corresponds to a CH₂ group in a less deshielded environment.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   Product 1 (the diol) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid. This likely facilitates dehydration of the diol, forming an alkene (product 2). The reaction conditions favor elimination, leading to the formation of a double bond.

3. **Ozonolysis of product 2**:  
   Ozonolysis of the alkene (product 2) at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide, cleaves the double bond and forms carbonyl-containing products (product 3). The exact structure of product 3 depends on the position and nature of the double bond in product 2. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling pattern in product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen couples with two equivalent hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern. Other coupling patterns, such as a triplet of triplets or a pentet, are less consistent with the expected structure.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
