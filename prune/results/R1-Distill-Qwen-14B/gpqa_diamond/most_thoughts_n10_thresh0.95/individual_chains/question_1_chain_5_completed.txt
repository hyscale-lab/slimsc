Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Hmm.

So, the problem states that there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. Wait, the lifetimes... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy of a particle to the precision of its measurement. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, but often approximated as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ. 

So, the uncertainty in energy depends on the lifetime of the state because the lifetime is the time over which the energy is measured. The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy can be measured because there's more time to observe it, leading to a smaller uncertainty. Alternatively, a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy.

The question is asking for the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve the two states. That means the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we wouldn't be able to distinguish them.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So the uncertainty in energy for each state would be based on their respective lifetimes. Let me think: for state E1 with a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(τ2), where τ2 is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So we need the difference |E2 - E1| to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each's uncertainty? Or maybe the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime. Because the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. So if the difference is larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, we can resolve them. Let me think more.

Suppose the two states have different uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty (since ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, so shorter τ means larger ΔE). So if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states can be distinguished. Because even the state with the larger uncertainty would have a width that's less than the energy difference.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime. Because the uncertainty is larger for the shorter-lived state. So, if the energy difference is bigger than ΔE1, which is bigger than ΔE2, then the two states can be resolved.

So, let's compute the uncertainties. I'll need the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Then ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

So, for E1: τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. Hmm, but the options are given in eV. So I need to convert J to eV.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 = 1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. Wait, that's 6.58e-7 eV. That's 0.658e-6 eV, which is about 0.658 micro-eV.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1e-9 seconds is 1 nanosecond. So let's compute 1.055e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.055e-25 J. Then divide by 1.602e-19 to get eV: (1.055e-25)/(1.602e-19) = approx (1.055 / 1.602) * 1e-6 = 0.658 * 1e-6 eV. Yep, so about 6.58e-7 eV, or 0.658 micro-eV.

Similarly, for τ2 =1e-8 seconds, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV. That's 0.658e-7 eV, about 0.0658 micro-eV.

So the uncertainty for E1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and for E2 it's about 6.58e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be clearly distinguishable. Or wait, wait. Because each state has its own uncertainty, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two? Hmm. Let me think about how energy resolution works.

In spectroscopy, for example, the resolving power depends on the energy spread. If two peaks are being observed, each with their own linewidths, the minimum energy difference between them for resolution is roughly the sum of their half-widths. So, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

But in this case, the problem says "clearly distinguish these two energy levels." So the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Another approach: the uncertainty principle says that the time of measurement defines the energy uncertainty. If you have two states, the precision in energy measurement is determined by the longer of the two lifetimes? Or the shorter?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime because that's the larger uncertainty. Because if the difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then they're definitely separated beyond the larger possible error.

So, the larger uncertainty is ΔE1 = ~6.58e-7 eV. So, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 must be greater than this.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 n eV → 1e-9 is 0.001 nano. That's way smaller than 6.58e-7 eV. So no.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, so no.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 / 1e-7 (6.58e-7) about 1500 times larger. So yes, much bigger than ΔE1. So this would allow clear distinction.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. 1e-8 is larger than 6.58e-8? No, 6.58e-8 is about 6.58 x1e-8, so 1e-8 is smaller than that. So it's 1e-8 eV is about 0.15 times ΔE1. So, 1e-8 is less than the uncertainty of E1, so not enough to distinguish.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. 6.58e-7 eV is 6.58 x1e-7. The option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01e-7 eV. So 1e-8 is 10^-8, which is 0.001 times 10^-7. So 1e-8 is way smaller than 6.58e-7. So 1e-8 is much smaller than ΔE1, so the energy difference between E2 and E1 would have to be bigger than 6.58e-7 eV to be resolved.

So looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4, larger than 6.58e-7. So that's good.

Wait, but wait again. The energy difference is E2 - E1. So let's say E2 > E1. So the difference would be E2 - E1. For them to be distinguishable, the difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Wait, but that depends on the measurement method.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is bigger than the larger uncertainty, then even considering the maximum possible error, you can tell that the energies are different.

So if ΔE_diff > max(ΔE1, ΔE2), then they can be distinguished.

In this case, max(ΔE1, ΔE2) is ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV. So any ΔE_diff > 6.58e-7 eV would suffice.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 1e-4 is larger than 6.58e-7 (which is 0.000000658 eV). So yes, 1e-4 is much larger. So option C is a valid choice.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. Which is way smaller than 6.58e-7 eV. So that's too small.

So the correct energy difference must be larger than approximately 6.58e-7 eV. So among the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is bigger than that.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \Delta t \approx \hbar
\]

Here, \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, and \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. For a state with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties in energy for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \, \text{J} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_1 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \, \text{J} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the larger uncertainty, which is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient to resolve the two states.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is also insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it satisfies the condition for clear resolution.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two states.
