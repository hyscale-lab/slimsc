Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me see what I can remember. The question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X, given its mass is 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is provided, but I'm not sure how that affects the decay channels yet. Let me think.

Wait, the mass of the boson is 6 GeV. So for it to decay into a pair of particles, each of those particles must be lighter than half of 6 GeV, right? Because in particle physics, the rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So, I should find all possible fermion-antifermion pairs that each fermion is less than 3 GeV.

But wait, what fermions are there? Let's list them. There are leptons and quarks. For leptons, the charged ones are e, mu, tau, and their antiparticles. The neutrinos are neutral but they're negligible mass, so probably not relevant here. For quarks, we have up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top. But the top quark is really heavy, like around 173 GeV. So, way too heavy for this.

So, let's see each possible fermion pair.

First, the boson X can decay into any fermion and its antiparticle as long as each is less than 3 GeV. Let me list the masses of the known particles.

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV. So e+ e- is allowed.
Same for muon: ~0.1 GeV. So mu+ mu- is allowed.
Tau is about 1.78 GeV. So tau+ tau- is allowed because each is about 1.78, so 1.78*2 = 3.56 GeV. Wait wait, wait, that's more than 6? Oh no, wait, no. Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So the pair can have a total mass up to 6 GeV. Because each decay product must be less than half, right? So each fermion must be less than 3 GeV.

Tau is 1.78 GeV. So tau pair is allowed. How about the other quarks?

Up quark: about 2 MeV, so way under 3 GeV. Same for down and strange. Charm is around 1.5 GeV. So all of those are under 3 GeV. So X can decay into u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Wait, what about bottom quarks? The bottom is about 4.5 GeV. But if X is 6 GeV, each b would have to be under 3 GeV. But 4.5 is bigger than 3, so that's not possible. So b and anti-b can't be decay products because each is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

Similarly, top quark is way too heavy, so that's out.

So, possible fermions for decay are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. So their pairs are e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Wait, but the problem gives the interaction Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f f-bar (y) (upsilon + X(y)) psi_f(y). Hmm, wait, perhaps that's a typo in the question. Let me read it again. Oh, wait, the question says the interaction is L(y) = -λ f (psi_f bar) (y) (upsilon + X(y)) psi_f(y). Wait, maybe that's a typo. Or perhaps it's written as L = -λ fψ_f† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that seems a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe it's written as L = -λ ψ_f† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Because that would look more like a Yukawa coupling. So the interaction term is proportional to ψ_f† X ψ_f, which suggests that the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So the fermions that X can interact with are those ψ_f. So in the Lagrangian, which fermions are present? The term is -λ f (psi_f bar) ... Wait, perhaps the fermion ψ_f is a specific one. Wait, perhaps the interaction is written as f ψ_f bar (v + X) ψ_f. Hmm, maybe the f is another field?

Wait, maybe the interaction term is written as -λ f (v + X) ψ_f† ψ_f. So f is a scalar field, and ψ_f is a fermion field. So X couples to ψ_f. So which fermions are these? Oh, perhaps f is a fermion field, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the term is written as -λ (v + X) f ψ_f† ψ_f. So X couples to the product of f and ψ_f. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the exact form isn't as important as the fact that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs that it can couple to.

But from the problem statement, the boson X can interact with fermions, so it can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that is kinematically allowed.

So, going back, the possible decay modes are all the fermion pairs where each is less than 3 GeV. Let's list the possible fermions.

Leptons: e, mu, tau. Their masses are way less than 3 GeV, so their pairs are allowed.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm. Because their masses are all less than 3 GeV. Wait, charm is about 1.2-1.5 GeV, so yeah. So up, down, strange, and charm can be decay products.

Bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3, so can't decay into b b-bar.

Top quark is too heavy as well, so no.

So the possible decay modes are:

ee, mu+mu-, tau+tau-, uu, dd, ss, cc.

So, all the options given, let's look at the choices.

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b is too heavy, so option A includes b, which is incorrect. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So this includes c, which is allowed because c is 1.5 GeV, so 3 GeV total. That's fine. So option B includes all the allowed fermions except b and t.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy, so C is wrong.

Option D includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is too heavy, so D is wrong.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but wait, I should double-check the fermion masses. Let me think again.

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV.

Muon: ~0.105 GeV.

Tau: ~1.777 GeV.

Up quark: ~2 MeV (so negligible, but under 3 GeV).

Down quark: ~3-5 MeV.

Strange quark: ~95 MeV.

Charm quark: ~1.2-1.5 GeV.

So all of these are allowed because each is less than 3 GeV.

Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV, so each is more than 3 GeV, so can't decay into b b-bar.

So the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So in the decay products, the possible pairs are these.

Looking at option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's correct.

Option B includes all except the t and b quarks.

So the answer is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a boson to decay into a pair of particles, the rest mass of each decay product must be less than half the boson's mass, i.e., less than 3 GeV. The possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs, and their masses must satisfy this condition.

### Step 1: Analyze the possible fermion-antifermion pairs
The fermions considered are leptons (electron \( e \), muon \( \mu \), tau \( \tau \)) and quarks (up \( u \), down \( d \), strange \( s \), charm \( c \), bottom \( b \), top \( t \)). The masses of these particles are as follows:
- \( e \): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \mu \): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( u \): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (negligible compared to 3 GeV)
- \( d \): \( \sim 3-5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( s \): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( c \): \( \sim 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with masses less than 3 GeV are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). Therefore, the allowed decay pairs are:
- \( e^+ e^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( c \bar{c} \).

The bottom quark (\( b \)) and top quark (\( t \)) are excluded because their masses (4.5 GeV and 173 GeV, respectively) exceed 3 GeV.

### Step 2: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because the bottom quark is too heavy. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \). All these pairs are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because the top quark is too heavy. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because the bottom quark is too heavy. **Incorrect**.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decay modes of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.

Answer: B
