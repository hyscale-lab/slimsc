Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting, because they can only observe one due to limited time. They've already detected these planets using the radial velocity (RV) method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Both planets have the same mass. But the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2 has a period P, Planet_1 has P/3. Oh wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law.

Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things because eccentricity might impact transit probability, but since both are circular, maybe that's not a factor here.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Interesting. So, despite being more massive, Planet_1's star is the same size as Planet_2's star. Wait, but how does that happen? Oh, maybe Planet_2's host is a slightly evolved star, like a subgiant or something, which can have a larger radius but perhaps its mass is lower. Wait, no, the question says that the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, and both have the same radii. So Planet_1's star is more massive but same radius, which might imply it's younger or a main-sequence star, while Planet_2's host is a bit evolved but hasn't expanded much yet, like maybe a K-type star moving towards the giant phase.

Now, the question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the relative sizes of their orbits. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / R_s), where R_p is planet radius, R_s is star radius, and a is the semi-major axis (which for circular orbits is the distance from the star). Or wait, maybe the formula for the transit probability is (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a) or something like that. Or perhaps the transit probability is given by the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but scaled by the planet's size relative to the star.

Wait, I think the transit probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (d / a), where d is the distance along the line of sight that the planet's orbit could block the star. Oh, or more accurately, the probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital radius to the distance between the observer and the star, but I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, wait. The transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The formula I remember is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (d^2)) ), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the relative sizes.

Wait, maybe the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)) ), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 times the impact parameter term. But impact parameter is about the alignment—so if the planet's orbit is perfectly edge-on, the probability is higher. But since the RV method detects planets with high enough mass and they have a certain probability of being in the edge-on orientation, but wait, RV can detect planets even if their orbits are not perfectly edge-on because it's about the Doppler shift, which depends on the velocity component along our line of sight. So, for RV, the inclination i must be such that sin i is significant, but for transits, the inclination must be very close to 90 degrees (i ≈ 90°), so that the planet passes in front of the star.

Wait, but the question says that both planets have already been detected via RV. So, the RV method tells us that their orbits have certain minimum masses, but for transiting, the RV detection doesn't require edge-on orbits. Wait, no, actually, RV can detect planets even if the orbit isn't edge-on, as long as there's a component of the velocity along our line of sight. But for a planet to transit, the orbit must be very close to edge-on (i ≈ 90°), so the probability of a transit depends on the fraction of possible orbits that are edge-on enough.

Wait, no, the probability of a transit is the fraction of orbits that are edge-on enough for the planet to pass in front of the star. For a randomly oriented orbit, the probability that the inclination is high enough for a transit is about (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (distance^2))), but that's probably not the case. Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by ( (a) / (distance) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the reciprocal of the orbital distance a. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, I think the transit probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s) / a ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: the area of the star is π R_s², and the area of the possible paths where the planet could block the star is related to the planet's orbital plane. Wait, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the circle where the planet can block the star (as seen from Earth) to the area of the sphere of possible orbital orientations.

Wait, maybe the probability is [ (R_p + R_s) / a ]², but that's not quite right. No, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think: the transit probability P is given by the formula P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 × ( (a) / (distance) ), but no, that can't be right because distance from Earth isn't mentioned here. Wait, but the question doesn't mention the distance to the stars, so perhaps distance isn't a factor here, and we can ignore it. So perhaps the transit probability is independent of distance, but depends only on the star's size and the planet's distance.

Wait, another way: the transit probability is the probability that, from our line of sight, the planet's orbit intersects the line of sight to the star. So the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (a / R_s)) )? Or perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)² × ( 1 / (a / (R_s * sqrt(3))) )) )? I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 × ( (a) / (d) ), but without knowing d, that approach might not be applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to find the formula.

The formula for the probability of a transit is approximately:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × ( (R_s) / a ) )

Wait, that would make P = (R_p² R_s ) / ( R_s² a ) ) = (R_p²) / ( R_s a )

So P = (R_p^2) / ( R_s a )

Wait, but wait, that would mean that P is inversely proportional to a, the orbital distance.

So, if a is larger, P is smaller, which makes sense. Because a larger a (farther from star) would make it less likely that the planet's path crosses our line of sight.

But in our case, what do we know about a? Well, Kepler's third law says that a^3 is proportional to (M_star * P^2), where M_star is the mass of the star, and P is the orbital period.

So, a^3 ∝ M_star * P^2.

So, a ∝ (M_star * P^2)^(1/3).

So, for each planet, a is proportional to (M_s * P^2)^(1/3).

Wait, but in the question, both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods and different host star masses.

Let me compute the a ratio between Planet_1 and Planet_2.

Given:

M_s1 = 2 * M_s2
