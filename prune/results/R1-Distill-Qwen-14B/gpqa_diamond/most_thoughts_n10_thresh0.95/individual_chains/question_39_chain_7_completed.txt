Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. So the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. 

Alright, the setup is that each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, wait, but that doesn't look right. Oh wait, maybe the wave function is written in a particular way. Let me think. The wave function usually has to satisfy certain conditions, like being normalizable, right? So that the integral of the absolute square of the wave function is 1. Or wait, maybe it's normalized already. Hmm.

But wait, the problem says that when they measured the position, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this region. Or maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, which is where the particles are found. But looking at the given wave function, (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, that seems a bit off. Because if x is less than 1, say x=0, then 1+x=1, so sqrt(1)=1, so (a/1) - 0.5i = a - 0.5i. But the wave function isn't zero there, which contradicts the measurement results. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, maybe the wave function is zero outside of x=1 to x=3. So perhaps the given expression is the part of the wave function that's non-zero only between 1 and 3. So the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, in the question, the wave function is described as "in a part of space where it can exist," so maybe that part is between x=1 and x=3. So outside of this region, the wave function is zero. So the given expression is for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3.

But then the wave function has a real part and an imaginary part. Oh wait, but wave functions can have real and imaginary parts. But for normalization, we need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over all space to be 1.

So ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, but only between x=1 and 3. So the absolute square would be the magnitude squared of this complex number. Let's compute that.

The magnitude squared is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. Because when you have a complex number a + ib, the absolute square is a² + b². So here, a is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and b is -0.5. So the square is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, no. Wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ(x)|² would be [ (a/sqrt(1+x))² ] + [ (-0.5)^2 ].

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (from 1 to 3) [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Hmm, let's compute this integral. Let's split it into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

First part: a² * ∫(1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C.

So evaluating from 1 to3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second part: 0.25 * (3 -1) = 0.25 *2=0.5.

So the whole equation is:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Solve for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2), which is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Hmm, looking at the options, B is 0.85, which is close. So that's our answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), imaginary part is -0.5. So the absolute square is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (-0.5)^2.

So that's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 is ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx.

Which is a² * ln(2) + 0.25*(3-1) = a² * ln(2) + 0.5.

Setting equal to 1:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)).

Compute 0.5 divided by ln(2): 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7213.

Square root of that is about 0.849. So a is approximately 0.849. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start with the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

where the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since \( \psi(x) \) is zero outside \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The magnitude squared of \( \psi(x) \) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1.
\]

1. **First term**:  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**:  
   The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) is:

   \[
   0.25 \times (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Subtracting \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

This value is closest to \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
