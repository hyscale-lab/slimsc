Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S has the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and figure out which statement among the options is correct.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Right, for a matrix, to find the eigenvalues, I should solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0. Let me write down the matrix A_y first.

So, c is h/(4π), and S is given as:
[0   -i]
[i    0]

So, A_y = c * S. Let me compute c*S. Let's plug in c: (h/(4π)) multiplied by each element of S.

So, A_y becomes:
[0       (-i)(h/(4π))]
[(i)(h/(4π))  0     ]

So the matrix is:
[0, -i h/(4π)]
[i h/(4π), 0]

To find the eigenvalues, I'll set up the characteristic equation. The matrix A_y minus λ I is:

[-λ      (-i h/(4π))]
[(i h/(4π))  -λ     ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] = λ^2 - [ (-i)(i) * (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the product of the off-diagonal terms. The (1,2) entry is -i h/(4π), and the (2,1) is i h/(4π). Their product is (-i)(i) * (h^2)/(16 π²). But (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the product is (h²)/(16 π²) * 1.

So the determinant is λ^2 - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0. Therefore, λ^2 = (h²)/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). 

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because I just found real eigenvalues. So option A is wrong because it suggests complex eigenvalues, but our matrix A_y is Hermitian? Let's see.

Wait, wait, is A_y Hermitian? Because S is S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me check if S is Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of S would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not the same as S. Wait no, wait, S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian. Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian and unitary. So S is Hermitian, so A_y = c S is also Hermitian because c is real. Therefore, the eigenvalues must be real. So the options saying that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts are incorrect.

So looking at the options, option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's also implying complex eigenvalues, which can't be right. So options A and B are incorrect because they suggest eigenvalues with imaginary parts.

So, the eigenvalues are real: a = ± h/(4π). So, which options are left? Let's look at options C and D.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. I think that in quantum mechanics, for angular momentum, the eigenfunctions of A_y and A² are related because A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with all components. So, since A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions can be shared. So the eigenfunctions of Ay should also be eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az? I'm not sure, maybe they don't share the same eigenfunctions. Because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something (like the commutation relations), so they don't commute. So their eigenfunctions are different. So option C's statement would be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, what does that mean? The matrix operator's basis functions would be its eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors (eigenvectors) of Ay. That seems correct. Because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So D is also a correct statement.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me think about each option.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, for option D, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That is, the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2x2 space. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, two eigenvectors (unless they are degenerate, which they aren't here) will form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the options. So, in this case, both C and D seem correct? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me re-examine each option.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Since A² and Ay commute, their eigenfunctions can be shared, so eigenfunctions of Ay would also be eigenfunctions of A². So that part is correct. But would they also be eigenfunctions of Az? Probably not, because [Ay, Az] is not zero; their commutator is iħ A something. So their eigenfunctions are different. So the statement in option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. So, the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space. Since the operator is 2x2, and we found two eigenvectors, they form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as which statement is correct. So perhaps more than one is correct? No, the options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, the given options are A, B, C, D. So, which is correct.

Wait, from the eigenvalues, options A and B are incorrect because they suggest complex eigenvalues, but we found real ones.

So, between C and D.

Hmm. Let me think again.

Option C says phi is an eigenfunction of Ay and A² but not Az. So, phi is a simultaneous eigenstate for Ay and A². Since A² is the square of the angular momentum and commutes with Ay, it's possible. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part, that they aren't eigenfunctions of Az, is also correct because Angula momentum components don't commute.

So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So, since the operator is 2x2 and we have two eigenvectors, which are orthogonal, they form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct? But looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, let me look back. The problem gives options, and I'm to choose which is correct.

Wait, perhaps option D is always correct because the eigenvectors are the basis for any 2x2 matrix. But the question is whether during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Wait, the first part of the question is about calculating the eigenvalue and eigenvectors. So, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors will form a basis for the space, so option D is correct. So during calculation, the eigenfunctions would form the basis, so D is correct.

But wait, the matrix A_y is 2x2, so any two eigenvectors (assuming non-degenerate) would form a basis. So D is correct.

So, both C and D seem correct. But looking at the options, the correct answer must be one.

Wait, wait, perhaps the statement in D is always correct for any square matrix. Because the eigenvectors (if they are linearly independent) form a basis. So D is correct. But why is option C correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In the problem, the matrix is 2x2, and the operator is A_y = c S, where S is the Pauli Y matrix. The eigenvalues are ± c, which are real. The eigenvectors would be orthogonal. So the eigenvectors are the basis functions (they form a basis), so D is correct.

But then, let's think about option C. The eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A^2. Well, A is the angular momentum operator, so A^2 is the square of the vector. The square of the angular momentum operator commutes with each component, so any eigenstate of Ay will also be an eigenstate of A^2. So, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A^2. But they won't be eigenfunctions of Az because [Ay, Az] is non-zero, so their eigenstates are different.

So, in option C, the first part is correct, the second part is correct. So option C is correct.

Wait, but the first part of option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az, which is correct because Az doesn't commute with Ay.

So, option C is correct.

But what about option D? D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, eigenvectors (as a basis) are correct. So D is correct.

Wait, but which option is correct during the calculation?

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, during the calculation, you would find that the eigenfunctions form a basis (D) and that they are eigenfunctions of A² (C).

But the options are given as four separate options, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, now I'm a bit stuck. Let me look at the statements again.

Option C says eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. This is correct because A² and Ay commute, but Az doesn't.

Option D says eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space.

In that case, both statements C and D are correct. But that can't be the case since only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the options. Let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, the matrix operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are a basis for the 2x2 space. So D is correct.

But during calculation, when you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you would find that D is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is both C and D are correct. But the options don't allow that, so perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought C is correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because it's a fundamental property of Hermitian operators in 2D,
