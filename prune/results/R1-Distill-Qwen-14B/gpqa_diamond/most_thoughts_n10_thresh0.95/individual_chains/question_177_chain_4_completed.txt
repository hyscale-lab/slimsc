Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

So, the given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! Which says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Then, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. But in this case, when they're determining the peak wavelengths, have they accounted for the Doppler effect? Hmm, because if Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, that would shift the observed wavelength. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps they've corrected for their radial velocities when measuring the wavelengths. Or maybe not. Wait, the problem states that the "wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. But if the stars are moving, the observed wavelength would be different. Oh wait, but maybe the question is considering the rest frame wavelengths. Because if Star_2 is moving, its emission would be Doppler shifted. But if the observed wavelengths are the same, that might imply that their rest frame wavelengths are the same, so their temperatures are same as we thought.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The peak wavelength (lambda_max) depends on the star's temperature. But if a star is moving towards us, the observed lambda_max would be shorter (blue shifted), and moving away would make it longer (red shifted). So if both stars have the same observed lambda_max, that would mean that their actual temperatures (in their rest frames) might be different. Because the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength.

Hmm, this adds another layer. So maybe I should consider the Doppler effect. Let me think. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), assuming v_r is much smaller than the speed of light, which it is here (700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light, so non-relativistic approximation might be okay). Or wait, the exact Doppler shift formula for recession velocity is (lambda_obs - lambda_rest) / lambda_rest = v_r / c. But wait, for a source moving away, the wavelength increases, so lambda_obs > lambda_rest. For a source moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter. 

So in this problem, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so lambda_max1 is its rest frame lambda. Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s. Let's assume that Star_2 is moving away, so its observed lambda would be longer. But the problem says that the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. So, we have:

lambda_obs,1 = lambda_rest1 (since v_r1=0)
lambda_obs,2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c) [approximate formula for small v_r]

Since both observed lambdas are same (lambda_obs,1 = lambda_obs,2), then:

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But wait, because Star_2 is moving away, its observed lambda is longer. So if lambda_obs,2 = lambda_obs,1, which is lambda_rest1, then lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, but earlier I thought that the peak wavelengths are the same, so their temperatures are same. But now, with the Doppler effect, that might not be the case.

Wait, let me restate: the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2. So Star_1's rest frame lambda is lambda_obs1, and Star_2's rest frame lambda is lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs2 * (1 - v_r2/c ), if v_r2 is positive when moving away.

Wait, let me think about the Doppler effect formula again. The standard formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z)

where z is the redshift, which is positive for moving away. And z is approximately v_r/c when v_r is small compared to c.

So for Star_2, which has v_r = 700 km/s. Let's compute z.

v_r for Star_2 is 700 km/s. The speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So z ≈ 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333...

So the observed wavelength for Star_2 is lambda_rest2 * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ lambda_rest2 * 1.002333.

Since lambda_obs,1 = lambda_obs,2, and Star_1's lambda_rest is lambda_obs1, because it's not moving.

So:

lambda_rest1 = lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * 1.002333

Thus, lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 / 1.002333 ≈ lambda_rest1 * (1 - 0.002333 + ...) using 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

So lambda_rest2 ≈ 0.997667 * lambda_rest1.

But lambda_rest is inversely proportional to temperature, as per Wien's law: lambda_max = b / T. So:

lambda_rest1 / lambda_rest2 = T2 / T1.

So from lambda_rest2 ≈ 0.997667 * lambda_rest1, we have:

lambda_rest1 / lambda_rest2 ≈ 1 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.00234.

So T2 / T1 = 1.00234 → T2 ≈ 1.00234 * T1.

Wait, but that's a very small difference. Hmm, but considering that Star_2 is moving away, its observed lambda is longer, so to have the same observed lambda as Star_1, its rest frame lambda must be shorter. Which implies higher temperature.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the exact temperatures.

Let me write the relations:

From Star_1:

lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1 (since v_r1=0)

From Star_2:

lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But since lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But from Wien's law:

lambda_rest = b / T → T = b / lambda_rest.

So,

T1 = b / lambda_rest1,

T2 = b / lambda_rest2.

Substituting lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

We get:

T1 = b / [ lambda_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c) ) ]

T2 = b / lambda_rest2.

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

→ T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + 700/3e5 ), which is approximately 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

So T2 ≈ 1.002333 * T1.

So T2 is slightly hotter than T1.

Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

Wait, but the problem says the stars radiate as black bodies. So that should be the case.

So for each star, L is proportional to R² T^4.

So the luminosity ratio L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / (R2² T2^4 )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2,

So R1/R2 = 1.5 → R1²/R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

So:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

But we have T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c ) → T2 = T1 * (1 + 700/(3e5) )

Which is T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997667.

So, T1^4 / T2^4 = (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.997667)^4.

Calculating 0.997667^4:

Let me compute this step by step.

0.997667 is about 0.997667.

So, first square it:

(0.997667)^2 ≈ (approx) 0.997667 * 0.997667.

Let me compute 0.997667 * 0.997667.

0.997667 * 0.997667 ≈ (1 - 0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004666 + 0.0000054 ≈ approximately 0.9953394.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately:

Compute 0.997667 * 0.997667.

Let me compute 1000000 * 0.997667 = 997667.

But I'm not sure, perhaps better to compute as follows:

(0.997667)^2 = (1 - 0.002333)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2.

= 1 - 0.004666 + 0.0000054.

= 0.9953394.

Then, square that result to get to the fourth power.

So (0.997667)^4 = (0.997667^2)^2 ≈ (0.9953394)^2.

Compute 0.9953394^2.

Again, 0.9953394 is approximately 0.99534.

So, 0.99534^2 = (1 - 0.00466)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00466 + (0.00466)^2.

= 1 - 0.00932 + 0.0000217.

= approx 0.99068 + 0.0000217 = 0.9907017.

Wait, wait, perhaps more accurately:

Let me compute 0.99534 * 0.99534.

Multiply 99534 * 99534, then adjust the decimal.

But perhaps a better way is to compute (a - b)^2.

a=1, b=0.00466.

So, (1 - 0.00466)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00466 + (0.00466)^2.

= 1 - 0.00932 + 0.0000217.

= 0.99068 + 0.0000217 = 0.9907017.

So, (0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So, T1^4 / T2^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So, putting it all together:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.9907) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ let's compute that.

2.25 * 0.9907 → 2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275, and 2.25 *0.0007 is 0.001575. So total ≈ 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075. Approximately 2.229.

Wait, but wait—since we're doing the ratio L1/L2, and according to the problem statement, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. Our calculation gives L1/L2 ≈ 2.229. So the factor is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because I approximated the T ratio. Let me see:

v_r2 = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s → 300,000 km/s.

So, v_r2/c = 700/300000 = 0.002333...

So,

(1 + v_r2/c ) = 1.002333.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (1/1.002333 )^4.

What's 1/1.002333? Let me compute it accurately.

1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997675.

So,

0.997675^4.

Compute 0.997675^2 first:

0.997675 * 0.997675.

Let me compute 0.997675 * 0.997675:

It's about (1 - 0.002325)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002325 + (0.002325)^2.

=1 - 0.00465 + 0.0000054.

= 0.99535 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.9953554.

Then, squaring that number:

0.9953554^2.

Compute (0.9953554)^2.

Again, (1 - 0.00464456)^2, but perhaps more accurately:

0.9953554 * 0.9953554.

Wait, perhaps use binomial approximation.

(1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x + x², where x=0.00464456.

So,

1 - 2*(0.00464456) + (0.00464456)^2.

=1 -0.00928912 + 0.00002158.

= 0.99071088 + 0.00002158.

= 0.99073246.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.990732.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.990732) = 2.25 * 0.990732.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.000732 is approximately 0.001644.

So total is 2.2275 + 0.001644 ≈ 2.22914.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

So the correct option is D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the given data:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
   - Mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \).
   - The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same: \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \).
   - Radial velocities: \( v_{r,1} = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), \( v_{r,2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).
   - Stars radiate as blackbodies, so their luminosities follow the Stefan-Boltzmann law: \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \).

2. **Wien's Law and Doppler Effect**:
   - Wien's law states \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) is inversely proportional to temperature \( T \).
   - The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect: \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} (1 + z) \), where \( z = \frac{v_r}{c} \) for non-relativistic velocities.
   - Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), the rest-frame wavelengths are related by:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} (1 + z_2), \quad z_2 = \frac{v_{r,2}}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333.
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}}{1 + z_2} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} (1 - 0.002333).
     \]

3. **Temperature Ratio**:
   - From Wien's law, \( \frac{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest,2}}} = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \). Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} (1 - 0.002333) \), we find:
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + z_2 \approx 1.002333 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_2 \approx 1.002333 T_1.
     \]

4. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - Luminosity is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \): \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} \).
   - Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = 1.002333 T_1 \):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2}{(1.002333)^4}.
     \]
   - Compute \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \) and \( (1.002333)^4 \approx 1.00933 \) (using binomial expansion or calculator).
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx \frac{2.25}{1.00933} \approx 2.23.
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately \( 2.23 \).
