Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are the production energy EX = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula should be something like distance = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, and β is the velocity over the speed of light.

But how do I find τ? Oh, the mean lifetime is related to the decay width Γ. I think the relation is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I need to make sure about the units here.

Let me jot down the variables:
E_X = 8 GeV (production energy)
m_X = 1.2 GeV (rest mass)
Γ_X = 320 MeV (width)
c = speed of light (approx 3e8 m/s)
ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/(2π), about 6.582e-25 GeV·s)
Wait, but I should check the units. Since Γ is in MeV, and ħ is in GeV·s, so I need to convert them to the same units.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV. So Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Let me compute that. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s.

Calculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s. Which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

But wait, I might have messed up the exponents. Let me compute 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is the same as 2.056875e-24 s. Yeah that looks right.

Next, I need to find the velocity β. Hmm, since the particle is produced with energy EX = 8 GeV, which is higher than its rest mass, so it's moving relativistically.

The energy E is related to mass and momentum by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So I can find the momentum p.

Let me write that equation:

E_X^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2

We can rearrange to solve for p:

p = sqrt( (E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2) ) / (c^2) ) * c ?

Wait, let me think again. The equation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So solving for pc, we get pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2). Therefore, p = sqrt(E² - m^2 c^4) / c² * c? Hmm, maybe I should write it differently.

Wait, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so perhaps it's easier to work in units where c=1. But let me proceed step by step.

Wait, another approach: since E and m are given, I can compute the Lorentz factor gamma.

E = gamma m c².

So gamma = E / (m c²). But wait, in natural units where c=1, it's simply E = gamma m. So if E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, then gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), we can solve for beta.

gamma² = 1/(1 - beta²) => 1 - beta² = 1/gamma² => beta² = 1 - 1/gamma².

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

Let me compute gamma first: gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666..., so gamma squared is (6.6667)^2 ≈ 44.4444.

1/gamma² is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Taking the square root of 0.9775: let's see. sqrt(0.96) is 0.98, sqrt(0.9801)=0.99, so 0.9775 is between that. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.9775 is approximately 31/32, but maybe I can compute it numerically. Let me calculate sqrt(0.9775). 

Well, 0.9775 ≈ 0.9875 (wait, no, wait). Wait, 0.9775 is 0.9775. Let me compute it:

Approximate sqrt(0.9775):

Let me think, 0.988^2 = 0.976144, 0.989^2= 0.978121. Oh, so 0.989^2 is 0.978121, which is larger than 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887 or something.

Wait, let me compute it precisely.

Let me compute 0.988^2: (0.988)^2 = (988/1000)^2 = (988^2)/(1e6) = 976,144 /1e6 = 0.976144.

0.9885^2: (0.9885)^2 = Let's compute 9885^2. 9885 *9885. Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute (988 +0.005)^2, but perhaps I'll approximate.

Alternatively, 0.988^2 is 0.976144, 0.989^2 is 0.978121.

Our target is 0.9775. So the difference is 0.9775 - 0.976144 = 0.001356. The total range between 0.988^2 and 0.989^2 is 0.978121 - 0.976144 = 0.001977.

So 0.001356 is about 0.685 of the way (0.001356 / 0.001977 ≈ 0.685). So 0.988 + 0.685*(0.001) = 0.988685. So approximately 0.98869.

So beta ≈ 0.9887.

So beta is about 0.9887. That's a high velocity, which makes sense for a high-energy particle.

Now, the mean decay distance is c * tau * beta.

Wait, but wait, tau is the lifetime, which I calculated as about 2.056875e-24 seconds. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me double-check.

Tau = ħ / Γ.

Given ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 divided by 0.32: 0.32 * 20 = 6.4. 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182, so 20 + (0.182/0.32). 0.182 /0.32 ≈ 0.56875. So 20.56875.

So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So now, the distance is c * tau * beta.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So let's compute each part:

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

beta ≈ 0.9887.

Multiplying them all together:

distance = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9887.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875e-16 = 6.170625e-16.

Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.170625 *0.9887 *1e-16.

6.170625 * 0.9887 ≈ Let me compute that.

6 * 0.9887 is 5.9322.

0.170625 * 0.9887 ≈ approximately 0.1688.

So adding together, 5.9322 + 0.1688 ≈ 6.101.

Wait, that's an approximate calculation, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 6.170625 × 0.9887.

Let me think:

6.170625 × 0.9887 = 6.170625 × (1 - 0.0113) = 6.170625 - (6.170625 × 0.0113).

Compute 6.170625 × 0.0113:

6 * 0.0113 = 0.0678.

0.170625 × 0.0113 ≈ 0.00193.

So total is 0.0678 + 0.00193 = 0.06973.

So 6.170625 - 0.06973 ≈ 6.10089.

So approximately 6.10089e-16 meters.

Wait, but let me compute that again.

Wait, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 * 1e8 *1e-24 = 6.170625 * 1e-16.

Which is 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta (0.9887):

6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 = approx 6.170625 *0.9887 = 6.1008e-16 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m, D is 4.0655e-16. Hmm, but my calculation gives around 6e-16, which isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second, maybe I messed up with the calculation of beta. Let me recheck that.

Gamma is E / (m c^2). But when E is given as 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, assuming natural units where c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Gamma = 6.6667.

So gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444.

Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2))
