Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when it comes to the excitation of atoms in stars, the Boltzmann equation is probably involved. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. So the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where g's are the statistical weights and ΔE is the energy difference.

Wait, but in this case, the problem mentions the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So the energy levels are separated by that amount. Let me denote the excited state as level 2 and the lower as level 1. So the ratio N2/N1 would be (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

But wait, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So in star 1, the ratio N1_2/N1_1 is 2, and in star 2, it's 1? Because if they're twice as excited, perhaps the ratio is higher. Or wait, no, maybe the ratio is 2 in star_1 and 1 in star_2? Or maybe the other way around? Let me read again. "Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So maybe N1_2/N1_1 = 2, while N2_2/N2_1 = 1, assuming that the ground state is level 1.

So, for each star, we can write an equation. Let me denote T1 and T2 as the effective temperatures of the two stars. The ratio for star 1: (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2, and for star 2: (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = 1.

Wait, but the problem states that the energy difference is the same for both stars, as it is a specific energy level. So ΔE is the same. Now, the ratio of the two equations would eliminate g2/g1. So dividing equation for star 1 by that of star 2: [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = 2/1.

Simplifying the left side: exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2.

Which is the same as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but wait, let me get the signs right. The exponent is [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] = ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ].

So, exp(ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]) = 2. Take ln: ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

But I can rearrange this equation. Let's write it as (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE.

Wait, but let me think about the terms. Let me write:

ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Rearranged:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I can express this in terms of T1 and T2. Let me factor the equation.

Alternatively, let's think about 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (ln(2))*k / ΔE.

But perhaps we can relate this to the temperatures. Let me see. Let's denote (1/T2 - 1/T1) as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting that into the equation:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) * ΔE/(k) = ln(2)

Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. The equation was:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ] = ln(2)

But 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but let me rearrange this equation to solve for the temperatures.

Wait, but in the options, the equation is set to ln(2) equal to a combination of T1 and T2. So maybe we can write the equation as ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] multiplied by something else.

Wait, let's see. Let's rearrange the equation:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But that doesn't match any options directly. Alternatively, perhaps I should write it as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see what each option presents.

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, that would be the case if the equation were ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). But according to our earlier rearrangement, (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) is equal to [ ln(2) k ] / ΔE.

But wait, the question doesn't give any values for k or ΔE. The problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, but the options are presented as equations in T1 and T2. So perhaps the correct equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) k ] / ΔE.

But wait, the options don't include any factors of k or ΔE. So perhaps the question is expecting us to consider that the ratio is related to the temperatures in a certain way. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me re-examine the steps.

We have for star_1:

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2.

For star_2:

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = 1.

So taking the ratio of N1 over N2 (or wait, the ratio of the two equations is (N1/N2)_star1 / (N1/N2)_star2.

Wait no, perhaps I should take the ratio of the two equations:

(N2_1/N1_1) / (N2_2/N1_2) ) = [ (g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) ] / [ (g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ) ]

Simplify: [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = (2) / (1) = 2.

So the exponent becomes exp( [ (-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) ] ). Wait, no, division of exponents is subtraction of exponents. So, exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2.

Which can be written as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking ln on both sides: ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Then, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE.

Let me compute the right-hand side. Wait, but k is the Boltzmann constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait a second! The ΔE given is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K multiplied by 1 K gives 1.38e-23 J). Wait, no, wait. Let me compute:

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So, if ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, that's equal to k * 1 K. So ΔE = k*T, where T is 1 K? Because ΔE = k * T.

Wait, but that's an interesting point. So, ΔE = k * T_0, where T_0 is 1 K. So, substituting, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE = (ln(2) * k ) / (k * T0 ) ) = ln(2) / T0.

But T0 is 1 K, so it's ln(2) * (1 K)^-1.

Wait, but that would give (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2). Because T0 is 1 K, so 1/T0 is 1 K^-1.

Wait, but that can't be right because then (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2). Which suggests that (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2). Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So that would imply that (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but ln(2) is about 0.693. So (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = 0.693.

But looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So the equation would be ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Wait, but earlier substitution leads us to (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * k / ΔE. And since ΔE = k * 1 K, then:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) * k ) / (k * 1) ) = ln(2).

So, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Which can be written as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2). So yes, the equation becomes ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.

Wait, but what if I messed up the sign? Because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2), which is positive. So, that would imply that 1/T2 is greater than 1/T1, which implies that T2 is less than T1. Because if T2 is smaller, its reciprocal is larger. So, T1 is hotter than T2.

But the original observation is that star_1 has more excited atoms. So higher excitation suggests higher temperature. Which aligns with T1 being larger than T2.

So the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation is central to this analysis, as it describes the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels under LTE conditions. The ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (N₂) to the ground state (N₁) is given by:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1, the excitation ratio is twice that of star_2, i.e., \(\frac{N_{2,1}}{N_{1,1}} = 2\) and \(\frac{N_{2,2}}{N_{1,2}} = 1\). Dividing the equations for the two stars eliminates \(g_2/g_1\), leading to:

\[
\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)} = \frac{2}{1}.
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side using properties of exponents gives:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The problem specifies that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which is equal to \(k \cdot 1 \, \text{K}\) (since \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)). Substituting \(\Delta E = k\) simplifies the equation to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
