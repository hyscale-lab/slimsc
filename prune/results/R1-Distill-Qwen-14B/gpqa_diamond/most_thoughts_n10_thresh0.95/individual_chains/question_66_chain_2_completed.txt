Alright, let me try to work through this question. So, the question is about the symmetries that operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) must respect. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, first, I remember that the SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it incorporates the Standard Model but allows for higher-dimensional operators that parameterize beyond the SM physics in a systematic way. The SMEFT is constructed in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model, but I'm not entirely sure which symmetries exactly.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, so all its extensions, including SMEFT, should respect Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected. That makes sense because the operators are constructed as Lorentz-invariant.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. I think that in the SMEFT, the theory is formulated in a way that respects Poincare symmetry. Because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it should have the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model is Poincare invariant, so SMEFT must also respect it. So both Lorentz and Poincare (options 1 and 2) are respected. So that's points 1 and 2.

Now, CP symmetry. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The Standard Model doesn't have a global CP symmetry, but some of its parts do. Wait, but the SMEFT operators are constructed to respect the same symmetries as the SM. Wait, no—wait, the SM includes CP violation, as in the CKM matrix. So the SM doesn't respect CP symmetry as a whole. Therefore, SMEFT doesn't have to respect CP symmetry either because you can have operators that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT might not respect CP symmetry, right? So option 3, CP symmetry, is not a must. So it's not something that all operators have to respect. So maybe SMEFT operators don't have to obey CP symmetry.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories that are Lorentz invariant must respect CPT symmetry. Because in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the CPT theorem holds. So any operator in the SMEFT, respecting Lorentz symmetry, would automatically respect CPT symmetry. So option 4, CPT symmetry, must be respected by all operators.

So putting it all together: the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1,2,4. Let's look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2 → misses CPT.
Option B: 3,4 → no, since 1 and 2 are correct.
Option C: 1,2,4 → this would be correct if yes. But wait, wait. Hold on—does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. I think that SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but I'm not sure if it's necessarily Poincare-invariant. Wait, SMEFT is formulated in a way that the operators are local and Lorentz-invariant, so they must also respect translation symmetry because they're part of a local field theory. So I think that yes, Poincare symmetry is respected.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether Poincare symmetry is a separate condition or automatically included when you have a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because Poincare is Lorentz plus translations. So if the operators are Lorentz-invariant, and the theory is formulated in a translation-invariant way, then yes, Poincare is respected.

So options 1,2, and 4 are correct. So the answer should include 1,2,4.

Looking again at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that CP symmetry isn't necessarily respected because the SM doesn't have it. So the SMEFT operators can violate CP. Therefore, operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP, so option 3 is not a must. So the symmetries that must be respected are 1,2,4.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that systematically incorporates higher-dimensional operators to describe physics beyond the SM. These operators are constructed to respect the same symmetries as the SM, with some modifications to account for the effective nature of the theory. Let us analyze the symmetries in question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SMEFT is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it builds on the SM, which respects Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a local field theory, it inherently respects translation symmetry. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is also respected by all operators in SMEFT.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to CP violation, as seen in phenomena like the CKM matrix. Since SMEFT is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the SM, it does not necessarily respect CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In quantum field theory, any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect the CPT theorem. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it automatically respects CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement.

**Option Analysis**:
- **A) 1, 2**: This option excludes CPT symmetry, which is required.
- **B) 3, 4**: This option excludes Lorentz and Poincaré symmetry, which are required.
- **C) 1, 2, 4**: This option correctly includes Lorentz, Poincaré, and CPT symmetry.
- **D) 1, 3, 4**: This option incorrectly includes CP symmetry, which is not required.

The correct answer is **C**, as it includes all the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Answer: C
