--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be tricky. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. We're given the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

The options are four possible normalized eigenvectors, and I need to pick the correct one. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the setup. The operator P is a vector operator, so it's like the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vectors. But wait, the direction is arbitrary along the x-z plane. Oh, so the direction n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, which would have components (nx, 0, nz), with nx² + nz² = 1.

The operator P is given by P = P_x * x + P_y * y + P_z * z. But in this case, since the direction is n = (nx, 0, nz), the operator we're interested in is P·n, which is Px * nx + Pz * nz. Because the direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero, so Py doesn't contribute.

So we're looking for the eigenvector of the operator (P_x * nx + P_z * nz) corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Let me write down the matrices for each component:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P·n is (ħ/2)(nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Let me compute this matrix. Let's denote the matrix as M.

M = (ħ/2) [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Because when you multiply out, the (1,1) element is nz * 1, (1,2) is nx * 1, (2,1) is nx *1, and (2,2) is -nz.

Wait, no. Wait, the first term is nx times the Px matrix. The Px matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying by nx gives [[0, nx], [nx, 0]]. The second term is nz times the Pz matrix, which is [[nz, 0], [0, -nz]]. So adding them together, the matrix becomes:

[ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

And then multiplied by ħ/2, so M = (ħ/2) * this matrix.

We need to find the eigenvector of M with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's denote the eigenvalue as λ = +ħ/2.

The general approach is to solve (M - λ I) v = 0, where v is the eigenvector. Let's set up the matrix equation.

M is (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

So M - λ I is (ħ/2)[ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] - λ I.

But since λ is ħ/2, let's substitute that:

M - λ I = (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] - (ħ/2) I

Which can be written as (ħ/2) [ [nz - 1, nx], [nx, -nz - 1] ]

Wait, because I is the identity matrix, so subtracting (ħ/2)*I comes from (ħ/2)*I.

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ (nz -1)   nx         ]
          [ nx        (-nz -1) ]

But when solving (M - λ I)v = 0, the eigenvector v = [a; b] must satisfy this equation. Let me write it out.

In matrix form:

(ħ/2)(nz - 1) a + (ħ/2) nx b = 0
(ħ/2) nx a + (ħ/2)( -nz -1 ) b = 0

We can factor out ħ/2 from each equation, so we can ignore it since it's non-zero.

So the equations become:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0
nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

Let me write the first equation as:

(nz - 1) a = - nx b => a = (-nx / (nz -1)) b

Let me substitute a into the second equation.

nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0
nx * [ (-nx / (nz -1) ) b ]  + (-nz -1) b =0

Factor out b:

[ (-nx^2)/(nz -1) ) + (-nz -1) ] b =0

Since b can't be zero (trivial solution), the coefficient must be zero.

So,

(-nx^2)/(nz -1) + (-nz -1) =0

Multiply both sides by (nz -1):

-nx^2 + (-nz -1)(nz -1) = 0

Wait, let's expand (-nz -1)(nz -1):

= (-nz)(nz) + (-nz)(-1) + (-1)(nz) + (-1)(-1)
= -n_z^2 + nz -nz +1
Simplify: -n_z^2 + 0 +1 = (1 - n_z^2 )

So,

-nx^2 + (1 - n_z^2 ) =0

But since n is a unit vector in x-z direction, nx^2 + nz^2 =1. So 1 - n_z^2 = nx^2. Let me substitute:

-nx^2 + (nx^2) =0 → 0=0.

Wait, that's an identity. So this condition holds, which means that the two equations are not independent, and we have a one-dimensional solution space. So the eigenvector can be expressed in terms of one variable.

From the first equation: a = (-nx/(nz -1)) b

Let me express the ratio of a to b:

a/b = (-nx)/(nz -1 )

Alternatively, a = [ -nx/( (nz -1) ) ] b

But wait, perhaps it's easier to express in terms of trigonometric functions. Since n is in x-z plane, let me parameterize n.

Let me let n = (cosθ, 0, sinθ). Because any direction in x-z plane can be represented with an angle θ from the x-axis. So, nx = cosθ, nz = sinθ.

So, substituting into a/b:

a/b = [ -cosθ ] / ( sinθ -1 )

Hmm. Let me see if I can simplify this.

Wait, sinθ -1 can be rewritten as - (1 - sinθ )

So,

a/b = [ -cosθ ] / ( - (1 - sinθ) ) = cosθ/(1 - sinθ)

So, a = [ cosθ/(1 - sinθ) ] b

Hmm, perhaps I can rationalize this expression. Multiply numerator and denominator by (1+sinθ):

a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ] / [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) ] * b

Denominator becomes 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ.

So,

a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) / cos²θ ] * b

= [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ ] * b

Which is ( (1 + sinθ)/cosθ ) * b

So, a = [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ ] b

Now, the eigenvector is [a; b] = [ ( (1 + sinθ)/cosθ ) b ; b ]

We can factor out b, and write the eigenvector as proportional to [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ ; 1 ]

But we can also write this as [ (1 + sinθ) ; cosθ ] because we can factor out 1/cosθ (but that's scaling, so for eigenvectors, scaling doesn't matter, except for normalization).

Wait, wait. Let me think. Let me set b=1 (since eigenvectors are only defined up to a scalar), then the vector is [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ , 1 ]^T.

But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it. Let's compute the norm squared.

The components are a = (1+sinθ)/cosθ and b=1.

So, |a|^2 + |b|^2 = [ (1 + sinθ)^2 / cos²θ ] + 1

= [ (1 + 2 sinθ + sin²θ ) + cos²θ ] / cos²θ

Since cos²θ + sin²θ =1, the numerator becomes 1 + 2 sinθ + 1 = 2(1 + sinθ)

So, norm squared is 2(1 + sinθ) / cos²θ.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recompute.

Wait, [ (1 + sinθ)^2 ] / cos²θ + 1 

= [ (1 + 2 sinθ + sin²θ) + cos²θ ] / cos²θ

Because 1 can be written as cos²θ / cos²θ.

So numerator:

1 + 2 sinθ + sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 + 2 sinθ + (sin²θ + cos²θ) = 1 + 2 sinθ +1 = 2 (1 + sinθ )

So, norm squared is [2 (1 + sinθ)] / cos²θ.

Hmm. Let me see if I can simplify (1 + sinθ) in terms of half-angle formulas.

We know that 1 + sinθ = 2 sin²(θ/2 + π/4 )? Or another identity. Wait, perhaps using the identity:

1 + sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2 + π/4)^2 ?

Wait, I think a better approach is to express everything in terms of tan(θ/2). Let me try that.

Let t = tan(θ/2). Then,

sinθ = 2t/(1 + t²)
cosθ = (1 - t²)/(1 + t²)

But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can write (1 + sinθ) as 2 cos²(θ/2 - π/4 ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: 1 + sinθ = sin(θ/2 + π/4 )^2 * something.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio a/b again.

Wait, let me think about the eigenvector. The ratio a/b is (1 + sinθ)/cosθ.

So the vector can be written as [ (1 + sinθ), cosθ ]^T, scaled by a factor. Wait, because if a = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * b, and let’s say b = cosθ, then a = (1 + sinθ). So the vector is [1 + sinθ, cosθ ]^T. But let's check if this works.

Wait, if I set b = cosθ, then a = (1 + sinθ). So the vector is [1 + sinθ, cosθ ].

What's the norm squared? (1 + sinθ)^2 + cos²θ = 1 + 2 sinθ + sin²θ + cos²θ = 2(1 + sinθ).

So the norm is sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)).

So the normalized eigenvector would be [ (1 + sinθ)/sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)), cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) ) ]

Which simplifies to [ sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ), sqrt( cos²θ/(2(1 + sinθ)) ) ]

Wait, wait. Let me compute the second term.

cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) = [cosθ ] / [ sqrt(2) sqrt(1 + sinθ) ) ]

We can write this as [ cosθ / sqrt(1 + sinθ) ] / sqrt(2 )

Hmm, perhaps we can express cosθ as sqrt(1 - sin²θ) = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) )

So,

cosθ = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) )

So,

cosθ / sqrt(1 + sinθ) ) = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) / sqrt(1 + sinθ) ) = sqrt(1 - sinθ )

So the second term becomes sqrt(1 - sinθ)/ sqrt(2 )

Similarly, the first term is sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 )

Wait, so the normalized eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) ]

Wait, that's interesting. Because the first component is sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ), and the second is sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

Wait, but wait, if I square both terms, I get (1 + sinθ)/2 + (1 - sinθ)/2 = 1, which works.

But what is this in terms of theta over 2? Let's think about trigonometric identities.

I remember that cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cos theta)/2 ), and sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cos theta)/2 )

Wait, but here I have sin theta. So perhaps using a substitution.

Wait, let me think. Let's set phi = theta/2. Then theta = 2 phi.

So, (1 + sin(2 phi )) / 2 = [1 + 2 sin phi cos phi ] /2 

= (1/2) + sin phi cos phi.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps using the identity:

sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

(1 + sin theta)/2 = [1 + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / 2 

= (1/2) + sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution:

(1 + sin theta) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2.

Wait, let me check:

[sin(a) + cos(a)]^2 = sin^2 a + 2 sin a cos a + cos^2 a = 1 + sin 2a.

So, if a = theta/2, then [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]^2 = 1 + sin theta.

So, (1 + sin theta) = [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]^2.

Similarly, (1 - sin theta) = [sin(theta/2) - cos(theta/2)]^2.

So,

sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 )

= [1/sqrt(2) ] [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]

Similarly,

sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) = [ sin(theta/2) - cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 )

But wait, the signs would depend on the quadrant of theta/2. But for normalized eigenvectors, we can take the positive roots, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express in terms of exponential form. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me think again about the eigenvector components.

The normalized eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ]^T.

But perhaps this can be written in terms of trigonometric functions of theta/2.

Wait,

(1 + sin theta)/2 = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2 / 2 * 2? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, using the identity:

sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So, 1 + sin theta = 1 + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) = [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]^2.

Similarly, 1 - sin theta = [sin(theta/2) - cos(theta/2)]^2.

So,

sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 )

Similarly,

sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) = [ sin(theta/2) - cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 )

Wait, but this expression involves sin(theta/2) and cos(theta/2), which are factors of 1/sqrt(2)) added or subtracted.

But perhaps we can factor this as e^{i something}.

Wait, let me think about writing this as a combination of exponentials.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as (e^{i theta/2} + e^{-i theta/2} ) / (2i) but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps we can write it as (e^{i theta/2} ) / sqrt(2) or something similar.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the eigenvector.

The eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ].

But another way to look at this is to write these terms in terms of sines and cosines of theta/2.

Wait, let me think. Let me set theta/2 = φ. Then theta = 2φ.

So,

(1 + sin 2φ ) = (1 + 2 sinφ cosφ ) = (sinφ + cosφ )^2

Similarly, 1 - sin 2φ = (sinφ - cosφ )^2.

So,

sqrt( (1 + sin 2φ ) / 2 ) = (sinφ + cosφ ) / sqrt(2 )

= [ sqrt(2) ( (sinφ + cosφ ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as [sinφ + cosφ ] / sqrt(2 ) = sqrt( (sin^2 phi + cos^2 phi + 2 sin phi cos phi ) / 2 )

But that's just (1 + sin 2 phi)/(2 ) ) * sqrt(2 ), which brings us back.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

sinφ + cosφ = sqrt(2) sin( phi + 45 degrees )

Because,

sin( phi + 45° ) = sin phi cos 45 + cos phi sin 45 = (sin phi + cos phi ) / sqrt(2 )

So, sin phi + cos phi = sqrt(2) sin( phi + 45 )

So,

[ sin phi + cos phi ] / sqrt(2 ) = sin( phi + 45 )

Similarly,

[ sin phi - cos phi ] / sqrt(2 ) = sin( phi -45 )

So,

sqrt( (1 + sin 2 phi ) / 2 ) = sin( phi +45 )

sqrt( (1 - sin 2 phi ) /2 ) = sin( phi -45 )

But wait, phi is theta/2, so theta is 2 phi. So,

sin( phi +45 ) = sin( theta/2 + 45 )

But 45 degrees is pi/4 radians. So,

sin(theta/2 + pi/4 )

Similarly,

sin(theta/2 - pi/4 )

But wait, I'm not sure if that helps, but perhaps it's another way to write the components.

Wait, but the problem is about the direction vector n being in the x-z plane. So, any direction can be represented as theta from the x-axis. The eigenvectors for spin in that direction would involve theta and phi. But in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi (the azimuthal angle) is zero, I think. Wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle, but in this problem, theta is the angle in the x-z plane. So perhaps the conventions are a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, in our case, the first component is sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) / 2 ), which is equal to cos(theta/2) when theta is between 0 and pi.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think. Is sqrt( (1 + sin theta ) / 2 ) equal to cos(theta/2 )?

Wait, cos(theta/2 ) is sqrt( (1 + cos theta ) / 2 )

Hmm, but (1 + sin theta ) isn't the same as (1 + cos theta ). So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me check the normalized eigenvector again.

Earlier, I thought the normalized eigenvector was [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta )/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta )/2 ) ]

Wait, but if I square these terms:

(1 + sin theta)/2 + (1 - sin theta)/2 = 1, which is correct.

But is there a way to write this in terms of cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2)?

Wait, another approach. Let me use the substitution sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So,

1 + sin theta = 1 + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 ) = (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) )^2.

Similarly,

1 - sin theta = (sin(theta/2) - cos(theta/2) )^2.

So,

sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) = ( sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ) / sqrt(2 )

Similarly,

sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) = ( sin(theta/2) - cos(theta/2) ) / sqrt(2 )

Wait, but this could be written as [ e^{i theta/2} ] / sqrt(2) and [ e^{-i theta/2} ] / sqrt(2 ), but that only works if we have complex components. But in our case, the eigenvector components are real, because the problem states that the operator is along x-z, which is a real direction, and the eigenstates should be real.

Wait, but the eigenvectors for spin in a real direction are generally real, except perhaps for some phase factors.

Wait, but in our case, the eigenvector components are real, so perhaps the correct way to express them is in terms of cos and sin of theta/2.

Wait, but wait, let me compute:

[ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 ) = sqrt( (sin^2(theta/2) + cos^2(theta/2) + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ) / sqrt(2 )

= sqrt( 1 + sin theta ) / sqrt(2 )

Which is the same as sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), which matches earlier steps.

But I'm not seeing the connection to cos(theta/2), which is sqrt( (1 + cos theta ) / 2 )

Hmm. So perhaps the correct expression is not in terms of theta/2, but perhaps in terms of another angle.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

But according to our calculation, the components are sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ).

Wait, let's see for specific theta values.

For example, when theta =0 (along x-axis):

sin theta =0, so sqrt( (1 +0)/2 )=1/sqrt(2 ), and sqrt( (1-0)/2 )=1/sqrt(2 )

So the vector is [1,1 ] / sqrt(2 ), which is [1/sqrt(2 ), 1/sqrt(2 ) ]

But according to option C, when theta=0, the vector would be (cos(0), sin(0)) = (1, 0 )

Which doesn't match. So option C can't be the correct answer.

Hmm. Let me check this: when theta=0, the direction is along x. The operator in that case is (P_x * 1 + P_z *0 ) = P_x.

So the eigenvectors of P_x with eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be [1; 1 ] / sqrt(2 ), as P_x is the Pauli X matrix times ħ/2.

So the eigenvector is [1;1 ] / sqrt(2 ), which is what we found. But option C gives [1;0], which is not correct. So option C is incorrect.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

But the problem states that the eigenvector lies in the x-z plane, which typically would have phi=0 for spin-1/2 systems, but the options don't necessarily reflect that. Also, the eigenvector components are real, but option B has a complex component (e^{i phi} ), which is only possible if phi is chosen such that it's real. But for arbitrary phi, the component is complex, which may not fit our case.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but in our case, the components don't have ħ. The eigenvector is a dimensionless vector, because it's a state vector in Hilbert space.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the options include ħ in the components. That seems off because eigenvectors are typically dimensionless.

Wait, the question states that the operator P has components with ħ/2, but the eigenvector is a vector in Hilbert space, so it's a normalized state, like |up> or |down>, which are unit vectors.

But the options given include ħ in the elements, which seems incorrect. Perhaps this is a typo, but let's proceed.

But according to our earlier calculation, the normalized eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ]

Looking at option D: sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2 )

Wait, but perhaps we can reconcile this.

Wait, let's compute cos(theta/2 )^2 = (1 + cos theta)/2, and sin(theta/2 )^2 = (1 - cos theta)/2.

But in our case, we have (1 + sin theta)/2 and (1 - sin theta)/2.

Hmm, so perhaps if we can write this in terms of another angle.

Wait, another approach. Let me set phi = theta - pi/2.

Then, theta = phi + pi/2.

So, sin theta = sin(phi + pi/2) = cos phi.

So, sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + cos phi )/2 ) = cos(phi/2 )

Similarly, sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - cos phi )/2 ) = sin(phi/2 )

So, the eigenvector is [ cos(phi/2 ), sin(phi/2 ) ]

But phi = theta - pi/2, so phi/2 = theta/2 - pi/4.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, but theta is the angle in the x-z plane. So, perhaps the direction is at an angle phi from the z-axis? Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up between polar and azimuthal angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to parameterize the direction in terms of angles from the x and z axes.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the eigenvector can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere representation.

In the Bloch sphere, the eigenvector for spin in the direction (nx, 0, nz) is given by:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |1>

But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi =0, so the eigenvector would be cos(theta/2) |0> + sin(theta/2) |1>

Which corresponds to (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

So the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which matches option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but earlier I thought that when theta=0, the eigenvector is [1;1]/sqrt(2), but according to this, when theta=0, it would be [1;0], which contradicts.

Wait, what's wrong here? Because when theta is the polar angle in the Bloch sphere (from the z-axis), then for theta=0, the direction is along +z. So the eigenvector would be |0>, which is [1;0].

But in our problem, theta is the angle in the x-z plane from the x-axis. So when theta=0, the direction is along +x. So the Bloch vector for spin along +x is [1;1]/sqrt(2 ), which is the eigenvector for P_x.

But according to option C, when theta=0, the vector is [1;0], which is the eigenvector along +z, not +x.

So that suggests that option C is incorrect because it's parameterizing the angle from the z-axis, not the x-axis.

So perhaps the correct approach is to parameterize the eigenvector in terms of the angle theta from the x-axis, as we did earlier.

Earlier, we found the normalized eigenvector to be [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ]

Looking again at the options, none of them directly match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider the general spin-1/2 system. The spin operator in direction n is given by S·n = (Sx nx + Sz nz ) (since n is in x-z plane, ny=0).

The eigenstates are |+> and |->, which are:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |1>

|-> = -e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |0> + cos(theta/2) |1>

But since the direction is in x-z plane, phi=0. So,

|+> = cos(theta/2) |0> + sin(theta/2) |1>

Which is the same as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which is option C.

But earlier, when I computed for theta=0, which is along x, this would give [1;0], but that's not correct because the eigenvector for x direction is [1;1]/sqrt(2).

Ah, wait, now I realize the confusion: the angle theta in the Bloch sphere is measured from the z-axis. So in our problem, theta is the angle from the x-axis, which is different.

So when theta is 0 in Bloch sphere (along z), the vector is [1;0], but when theta is 90 degrees in our problem (along z), the eigenvector is [0;1], which is correct.

So perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the parameterization.

Wait, let me think again. The direction vector in the x-z plane can be represented as ( cos alpha,  0, sin alpha ), where alpha is the angle from the x-axis. So the Bloch vector for spin along this direction is:

|+> = cos(alpha/2) |0> + sin(alpha/2) |1>

Which gives the vector [ cos(alpha/2), sin(alpha/2) ]

So if the problem's theta is alpha, then the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which matches option C.

But earlier, when I computed the eigenvector for theta=0 (along x), it gave [1;0], but that's not correct because the eigenvector along x should be [1;1]/sqrt(2).

Hmm, I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, no. Because in the Bloch sphere, the angle theta is measured from the z-axis. So when the direction is along x (theta=90 degrees from z), the eigenvector would be |+x> = [1;1]/sqrt(2 )

So the parameterization in option C is using theta as the angle from the x-axis, not the z-axis.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the definition of theta.

In the problem statement, the direction is in the x-z plane. So the parameterization can be either from the x-axis or the z-axis.

Wait, perhaps the problem defines theta as the angle from the x-axis, so in that case, the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which would mean that when theta=90 degrees (along z), the eigenvector is [0;1], which is correct. And when theta=0 (along x), it's [1;0], which is incorrect because the eigenvector for x should be [1;1]/sqrt(2 )

Wait, so perhaps the problem defines theta differently. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let me think again. Let me take the direction vector n as (sin theta, 0, cos theta ), which is a common parameterization where theta is the polar angle from the z-axis.

In that case, for theta=0, n is along +z, theta=pi/2 along +x.

So the operator would be S·n = Sx sin theta + Sz cos theta.

The eigenstates for S·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be |+n> = cos(theta/2)|0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|1>

But since the direction is in x-z, phi=0, so |+n> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which matches option C.

But according to our earlier calculation, when theta=pi/2 (along x), the eigenvector would be [0, 1], which is incorrect because the +x eigenstate is [1;1]/sqrt(2 )

So there's a contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in how the direction vector is parameterized. Let me think again.

The direction vector in the x-z plane can be represented as ( cos alpha, 0, sin alpha ), where alpha is the angle from the x-axis.

So n = (cos alpha, 0, sin alpha )

Then, the operator is S·n = Sx cos alpha + Sz sin alpha.

The eigenstates would be |+> = cos(alpha/2) |0> + e^{i phi} sin(alpha/2)|1>

But since the direction is in x-z plane, phi=0, so it's [ cos(alpha/2), sin(alpha/2) ]

In this case, when alpha=0 (along x), the eigenvector is [1;0], which is incorrect because the +x eigenstate is [1;1]/sqrt(2 )

Hmm, that's a problem. Because when alpha=0, along x, the eigenvector is [1;1]/sqrt(2 ), not [1;0].

Wait, that suggests that the parameterization I'm using is wrong. So perhaps the correct parameterization is using (sin alpha, 0, cos alpha ), making alpha the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, let me try that.

If n = (sin alpha, 0, cos alpha ), then when alpha=0, it's along z; alpha=pi/2 along x.

So the operator S·n = Sx sin alpha + Sz cos alpha.

The eigenstates would then be |+> = cos(alpha/2)|0> + e^{i phi} sin(alpha/2)|1>

Again, phi=0 because in x-z plane.

So when alpha=pi/2 (along x), the eigenvector is [ cos(pi/4 ), sin(pi/4 ) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ], which is correct, as it's the |+x> state.

When alpha=0 (along z), the eigenvector is [1;0], which is correct.

So this seems to fit. So the eigenvector is [ cos(alpha/2), sin(alpha/2) ]

But in the problem, the angle is called theta, which is the angle from the x-axis in the x-z plane. So that would correspond to alpha= pi/2 - theta.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me clarify.

If the direction is in the x-z plane, making an angle alpha from the z-axis, then the angle from the x-axis would be theta = pi/2 - alpha.

So if we parameterize with alpha as the polar angle (from z), then the eigenvector is [ cos(alpha/2), sin(alpha/2) ]

But in the problem, the direction is given by theta being the angle from x-axis. So alpha = pi/2 - theta.

So, substituting, the eigenvector becomes:

cos( (pi/2 - theta)/2 ), sin( (pi/2 - theta)/2 )

Which simplifies to cos( (pi/4 - theta/2) ), sin( (pi/4 - theta/2) )

We can write this using trigonometric identities.

cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B

So,

cos(pi/4 - theta/2 ) = cos(pi/4) cos(theta/2 ) + sin(pi/4) sin(theta/2 )
= (sqrt(2)/2)( cos(theta/2 ) + sin(theta/2) )

Similarly,

sin(pi/4 - theta/2 ) = sin(pi/4) cos(theta/2 ) - cos(pi/4) sin(theta/2 )
= (sqrt(2)/2)( cos(theta/2 ) - sin(theta/2) )

So the eigenvector is:

sqrt(2)/2 ( cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ), 
sqrt(2)/2 ( cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) )

Which can be written as [ (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ) / sqrt(2 ), (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ) / sqrt(2 ) ]

Hmm, but this doesn't match any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the parameterization.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the standard result that the eigenvector for spin along a direction (nx, ny, nz) is given by the state |+> = e^{-i phi/2} ( cos(theta/2) |0> + sin(theta/2) |1> )

But since ny=0, phi=0, so |+> = cos(theta/2) |0> + sin(theta/2) |1>

Which matches option C.

But according to our earlier calculation, when theta= pi/2 (along x), the eigenvector should be [1;1]/sqrt(2 ), but option C would give [0;1], which is incorrect.

Wait, that suggests that the parameterization in option C is using theta as the polar angle from the z-axis, not the x-axis. So when the direction is along x, theta=pi/2, and the eigenvector is [0;1], which is incorrect.

This is confusing. Let me try to approach this differently.

Let me consider the operator P·n, where n is (sin alpha, 0, cos alpha ), alpha is the angle from the z-axis.

The matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) [ [ cos alpha, sin alpha ], [ sin alpha, -cos alpha ] ]

The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

For the eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector is found by solving (P·n - (ħ/2) I ) v =0.

The matrix becomes (ħ/2) [ [ cos alpha -1, sin alpha ], [ sin alpha, -cos alpha -1 ] ]

Set to zero:

(cos alpha -1) a + sin alpha b = 0

sin alpha a + (-cos alpha -1 ) b = 0

From the first equation:

a = [ - sin alpha / (cos alpha -1) ] b

= [ sin alpha / (1 - cos alpha) ] b

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cos alpha ):

a = [ sin alpha (1 + cos alpha ) ] / ( (1 - cos alpha)(1 + cos alpha) ) * b

Denominator is 1 - cos^2 alpha = sin^2 alpha.

So,

a = [ sin alpha (1 + cos alpha ) / sin^2 alpha ] b

= [ (1 + cos alpha ) / sin alpha ] b

= [ (1 + cos alpha ) / sin alpha ] b

Now, using the identity (1 + cos alpha ) = 2 cos^2(alpha/2 )

And sin alpha = 2 sin(alpha/2) cos(alpha/2 )

So,

a = [ 2 cos^2(alpha/2) ] / [ 2 sin(alpha/2) cos(alpha/2) ) ] * b

= [ cos(alpha/2 ) / sin(alpha/2) ] * b

= cot(alpha/2) * b

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(alpha/2 ), 1 ]^T.

Which can be written as [ cos(alpha/2 ), sin(alpha/2) ]^T.

Because,

cot(alpha/2 ) = cos(alpha/2 ) / sin(alpha/2 )

So, the eigenvector is [ cos(alpha/2 ), sin(alpha/2) ].

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(alpha/2 ), sin(alpha/2) ), which is option C.

But in this parameterization, alpha is the polar angle from the z-axis. So when alpha=0 (along z), the eigenvector is [1;0]. When alpha=pi (along -z), it's [0;1]. When alpha=pi/2 (along x), the eigenvector is [sqrt(2)/2; sqrt(2)/2 ], which is correct.

So in this case, the eigenvector is given by option C.

But wait, the problem states that the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle is measured from the x-axis. So perhaps I'm confusing the angles here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses theta as the angle from the x-axis, making alpha = pi/2 - theta.

But regardless, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly this.

But earlier, when I thought that for theta=0 (along x), the eigenvector is [1;1]/sqrt(2 ), but according to option C, it's [1;0], which is incorrect.

Ah, perhaps the confusion arises because the angle definitions differ.

Wait, perhaps the angle in the problem is measured from the x-axis, making the polar angle alpha = theta.

In that case, when theta=0 (along x), the eigenvector should be [1;1]/sqrt(2 ), but option C gives [1;0], which is incorrect.

So this suggests that option C is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the parameterization wrong. Let me think again.

In the standard parameterization, when the direction is along x (theta=pi/2 from z), the eigenvector is [1;1]/sqrt(2 ), which is [ cos(pi/4 ), sin(pi/4) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ].

So according to option C, when theta= pi/2 (along x), the eigenvector is [ cos(pi/4 ), sin(pi/4) ] which matches.

Wait, but earlier I thought when theta=0 (along x), but perhaps theta is measured from the z-axis, not the x-axis.

So perhaps the problem states that the direction is in the x-z plane, but theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, making the eigenvector [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ]

In that case, when theta=pi/2 (along x), the eigenvector is [0;1], which is incorrect. Wait, no.

Wait, if theta is the angle from z-axis, then when theta=pi/2 (along x), the eigenvector is [ cos(pi/4 ), sin(pi/4) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ] which is correct.

Ah, yes! So perhaps in the problem, theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, not the x-axis. So when the direction is along x, theta=pi/2.

In that case, option C is correct.

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

Which is option C.

But in the problem statement, the direction is in the x-z plane, but the angle theta is not specified. So perhaps the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me recap.

The normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ], where theta is the polar angle from the z-axis. This matches option C.

But when theta=pi/2 (along x), the eigenvector is [0;1], which we know is incorrect because the +x eigenstate is [1;1]/sqrt(2 )

Wait, that can't be. So I must have made a mistake in the parameterization.

Wait, let me get back to the initial calculation.

The normalized eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ]

Which can be written as [ cos(alpha/2 ), sin(alpha/2) ], where alpha is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So when alpha=pi/2 (along x), the eigenvector is [0,1], which is incorrect.

But when alpha=0 (along z), it's [1,0], which is correct.

So this suggests that perhaps the correct parameterization is using the angle from the x-axis.

But that complicates things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ], where theta is the angle from the x-axis.

In that case, when theta=0 (along x), the eigenvector is [1;0], which is incorrect.

So I'm stuck.

But given the options, and the fact that option C is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ], which aligns with the standard Bloch sphere parameterization when theta is measured from the z-axis, perhaps that's the intended answer.

But earlier, our calculation when n is in x-z plane gave the eigenvector as [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ]

Which for theta=0 (along x), gives [1,0], which is incorrect.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each represented as a $2 \times 2$ matrix multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle measured from the z-axis.

The eigenvalue problem involves solving for the eigenvector of the operator $P \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta$. The eigenvector for the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ is derived using the standard result for spin-1/2 systems, where the eigenstate for spin along a direction $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ is given by:

\[
|+\rangle = \cos(\theta/2)|0\rangle + \sin(\theta/2)|1\rangle
\]

This corresponds to the normalized eigenvector:

\[
\left[\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)\right]
\]

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
   This does not match the derived eigenvector, as it introduces unnecessary scaling factors and does not depend on $\theta$.

2. **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
   This is incorrect because the eigenvector components are real, and the problem specifies an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, which does not require a complex phase factor.

3. **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
   This matches the derived eigenvector for the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. It is consistent with the standard parameterization of spin states in the Bloch sphere formalism, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

4. **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
   This introduces incorrect scaling factors and does not match the derived eigenvector.

### Conclusion:
The normalized eigenvector for the operator $\vec{P}$ along the direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, is given by $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$. This matches **Option C**.
