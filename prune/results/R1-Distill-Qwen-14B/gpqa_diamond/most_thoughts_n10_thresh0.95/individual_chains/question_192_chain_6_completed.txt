Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

We have an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the cavity is some distance away from the center of the conductor, not exactly at the center.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both l and L are greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside.

The angle between l and s is theta. Wait, so l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, and s is the distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity. So the setup is a bit like the conductor with the cavity off-center, and point P is somewhere outside.

I remember from my studies that when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's response involves charges induced on its inner and outer surfaces. Oh right, the cavity is isolated, so the conductor's net charge is zero, but the presence of +q induces charges.

In this scenario, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when we place +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance it out.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the total induced charge should cancel the internal charge. Let me think. Yes, the inner surface of the conductor (inside the cavity) would have an induced charge of -q, because the charge +q attracts the electrons. Then, since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the total conductor's charge is zero (original condition), so inner is -q, outer must be +q to sum to zero.

So the electric field outside the conductor would be as if the charge +q was located at the center of the conductor. Or wait, no. Because the charge on the outer surface is +q, but its distribution is uniform since the conductor is spherical. Wait, but the charge on the outer surface is uniformly distributed because the conductor is a sphere, regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity. Or is that the case?

Wait, no. If the charge inside the cavity is not at the center, does that affect the distribution on the outer surface? I think in a conductor, the charges rearrange to cancel any internal fields. So the induced charges on the inner surface depend on the position of the +q, but the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform, right? Because the outer surface depends on the total charge inside the conductor, which is just the induced -q on the inner surface and the +q on the outer. So the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's symmetrically distributed because it's a sphere. So the electric field outside the conductor (like at point P) would be as if all the charge +q was at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait. No, because the point P is not at the center. The distance from P to the conductor's center is L, but the conductor's outer surface has charge +q. So the field at P would be as if the charge +q is located at the center of the conductor, so the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That's because for a spherical charge distribution, the field outside is the same as if the charge were a point at the center.

But wait, the charge is inside the cavity, which is off-center. So does that affect the outer field? Hmm, no, because the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed regardless. So the external field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and the location is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is outside, so the distance is L from the conductor's center. So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². But looking at the options, let's see.

Option B says that. Option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That's the same as what I was thinking.

But wait, what about the position of the charge inside the cavity? The cavity's center is at distance s from the conductor's center, and P is at distance l from the cavity's center, so maybe the field comes from the +q being displaced, so the field at P isn't just from the center.

Wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface's +q is uniformly distributed. The field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is as if the charge were a point at the center. So regardless of where the inner charge is, the outer field behaves as if it's a point charge at the conductor's center.

So the electric field at point P is due to the +q on the outer surface. So P is outside, so the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The point P is outside the conductor, so the induced charges on the outer surface (which sum to +q) create a field as if the charge were at the center. Since the point is at distance L from the center, the field is q/(4πε₀ L²).

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity is off-center, with its center separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and $l$ from the center of the cavity, where $l, L > R$. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the total charge. The charge on the outer surface is uniformly distributed due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor.

The electric field outside a charged spherical conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor. For a spherical charge distribution, the field outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge located at the center of the conductor. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
\]

This matches option B. The position of the charge inside the cavity or the angle $\theta$ does not affect the external field because the outer surface charge distribution ensures that the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

Answer: B
