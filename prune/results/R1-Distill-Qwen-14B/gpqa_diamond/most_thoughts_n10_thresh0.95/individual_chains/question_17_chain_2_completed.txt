Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5×10^10. The options are A to D, four choices.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and we need to find the free calcium ion concentration in the solution.

Wait, the stability constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Right. So the complex is CaEDTA^2-, and it dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, the problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But since the K is so large (5e10), that suggests that the complex is very stable. Which means that the dissociation of CaEDTA^2- into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- is minimal. So the free [Ca^2+] should be really low.

So the idea is to calculate the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions in solution. Let me write down the equation.

The reaction is: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The equilibrium expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in this problem, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Are the concentrations of EDTA and Ca^2+ given somewhere else? No, wait, the solution only contains the Ca-EDTA complex, right? So all the Ca is tied up in the complex, except for a tiny amount that dissociates.

Wait, but EDTA is in solution as well. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, and assuming that all the EDTA is present as the complex (or not?), because EDTA can come from the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, but in a 1:1 complex like this, the total concentration of EDTA would be equal to the concentration of the complex, plus any free EDTA and free Ca^2+.

But wait, if the solution is made by dissolving a stoichiometric amount of Ca and EDTA, then the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. But in this problem, the solution contains just the complex. So perhaps the initial assumption is that the EDTA is entirely in the complex form, except for a small amount that dissociates.

Wait, but that can't be right because the EDTA comes from the complex. Let me think again. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, the complex dissociates a little, so:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.

Let me set up the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ produced from dissociation. Since for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4- are formed. So [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

So the expression becomes K = (0.02)/(x * x) = 5e10.

So 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10.

Wait, solving for x^2: x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-3 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.

So x = sqrt(4e-14) = 2e-7 M.

Wait, but that's the concentration of Ca^2+. So would that be 2e-7 M? Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, and option B is 5e-3. Hmm, 2e-7 isn't directly an option, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait. Let me redo the math. 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 0.02 / 5e10 = (2e-2) / (5e10) )= (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, no, because 5e10 is 5 x 10^10, so 0.02 M is 2e-2 M.

So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2e-6.5. Wait, what is 1e-6.5? 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 6.5 is halfway between 6 and 7 exponents, so 3.16e-7.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7 because 10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = 1e-6 * 0.316 = 3.16e-7.

So x = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Ah, that's approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. If 0.02 M is the concentration of the complex, then when it dissociates, the concentration of each ion is x. So the denominator is x^2, and [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 - x, but since x is so small compared to 0.02, we can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02. So our initial assumption holds, because K is very large, so x is very small.

So yes, the correct answer should be 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation equilibrium is:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions at equilibrium. Since the dissociation is minimal (due to the large \( K \)), the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) remains approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \). Thus, \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\). Substituting these into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
