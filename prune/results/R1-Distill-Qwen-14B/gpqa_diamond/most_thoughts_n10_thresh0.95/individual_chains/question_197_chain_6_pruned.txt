Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out what the final product is after Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the given data for Compound X: the IR and NMR spectra. The IR shows peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, another peak at 1720 cm-1 is strong. That's a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might suggest aromatic rings, like benzene, because those are typical for C=C stretching.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is a strong indicator of an -OH proton, probably from a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols usually have lower ppm values, like around 1-5, unless they're more acidic like phenols. But 10.5 is really high, so carboxylic acid makes more sense.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 could also be a ketone. Hmm. But the NMR has a singlet at 10.5, which I'm pretty confident is a carboxylic acid proton. So maybe the IR's 1720 is a carbonyl from the acid, which would fit.

Then looking at the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are usually as two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So the substituent is in the para position, making a symmetrical structure.

What about the other NMR peaks? 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let me think about what these could be. 

The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, maybe a CH next to another group. The 1.7 ppm is two Hs in a multiplet, maybe a CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a triplet of three Hs as a doublet—wait, no, a doublet would be two peaks. So it's a doublet, possibly an isopropyl group or a methyl adjacent to something. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet, likely a CH2CH2CH3, so a terminal methyl group, like at the end of a chain.

Putting it together: the aromatic ring has a substituent. The substituent is attached to a group that has a CH2CH(CH3)2 or something similar. Wait, let's think about the structure.

The IR at 1720 is a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would have a COOH group attached to the benzene ring. So para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent on the ring.

Looking at the substituent: the NMR signals suggest maybe a (sec-butyl) group. Let's see: the substituent would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, no, perhaps it's a branched chain.

Wait, wait. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH that's adjacent to another CH2 or something. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl. So putting it together, perhaps it's a (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) group. Wait, maybe it's isobutyl.

Wait, the NMR:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) - perhaps a CH adjacent to a carbonyl, or maybe part of a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with branching. Let me think about the substituent attached to the benzene ring. If the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)2, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached as a substituent. Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)- attached to the ring. Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2CH2-? No, wait, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. The NMR shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → probably a CH that's adjacent to another group. Maybe part of a CH2 group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → maybe a CH2 group next to something else.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → a terminal methyl group, so maybe a CH2CH2CH3 at the end.

Wait, putting that together, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, but that would have a branching. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think: if the substituent is a isopropyl group, then perhaps the NMR signals would be different.

Wait, considering that the substituent is attached to the benzene ring and is a propyl group with branching, perhaps a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Or, wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: The 1H NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is a methyl group connected to a CH2. So that would be a CH2CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH, which is connected to another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me see: the CH2 would be the part connected to the ring, then a CH adjacent, which would have a methyl attached (the 1.4 ppm, d, 3H), and the CH2 at the end with the t, 3H.

So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that would make it a pentyl group, but perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that's not right. Actually, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) ? Hmm, I'm not getting the structure right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. But that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me think about the NMR:

The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, which could be the CH adjacent to the benzene ring. Then the CH2 group next to that (perhaps the 1.7 ppm m, 2H). The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be a methyl attached to that CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be the end of the chain.

So if substituent is CH(CH2CH2CH3), then the NMR would show:

- CH (2.9 ppm, m, 1H)

- CH2 (1.7 ppm, m, 2H)

- CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that would make it a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2 group. So the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's actually a pentyl group with a methyl branch. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, but how would that fit the NMR? Let me break it down:

- The CH adjacent to the benzene (Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)): the CH would be the next carbon after the benzene, so it's CH2-CH(...). The CH2 would be split into a triplet perhaps, but in the NMR, the 2.9 is a multiplet for 1H. Maybe the CH is the one with the methyl groups attached.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

So the structure would be benzene ring with a substituent at position para, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3).

In that case:

- The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be the CH in CH(CH2CH3). Because that CH is connected to two CH2 groups, perhaps.

Wait, but the NMR shows 1.4 ppm (d,3H) and 0.9 ppm (t,3H). The d would be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is in turn connected to another group. The t is a terminal methyl, so it would be on the end of a CH2 group. So, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? But that would make it a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group? No, that doesn't fit with the t at 0.9.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group, like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to a CH2. So it would be -CH2-CH(CH3)2. Let me check the NMR.

In that case:

The CH2 (attached to benzene) would be around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet, maybe. The CH(CH3)2 would have the methyl groups at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and perhaps another group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to piece it together.

The 10.5 ppm peak in NMR is a strong carboxylic acid proton. So the compound has a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent in the para position.

So the structure is para-substituted benzoic acid, with a substituent on the ring. The substituent is a side chain, perhaps an alkyl group.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that's a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 4? Wait, no, para would be positions 1 and 4.

Wait, wait, the numbering is a bit tricky. So benzoic acid is usually at position 1, so the substituent would be at position 4.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group. What's
