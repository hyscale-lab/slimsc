--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

Hmm, I remember that particles like mesons, which are bosons, can decay, and the mean decay length depends on their lifetime and velocity. But wait, how do I calculate that?

I think the formula for the mean decay distance is L = γ * β * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity in terms of the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime of the particle.

But first, I need to find the lifetime τ. Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but the units might be tricky here. I should make sure all units are consistent. Let's think about the values given.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. Since ħ has units of GeV·s, then Γ in GeV would be 0.32 GeV (since 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV). So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. But what is ħ in GeV·s? I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me double-check that. Oh wait, yes, because 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J, and ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Converting that, but maybe I can just use the value 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ let's see, 6.582 divided by 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is τ. That's 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, no, because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, I need to find the velocity β. For that, I can use the energy and mass. The particle is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Since E is given, perhaps I can find the momentum p.

Wait, another approach: the kinetic energy is E - m c². But in this case, E is the total energy, because when they say production energy, I think they mean the total energy of the meson. So E = γ m c², and m is 1.2 GeV/c² (since E=mc², so m = E/(c²) when at rest). 

Wait, no, m is given as 1.2 GeV, but units-wise, mass is in GeV/c². So E is total energy, which is 8 GeV. So to find γ, we calculate γ = E / (m c²). But wait, because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But wait, m is in GeV/c², and E is in GeV. So when you multiply m (GeV/c²) by c², you get GeV. So E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²) → but wait, E and m c² have same units (GeV), so γ = E/(m). Because m c² is 1.2 GeV, since m is 1.2 GeV/c², m c² is 1.2 GeV.

So γ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 /1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, that's 6 and 2/3, or 20/3. So γ = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

Then, to find β, we can use the relation γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So β² = 1 - (1/γ²). Let's compute that.

γ² is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444.

So 1/γ² is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So β² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So β = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ let's calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.9775). Let me think: 0.987^2 is about 0.974, 0.988^2 is 0.976, 0.988^2 = 0.976144. Wait, 0.988 squared is (0.98 * 10 + 0.008)^2= maybe I should compute it numerically.

Wait, 0.9775 is the number. Let me find sqrt(0.9775).

I know that sqrt(0.96) is 0.98, sqrt(0.976) is approx 0.9878. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach. Let me compute it step by step.

Let me approximate sqrt(0.9775).

Let me think that 0.988^2 = (0.988)^2 = let's compute:

0.988 * 0.988 = ?

Multiply 988 * 988. 988 * 988 is (1000 - 12)^2 = 1000000 - 2*1000*12 + 12^2 = 1e6 - 24,000 + 144 = 976,144.

So 0.988^2 = 0.976144. That's less than 0.9775.

The difference is 0.9775 - 0.976144 = 0.001356.

Now, let me find a small delta x such that (0.988 + x)^2 ≈ 0.9775.

Expanding (a + x)^2 = a² + 2 a x + x².

Here, a = 0.988, a²=0.976144.

We have 0.976144 + 2 * 0.988 * x + x² = 0.9775.

So 0.976144 + 1.976 x + x² = 0.9775.

The difference is 0.001356 = 1.976 x + x².

Assuming x is small, x² is negligible. So 1.976 x ≈ 0.001356 → x ≈ 0.001356 / 1.976 ≈ approximately 0.000686.

So 0.988 + 0.000686 ≈ 0.988686.

So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ approximately 0.988686. Let's say about 0.9887.

So β ≈ 0.9887.

So now, we have β and γ.

Next, find the lifetime τ, which we already have as approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, the mean lifetime from the lab frame is τ_lab = γ * τ.

Wait, no, because τ is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame), so the observed lifetime is γ τ.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is τ_lab = γ τ ≈ (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let me compute that.

(20/3) is about 6.6666667.

So 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ let's compute 6 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.234125e-23, and 0.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.37125e-24. So total is 1.234125e-23 + 1.37125e-24 = 1.37125e-24 is 0.137125e-23, so total is 1.234125 + 0.137125 = 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

6 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.234125e-23.

0.6666667 * 2.056875e-24: 2.056875e-24 * 0.6666667 ≈ 1.37125e-24.

Adding them together: 1.234125e-23 + 0.137125e-23 = 1.37125e-23 seconds.

So τ_lab ≈ 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Now, the velocity is β c, so the speed is v = β c.

The mean decay distance L is velocity multiplied by the lifetime.

So L = v * τ_lab = β c τ_lab.

Wait, but since τ_lab is already γ τ, and velocity v = β c, then L = β c * γ τ.

But τ is ħ/(Γ).

Wait, let me make sure I have the formula right.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as L = (β γ c τ).

So yes, that's correct.

Let me compute it.

Compute each part:

β ≈ 0.9887,

γ = 20/3 ≈ 6.6666667,

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 meters per second,

τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = β * γ * c * τ.

Compute step by step.

First compute β * γ: 0.9887 * 6.6666667 ≈ approximately 6.6 (exact: 0.9887 * 6.6666667 ≈ 0.9887 * 6 = 5.9322, 0.9887 * 0.6666667 ≈ approx 0.6591, so total about 6.5913).

But for more precise calculation: 0.9887 * 6.6666667.

Let me compute 6.6666667 * 0.9887.

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's compute 2/3 * 0.9887: 0.9887 * 2 = 1.9774, divided by 3: approximately 0.65913.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.65913 = 6.59133.

So β γ ≈ 6.59133.

Now, c is 3e8 m/s.

τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 6.59133 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but wait, that's a lot of exponents. Let's handle the multiplication:

6.59133 * 3e8 = 1.977399e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24 s.

So 1.977399e9 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Multiply 1.977399 * 2.056875 ≈ let me compute that.

1.9774 * 2.056875.

Compute 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375. Then subtract 0.0226 * 2.056875 (since 2.056875 - 1.9774 is about 0.079475, but perhaps it's easier to compute 1.9774 * 2.056875.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to approximate.

Wait, 2.056875 * 2 = 4.11375.

2.056875 * 0.9774 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2 * 0.9774 = 1.9548.

0.056875 * 0.9774: 0.056875 * 1 is 0.056875, but since 0.9774 is about 0.9774 times that, so 0.056875 * 0.9774 ≈ 0.0555.

So sum is approximately 1.9548 + 0.0555 ≈ 2.0103.

So 2.056875 * 1.9774 ≈ approx 4.11375 (for 2.056875 * 2) minus 2.056875 * (2 - 1.9774) = 2.056875 * 0.0226 ≈ 0.04655.

So 4.11375 - 0.04655 ≈ 4.0672.

So the product is approximately 4.0672e-15 meters.

Wait, because 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.

So 4.0672e-15 meters. Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655 * 10^-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

So our calculation is approximately 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but perhaps I made some approximation errors. Let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should do it more precisely.

Let me recompute L = β γ c τ.

β is exactly sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, another approach: since E = γ m c², and p = gamma m v, but maybe that's complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute β using the exact formula.

Wait, since E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c², so the total energy is E = γ m c² → γ = E / (m c²) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) )= 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6666667.

So β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

So 1/γ² is (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So β = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.98868.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator would give a more precise value. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

I can use a Taylor expansion or a better approximation.

Alternatively, using a calculator's square root function: sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.988685.

So, β = 0.988685.

So, β * γ = 0.988685 * (20/3) = 0.988685 * 6.6666667.

Compute 0.988685 * 6 = 5.93211.

0.988685 * 0.6666667 = ?

0.988685 * 2/3 = (0.988685 * 2) / 3 = 1.97737 / 3 ≈ 0.659123.

So sum is 5.93211 + 0.659123 ≈ 6.59123.

So β γ ≈ 6.59123.

Now, c is 2.99792458e8 m/s, but for simplicity, let's take it as 3e8 m/s.

τ is ħ / Γ. 

We have Γ = 0.32 GeV.

ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

So τ = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So now, L = β γ c τ.

Compute each part:

β γ = 6.59123,

c = 3e8 m/s,

τ = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 6.59123 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute the product step by step.

First, multiply 6.59123 * 3e8 = 1.977369e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24.

So 1.977369e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.977369 * 2.056875) * 1e9 * 1e-24.

1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.

Now, compute 1.977369 * 2.056875.

Let me compute this exactly.

2.056875 * 1.977369.

= 2 * 1.977369 = 3.954738,

0.056875 * 1.977369.

Compute 0.056875 * 1.977369.

0.05 * 1.977369 = 0.09886845.

0.006875 * 1.977369 ≈ 0.0135594.

So sum is 0.09886845 + 0.0135594 ≈ 0.11242785.

So total is 3.954738 + 0.11242785 = 4.06716585.

So 1.977369 * 2.056875 ≈ 4.06716585.

So L = 4.06716585e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Our calculated value is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of β γ c τ. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact expressions.

Another approach: The mean proper lifetime τ is ħ / Γ.

Then, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ_lab = γ τ.

The velocity is β c.

So the mean decay length is L = β c τ_lab = β c γ τ.

Which is β γ c (ħ / Γ).

Hmm, could I find an expression in terms of E, m, Γ, etc.?

Wait, let's see.

E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²) = E/(m c²) → but since m is given in GeV/c², E is GeV, and c² is (m/s)^2, but perhaps it's better to keep units abstract.

But perhaps to compute everything numerically.

Alternatively, let me compute the exact product again.

Compute β γ:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Wait, but in terms of units, perhaps it's easier to compute beta as (p c)/E, where p is momentum.

Because for a relativistic particle, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So p c = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) / c.

Wait, perhaps better to compute p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/(c²).

Wait, but units are a bit messy, perhaps better to compute beta = (pc)/(E).

But in natural units where c=1, beta = p/E.

So, in natural units, beta = sqrt(1 - m²/E²) → which is what we have.

So, beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2)^2 / (8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 1.44/64) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.98868.

So, beta is 0.98868.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

So beta gamma = 0.98868 * 6.6666667 ≈ 6.59123.

Now, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So, L = 6.59123 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625 → 6.170625e-16.

Then multiply by 6.59123: 6.170625e-16 *6.59123 ≈ ?

6 * 6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.

0.59123 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ 3.648e-16.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to compute 6.59123 *6.170625e-16.

6.59123 *6.170625 = ?

Compute 6 *6.170625 = 37.02375,

0.59123 *6.170625 ≈ 3.648.

So total is approx 37.02375 + 3.648 = 40.67175.

So 40.67175e-16 m = 4.067175e-15 m.

Which is about 4.067e-15 m, which matches what I had before.

So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close. So probably the answer is B.

I think I did all the steps correctly, but perhaps I made a minor calculation error in the approximation. So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \) (proper lifetime)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we compute:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \) (Lorentz factor)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy of the particle, and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) is the rest mass. Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \) (velocity in units of \( c \))
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \) (mean decay distance)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5912.
\]

Then, calculate \( \beta \gamma c \tau \):

\[
L = 6.5912 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

Simplify the powers of 10:

\[
L = 6.5912 \cdot 3 \cdot 2.056875 \cdot 10^{-16}.
\]

Multiply the constants:

\[
6.5912 \cdot 3 \cdot 2.056875 \approx 40.67175.
\]

Thus:

\[
L \approx 40.67175 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} = 4.067175 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

**Answer: B**
