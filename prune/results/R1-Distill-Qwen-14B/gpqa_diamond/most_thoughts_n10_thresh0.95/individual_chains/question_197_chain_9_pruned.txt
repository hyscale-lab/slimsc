Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of Compound X and then determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

Let me start by looking at the IR and NMR data. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But the presence of a broad peak in the NMR might support that. Wait, the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm which is a broad singlet for 1H. That sounds like an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Because the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which is in the IR range, and the 1720 cm-1 would be the C=O stretch. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

But wait, another thought: the NMR has a peak at 2.9 ppm as a multiplet for 1H. That could be adjacent to a carbonyl, like a CH next to a COOH. Also, the 1.4 ppm as a doublet for 3H suggests maybe a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH(CH3) or similar.

Looking at the aromatic region in the NMR: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Like, two substituents in the para positions. So, the structure is probably something like a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1. Those are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So that fits with a benzene ring.

Putting this together, the benzene has two substituents para to each other. One substituent could be a substituent with a carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid or an ester. Let's look at the other protons. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to the carbonyl. So maybe it's a propionoic acid, where the CH2 is next to the COOH.

Wait, the NMR has a peak at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which is another set of protons. Maybe a CH2 group connected to something else. Let me try to sketch this structure.

If the benzene ring has a substituent at the para position, perhaps a propanoic acid group. Let's see: a benzene ring with a -CH2CH2COOH group. Wait, no, because the 1.7 ppm is two H as a multiplet, maybe a CH2 connected to another CH.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a triplet? No, it's a doublet. So that's a CH2 group attached to a CH which is attached to the benzene. So maybe it's something like CH(CH3)-..., but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the substituent on the benzene could be a propyl group with a carbonyl. Wait, but the IR shows a 1720 cm-1 which is a strong carbonyl, so maybe an ester or acid.

Let me consider each part:

IR peaks:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: Broad O-H (carboxylic acid) or maybe a ketone? No, ketones don't have that broad peak. So probably O-H, like a carboxylic acid.
- 1720 cm-1: C=O of a carboxylic acid.
- 1610 and 1450 cm-1: aromatic C=C.

So the compound has a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group.

NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs,1H): O-H of carboxylic acid? But carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but sometimes if it's de-shielded, it can be higher. But maybe the peak is for an aldehyde? No, aldehydes are around 9-10, but the broadness suggests it's an O-H.

Wait, but another possibility: the 10.5 ppm could be a vinylic proton, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Hmm, but then the NMR would show a triplet or something else. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl ketone, but that doesn't fit with the broad peak. I'm going to stick with it being a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): that's a typical para-substituted benzene. Let's say substituents are in the para positions, so groups like two -COOH, but that's unlikely. Or one -COOH and another group.

Wait, wait, but the substituents could be a -COOH and another group, but in the given options, some are acids and others are not.

Wait, let's look at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be a benzene ring with ethyl in position 4 and a propanoic acid at position 2. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would be benzene with ethyl group in position 4 and a propanoic acid attached to position 2. Wait, but that would make the substituents at positions 2 and 4, which are not para. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the substituents are in the para positions. Like the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 and 3? No, para is 1 and 4. So in the structure, the two substituents are on opposite positions.

Alternatively, maybe the benzene ring has a substituent that's a propyl group with a COOH.

Wait, let's think about the NMR:

The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, each as doublets, so that would mean the substituents are in the para positions, leading to two sets of doublets.

So, the substituent on the benzene is a group that has a carbonyl and perhaps some alkyl chain.

Looking at the downfield protons: 10.5 ppm (probably -COOH), 2.9 ppm (maybe a CH adjacent to COOH), 1.7 ppm (CH2), 1.4 ppm (CH3?), 0.9 ppm (CH2CH2CH3 perhaps).

Wait, the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a triplet, which is a terminal CH3. So that's likely the end of a propyl chain.

Putting it together, the substituent on the benzene is a group like -CH2CH(CH3)COOH.

Wait, let's count the protons.

The 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, broad): COOH.

- 8.0 and 7.2 (each 2H, d): para substituents.

- 2.9 ppm (1H, m): likely the CH next to the COOH.

- 1.7 ppm (2H, m): perhaps a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (3H, d): a CH3 attached to something.

- 0.9 ppm (3H, t): a terminal CH3 in a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH? Or perhaps a propyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2COOH. But the NMR doesn't show enough protons for that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH. Let's see:

The 1H NMR for the CH adjacent to COOH would be around 2.9 ppm, as a multiplet (maybe coupling with the adjacent CH2 groups).

The CH2 groups would be around δ 1.7 ppm as a multiplet.

The CH(CH2CH2CH3) group would have a CH3 at the end, which would be a triplet at δ 0.9 ppm (as in a -CH2CH2CH3 group), matching the NMR.

The CH3 attached to the CH would be at δ 1.4 ppm as a doublet. Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe it's a branching point.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a -CH2CH2COOH group attached to the benzene. Let's see:

Benzene ring with substituent at position 4. So, structure would be:

Ph-CH2CH2COOH.

But the NMR would then have a triplet around δ 4.3 for the CH2 next to COOH, but this isn't present. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group in a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)COOH group. So, the benzene ring is connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to a COOH.

Let me think about the NMR:

- The COOH proton is at 10.5 ppm (broad, 1H).

- The CH(CH3) group would have a proton at around 2.9 ppm, maybe as a multiplet.

- The CH2 next to CH(CH3) would have protons around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet.

- The CH3 on the CH(CH3) would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet.

- The CH2CH2CH3 chain would have a CH2 next to the CH(CH3) and another CH2 leading to a terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm.

Wait, but that would require the substituent to be -CH2CH(CH3)COOH.

So the structure would be benzene ring with a substituent in the para position, which is a -CH2CH(CH3)COOH group.

But then the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, because the COOH is at the end. Hmm, but the NMR shows 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which would be the CH3 attached to the CH. So that's the CH(CH3) group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH.

Wait, that's getting confusing. Let me think about the possible structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group connected to the benzene, but with a carbonyl group. Or maybe it's a butyl group.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure: the propanoic acid is attached to the benzene in position 2, and the benzene has an ethyl group in position 4. Wait, but that would make the substituents at positions 2 and 4, which are meta to each other, not para. So that might not fit the NMR data which suggests para substituents.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has a sec-butyl group in position 4 and a COOH group. Wait, but then the substituents would be in the same position? No, because benzoic acid is in position 1, so the substituent would be in position 4.

Wait, the question says it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What's that reaction? Oh, red phosphorus and HI is used for the Hinsberg reaction. Wait, no, the Hinsberg test uses benzene sulfonyl chloride and KOH. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe the cleavage of certain functional groups.

Wait, or maybe it's a reaction to reduce a nitrile? Or maybe to cleave a nitrile into an amine? No, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used in some reactions, like the Clemmensen reduction, but that's with Zn(Hg)/HCl. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used to cleave certain groups, like the reduction of a nitrile group into an amine. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. If the initial compound has a carboxylic acid group, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a nitrile, and this reaction would convert the nitrile into an amine. But wait, the IR data doesn't show the nitrile peak at around 2250 cm-1. So that's not the case.

Wait, let me think again: the compound has a benzene ring with substituents. The IR has a strong C=O at 1720, which could be a carboxylic acid. So if it's a benzoic acid derivative, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI might protonate the acid? Or perhaps it's a different functional group. Alternatively, maybe the starting compound is an ester, which would react with HI to form an acid.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak around 3400–2500 cm-1, which is more consistent with an O-H (like a carboxylic acid) than an ester. So maybe the starting compound is a benzoic acid with some substituent.

Wait, but maybe the reaction is something else. Red phosphorus and HI are also used in the Wittig reaction. Wait, no, the Wittig reaction uses triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Wait, maybe it's a case of eliminating a group. But I'm not entirely sure; perhaps I should think about the structure first.

Back to the NMR:

The 1H NMR shows:

10.5 (bs, 1H) → likely the COOH proton.

8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H) → para-substituted benzene.

Then, the 2.9 (m, 1H) → maybe the CH group adjacent to the COOH.

1.7 (m, 2H) → maybe a CH2 group.

1.4 (d,3H) → a CH3 attached to a CH.

0.9 (t,3H) → a terminal CH3.

So, putting it together, the substituent on the benzene is a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, so the structure would be benzene ring with a substituent at, say, position 4 being a CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH group.

Wait, that would make the substituent a propanoic acid group with a branching. Let me draw this.

So, benzene ring with a -CH2CH(CH3)COOH group attached. So the substituent is a propanoic acid where the middle carbon is attached to a methyl group.

Wait, then the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)COOH, which is a 3-methylpropanoic acid group attached to the benzene.

Wait, that would be 4-(3-methylpropanoic acid)benzene? Or perhaps the substituent is a pentanoic acid with a branch? Hmm, not sure.

But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me see: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group in the para position and a COOH group in position 1. So the substituents are at 1 and 4 positions of the benzene.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, each as doublets. That would imply that the substituents are in the para positions, each with two protons. So the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. One substituent is a COOH group, and the other is a sec-butyl group?

Wait, but if the substituents are in para positions, the ring would have two groups. So the structure would be something like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

So the initial compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction: it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What does that do?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hinsberg reaction, but I think that's more for sulfonamides. Alternatively, red phosphorus with HI is used in the Cleve elimination or for the reduction of nitriles to amines. Hmm, but benzoic acid doesn't have a nitrile group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. If the starting material has a leaving group, but I don't see any in the initial description.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Red phosphorus and HI can also be used to cleave certain groups. For example, if there's a nitrile group, HI in presence of red phosphorus might convert it into an amine. But I don't see a nitrile peak in the IR, so that might not apply.

Alternatively, if the starting material is a benzoic acid with a substituent that can undergo some elimination.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis. If the substituent is an ester, then HI and red phosphorus might saponify it. But the IR of the starting material shows a strong C=O at 1720, which could be an ester, but the O-H stretch in IR is broad, which suggests a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Wait, but if the starting compound is a benzoic acid, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would not change it much, unless it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a leaving group, but I don't see any halides in the initial structure.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the NMR again.

The substituent on the benzene is a group that includes a CH(CH3) and a CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, attached to the benzene ring. So if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can be used in the Cleve elimination, which typically converts a nitrile into an amine, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is an alkyl chain, what reaction would that undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't a benzoic acid but an ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid, but the IR data suggests it's already a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: substituents at 2 and 4 on benzene? Hmm, but this would require the substituents to be meta, not para.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: that's a toluene derivative with substituents in para, but the NMR doesn't show a COOH.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: benzene with COOH and sec-butyl in para positions.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: another toluene derivative, no COOH.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If the starting material is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, benzoic acid reacts with HI? Maybe HI would protonate the COOH, making it a good leaving group, but I don't see an obvious substitution. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not on the acid but on the sec-butyl group.

Wait, the sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Red phosphorus and HI are strong enough to perhaps eliminate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is converting a nitrile to an amine, but again, no nitrile in the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a benzoic acid but a benzyl chloride or something else that can undergo substitution. But the IR data doesn't support that.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester. Let me think again.

The IR has a strong C=O at 1720 cm-1, which can be an ester or a carboxylic acid. But the broad O-H stretch between 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests a carboxylic acid, unless it's an alcohol.

Wait, another thought. The peak at 1720 cm-1 could be an ester. The O-H stretch could be an alcohol or a phenol. But the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid O-H.

So, perhaps the starting material is a substituted benzoic acid.

So, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI: maybe the HI is a source of iodide, and red phosphorus could be a reducing agent or a catalyst.

Wait, another angle. Red phosphorus is used in the hydroboration reaction? No, that's with BH3. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a hydrogen with iodide, but that's more of an alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene ring is a leaving group. For example, if the substituent is a nitro group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a halide, but again, the data doesn't show that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction. For example, if there's a ketone, it might be reduced. But the starting compound has a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone or an acid.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is also indicative of a carbonyl, but for a ketone, the peak is around 1700-1750. Hmm, but 1720 is more like an ester or acid.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is an acyl chloride, but the IR would show a sharp peak around 1800, which isn't present here.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a benzaldehyde, but the NMR doesn't show the aldehyde peak in the correct region.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach it differently.

If the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a halogenation reaction. Red phosphorus is sometimes used in the substitution of hydrogen with iodine, especially in aromatic compounds.

But the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative. Adding iodine would require a directing group. Benzoic acid is meta directing, so if the substituent is para, maybe another substituent would be added in the meta position.

Wait, but the starting material has a substituent in the para position (the sec-butyl group and the COOH group), so perhaps adding another substituent.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is adding iodide to a position on the benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group that gets converted into an amine.

Wait, but I don't see any nitrile in the IR. The 1720 cm-1 is more likely a carbonyl.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis. If the substituent is an ester, then HI (acid) might hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. But the starting material is already a carboxylic acid, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Suppose the starting material is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Reaction with red phosphorus and HI: what would that do? Well, red phosphorus in presence of HI can be a reducing agent. For example, it can reduce nitriles to amines, but if there's no nitrile, then maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: the starting material has a benzoic acid group and a sec-butyl group. Maybe the reaction converts the benzoic acid into a benzamide or something else, but I don't see the purpose.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the benzene ring, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a nitro group which is reduced to an amine. But the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is introducing iodide into the molecule. For example, if the starting material has a hydrogen that can be replaced by iodide, such as in an alkyl halide formation.

But the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is an alkyl chain. Reacting with HI could lead to an alkylation. But how?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a leaving group, like a bromide, and HI is a nucleophile, but there's no indication of a leaving group in the starting material.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material has a double bond that undergoes addition. Oh, wait, the IR has a peak at 1610 cm-1 which is around where a C=C stretch would be. So the substituent might have a double bond.

Wait, in the NMR, the aromatic region is at 8.0 and 7.2, but if the substituent has a double bond, maybe it's a vinyl group. So perhaps the substituent is a propenoic acid group.

But I don't see any vinyl protons in the NMR data. The 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which could be an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to re-examine the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

When treated with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH is converted into a COOR (ester) or something else. But I don't see how HI and red phosphorus would do that.

Alternatively, maybe the COOH group is decarboxylated. But under what conditions? Decarboxylation typically requires heat or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is converted into an acid chloride, but again, that's not matching the reagents.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the reaction: red phosphorus and HI. I think that's used in the Hinsberg reaction, but that's for sulfonamides. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to introduce iodide into the molecule.

Wait, the Hinsberg reaction is when a sulfonamide reacts with benzene sulfonyl chloride and KOH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. If the substituent has a good leaving group, HI could substitute it with iodide.

But in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, there's no leaving group attached to the substituent. So unless the substituent is something else.

Wait, another angle: maybe the substituent is a benzyl ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it into a carboxylic acid. But the starting material is already a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile, which gets converted into an amine. But no nitrile in the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not on the substituent but on the benzene ring. For example, the substituents are activating or deactivating groups. Benzoic acid is a strong deactivating group, meta-directing. The sec-butyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

So when the reaction occurs, which substituent is more influential in directing the incoming iodide?

But I'm not sure what the reaction is. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an iodination, and the product is a mono-iodinated benzene.

But without knowing exactly what the reaction does, it's hard to determine.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deprotonation and iodide substitution. For example, if the substituent is a tosyl group, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe the reaction is cleaving a double bond. If the substituent has a double bond, red phosphorus and HI could add across it. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are also used in the preparation of alkenes from alcohols, but that's more of a substitution reaction.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a Fries rearrangement, but that involves esters and aromatic rings, and requires a catalyst, typically.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an example of an elimination. If the substituent has a structure that can eliminate, perhaps forming a double bond.

Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, and the reaction conditions are such that it eliminates to form a vinyl group, but that seems unlikely without a good leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is oxidizing the substituent, but I don't see any oxidizing agents here.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I should go back to the question.

The question is to identify the final product after the reaction. So perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with two substituents: a COOH group and a substituent that's a good leaving group, which gets replaced by iodide.

Wait, but looking at the options, all the options are either benzoic acids or toluene derivatives.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions. If the starting material is a di-substituted benzene with a COOH group, perhaps the reaction removes the COOH group and replaces it with a methyl group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a reduction
