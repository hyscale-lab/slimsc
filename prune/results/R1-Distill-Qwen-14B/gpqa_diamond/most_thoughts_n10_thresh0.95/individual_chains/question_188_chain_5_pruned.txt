Okay, so I have this question about a rhombohedral crystal and finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but let me think this through.

Wait, rhombohedral means all the edges are the same length, and all the angles are equal too. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, a rhombohedral crystal system has a cubic lattice but with all edges equal and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So that's the a, b, c lattice parameters? Or wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, right? Because it's like a cube that's been skewed equally in all directions. So yeah, a = b = c = 10 Angstroms.

I remember that the interplanar distance d(hkl) is given by the formula 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) - (hk + kl + lh)/(a² cos²θ), but wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Maybe I should think about the general formula for interplanar distances in a crystal system.

Oh right, the general formula is d = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cosθ )) ), but wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, for a cubic system, the formula is simpler, but since this is rhombohedral, it's a bit more complex.

Wait, for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But rhombohedral is a special case where the angles are not 90 degrees. So the formula should account for the angles between the lattice vectors.

Another approach: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula involving the reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by (h, k, l), and the distance in real space is the reciprocal of the norm in reciprocal space, divided by the volume factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2 hk cosα + 2 hk cosβ + 2 hk cosγ)/(a²), no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is:

d² = (a² b² c²) / [ (h² (b² sin²γ + c² sin²β - 2 b c sinβ sinγ cosα)) + ... ] Hmm, no, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach.

Wait, for a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c and all angles are equal, the formula simplifies. So let me denote a = b = c = a0, and α = β = γ = θ. Then, the interplanar distance formula becomes:

d² = (a0²) / [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cosθ ]

Hmm, that sounds familiar. Let me make sure. Oh yes, for a rhombohedral system, because all edges are equal and angles are equal, the formula simplifies to that expression. So yes, d = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + kl + lh) cosθ )

So in this case, the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. The angle θ is 30 degrees, and a0 is 10 Angstrom.

Plugging in the numbers: numerator is a0 =10. The denominator is sqrt( 1 +1 +1 - 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos30° )

Wait, compute the denominator first. Let's compute the expression inside the square root.

h² + k² + l² = 1 +1 +1 =3.

The second part is 2*(h k + k l + l h) * cos θ. Since each of h, k, l is 1: hk + kl + lh = 1*1 +1*1 +1*1 =3. So 2*3=6. Multiply by cos(30°). Cos(30 degrees) is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 = 5.196.

So the denominator is sqrt(3 -5.196). Wait, wait a second. 3 minus 5.196 is negative. That can't be right because square root of a negative number would make d imaginary, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, did I mess up the formula? Maybe I should double-check the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cosθ. Wait, but in this case, 3 - 6 * cos30 ≈ 3 - 5.196 = -2.196. That's negative, which doesn't make sense because d^2 can't be negative. So something's wrong here.

Hmm. Did I get the formula wrong? Maybe the formula is (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cosγ + kl cosα + lh cosβ) / something. Wait, another approach: perhaps I should recall the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ.

The general formula is 1/d² = (h²/l² + k²/m² + l²/n²) + ... No, wait, that's the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, the formula is given by:

d = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos γ + kl cos β + lh cos α) ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) a² - 2 a² (h k cos γ + k l cos α + l h cos β) ] / (V^2), where V is the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me think again: for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But for a rhombohedral system, the formula incorporates the angles.

Wait, another approach: the Miller indices (hkl) define a plane. The interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector components are (h, k, l), but scaled by factors depending on the crystal system.

In a cubic system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are simply (h, k, l), so the magnitude is sqrt(h² +k² + l²), and d is a over that.

But for a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal vectors are given in terms of the metric tensor. Let me recall that the metric tensor g is a 3x3 matrix where the diagonal elements are a², a², a² (since a=b=c), and the off-diagonal elements are a² cosθ, where θ is the angle between the respective axes (so in this case, all angles are 30°).

So the metric tensor g would be:

[ a²        a² cosθ    a² cosθ ]
[ a² cosθ  a²         a² cosθ ]
[ a² cosθ  a² cosθ    a²       ]

The reciprocal lattice vector components (h*, k*, l*) are given by solving the equation:

h* g_11 + k* g_21 + l* g_31 = 1/a²
h* g_12 + k* g_22 + l* g_32 = 0
h* g_13 + k* g_23 + l* g_33 = 0

Wait, this might be getting too complicated, but perhaps there's a simpler formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Alternatively, using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 hk (1 + cosθ) + 2 hk cosθ )

Wait, that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for d in terms of the unit cell parameters.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for interplanar spacing in terms of the structure factor, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I remember a formula specific to the rhombohedral system. For a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance for planes (hkl) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos θ )

Wait, but earlier when I applied this, I got a negative value under the square root. Oh, because in this case, θ is 30 degrees, so cosθ is about 0.866.

Let me recalculate:

h, k, l are all 1.

So h² + k² + l² = 3.

The term 2*(hk + kl + lh) cosθ: hk is 1, kl is 1, lh is 1, so sum is 3. Multiply by 2: 6. Multiply by cos30: 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 6 *0.866 ≈5.196.

So denominator under sqrt is 3 -5.196 = -2.196. That's negative, which can't be right. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should switch the sign. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos θ )

Wait, but that's what I'm using. Hmm. Getting a negative number, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the formula is not applicable here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me check online in my mind. Oh wait, I can't. Let me think: another approach. In a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). For a rhombohedral system, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cosθ ), but only if the angles are taken into account correctly.

Wait, but in this case, the denominator inside sqrt is negative, which is impossible. So perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is:

d² = (a²)/[ (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cosθ ]

But again, in this case, that would give 3 - 6 * 0.866 ≈3 - 5.196 = -2.196 → d² negative. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the formula is [(h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cosθ ] but with a minus sign, like:

d² = a² / [ (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cosθ ]

But that would still give the denominator negative. So this suggests that my formula is incorrect.

Alternative idea: Maybe in rhombohedral systems, the angles are 60 degrees, but the question says 30 degrees. Hmmm. Or maybe I have the formula sign wrong. Let me think: perhaps the formula is (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + kl + lh) cosθ.

Wait, trying that: 3 + 6 * 0.866 ≈3 +5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863. Then d =10 / 2.863 ≈3.496 Angstrom. That's not any of the options given. The options are around 8.95 to 10.05.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I should use the formula for a general hexagonal system, but no, rhombohedral is a different system.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for d is a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cosθ ), where θ is 180-30=150 degrees, as in a rhombohedral system, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. In a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, say θ. So the formula for d would be:

d² = a² [ (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (h k cosγ + k l cosα + l h cosβ) ] / (a² ( ... )) Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me try looking for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be approached using the volume of the unit cell. The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + 3 cos²θ/2 ), or something like that. Or wait, another formula for volume: V = a³ * sqrt(1 - cosθ)^2 ? Hmm, I'm not confident.

Wait, the volume V for a rhombohedral unit cell is given by V = a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + 3 cos²θ ). Wait, is that right? Alternatively, I think the formula is V = a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + 3 cos²θ )^(1/2) ?

Wait, not sure. Let me see, perhaps the volume can be expressed using the scalar triple product. Since it's a rhombohedral system, the edges are a, a, a, and the angles between each pair of vectors is θ. So the volume is a^3 times the square root of (1 - cosθ)^2 - (cosθ (1 - cosθ) )? Not sure.

Alternatively, the volume for a rhombohedral unit cell is a³ * sqrt(1 + 2 cosθ (cosθ -1 )) ). Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the volume as:

V = a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ
