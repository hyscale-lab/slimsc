--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy it imparts on a nucleus. The question is asking for the energy such that the nucleus's speed is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. Li is lithium, right? So Li with 3 neutrons would be lithium-6 because regular lithium has 3 protons, so 3 + 3 = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic effects become significant. So I'll need to use the relativistic energy equations.

The speed given is 0.96c. That's pretty fast. I think the first step is to find the gamma factor (γ), which is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v = 0.96c.

Calculating that, v²/c² is (0.96)^2 which is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1. So yeah, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy of the nucleus would be the relativistic kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, wait. The energy in particle physics usually refers to the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic. Or sometimes it's just the kinetic. Hmm, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which is typically given as kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should recall that the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, which is mc². The rest mass energy for the nucleus is the mass of the nucleus times c squared. But when they talk about the energy of the collider, it's usually the kinetic energy. Or sometimes the total energy. Hmm. I think for heavy ions, the energy given is the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no. Wait, in accelerator physics, the energy is often stated as the kinetic energy, but sometimes as the total energy. I might need to clarify this. Let's think: the problem says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So the speed relates to the kinetic energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is the total energy, which includes gamma times mc². So let's proceed with both possibilities in mind.

First, let's compute gamma. As I did earlier, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857. Let me compute it more precisely.

0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is m * c². What's the mass of the ^6Li nucleus?

The atomic mass of lithium-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but each u is 1.660539e-27 kg. So m = 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg. Let me compute that.

m = 6 * 1.660539e-27 = approx 9.963234e-27 kg.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the energy in terms of u, since 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c².

So m = 6 u, so m c² = 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV = 5.589 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is 5.589 GeV.

Now, the total energy is gamma times m c², which is 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV. Let's compute that.

3.5714 * 5.589. Let me compute:

3 * 5.589 = 16.767

0.5714 * 5.589 ≈ 5.589 * 0.5 is 2.7945, 5.589 * 0.0714 is approx 0.399. So total approx 3.1935.

Adding to 16.767 gives 16.767 + 3.1935 ≈ 19.9605 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: 3.5714 * 5.589.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 * 0.589 = let's compute 3.5714 * 0.5 = 1.7857, 3.5714 * 0.08 = 0.2857, 3.5714 * 0.009 = 0.03214. Adding these: 1.7857 + 0.2857 = 2.0714, plus 0.03214 is 2.1035. So total 17.857 + 2.1035 = approx 19.9605 GeV.

So total energy E = gamma * m c² ≈ 19.9605 GeV.

But wait, the options are A) 18.475, B) 23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm. 19.96 is closest to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. But let's see if perhaps the energy is given as the kinetic energy, not the total.

Because sometimes, the energy mentioned is the kinetic energy. Let me think about that. The kinetic energy (K) is (gamma - 1) * m c².

So K = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.5714, so gamma minus 1 is 2.5714.

Multiply by m c² of 5.589 GeV: 2.5714 *5.589.

Let me compute that.

2 *5.589 = 11.178.

0.5714 *5.589. Let me compute that.

0.5 *5.589=2.7945.

0.0714 *5.589≈ 0.400.

So 2.7945 + 0.4=3.1945.

Total K = 11.178 +3.1945 = 14.3725 GeV.

But looking at the options, 14.37 isn't present. So perhaps the energy is the total energy, so about 19.96 GeV, which is close to option C, 20.132 GeV.

But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps my calculation for gamma is incorrect.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 = 0.9216 c^2.

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma = 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Let me think again about the mass of the nucleus.

^6Li has a mass of 6.015 atomic mass units (I think I should look up the exact mass, but since this is an approximate calculation, maybe I can use the exact value). Wait, maybe it's more precise to use the exact mass.

Wait, let's see: the exact mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.01508 u.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact mass. Because 6Li's atomic mass is about 6.01508 u. So that would make the rest mass energy more precise.

So m c² = 6.01508 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that:

6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.01508 *931.5 = approx 14.03 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.03 = 5603.03 MeV = 5.60303 GeV.

So m c² is about 5.60303 GeV.

Then gamma is 3.57142857.

So E_total = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.60303 GeV.

Let me compute this.

3 * 5.60303 = 16.80909.

0.57142857 *5.60303.

Wait, 5.60303 * 0.5 = 2.801515.

5.60303 * 0.07142857 ≈ Let's compute 5.60303 * 0.07 = 0.3922121. 5.60303 * 0.00142857 ≈0.008 (approx 0.008). So total around 0.3922121 + 0.008 = 0.4002121.

So 2.801515 + 0.4002121 ≈ 3.201727.

So total E_total = 16.80909 +3.201727 ≈ 20.0108 GeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 20.01 GeV. Now, looking at the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Option D is 21.419, which is higher. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps because I should consider that the energy is the kinetic energy. Let's compute the kinetic energy.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) * m c^2.

Gamma is ~3.5714.

Gamma -1 is ~2.5714.

2.5714 *5.60303 GeV.

Compute:

2 *5.60303=11.20606.

0.5714 *5.60303.

0.5 *5.60303=2.801515.

0.0714 *5.60303≈0.4002.

So 2.801515 +0.4002 =3.2017.

Total K=11.20606 +3.2017=14.40776 GeV.

But that's around 14.4 GeV, which is not among the options. So perhaps the energy is the total energy, which is around 20.01 GeV.

The options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

20.01 is close to option C (20.132), but not exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the mass of ^6Li.

I think the exact mass of ^6Li is about 6.01508 u. So, 6.01508 *931.5 MeV/c².

6 *931.5 is 5589 MeV.

0.01508 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5 =9.315, 0.00508 *931.5= approx 4.726.

So 9.315 +4.726=14.041 MeV.

So total m c² is 5589 +14.041 =5603.041 MeV=5.603041 GeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

E_total =3.57142857 *5.603041 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Multiply 5.603041 by 3.57142857.

Let me write 3.57142857 as 25/7, because 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 5.603041 * (25/7) = (5.603041 *25)/7.

5.603041 *25 = let's calculate:

5 *25 =125, 0.603041 *25=15.076025.

So 125 +15.076025=140.076025.

Divide by 7: 140.076025 /7 = approximately 20.01086 GeV.

So E_total is approximately 20.01086 GeV.

But the options don't have this value. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps my value for the mass is incorrect. Let me check the exact mass of ^6Li.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact atomic mass. Let me see, perhaps the atomic mass of ^6Li is actually 6.01508 u, which is what I used.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is being considered as the mass number times u, without considering binding energy. Wait, no, because the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of its parts. But I think in this context, using the approximate mass as A u is acceptable for such a problem.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the energy in terms of the rest mass of a proton and neutron, rather than the nucleus. But that seems unlikely, since the nucleus is Li-6.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, let's recompute gamma.

v =0.96c.

So v²/c²=0.9216.

1 -v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Alternatively, more precise calculation: let's compute 0.0784 accurately.

But wait, perhaps I can use more precise values.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

beta = v/c = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28.

Wait, but perhaps 0.96^2 is exactly 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216=0.0784, which is 184/2343, but perhaps that's not necessary.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So back to E_total=20.01086 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher.

Hmm. Perhaps I should consider more precise calculations for gamma.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, another approach: compute beta=0.96.

gamma = (1 - beta^2)^(-1/2).

Compute beta^2=0.9216.

1 - beta^2=0.0784.

Compute sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So yes, gamma is 3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should compute the exact value of 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.603041.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.603041.

Let me break it down:

3 *5.603041 =16.809123.

0.57142857 *5.603041.

Let me compute 0.5 *5.603041=2.8015205.

0.07142857 *5.603041.

Compute 5.603041 *0.07=0.39221287.

5.603041 *0.00142857.

0.00142857 is approximately 1/700. So 5.603041 /700 ≈ 0.00800434.

So 0.39221287 +0.00800434≈0.40021721.

So 0.57142857 *5.603041 ≈2.8015205 +0.40021721≈3.2017377.

So total E_total=16.809123 +3.2017377≈20.01086 GeV.

So approximately 20.01086 GeV.

But looking at the options, none exactly match. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher than my calculation.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the mass is not exactly 6 u. Let me think. ^6Li has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. The mass would be the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons minus the binding energy.

Wait, the actual mass of ^6Li is known. Let me look up the approximate value.

Alternatively, I can use the exact mass of ^6Li, which is approximately 6.01508 atomic mass units.

So m =6.01508 u.

So m c²=6.01508 * 931.5 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.01508 *931.5= let's compute.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.00008 *931.5=0.07452.

So 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725, plus 0.07452=14.04702.

So 5589 +14.04702=5603.04702 MeV=5.60304702 GeV.

So E_total=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.60304702 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.60304702.

Let me compute 3*5.60304702 =16.80914106.

0.57142857 *5.60304702.

Hmm. 0.5 *5.60304702 =2.80152351.

0.07142857 *5.60304702.

Compute 5.60304702 *0.07=0.39221329.

5.60304702 *0.00142857= approximately 0.008003.

So total 0.39221329 +0.008003=0.40021629.

So 2.80152351 +0.40021629=3.2017398.

So total E_total=16.80914106 +3.2017398≈20.01088 GeV.

Still about 20.0109 GeV.

Hmm. So why is there a discrepancy between this and the options?

Looking at the options again:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

20.01 is closest to option C (20.132), but let's see if perhaps I made a mistake in considering the energy as the kinetic energy. Because sometimes, RHIC's energy is given as the kinetic energy.

Wait, let's compute the kinetic energy: (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

Multiply by m c²=5.60304702 GeV.

2.57142857 *5.60304702.

Let me compute:

2*5.60304702=11.20609404.

0.57142857 *5.60304702.

0.5 *5.60304702=2.80152351.

0.07142857 *5.60304702≈0.4002172.

So 2.80152351 +0.4002172=3.20174071.

Total K=11.20609404 +3.20174071=14.40783475 GeV.

So about 14.408 GeV. None of the options are near this, except perhaps none, since the options don't have anything around 14 GeV.

So perhaps the given energy is the total energy, which is about 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132.

Wait, maybe I should check if the problem is using the rest mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) instead of the nucleus. Let me think.

Wait, the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons, so it's ^6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass should be based on the nucleus, not individual nucleons.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. Because sometimes in such problems, people approximate the mass as A * (mass of a proton/neutron). But that's not correct, because the actual mass is less due to binding energy. But perhaps the problem expects that approach.

So let's try that.

Assume each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of about 1.007276 u (proton) or 1.008664 u (neutron). So let me compute the average.

But wait, ^6Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total mass would be 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008664) =3*(2.01594) =6.04782 u.

But the actual mass of ^6Li is about 6.01508 u, which is less than 6.04782 u. So using this approximate method would overestimate the mass.

But perhaps the problem expects this approach.

So m=6.04782 u.

m c²=6.04782 *931.5 MeV = ?

Compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.04782 *931.5 = let's compute.

0.04 *931.5=37.26.

0.00782 *931.5≈7.298.

So 37.26 +7.298=44.558.

So m c²=5589 +44.558=5633.558 MeV=5.633558 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.57142857.

E_total=3.57142857 *5.633558 GeV.

Compute 3 *5.633558=16.900674.

0.57142857 *5.633558.

0.5 *5.633558=2.816779.

0.07142857 *5.633558≈0.405 (approx 0.405).

So approximately 2.816779 +0.405=3.221779.

So total E_total≈16.900674 +3.221779≈20.12245 GeV.

Hmm, that's very close to option C)20.132 GeV.

Ah, so perhaps the problem expects us to use the sum of individual nucleon masses, ignoring binding energy. That would give an E_total of approximately 20.122 GeV, which rounds to 20.132 GeV, matching option C.

So the correct answer would be option C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the ^6Li nucleus is 0.96c, we analyze the relativistic energy equations. The nucleus in question is lithium-6 (^6Li), which has a mass of approximately 6.01508 atomic mass units (u). Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy of the nucleus is:

\[
m c^2 = 6.01508 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 = 5603.04 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60304 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The speed of the nucleus is given as \( v = 0.96c \). The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714.
\]

The total energy of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma \cdot m c^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 3.5714 \cdot 5.60304 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \cdot 5.60304 = 3 \cdot 5.60304 + 0.5714 \cdot 5.60304,
\]

\[
3 \cdot 5.60304 = 16.80912, \quad 0.5714 \cdot 5.60304 \approx 3.20174.
\]

Adding these results:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 16.80912 + 3.20174 \approx 20.01086 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This value is very close to the provided option \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \). The slight discrepancy may arise from approximations in the mass of the nucleus or the use of averaged nucleon masses instead of the exact nuclear mass. Thus, the closest match to the calculated energy is:

**Answer: C**
