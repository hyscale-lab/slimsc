Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but let me try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in a specific region of the sky. It says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. Hmm, parallax is something related to distance, right? Oh yeah, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the object is far away, and vice versa. Like, plx = 1/distance (but in some units I guess).

Wait, the number of stars in the region depends on 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But I need to find how the number changes with distance. So I should express this in terms of distance, not parallax.

Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, plx = k * (1/r), where k is some constant. So plx = 1/(r * some constant). But maybe I can just write plx = 1/r for simplicity, because the exact constant might not matter for the proportionality.

So, substituting plx in terms of r: N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me calculate that exponent. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Wait, but wait a second. Because the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, so we're looking for the number of stars per unit distance, maybe the differential number?

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of density. Let's think about the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr. The number would be proportional to r squared times dr, but that's in a spherical shell. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says in a specific region of the sky, so maybe it's not a spherical shell but something else. Hmm, perhaps it's a volume along the line of sight?

Wait, parallax is related to distance, but in astronomy, the number of stars you can see in a certain direction depends on the volume of space you're looking into. Because more distant regions have a larger volume, so more stars, assuming a uniform distribution.

Wait, the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume. So if I have a certain area on the sky (like a specific region), and I look along the line of sight, the volume accessible at a distance r is a sort of cylinder or something? Or perhaps a rectangular prism with some area?

Alternatively, for a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars in a thin shell (or a thin layer) at distance r would be proportional to the area of that shell (since the area on the sky is fixed) times the thickness in terms of distance, but adjusted for how the distance relates to the angle.

Wait, maybe I should think about flux or density. Let me think again. The number of stars as a function of parallax is given, and I need to find how it scales with distance.

Given that N ∝ 1/plx^5. And plx = 1/r (ignoring constants for proportionality), so 1/plx = r. So 1/(plx)^5 = r^5. Therefore, N ∝ r^5.

Wait, that's a big exponent. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance? That seems steep, but maybe in certain conditions.

But wait, if you have more distant regions, the volume increases with r^3. Because volume scales as r^3. Oh, but here the number goes as r^5, which is faster than volume. That's strange. Unless the relationship isn't just about volume but something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a fixed area of the sky as a function of distance. So for a given area, the number of stars you can see at a certain distance depends on the volume of space you're looking into. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 2πr² dr, but that's for all directions. For a specific direction, perhaps it's more like a thin cylinder. Wait, maybe for a specific direction, the volume you can observe up to distance r is (distance) * (area of observation), but that seems simplistic.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to model the number of stars as a function of distance, given the parallax relation.

Given that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/(distance), then N ∝ distance^5. But wait, that's the total number of stars up to that distance. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit distance. So perhaps it's the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, that's a crucial point. If N(r) is the cumulative number of stars up to distance r, then the number per unit distance would be the derivative dN/dr.

So if N(r) ∝ r^5, then dN/dr ∝ 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would increase as r^4.

Wait, but let me check my initial assumption. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So the number of stars in a given region is higher when parallax is smaller, which is when the distance is larger.

So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx=1/r, N= k*(r)^5, where k is a constant.

But how does the number change per unit distance? So if I want the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r, with thickness dr, that would be dN= N(r+dr) - N(r) = k [ (r + dr)^5 - r^5 ].

But for small dr, this is approximately 5 k r^4 dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is proportional to r^4 dr. So as dr is the unit, the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial statement is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So if the parallax is p, then N = k / p^5. Since p = 1/r, N = k r^5.

So the total number of stars up to distance r is proportional to r^5. So the differential number per unit distance is dN/dr = 5k r^4. Hence, per unit distance, the number of stars increases as r^4.

Thus, the correct answer is option C, which is ~ r^4.


To determine how the number of stars changes with distance in a specific region of the sky, we start with the given relationship: the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax \( \text{plx} \) as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \)), we can substitute \( \text{plx} \) in terms of \( r \), yielding \( N \propto r^5 \).

This indicates that the total number of stars up to a distance \( r \) scales as \( r^5 \). However, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, which corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \). This means the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
