Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Let's think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So Radius1 is 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, the question is about luminosity, which I remember relates more to temperature and radius than mass. So maybe the mass part is a red herring, or maybe it's relevant for another part, but let's focus on luminosity first.

The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I think this is where Wien's Law comes in. Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, they must have the same temperature. So T1 = T2. Hmm, that's important.

Wait, but then the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh right, if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and moving away causes redshift. So since Star_2 is moving away (radial velocity positive 700 km/s), its observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted) compared to if it were stationary.

But the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But according to Wien's law, the peak wavelength depends on the star's actual temperature. So if Star_2 is moving, its observed temperature would be different.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again. The stars' actual temperatures are T1 and T2, but because of their velocities, the observed wavelengths are shifted. The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So, the observed wavelength λ_obs for each star is the same.

So, for Star_1, since its radial velocity is zero, λ_obs1 = λ_peak1 (because there's no Doppler shift). For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_peak2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) ) ) or something like that, because of relativistic Doppler effect. Wait, but 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let's compute that.

Wait, speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. 700 is about 0.002333 times the speed of light. So v = 0.002333c. So the Doppler shift formula, for non-relativistic speeds, is approximately λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c). Since Star_2 is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs2 is longer than λ_peak2.

But the problem states that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. Because both have the same observed peak wavelength. So:

λ_peak1 = λ_obs1 (since v1=0)
λ_peak2 * (1 + v2/c) ≈ λ_obs2 = λ_peak1

Wait, but wait. The Doppler shift formula for redshift is usually 1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest. So for Star_2, z is v_r / c, approximately, since v is much less than c.

So, z2 = v2/c = 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333. So 1 + z ≈ 1.002333.

Thus, λ_peak2_observed = λ_peak2 * (1 + z2) = λ_peak1.

So λ_peak2 = λ_peak1 / (1 + z2) ≈ λ_peak1 * (1 - z2) [since 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x]

But wait, if the observed wavelengths are the same, then λ_peak1 (for Star_1) must be equal to λ_peak2_observed. So,

λ_peak1 = λ_peak2 * (1 + z2)

But from Wien's law, λ_peak = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So,

λ_peak1 = b / T1
λ_peak2 = b / T2

So,

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * (1 + z2)
Divide both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + z2)
Multiply both sides by T1 T2,

T2 = T1 (1 + z2)

Which implies T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) 

Wait, that would mean that T2 is higher than T1. But that can't be right, because Star_2 is moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer (since it's redshifted), which would imply a cooler temperature. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me re-express this. Let's denote:

λ_obs1 = λ_peak1 (since v1=0)
λ_obs2 = λ_peak2 * (1 + z2) ≈ λ_peak2 (1 + v2/c)

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_peak1 = λ_peak2 (1 + v2/c)

But from Wien's law, λ_peak = b / T.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v2/c)

Multiply both sides by T1 T2,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c)

Wait, so T2 is greater than T1 by (1 + v2/c). But that would mean that Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. But wait, because Star_2 is moving away, we see it at a longer wavelength (redshift), which would imply it's cooler. So there's a contradiction here.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the Doppler shift direction. Let me think again. If Star_2 is moving away (positive radial velocity), then the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So the observed temperature would be lower. So in the equation, λ_obs2 = λ_peak2 * (1 + z), where z is positive. So the observed λ is longer, implying T_obs2 is lower than T2. Because λ_peak is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, perhaps I should set the observed λ_peak for both stars equal. So Star_1's emitted λ_peak is λ1 = b/T1. Star_2's emitted λ_peak is λ2 = b/T2. But due to Doppler shift, the observed λ2 is λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ1.

So,

λ2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ1

Substituting λ = b/T,

(b/T2) * (1 + v2/c) = (b/T1)

Cancel b,

(1/T2) (1 + v2/c) = 1/T1

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

Which can be written as T1 = T2 * [ 1 / (1 + v2/c) ] ≈ T2 (1 - v2/c ), again since v is small.

So, T1 is less than T2? Wait no, wait. Let's compute with numbers.

v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v2/c: 700/3e5 = 0.0023333.

So,

T1 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.0023333) ≈ T2 * 0.9976667.

So, T1 is a bit less than T2. But wait, that seems odd because Star_1 is at rest, and its observed λ is same as Star_2's which is moving away. Wait, but the observed λ is same, so Star_1's emitted λ is same as Star_2's emitted λ multiplied by (1 + v2/c).

Wait, no. Because Star_2 is moving away, so the observed λ_obs2 is longer than λ_peak2. So for the observed λ_obs2 to be the same as λ_obs1, which is λ_peak1, we have:

λ_peak1 = λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ_peak2 * (1 + v2/c )

So,

λ_peak1 = λ_peak2 * (1 + v2/c )

Which from Wien's law:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Divide both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c )

Multiply both sides by T1 T2,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ T1 * 1.002333

So, T2 is a bit hotter than T1.

So, now, the next part is to find the luminosity ratio. Luminosity as per the Stefan-Boltzmann law is L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, for each star,

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴
L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

So, the ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

And from above, T2 = T1 * 1.002333 approximately.

So let's plug in the numbers.

First, R1 = 1.5 R2 => R1/R2 = 1.5

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) => T2/T1 = 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333

Wait, wait, from earlier, T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c) ?

Wait, no, let me double-check. From the equation:

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) * (1/T2 )

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Yes, that's correct.

So, T2 is T1 multiplied by (1 + v2/c ) ≈ 1.002333 * T1.

So, T2^4 = (1.002333)^4 * T1^4

Now,

L1/L2 = [ (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ] / [ (R2^2) * (1.002333^4 T1^4) ]

Simplify:

= [ (1.5^2) R2^2 * T1^4 ] / [ R2^2 * (1.002333^4) * T1^4 ]

R2^2 and T1^4 terms cancel.

So,

= (1.5)^2 / (1.002333)^4

Compute each part.

1.5 squared is 2.25.

Now, compute (1.002333)^4.

Let me calculate this. Since 1.002333 is approximately 1 + 0.002333.

Using the approximation (1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2)x² for small x.

n=4, x=0.002333.

So,

(1 + 0.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + (4*3/2)(0.002333)^2

= 1 + 0.009332 + (6)(0.000005442)

= 1.009332 + 0.00003265 ≈ 1.00936465

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009365.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 2.25 by 1.009365.

Let me compute step by step:

1.009365 * 2.23 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to do 2.25 / 1.009365.

Compute 1.009365 * 2.225 = ?

Wait, perhaps approximate.

Compute 1.009365 * 2.225 ≈ 2.225 + (0.009365)*(2.225) 

0.009365 *2 ≈ 0.01873; 0.009365 * 0.225 ≈ 0.002107. So total ~0.0208.

So 2.225 + 0.0208 = 2.2458. Close to 2.25.

Wait, 2.225 * 1.009365 ≈ 2.2458.

But we need 2.25, so 2.225 gives 2.2458, which is slightly less than 2.25.

The difference is 2.25 - 2.2458 = 0.0042.

So, each 0.001 increase in the multiplier would add roughly 1.009365 * 0.001 ≈ 0.001009365 to the product.

We need to find how much more beyond 2.225 (i.e., 2.225 + x) we need to reach 2.25.

So, 2.2458 + 0.001009365 * x = 2.25.

0.001009365 x = 0.0042.

x ≈ 0.0042 / 0.001009365 ≈ 4.16.

So, x is approximately 4.16 * 0.001 = 0.00416.

So, the multiplier would be 2.225 + 0.00416 ≈ 2.22916.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.229 approximately.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, 2.229 is closest to option D, which is ~2.23. But wait, maybe my approximation for (1.002333)^4 was a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is better computed.

Let me compute (1.002333)^4 more accurately.

Compute 1.002333^4.

First, 1.002333^2 = (approx.)

1.002333 * 1.002333.

Compute:

1 * 1 = 1

1 * 0.002333 = 0.002333

0.002333 *1 = 0.002333

0.002333 * 0.002333 ≈ 5.44e-6.

So,

= 1 + 0.002333 + 0.002333 + 5.44e-6

= 1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 1.00467144.

Now, square that again to get to the fourth power.

(1.00467144)^2.

Compute:

1 * 1 = 1

1 * 0.00467144 = 0.00467144

0.00467144 * 1 = 0.00467144

0.00467144 * 0.00467144 ≈ (0.00467)^2 ≈ 2.18e-5.

Adding these:

1 + 0.00467144 + 0.00467144 + 0.0000218 ≈ 1.00936468.

So, (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00936468.

So, L1/L2 = (2.25) / 1.00936468 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 1.00936468:

Let me compute 1.00936468 * 2.23.

2.23 * 1 = 2.23

2.23 * 0.00936468 ≈ 0.020874.

So, total ≈ 2.23 + 0.020874 ≈ 2.250874.

Wait, that's more than 2.25. So 2.23 * 1.00936468 ≈ 2.250874, which is a bit more than 2.25.

Wait, but we need 2.25 / 1.00936468 = x.

So, x = 2.25 / 1.00936468.

Wait, since 2.23 * 1.00936468 ≈ 2.25087, which is just a bit above 2.25.

So, 2.23 * 1.00936468 ≈ 2.25087.

We need 2.25 / 1.00936468 = x.

So, x ≈ 2.23 minus a tiny bit.

Alternatively, let me compute 2.25 / 1.00936468.

Using division:

Divide 2.25 by 1.00936468.

We can approximate.

We know that 1.00936468 = 1 + 0.00936468.

So,

(2.25) / (1 + 0.00936468) ≈ 2.25 * (1 - 0.00936468 + (0.00936468)^2 - ... )

But for small x, 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x + x².

So,

≈ 2.25 * (1 - 0.00936468 + (0.00936468)^2 )

Compute term by term:

x = 0.00936468.

x² ≈ (0.00936468)^2 ≈ 0.0000877.

So,

≈ 2.25 * (1 - 0.00936468 + 0.0000877 )

= 2.25 * (0.99064532 + 0.0000877 )

= 2.25 * 0.990733.

Compute 2.25 * 0.990733.

= 2.25 * (1 - 0.009267) ≈ 2.25 - (2.25 * 0.009267 )

Compute 2.25 * 0.009267 ≈ 0.02085.

So,

≈ 2.25 - 0.02085 ≈ 2.22915.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.229.

So around 2.229, which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. The options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.229 is about 2.23, so option D.

But wait, earlier when I thought about the ratio, I had:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, no, because L1 is proportional to R^2 T^4.

But from earlier, T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c), so T1 = T2/(1 + v2/c).

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express that.

Wait, wait, from earlier, T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c ), so T1 = T2/(1 + v2/c ). 

So, T1 = T2 / (1.002333) ≈ 0.997667 T2.

So, (T1/T2) = 1/(1.002333) ≈ 0.997667.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.997667)^4.

Compute that:

(0.997667)^2 = approx (1 - 0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 0.995334 - 0.00000544 ≈ 0.9953285.

Then, square that again:

(0.9953285)^2 ≈ (1 - 0.0046715)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0046715 + (0.0046715)^2 ≈ 0.990656 - 0.0000218 ≈ 0.990634.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.990634.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4

R1/R2 = 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

(2.25) * 0.990634 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990634 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 * 0.990634.

= 2 * 0.990634 = 1.981268

0.25 * 0.990634 = 0.2476585

Sum: 1.981268 + 0.2476585 = 2.2289265.

So, approximately 2.2289, which is about 2.23.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D, approximately 2.23.


To determine the luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) of the two stars, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity of a star is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The given data is as follows:

1. **Radius Ratio**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( R_1 / R_2 = 1.5 \).
2. **Temperature Ratio**: From the problem, the observed peak wavelengths of the two stars are the same. Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{peak}} = b / T \)), the temperature ratio can be determined. For Star_2, the observed wavelength is redshifted due to its radial velocity (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)), so:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_2 / c),
   \]
   where \( c \) is the speed of light. Substituting \( v_2 / c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333 \), we find:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333.
   \]
   Thus, \( T_1 / T_2 = 1 / 1.002333 \approx 0.997667 \).

3. **Luminosity Ratio**: Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4.
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 / R_2 = 1.5 \) and \( T_1 / T_2 = 0.997667 \):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.997667)^4.
   \]

4. **Calculations**:
   - \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \),
   - \( (0.997667)^4 \approx 0.990634 \) (using the approximation \( (1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x \) for small \( x \)),
   - \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.990634 \approx 2.2289 \).

Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \( 2.23 \) times greater than that of Star_2.

**Answer: D**
