Okay, so I've got this question about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Oh wait, and X is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use Einstein's equations. The energy of a particle in relativity is given by the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes in these problems, they might be asking for the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or maybe just the kinetic part? I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC", which is likely the total energy each ion has when accelerated. RHIC accelerates heavy ions like gold nuclei, but here it's a Li nucleus with 3 neutrons. So X is Li-6, because Li usually has 3 protons and 3 neutrons makes it Li-6. So its mass should be approximately the mass of Li-6.

The speed is 0.96c, so I'll need to find the total energy of the nucleus when moving at this speed. The formula for total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me jot down the equations. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2). So plugging v = 0.96c, that becomes 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me check that calculation. Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m * c². But wait, what's the rest mass of the Li nucleus? Li-6 has a mass number A=6. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be approximated. Alternatively, the atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So m = 6 u. Let me compute that.

Wait, but I might need the rest mass energy in GeV. I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy of Li-6 is 6 * 931.5 MeV. Let's compute that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So the rest mass energy (m c²) is 5.589 GeV. Then, the total energy E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.589. Let's go step by step.

First, 3 * 5.589 = 16.767. Then 0.5714 * 5.589. Hmm, 0.5 *5.589 is 2.7945, and 0.0714 *5.589 ≈ 0.4003. So adding those gives 2.7945 + 0.4
