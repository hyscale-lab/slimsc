Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But I'll try to work through it methodically. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, right. So I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed here is Ca-EDTA, and the K is the formation constant, which tells us about the stability of the complex. A high K means the complex is very stable, so the reaction tends to go to completion.

Wait, the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex solution as 0.02 M. But I'm supposed to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because, in a complex like this, the metal ion is bound by EDTA, so the free calcium concentration should be really low, right?

Let me think about the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. So the formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this solution, the complex is already present. So perhaps the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaEDTA²−. But how does that translate to the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-?

I think in this case, the complex dissociates a little into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But because K is so large (5e10), the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

Wait, but wait, when you have a complex in solution, the concentration of the complex is the major component, and the free ions are in much lower concentrations. So the idea is to use the K expression to find the [Ca²+].

Let me set up the equation. Let's denote:

Let’s call the concentration of the complex as C, which is 0.02 M.

The dissociation is: CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

In solution, the concentrations would be:

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x (but since K is large, x is very small, so [CaEDTA²−] ≈ 0.02)

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

So the K expression is K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02 / x².

Wait, because K is 5e10, so 5e10 = 0.02/(x²).

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the K expression. The K should be [complex]/([M][L]), where M is the metal ion and L is the ligand. So yes, K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So substituting in:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x²).

Wait, no, that would be x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-12 → x = sqrt(2e-12) ≈ 4.47e-6 M.

Wait, but none of the options are around 4.5e-6. Let me check the options again.

Options are A) 2e-2, B)5e-3, C)6.3e-7, D)1e-2.

Hmm, none match that. Did I make a mistake in setup?

Wait, maybe I got the K expression wrong. Because sometimes the formation constant is written as Kf = [complex]/([M][L]), but sometimes it's written as the reverse, like when the reaction is M + L ↔ complex. So Kf is the forward rate, so yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Let me think again. If the solution is 0.02 M of CaEDTA²−, then when it dissociates, it produces x of Ca²+ and x of EDTA^4-. So [Ca²+] is x, [EDTA^4-] is x, and [CaEDTA²−] is approximately 0.02. So K = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So 5e10 = 0.02/(x²) → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2. So x² = (2e-2)/(5e10) → 2/5 = 0.4, so 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. Then x is sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5? Wait, no, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2 * 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. Hmm, but 4e-13 is 4*(1e-13), so sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5, which is 2*3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7.

Oh! So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Wait, that's option C.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations.

K = [complex]/([M][L]) → 5e10 = 0.02/(x * x) → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is about 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.

Let me make sure I didn't mix up any exponents. 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 2/(5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5, which is 6.32e-7, as before.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex at 25 °C, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}.
\]

Let the concentration of free calcium ions be \( x \). Since the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K \), the concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M. The concentrations of free calcium and EDTA ions are both \( x \). The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}.
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
