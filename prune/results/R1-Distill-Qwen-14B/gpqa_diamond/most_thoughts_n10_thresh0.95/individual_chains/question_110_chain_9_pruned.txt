Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs. The stars are Star1 through Star5, each with different properties. The spectrographs in question are ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory and HIRES at Keck Observatory. 

First, I remember that the ability of a spectrograph to detect a star depends on the star's brightness, specifically its apparent magnitude. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES have different limits. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can't see much fainter than that. HIRES can go down to 16 mag, so a bit brighter than ESPRESSO.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that would mean it can't observe stars fainter than 17, right? Because if the apparent magnitude is higher than 17, it's too faint for ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can go down to 16, so it can't observe stars fainter than 16 mag. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude <=16 to be detected by HIRES, and <=17 for ESPRESSO.

But wait, the question is about stars that can be detected by both. So the star's apparent V mag must be bright enough for both. So the star's V mag must be less than or equal to 16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16.5, because anything above 16 would be too faint for HIRES. Wait, wait. Let me read the question again.

Ah, the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star's V mag is brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can observe it. That is, V <17. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V <16.

So for a star to be detected by both, its V mag must be <16. Because HIRES can't detect V >=16, but ESPRESSO can. Wait, that's not right. Let me think again. 

ESPRESSO: V mag brighter than 17 â†’ V <17. So it
