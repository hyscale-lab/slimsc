Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how it's being observed. The idea is that when a star is spotted, it can mimic the presence of an exoplanet in terms of brightness variations, and the question is asking about the radius of such a planet that would produce the same signal.

Alright, let's start by parsing the given information. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so R_star is about 1 solar radius. The effective temperature is 6000K, which is a bit cooler than the Sun's 5778K, but not by much. Half of the star's surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, so the spots take up 20% of that hemisphere. Wait, no, actually, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. So if the hemisphere is spotty, then the total spot area is 20% of the entire star's surface? Or just of the hemisphere? Hmm, I think the filling factor refers to the entire surface. So 20% of the entire star's surface is covered in spots. But only one hemisphere is spotty, meaning the spots are on one side. Wait, no, the question says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Oh, so the entire hemisphere (which is half the star's surface) has spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. So the total spotty area is 0.2 * (π R²) * (1/2) since it's a hemisphere. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4π R². One hemisphere is half that, 2π R². The filling factor is 20%, so spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But wait, the effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spot's temperature is either 5000K or 7000K? Wait, the question says a temperature difference of 1000K. So if the star's Teff is 6000K, the spots are either 5000K or 7000K. But I think dark spots would be cooler because they're usually sunspots. So I guess the spots are 5000K.

So the problem is about the brightness variation as the star rotates. When the star is viewed from Earth, the spots will come into and out of view as it rotates, causing dips in the brightness. Similarly, an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would cause a dip in brightness proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star.

But the question is, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spot-induced variation? So I need to compare the variation caused by the spots to the variation caused by a planet transit.

First, I'll calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots. The star's total brightness, without spots, would be L = 4π R² σ T^4. But with spots, part of the surface is cooler. The spots have area A_spots and temperature T_spot. The rest of the star's surface (non-spots) has temperature T_star.

Wait, but wait. The star's entire surface emits with an effective temperature, but the spots are at a different temperature. So the total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted areas and the unspotted areas.

The flux from the entire star without spots is L = 4π R² σ T_eff^4. When spots are present, the total flux is:

L_total = (4π R² - A_spots) * σ T_star^4 + A_spots * σ T_spot^4.

Wait, no. Let me
