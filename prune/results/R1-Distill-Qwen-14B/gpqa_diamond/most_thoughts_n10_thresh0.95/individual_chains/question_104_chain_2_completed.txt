Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The radial velocity (RV) method detects these planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble.

The problem gives the shifts in the spectral lines for each planet. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, right. The RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1/(period^(1/3))), but wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

I think the formula is K = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * c, where c is the speed of light. Since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune vs Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the relationship between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period. I remember that for stars with the same mass, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Wait, wait, no, let me get the proportionality right.

The velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ). Since the planet masses and star masses are the same for both systems, the ratio K1/K2 would be inversely proportional to the cube root of the periods ratio.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, then K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)). So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) / (P1/P2)^(1/3))? No, wait. Let's set up the proportionality correctly.

Since K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)), and both stars have the same mass (similar to Sun), and planets have similar masses (Neptune), M_p and M_star are the same for both. So K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )^-1? Wait, no, because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * constant, and K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * same constant. Therefore, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me think again. If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1 = k / P1^(1/3), K2 = k / P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So given that the velocities are K1 =5, K2=7 (because the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms?), wait, is the shift directly proportional to the velocity? I think yes. So the ratio of the velocities is K1/K2 = 5/7.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. The shifts are 5 and 7, so the velocities are proportional to that. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So according to the proportionality, (K1)/(K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Wait, no. Let me re-derive. Let's write the formula correctly.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/c)

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, sin i is approximately 1 for planets (edge-on orbits). So,

K ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ) * (1/c)

But since M_p and M_star are same for both cases, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

Therefore, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait no, because if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So if K1 =5, K2=7, then K1/K2 =5/7.

So (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2 = 5/7

So, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2/P1 ≈ 0.36, so it's shorter. But the options say ~0.36 as option A. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait. Or maybe I got the ratio backwards. Let me double-check.

If K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then if K1 is smaller than K2, that would imply that P1 is larger than P2. Because if K is smaller, 1/P^(1/3) is smaller → P^(1/3) is larger → P is larger.

Wait, let me see. Let's say K1=5, K2=7, so K1 < K2. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), higher K means smaller P.

So K1=5 → P1 = (something) / (5)^3.

K2=7 → P2 = (same something) / (7)^3.

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1. Because P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1. So P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Since 0.36 is less than 1, P2 is 0.36 times P1, meaning it's shorter. So the question is asking for P2's period compared to P1. So it's about 0.36 times as long, which is option A.


The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given that both planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \), which is proportional to the Doppler shift of the spectral lines, is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \). Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Since the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) (given as 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms, respectively) is proportional to the inverse cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for the ratio of orbital periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This result indicates that the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Therefore, Planet #2's orbital period is shorter than Planet #1's by a factor of approximately 0.36.
