--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a bit of a mouthful. I'll need to break it down.

First, I should figure out the structure of the target. So, the target has a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a carbaldehyde group (CHO) and another substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, let me visualize. The substituents are on the cyclohexane ring. So, position 1 has the substituents. The substituents are a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexyl. So, perhaps the structure is where the cyclohexane has a CH2-OH group attached, and that CH2 is connected to another cyclohexane ring. And on the same carbon where the CH2-OH is, there's a carbonyl group (CHO). Wait, no. Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a cyclohexyl group connected to a CH2OH group, and perhaps also a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe it's more like the main ring has a substituent that is a cyclohexyl-CH(OH)-CH2CHO? No, wait. Let me think: the substituent is cyclohexyl (a cyclohexane ring) attached to a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and this is attached to the main cyclohexane at position 1. But wait, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So that's a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl ring, and that methyl has an OH group. So perhaps the structure is the main cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1: -(CH2OH) attached to a cyclohexyl group, and also a carbonyl group (CHO) on the same carbon? Or maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group connected to a CH(OH)CH2CHO group? I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, and this is connected to the main cyclohexane. But then, the main cyclohexane also has a carbonyl group at position 1. Wait, maybe the target is a molecule where the main ring is cyclohexane, and at position 1, there's a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group. And on the same carbon as the substituent, there's a carbonyl group (CHO). So, structure is cyclohexane with a substituent: -(CH2OH)cyclohexyl and a CHO group on the same carbon. No, that might not add up. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzannulated structure, but not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the synthesis steps. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (a triple bond attached) – so it's cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So, the starting point is a sp-hybridized carbon attached to cyclohexane.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring, and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group connected to a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and this substituent is on the same carbon as a carbonyl group (CHO). Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH group and a CHO group attached to the main cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the target is a molecule where there's a cyclohexane ring, and on that ring, there's a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH)CH2 group, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the possible reactions that can be done on ethynylcyclohexane to get to the target.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the same carbon as a carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the target is made by adding a substituent and oxidizing a certain part.

Let me think about the steps. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne. So, perhaps the first step is to perform some kind of alkyne reaction. One common reaction for terminal alkynes is deprotonation to form a strong base, then alkylation. For example, using NaNH2 (sodium amide) as a base. That would deprotonate the ethynyl group, making it a strong nucleophile.

So, if we take ethynylcyclohexane and treat it with NaNH2, it would deprotonate the alkyne to form a cyclohexyl acetylide. Then, perhaps an alkylation step. The options include methyl chloride and ethyl chloride. If we use methyl chloride, the acetylide would attack, adding a methyl group. So, after alkylation, we would get a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2CH3 group? Or wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives cyclohexyl acetylide (Na+ [C≡C-] cyclohexyl). Then, treating with methyl chloride would lead to substitution: the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C- something? Or wait, perhaps the acetylide is at the end, so after alkylation, the structure becomes cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, the acetylide is at the cyclohexane end. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C- would attack CH3Cl, resulting in cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, wait, maybe it's a substitution: the acetylide has a strong negative charge at the carbon. So, CH3Cl would undergo an SN2-like reaction, replacing Cl with the acetylide. So, the product would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, that would be 1-propynylcyclohexane? No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group to the acetylide, making the product more substituted.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonation of the alkyne to form the acetylide, then alkylation with an alkyl halide. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexyl acetylide. Then, adding methyl chloride would give cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C- ? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: the starting material is cyclohexane ring connected to a triple bond (C≡CH). Deprotonate to form cyclohexyl acetylide (C≡C-). When you add methyl chloride, the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, making cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, the product after step 1 is 1-propynylcyclohexane? Or perhaps it's (cyclohexyl)acetylene, which is more substituted.

Wait, but if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH), then deprotonating with NaNH2 gives the acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+). Then, when methyl chloride is added, the acetylide attacks the methyl group, leading to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, the product after step 1 and 2 would be a longer alkyne.

But looking at the options, the first steps in each option vary. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, but after step 1 and 2, what happens? Step 2 is H2 with Pd, which is hydrogenation. So, if after step 1, we have an alkyne, hydrogenation would give an alkane. So, step 2 would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH3.

Then, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe it's for elimination or for oxidation. Then, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like a Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids (or ketones if secondary). But wait, I'm not sure.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/H2O; 4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane, giving acetylide. Then, ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group, making cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, step 2 is Li in liq NH3, which is for elimination reactions, perhaps dehydrohalogenation or deprotonation. But what would that do? Wait, another thought: Li in NH3 is used for Birch reductions or for elimination, like in the formation of alkenes from dihalides via dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for deprotonating something else.

Wait, after adding the ethyl group, the molecule is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see a halide. Alternatively, maybe it's a lithium amide reaction for alkyne addition. Not sure. Then step 3 is ozonolysis with O3, which cleaves double bonds. So, maybe an alkene is formed before ozonolysis. So after step 2, maybe the alkyne is converted into an alkene. How? Using Li and NH3 might not do that. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated in a different way. Wait, but step 2 in option B is Li in liq NH3. Oh wait, maybe it's a reduction? No, Li in NH3 is more about elimination. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the overall target. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group, and that's on the same carbon as a CHO group. So, the substituent is CH2OH attached to cyclohexyl, and that's on the main ring. Also, there's a CHO group on the same carbon as that substituent. So, that would require adding both an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group connected to a cyclohexyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-CHOH-CHO group. Hmm, not sure.

Another approach: the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, perhaps the alkyne can be functionalized to add substituents. For example, adding a methyl group via alkylation to make a longer alkyne. Then, hydrogenating the alkyne to an alkane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group to a hydroxyl group, and another group which is a carbonyl.

So, perhaps the process is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkyne functionalization (add substituents).
2. Then, hydrogenation to form a single bond.
3. Maybe oxidation steps to form the aldehyde and introduce the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. Ozonolysis of an alkyne would not do that; ozonolysis is for alkenes. Hydrogenation of the alkyne would give an alkane.

Wait, perhaps after adding a substituent, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, then further reactions.

Another angle: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH. So, perhaps that substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction or some kind of alkylation.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate to acetylide, then alkylate with methyl chloride to make a longer alkyne.

Then, hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond (alkane), which would give a cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group attached. Then, perhaps perform some kind of oxidation or functionalization to add the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups.

Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule is treated to form an epoxide or undergo some dihydroxylation, but I'm not sure.

Let me look at the options again.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

So, step 1: acetylide formation, then methyl chloride adds a methyl group, making the alkyne longer. Step 2: H2 with Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond. So, turning the alkyne into an alkane. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Then, step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if the molecule after step 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it. But in this case, after step 2, we have an alkane. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Unless the hydrogenation step is not complete or involves something else.

Wait, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation but under different conditions. Oh wait, in some cases, hydrogenation of alkynes can give cis or trans alkenes if done under specific conditions. Oh, right, hydrogenation of an alkyne can be stopped at the alkene stage using a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst (which would give cis addition) or using Na/NH3 (which would give trans). But in option C, the catalyst is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd is usually for full hydrogenation to the alkane. So, in step 2, the alkyne becomes an alkane.

Then step 3: Ozonolysis. But if the molecule is now an alkane, ozonolysis won't affect it. So maybe that's not the case. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Option D: Steps 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Step 1: Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2, then treat with methanol. Wait, but methanol is a methylating agent? Or perhaps it's a solvent. Alternatively, NaNH2 and methanol might form something else. Hmm, not sure. Then step 2 is Li in liq NH3. That's a strong base, used for elimination or deprotonation. Then ozonolysis and workup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Let me think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, and that's on the same carbon as a CHO group. So, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH group attached to the main ring, and the same carbon has a CHO group. So, that would imply the substituent is a CH2OH group attached to a cyclohexyl group, and a CHO group on the same carbon as the CH2OH. Wait, that doesn't make sense because each carbon can only have four bonds. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH(OH) group attached to a cyclohexyl and a CHO.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the substituent as a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is then attached to a carbonyl group (CHO) and a hydroxyl group (OH). So, the substituent is CH2(OH) attached to cyclohexyl, and also a CHO on the same carbon, but that's not possible because a carbon can't have two substituents beyond four bonds. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH group, and the main ring's carbon is also bonded to a carbonyl group (CHO). So, the substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(CH2OH) group, and the main ring has a CHO group on the same carbon. So, the structure would be cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1: a CH2OH group attached to a cyclohexyl, and the same carbon (position 1) has a CHO group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CHO group. But that would imply a geminal diol and a carbonyl, which might not be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-CHOH-CHO group. Wait, but that may not be feasible as well.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this by considering each option's steps and see which could logically lead to the target.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide → methylated to give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2/Pd hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, so cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Step 3: Ba(OH)2—maybe for elimination, forming an alkene. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can induce elimination reactions. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 → upon dehydrohalogenation (but where's the halide?), maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could cause oxidation. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is also used in the oxidation of alcohols, but that's more in the context of secondary alcohols. Alternatively, perhaps it's for epoxide opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, after step 2, the molecule is a straight chain alkane. If in step 3, Ba(OH)2 is used, perhaps it's for epoxidation, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used to form a diol through some pathway. Hmm.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's a Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. But to do that, there must be an alcohol present. So, maybe step 3 is introducing an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, step 3 with Ba(OH)2 could cause some kind of cleavage or reaction. Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used in a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that usually involves ketones and introduces oxygen, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's look at option D.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps deprotonating the ethynyl group to form the acetylide. Then, methanol could be a methylating agent. So, the acetylide attacks methyl chloride in some cases, but here it's methanol. Maybe the acetylide would attack a methyl group from methanol? Wait, methanol is a poor methylating agent; it's more a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps the methanol is used for something else.

Alternatively, the first step could be deprotonation to form the acetylide, then quenching with methanol. But I'm not sure what that would do. Acetylide plus methanol might form a methyl group addition. So, maybe the product after step 1 is cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with methanol to form a ketone. Wait, no, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is just deprotonation, and then methanol is added as a nucleophile. So the acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^-) would attack methyl groups from methanol, but methanol isn't a good methylating agent. So maybe nothing happens, but that's unlikely.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group on the same carbon. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2-CHOH-CH2-CHO structure, but that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to both a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group. So, the substituent is a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH group, and the same carbon has a CHO group. But that would require the carbon to have four bonds: cyclohexyl, two CH2 groups, and another group. Wait, maybe it's a geminal diol situation, but that's typically for adjacent oxygens.

Another approach: think of how to introduce the aldehyde group. Aldehydes can be formed via oxidation of alcohols, or via the oxidation of alkyl groups, or via the Stephen reduction, or via the Tishchenko reaction. Alternatively, maybe via a ketone and then further reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe after forming the appropriate alcohol, I can oxidize it to an aldehyde. But aldehydes are difficult to oxidize further, so maybe I can form the aldehyde via some kind of elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via ozonolysis of a double bond.

Wait, considering option C: step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis with a reductive workup (like using dimethyl sulfide) would cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if after step 2, we have a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. So, after step 2, the molecule is a straight-chain alkane, which doesn't have double bonds. So ozonolysis in step 3 wouldn't do anything. So, perhaps that's not the right path.

Option B: step 3 is O3/H2O, which is oxidative cleavage. So, if there's a double bond, that would break it into carbonyl groups. But in option B, step 2 is Li in liq NH3. Maybe that step forms a double bond via elimination.

So, let's think: starting with ethynylcyclohexane, step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. That would add an ethyl group, making cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2 is Li in liq NH3. Li in ammonia is often used for Birch reductions or for elimination. So, perhaps the triple bond is treated with Li to form a double bond. Wait, but Li and ammonia can also deprotonate things, but in this case, maybe it's used for dehydrohalogenation, but where's the halide?

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a reduction. Wait, Li in NH3 is sometimes used as a reducing agent for certain functional groups, like nitro groups, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation, leading to an alkyne with a lithium species, but I'm not certain.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck. Let's think of the possible target structure again. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a carbonyl (CHO) group. So, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CHO group.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply a geminal diol (if there's an OH and CHO on the same carbon, which isn't possible without a double bond or some other structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group, which is connected to both an OH and a CHO group. So, the substituent would be -CH2-OH and -CH2-CHO on the same carbon, but that's not possible because a carbon can't have five bonds.

So, perhaps the substituent is such that the same carbon has both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, and the adjacent carbon has a carbonyl group. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is a molecule where the cyclohexane ring has a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-CHOH-CHO group. But that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group, which is then attached to both a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group. But again, that's not possible in the same carbon.

I think I'm stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think of the possible reagents and what they do.

Looking at each option's reagents:

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride → H2/Pd → Ba(OH)2 → H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide → methylated to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate alkyne to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Maybe elimination to form a double bond. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2- with elimination, but wait, that would require a leaving group. Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is for oxidation. Maybe this step forms a ketone or an alcohol.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It could cause elimination if there's a suitable leaving group. But after step 2, we have a straight chain alkane, which doesn't have leaving groups. So, maybe this isn't the right path.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride → Li/liq NH3 → O3/H2O → NH4OH.

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide → ethylated to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3. Maybe this is for elimination, forming a double bond. So, the alkyne becomes an alkene. But how? Li in NH3 is a strong base and can cause dehydrohalogenation, but without a halide, perhaps it's used for reduction?

Wait, another thought: maybe the Li in NH3 is a method for deprotonating the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide, which could then undergo some reaction like cyclopropanation or insertion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enolate or something else.

Step 3: Ozonolysis. So, if the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyls. Then, step 4: NH4OH (which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reductive workup after ozonolysis). So, if the molecule after step 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Putting it together:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → after step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Step 2: treatment with Li in liq NH3. Maybe this converts the alkyne into an alkene via a mechanism. For example, using a lithium reagent to insert into the triple bond, forming an alkene. But I'm not exactly sure about that.

Assuming that step 2 forms an alkene, then step 3 would cleave it into carbonyls.

So, if after step 2 we have cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. Then, step 4: treatment with NH4OH would perhaps reduce any ozonides to aldehydes or ketones.

But I'm not sure how that leads to the target molecule. Maybe I'm getting off track.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol → Li/liq NH3 → O3/(CH3)2S → NH4OH.

Step 1: Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2, then treat with methanol. Maybe this adds a methyl group via alkylation. So, the product is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3. Maybe for elimination, forming an alkene. So, the alkyne becomes an alkene.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. This would cleave the double bond into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH. This is a mild base, perhaps for workup or for reducing any ozonides.

So, after ozonolysis, the molecule would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. Then, perhaps further reactions to form the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not exactly sure how this would form the cyclohexyl substituent with both a hydroxyl and aldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider each option's step counts and see which makes more sense.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has both a cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde group. So, perhaps a Friedel-Crafts alkylation isn't possible because cyclohexane is a saturated ring and doesn't undergo electrophilic substitution. So, maybe the substituent is added via some kind of coupling reaction or via forming a ring structure.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. But the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is an alkyne. So, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a structure where the main ring is cyclohexane, and the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2OH group, and also a CHO group on the same carbon. So, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH)CHO group.

But that's not possible because a carbon can't have more than four bonds. So, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group, which is also attached to a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-OH and cyclohexyl-CH2-CHO on the same carbon, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group, and the same carbon has a CHO group. So, the substituent is CH2-OH and CHO on the same carbon, which is attached to the cyclohexyl. That would require the carbon to have four bonds: cyclohexyl, CH2-OH, CHO, and the main ring. But that's five bonds, which is impossible. So, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group connected to a CH(OH)CH2-CHO group, but that seems unlikely.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the reagents.

Looking for steps that would introduce an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl.

Option D: After step 3, ozonolysis would cleave a double bond to form carbonyls. Step 4 is NH4OH, which is a reductive workup. So, if the ozonolysis breaks a double bond into two aldehydes, then treatment with NH4OH would perhaps lead to the formation of carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure. Another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2OH and a CHO. So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol, which itself is formed via some reduction or addition.

Wait, another possible pathway:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate with NaNH2 → acetylide.

2. Alkylation with methyl chloride → longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate alkyne to alkane.

4. Introduce a double bond via Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysed to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

- Add a methyl group via alkylation of the acetylide.

- Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

- Perform some kind of oxidation to introduce a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Looking at option C, step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. So, if there's a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls.

But in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd, which hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkane, so no double bond. So, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So, option C is unlikely.

Option B: Step 2 is Li in liq NH3, which could be for elimination, forming a double bond from an alkyne. For example, treatment of a terminal alkyne with Li in NH3 can form an alkene. So, ethynylcyclohexane → after step 1 (add ethyl group) becomes a longer alkyne. Then, step 2 forms an alkene.

Then, step 3 ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, the molecule would now have two carbonyl groups. Then, step 4, NH4OH (which is a weak base) would perhaps form the aldehyde from the carbonyl.

But I'm not sure how this would introduce the cyclohexyl group and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes both a cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde. So, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2CHO group. But then, where does the hydroxymethyl come from?

Hmm. Another approach: think about each reagent's purpose.

The target has an aldehyde group, which can be formed via oxidation of an alcohol or via the Stephen reduction. Also, the cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH suggests that perhaps a Grignard or similar reaction is involved, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the steps are as follows:

1. Make a longer alkyne by alkylation.

2. Hydrogenate it to an alkane.

3. Introduce a double bond via elimination (using a strong base like Ba(OH)2).

4. Ozonolyze the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

5. Reduce or oxidize to form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl groups.

But I'm not sure which option does that.

Looking at option A: step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Maybe Ba(OH)2 induces elimination, forming a double bond. So, after step 2, the molecule is a straight-chain alkane. Then, Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination, forming a double bond. But without a leaving group, how would that happen?

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is also used in the oxidation of alcohols. If the molecule after step 2 is a secondary alcohol, Ba(OH)2 could oxidize it to a ketone. But how would the alcohol be introduced in step 2?

Hmm. Maybe I'm getting stuck and should make an educated guess based on the reagents.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2OH and also a CHO group. So, perhaps the CHO is formed from an aldehyde, which is formed by oxidation of an alcohol. So, perhaps in the steps, after forming the appropriate structure, an alcohol is oxidized to a carbonyl.

Looking at the options, option C has ozonolysis, which forms carbonyl groups. So, if the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. Then, perhaps one of those carbonyls is an aldehyde.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, option D's steps involve ozonolysis as well. Let's think about the number of steps.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with substituents that require adding groups. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane with a triple bond.

Option C's steps: after adding a methyl group, hydrogenate to alkane, then ozonolysis. Ozonolysis wouldn't do anything without a double bond, so I think option C is unlikely.

Option D: after adding a methyl group, Li in NH3, then ozonolysis. Maybe step 2 forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option D is deprotonation to form a lithium acetylide, which is then treated with something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for the presence of a Grignard reagent or a similar step that can form alcohols or carbonyls.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the target is formed via a cyclopropanation or some ring-forming reaction, but I don't see any reagents that suggest that.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should go with the option that includes ozonolysis followed by something that forms an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group.

Option B: step 3 is O3/H2O (which would give ketones or carboxylic acids, depending on the starting alkene), and step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild base. So, perhaps the ozonolysis produces carbonyls, and NH4OH is used to reduce any possible ketones or to form aldehydes.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, where after ozonolysis, the molecule has two carbonyls, and NH4OH is used to form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not confident.

Another approach: Let me think of the target molecule. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, there's a substituent. The substituent is a cyclohexyl group connected to a CH2OH group, and that same carbon (on the main ring) has a carbonyl group (CHO).

So, the substituent is a CH2OH group attached to a cyclohexyl, and that substituent is on the main ring's carbon which also has a CHO.

So, the substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(CH2OH) attached to the main ring's carbon, which also has a CHO.

Wait, but that would require the substituent to be a CH2OH group attached to a cyclohexyl, and the same carbon on the main ring has a CHO group. But that would mean the main ring's carbon has four bonds: two from the cyclohexane ring, one to the substituent (CH2OH-cyclohexyl), and one to the CHO group. That's only four bonds, which is possible.

So, the substituent is a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH group, and the main ring's carbon has a CHO group as well.

So, the substituent is -(cyclohexyl-CH2-OH), and the main ring's carbon has a CHO group.

So, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH to the main ring's carbon, which also has a CHO group.

So, to form that, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized to have a CH2-OH group attached to a cyclohexyl, and then the main ring's carbon is oxidized to form the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, which can then be used to form the aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then oxidized to a carboxylic acid, but that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, and then via dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol, which can then be oxidized to form a carbonyl group.

But I'm not sure how that would fit into the options.

Looking back at the options, the only ones that include ozonolysis are options B, C, and D. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps the correct pathway involves forming a double bond, then ozonolysis to form carbonyls, which can then be worked up to form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl groups.

In option B, after step 2 (Li in NH3), if the alkyne is converted into an alkene, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. Then, step 4 (NH4OH) would perhaps reduce the ozonide to aldehydes.

So, if the molecule after step 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups. Then, the workup would form aldehydes, which could contribute to the target's structure.

But how does the cyclohexyl group and the hydroxymethyl group come into play?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is extended, then hydrogenated to an alkene, which upon ozonolysis forms two carbonyls. One of them becomes the aldehyde, and the other could form the hydroxymethyl group somehow.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, one carbonyl is a ketone and the other is an aldehyde. Then, the aldehyde is retained, and the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol, which then could be oxidized to a ketone again or converted into something else.

Hmm. Not sure.

Another approach: The target has two cyclohexane rings. The substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2OH and the main ring has a CHO. So, perhaps the process involves forming a bridge or a side chain with the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate → acetylide.

2. Alkylation with methyl chloride → longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate to alkane.

4. Introduce a double bond via Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to form a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis to form two carbonyls.

But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The correct sequence likely involves forming an alkyne, then adding a methyl group, hydrogenating to an alkane, introducing a double bond via elimination, ozonolysis to form carbonyls, and finally working up to form the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

Looking at the options, option C includes ozonolysis but after hydrogenation, which would not have a double bond. So, it's unlikely.

Option B involves ozonolysis after a possible elimination step, which could form a double bond.

Option D involves ozonolysis after a Li in NH3 step, which might form a double bond.

I think option C is unlikely because ozonolysis can't act on an alkane. So, the correct option is probably option C, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, option C's step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, leaving no double bond for ozonolysis.

So, probably option B or D.

Option B: step 2 is Li in liq NH3, which could form a double bond from the alkyne. Then, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups. Then, step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild base, perhaps for reductive workup.

So, if the molecule after step 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would form two carbonyls. Then, NH4OH might reduce any ozonide intermediates to aldehydes.

So, perhaps the target's aldehyde comes from ozonolysis, and the hydroxymethyl comes from another step.

But I'm not confident. Another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which suggests that a Grignard reaction might have been used, but I don't see Grignard reagents in any options.

Wait, another angle: the target's substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH. So, perhaps the CH2OH is formed via hydroboration or via some addition to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Given the time, I'll have to guess. I think the correct answer is option C, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps option D.

Wait, another thought: To form the hydroxymethyl group, perhaps a reduction of an epoxide is involved. But I don't see any epoxidation steps in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 in option A is used to form an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

I think I'll go with option C. After step 3, the molecule might have a double bond, but earlier steps don't seem to form it. Hmm, I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, no. Another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps this substituent is formed via a coupling reaction, like a Suzuki coupling, but I don't see any reagents for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition to a carbonyl group. But again, no Grignard reagents in the options.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C.


The question involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which includes a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2OH group and a carbonyl group (CHO) on the same carbon. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - Step 1: Deprotonation of ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 forms the acetylide, followed by alkylation with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne (cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3).  
   - Step 2: Hydrogenation with H2/Pd converts the alkyne into an alkane (cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3).  
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)2, a strong base, could induce elimination or oxidation, but no clear pathway forms the required substituent.  
   - Step 4: Jones oxidation (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) would oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but no alcohol is introduced in earlier steps.  
   - **Conclusion**: This sequence does not effectively produce the target molecule.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Step 1: Deprotonation with NaNH2 forms the acetylide, followed by alkylation with ethyl chloride to form a longer alkyne (cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3).  
   - Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 could deprotonate or eliminate, potentially forming a double bond.  
   - Step 3: Ozonolysis (O3/H2O) would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups.  
   - Step 4: NH4OH (a mild reducing agent) could reduce ozonides to aldehydes.  
   - **Conclusion**: While ozonolysis could form carbonyl groups, the sequence does not clearly introduce the cyclohexyl group or the hydroxymethyl group.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Step 1: Deprotonation with NaNH2 forms the acetylide, followed by alkylation with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne (cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3).  
   - Step 2: Hydrogenation with H2/Pd converts the alkyne into an alkane (cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3).  
   - Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups, but no double bond is present after hydrogenation.  
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)2 could introduce hydroxyl groups, but the sequence does not align with forming the target structure.  
   - **Conclusion**: This sequence is unlikely to produce the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Step 1: Deprotonation with NaNH2 forms the acetylide, followed by alkylation with methanol (though methanol is not a strong methylating agent).  
   - Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 could deprotonate or eliminate, potentially forming a double bond.  
   - Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups.  
   - Step 4: NH4OH could reduce ozonides to aldehydes.  
   - **Conclusion**: This sequence could form carbonyl groups, but the pathway to introduce the cyclohexyl group and hydroxymethyl group is unclear.

### Final Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly and directly produce the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite its limitations.
