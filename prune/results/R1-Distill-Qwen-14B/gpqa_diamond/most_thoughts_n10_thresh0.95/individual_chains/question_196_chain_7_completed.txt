Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it. The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. 

So, in the non-relativistic case, I remember that the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, the question is about the relativistic case. So option C is probably not the answer here.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. In that case, we can't use the classical expressions anymore. The energy considerations change because the total energy includes relativistic kinetic energy. 

The relativistic kinetic energy is given by (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, the energy equation might be different because as the mass moves, its relativistic mass increases, which affects the spring's force.

Wait, no. The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So the total energy E is (1/2)kA², which is the maximum potential energy when the mass is at x = A. At that point, all energy is potential, so when the mass is at the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. 

So at x=0, the kinetic energy is maximum. Let me write that down: E = K_max + U_max. Wait, no, when x is maximum, U is maximum and K is zero, and vice versa. So when the mass passes through the equilibrium point, all energy is kinetic. 

So E = (1/2)kA² = K_max. But K_max is the relativistic kinetic energy. So,

(1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

But I need to solve for v_max, which is the speed at x=0. So let's express γ in terms of v_max.

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²).

So,

(1/2)kA² = ( (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ) mc².

Let me rearrange this. Let me set x = v²/c² for simplicity. Then:

(1/2)kA² = (1/√(1 - x) -1 ) mc².

Multiply both sides by 2:

kA² = 2 mc² (1/sqrt(1 - x) - 1).

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can express it as:

(kA²)/(2 mc²) = (1/sqrt(1 - x) -1).

Let me denote (kA²)/(2mc²) as some constant, say α. So,

α = (1/sqrt(1 - x) -1).

Then,

1/sqrt(1 -x ) = α +1.

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 -x ) = 1/(α +1).

Square both sides:

1 -x = 1/(α +1 )².

So,

x = 1 - 1/(α +1 )².

But x is v²/c², so:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(α +1 )².

So,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(α +1 )² )

But α is (kA²)/(2mc²). So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (kA²/(2mc²)) +1 )² )

Hmm, that's getting a bit messy. Let me compute the denominator inside the sqrt.

Let me compute ( α +1 )² = [ (kA²/(2mc²)) +1 ]² = [ (kA² + 2mc²)/(2 mc²) ) ]².

So 1/( α +1 )² = (2 mc²/(kA² + 2 mc² ))^2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm on the right track. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should express everything in terms of β, where β = v/c.

So, let me write β² = v²/c².

Then, the equation:

(1/2)kA² = (γ -1 ) mc².

Let me solve for β.

γ = 1/ sqrt(1 - β²).

So,

(1/2)kA² = ( (1/ sqrt(1 - β²)) - 1 ) mc².

Let me multiply both sides by 2 mc²:

kA² = 2 mc² ( (1/ sqrt(1 - β²) ) - 1 )

Let me denote kA² = 2 mc² (something). Maybe I can put everything on one side.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the equation:

(1/ sqrt(1 - β²) ) = [ (kA²)/(2 mc²) ) + 1 ]

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = [ (kA²)/(2 mc²) ) + 1 ]

Let me write that as:

sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / ( [ (kA²)/(2 mc²) ) + 1 ] )

Square both sides:

1 - β² = 1 / [ ( (kA²)/(2 mc²) + 1 )^2 ]

So,

β² = 1 - 1/( ( (kA²)/(2 mc² ) + 1 )^2 )

Take the square root:

β = sqrt( 1 - 1/( ( (kA²)/(2 mc² ) + 1 )^2 ) )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( ( (kA²)/(2 mc² ) + 1 )^2 ) )

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2mc²) )² )

Wait, let me compute the denominator in my expression:

(kA²)/(2 mc²) +1 = (kA² + 2 mc² )/(2 mc² )

So,

( (kA²)/(2 mc² ) + 1 )^2 = [ (kA² + 2 mc² )/(2 mc² ) ]^2 

So,

1/( (kA²/(2 mc² ) + 1 )^2 ) = (2 mc² / (kA² + 2 mc² ))^2.

But when I plug this back into the expression for β²:

β² = 1 - [ (2 mc² )^2 ]/( (kA² + 2 mc² )^2 )

= [ (kA² + 2 mc² )^2 - (2 mc² )^2 ] / (kA² + 2 mc² )^2.

Expanding numerator:

(kA² + 2 mc² )^2 = k² A^4 + 4 k A² mc² + 4 m² c^4.

Subtracting (2 mc²)^2 (which is 4 m² c^4) gives:

k² A^4 +4 k A² mc² + 4 m² c^4 -4 m² c^4 = k² A^4 +4 k A² mc².

So,

β² = [ k² A^4 +4 k A² mc² ] / (kA² + 2 mc² )^2.

Factor numerator:

k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c² ) 

Denominator: (k A^2 + 2 mc² )^2.

Hmm, I'm not sure if this simplifies any further. Let me see the options again.

Looking at option D:

D) v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 mc² ))^2 )

Which would be:

sqrt( 1 - 1/( ( (kA²)/(2 mc² ) +1 )^2 ) )

Which matches the expression I have for β.

So, substituting back, v_max is c times sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (kA²)/(2 mc² ) )^2 ) )

Which is option D.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 -kA²/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, denominator is (1 - kA²/(2m) )^2. But in my expression, the denominator in the fraction is (1 + (kA²/(2 mc²) ))^2.

So, option D has (1 + kA²/(2 mc²) )^2 in the denominator of the fraction, which is the same as my expression.

So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check the initial setup. The potential energy is (1/2)k A², but in relativity, does the mass increase affect the potential energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic form for the energy. Hmm, but the question states that it obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -k x. So the potential energy is the same as in the classical case. But the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So that part seems right.

Another thought: when considering the total energy, the relativistic mass is γm, so the kinetic energy is (γm - m)c², which is (γ-1) mc². So the setup is correct.

So, the correct option is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the potential energy at maximum displacement, \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy, given by \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the total energy to the kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} - 1\right)mc^2.
\]

Let \( \beta = v/c \), so \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \). Rewriting the equation in terms of \( \beta \):

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} - 1\right)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \beta^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}},
\]

\[
1 - \beta^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Solving for \( \beta^2 \):

\[
\beta^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Thus, the maximum speed is:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options, it matches option D:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

The other options are incorrect because they either use the wrong denominator or include terms inconsistent with the relativistic energy conservation.
