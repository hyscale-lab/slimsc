Okay, so I have this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and quantum mechanics models. Hmm, I need to figure out what the momentum of a photon should be for the molecule to transition to the next energy state. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, the fundamental state... right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the molecule is currently in its lowest energy state, and a photon is absorbed to move it to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that means the next higher energy state, maybe the first excited state.

Wait, but what's the structure of the energy levels here? For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels come from both rotational and vibrational states. But the problem says it's in the fundamental state, which I think refers to the vibrational ground state. Or maybe it's the lowest rotational state as well? Or perhaps it's the combination.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model accounts for bond vibrations, unlike the rigid rotor model. So in the non-rigid case, the bond length can change, which affects the moment of inertia and thus rotational energy.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I'm thinking that the molecule is in the lowest vibrational state (v=0), and perhaps in the lowest rotational state (J=0), and the photon will cause it to transition to the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1).

Wait, but which transition would have the lower energy? Because the energy of the photon needed for a vibrational transition is usually higher than for a rotational one. Because vibrational transitions involve higher energy due to the potential energy changes.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So maybe it's the combination of the lowest vibrational and rotational states. So the next possible state would be either increasing the vibrational quantum number by one or the rotational by one. Which transition would require a photon with lower energy?

I need to calculate both possible photon energies and see which one is lower. Because the question asks for the photon's momentum, which relates to its energy via E = p*c, but wait, no, momentum p is equal to hν, but wait, actually, the photon's momentum is p = E/c, since for photons, E = pc.

Wait, let me think. The photon's momentum is p_photon = E_photon / c, where c is the speed of light. So if I can find the energy of the photon needed, I can find the momentum.

So first, I need to find the energy gap between the current state and the next possible state. The current state is the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible energy. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher state, which could be either the next vibrational state (v=1) or the next rotational state (J=1).

Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. Alternatively, perhaps the model refers to the vibration-rotational coupling, but I'm not too sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is treated as a non-rigid rotor, meaning that the bond length isn't fixed. So the energy levels would be a combination of vibrational and rotational energies.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which probably means the vibrational state v=0 and rotational state J=0. The next possible state would be J=1 or v=1. Now, which transition would require a lower energy photon? Because the question is about the photon with the momentum to cause the transition to the next lowest energy state.

So, I think the energy required for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is lower than for a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1. Because rotational energy levels are spaced closer together than vibrational ones.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the energy differences.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ R², with μ the reduced mass.

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (1/2) hν + hν v, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0,1,2...). So the spacing between vibrational levels is hν.

Wait, the question is about the energy needed to go to the next state. So, if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0, the next possible state is either J=1 (rotational) or v=1 (vibrational). Which transition requires less energy?

The rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 would require a photon with energy equal to the energy difference between J=1 and J=0. Let's calculate that.

E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = B [1*(1+1) - 0] = 2B.

The vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 would be hν, since the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is hν.

So which is smaller, 2B or hν? That depends on the values of B and ν.

Given the parameters in the problem: masses Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu, bond length R=2 angstroms, angular frequency w=4e14 rad/s.

So first, let's compute the reduced mass μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ let me compute 1.8 *1.66= approx 2.988, but more accurately:

1.818 *1.6605 = ?

Well, 1.8 *1.6605 = (1 *1.6605) + (0.8 *1.6605) = 1.6605 + 1.3284 = 2.9889.

Then 0.018 *1.6605 = approx 0.029889. So total is 2.9889 + 0.029889 ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute 1.818 *1.6605e-27:

1.818 * 1.6605 = let's calculate it step by step:

1.6605 * 1 = 1.6605,

1.6605 * 0.8 = 1.3284,

1.6605 * 0.018 = 0.029889.

Adding these together: 1.6605 + 1.3284 = 2.9889 + 0.029889 = 3.018789.

So, μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

Next, the moment of inertia I = μ R².

R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0188e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational constant B is given by hbar²/(2I), where hbar is ħ = h/(2π). So, let me compute B.

B = (ħ²)/(2I) = ( ( (h/(2π)) )^2 ) / (2I )

But perhaps it's easier to compute using B = (h^2) / (8 π² I) * (1/(2)) ? Wait, maybe better to directly compute using the formula.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J s.

Then, ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.112e-68) J² s².

Then B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2075e-46) ) = 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 1.112e-68 divided by 2.415
