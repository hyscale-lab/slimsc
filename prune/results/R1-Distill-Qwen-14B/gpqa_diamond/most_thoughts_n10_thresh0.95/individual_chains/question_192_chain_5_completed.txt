Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the cavity is off-center inside the conductor.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, but now has a charge inside the cavity, I think the conductor's charges will redistribute.

Wait, in electrostatics, when a conductor is neutral and a charge is placed inside a cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge, and the outer surface will remain neutral overall. Or wait, no. If the conductor is neutral, the total charge on it is zero. So the inner surface must have a charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the enclosed charge. So the inner surface would have -q. And then the outer surface would have +q, because the conductor's total charge is zero, so the inner is -q, so outer must be +q to cancel it out. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor is initially neutral. So when a +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface must induce a -q, so the outer surface then becomes +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so inner is -q, so outer is +q to sum up to zero? Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's net charge is zero. The +q is inside the cavity, so the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) must have -q. Then the conductor itself, being neutral, would have any excess charge on the outer surface. But since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface's charge is zero as well because the inner is -q, so the outer must be +q? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the conductor is neutral. The charge +q is inside the cavity. The inner surface of the conductor (which is the cavity wall) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the inner charge is -q, the outer must be +q to make the total charge zero. Wait no, wait I'm getting this wrong. The conductor's total charge is zero. If the cavity has +q, the inner surface must have -q to cancel the electric field within the conductor material. Then the outer surface must have +q because the total charge on the conductor is zero, so the inner is -q, so the outer is +q. So the outer surface has +q.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. The +q inside the cavity induces a -q on the inner surface. So the conductor's own charge is zero, so the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the inner surface is -q, so the outer has +q, making the total charge of the conductor zero.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so its total charge is zero. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the cavity is inside the conductor. The conductor's material is a conductor, so the charges will redistribute. The inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have a charge of -q because the conductor's material must cancel the electric field inside the conductor. So the inner surface has -q. Since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because -q (inner) + outer = 0 → outer = +q.

So the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q.

Now, the question is about the electric field at point P outside the conductor. So point P is outside, so the conductor's outer surface charge is the only charge that contributes to the electric field at P. Because inside the conductor, the field is zero, and outside, it behaves as if all the charge is on the surface.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is a sphere with a cavity. But the outer surface is spherical, right? So the conductor itself, from the outside, looks like a spherical shell with charge +q on it. So when you're outside, the electric field would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², where L is the distance from the center to P.

Wait, but wait. The conductor isn't a point charge, it's a sphere. So the electric field outside a conducting sphere is the same as a point charge at the center. So yes, the E field at P would be (k q) / L², where k is 1/(4πε₀).

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. For example, does the position of the cavity's center affect the external field?

Hmm. The cavity is off-center. The +q is placed inside the cavity, which is not at the center. The conductor's inner surface has -q, but the outer surface has +q. So the outer surface charge is uniformly distributed because the conductor is a sphere. Wait, no, the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, so the charge distribution would be uniform. Because the conductor is a sphere, regardless of where the cavity is, the outer surface's charge would distribute uniformly. So the external field only depends on the total charge of the outer surface, which is +q, and the distance L from the center.

So the point P is outside, so the electric field at P is as if the +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor. So the electric field E is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options:

A) (q)/( (l - s cosθ)^2 )

B) (q)/( L^2 )

C) (q)/( (l + s cosθ)^2 )

D) (q)/( l^2 )

So option B matches our conclusion.

Wait, but wait another thought: the point P's distance from the center of the cavity is l, and the distance from the cavity's center is l. The angle between l and s (the distance between cavity center and conductor's center) is theta.

But since the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, the E field at P only depends on the total charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is +q, and the distance from the center of the conductor, which is L. So the position of the cavity's center inside doesn't affect the external field because the conductor's outer surface is symmetric.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity is off-center, with its center separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, where $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance of $P$ from the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Charge Distribution on the Conductor**:  
   Since the conductor is initially neutral, the total charge on it is zero. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. The outer surface of the conductor then has a charge of $+q$ to ensure the total charge of the conductor remains zero.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   Outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor. The outer surface is spherical, and the charge distribution on it is uniform. Thus, the electric field at a point outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge is concentrated at the center of the conductor. The magnitude of the electric field at point $P$ is therefore given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

3. **Irrelevance of the Cavity's Position**:  
   The position of the cavity (and hence the charge $+q$ inside it) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the outer surface of the conductor is spherical, and the electric field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Depends on $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is unrelated to the electric field outside the conductor. Incorrect.  
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor. Correct.  
   - **Option C**: Depends on $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is also unrelated to the electric field outside the conductor. Incorrect.  
   - **Option D**: Depends on $l^2$, which does not account for the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as the electric field at point $P$ outside the conductor is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from its center.
