Okay, so I have this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So when a planet orbits a star, it makes the star move a bit, and we can see this movement by shifts in the spectral lines.

The problem says astronomers found planets around two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, which I think is less than Earth's mass but I'm not sure about the exact figure. Both planets are in circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer is Planet #2's orbital period compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. I think the formula for K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )) ), but since e is zero for circular orbits, that simplifies it a bit.

Wait, but when the planet is more massive, does that make the star move more, hence a larger K? But wait, the stars are same mass, and both planets have similar masses. So why the difference in K?

Wait, no. Wait: the problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So their masses are about the same. And the stars have the same mass. So the only difference is the semi-amplitude K, which relates to the velocity. But in the RV method, the velocity semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period and the semi-major axis. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the Doppler shift and the formula.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV method gives us information about the planet's orbit through the star's reflex motion. So the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) )

Wait, but I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, another formula I recall is:

K = (v) = [ (G * P ) / (2π c³) ) ]^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

But since the planets are similar to Neptune and stars are like the Sun, M_planet << M_star, so the denominator can be approximated as M_star^(2/3). Also, the inclination i is 90 degrees for both, so sin i is 1, because the RV method is most sensitive when the planet transits edge-on, but I'm not sure if that's always the case. But the problem doesn't mention inclination, so perhaps we can assume that both have the same inclination, so sin i is same, and we can ignore it for the ratio.

Wait, but in this problem, both stars are the same mass, and both planets have same mass. So the only variables left are P (orbital period). Hmm, but in the RV method, how does K relate to P?

Wait, perhaps we should think about the ratio of velocities. K is the velocity semi-amplitude. Let's say for each planet, K1 and K2 correspond to their respective shifts. The problem says that the shift for Planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and #2 is 7. But wait, how does the shift relate to velocity?

Wait, the Doppler shift (change in wavelength) relates to velocity via the formula:

Δλ / λ = v / c

But wait, since the wavelength shift is periodic, and in the RV method, the semi-amplitude is the maximum velocity. So the measured shift (in terms of velocity) is v = (Δλ / λ) * c.

But in the problem, they mention the shift in the same spectral line. So the same wavelength λ. So the velocity semi-amplitude would be proportional to Δλ. So K1 = (Δλ1) * c / λ, and K2 = (Δλ2) * c / λ. Since the same spectral line is used for both, λ is the same. So the ratio K2/K1 would be (Δλ2 / Δλ1) = 7/5 = 1.4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the RV method is expressed as the semi-amplitude K, which is the star's velocity. So K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So if the shift is 5 milliangstroms for Planet 1, and 7 for Planet 2, then K for 2 is larger than K for 1. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

But wait, how does K relate to the orbital period P?

I think K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (2π)^(1/3) ) )

Since M_planet << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) * (2π)^(1/3) ) )

Simplify, perhaps:

K = ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star^2) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, let me think again. Another approach is to use the formula:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * ( (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) )

But since e is zero, that's just:

K = ( (2π G) )^(1/3) * (M_planet) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Hmm, so K is proportional to (M_planet) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_planet and M_star are the same for both stars, the ratio K2/K1 would be (P1 / P2)^(1/3).

Wait, because K is proportional to (M_p / (M_s^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )) ), so for same M_p and M_s, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So let me write:

K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3)

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = (1/(P1^(1/3))) * const, K2 = (1/(P2^(1/3))) * const.

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

But earlier, we found that K2/K1 = 7/5.

So substituting,

7/5 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, we cube both sides.

(7/5)^3 = P2/P1

Compute (7/5)^3: 7^3 = 343, 5^3 = 125. So 343/125 = 2.744.

So P2 is about 2.744 times longer than P1.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So we're looking for P2/P1, which is 343/125 ≈ 2.744.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

Hmm, none of these are close to 2.744. Wait, did I make a mistake in my approach?

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio in the wrong direction. Let me recheck.

We have K2 = (7/5) K1.

From the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So if K2 > K1, that would imply that P2 < P1.

Wait, because if K increases, P must decrease, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K2 = (7/5) K1.

So (7/5) K1 = ( (G ... ) ) * (1/(P2^(1/3)) )

Similarly, K1 = same formula with P1.

So K2/K1 = [ (1/P2^(1/3)) ] / [ (1/P1^(1/3)) ] = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) = 7/5.

So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides:

(7/5)^3 = (P1/P2)

So 343/125 = P1/P2.

So P2/P1 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, that makes sense because if K is larger, the period is shorter. So Planet #2 has a shorter period than Planet #1.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That's P2/P1. So 0.364 times, which is roughly 0.36. So the correct answer is option A) ~0.36.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So since M_p << M_s, it's approximately:

K ≈ (G M_p / ( (M_s)^(2/3) (2π) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So higher K means lower P.

So yes, if K2 is larger (7/5 K1), then P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^(3) ? Wait, wait.

Wait, K2 = 7/5 K1. Since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then:

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Cubing both sides: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3.

5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. So 125/343 is approximately 0.364, so about 0.36 times.

So the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So it's shorter, meaning planet 2's period is about 0.36 times as long as planet 1's. So the answer is A.


The problem involves determining how many times the orbital period of Planet #2 is longer than that of Planet #1, given that both planets have similar masses (similar to Neptune) and orbit stars with masses similar to the Sun. The RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude \( K \), which is proportional to the Doppler shift of the spectral lines. For Planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it is 7 milliangstroms. Since the Doppler shift is proportional to velocity, \( K_2 / K_1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4 \).

The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) by the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies that \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \). Using the ratio \( K_2 / K_1 = 1.4 \), we can write:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( K_2 / K_1 = 1.4 \):

\[
1.4 = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
1.4^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
2.744 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{1}{2.744} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Therefore, Planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times as long as Planet #1's.
