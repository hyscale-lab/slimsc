Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me break it down step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and then various products are formed. I need to figure out the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 based on the given information.

First, let's outline the reactions:

1. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided.
2. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.
3. Ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3.

The question is about the 1H NMR coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding any exchangeable protons.

Let me tackle each step one by one.

**Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**

1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. This is an E2 mechanism where two β-hydrogens are abstracted, and the two leaving groups (bromides here) depart, forming a double bond.

The product after elimination would be an adamantene derivative with a double bond. Wait, the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the diamond structure. Upon elimination, the double bond would form between C1 and C3, but wait, in adamantane, the structure is more complex. Alternatively, maybe it's a different arrangement. Hmm, perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps the double bond forms between the two carbons where the Brs were.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). Wait, but elimination would produce an alkene, not a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. If KOH is used in a substitution reaction, two bromides might be replaced by hydroxide ions. But that would give me a diol, 1,3-diol. But the IR has a peak at 1720, which isn't a hydroxyl peak (those are usually broader and around 3200-3600). So maybe it's a ketone or ester or something else.

Wait, maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxides have different IR peaks. The 1720 is more like a ketone or maybe an ester. Alternatively, an aldehyde? But aldehyde peaks are around 2820 (stretch) and 1720 is the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. OH- might attack one Br, but for elimination, you need adjacent Brs. Wait, in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, are the Brs on adjacent carbons or across a bridge? I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons (vicinal), then elimination would form a double bond, giving 1,3-diene adamantane. But then why the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about other possible products. Oh! Wait, perhaps the reaction is a di-elimination, leading to the formation of a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration reaction forming an alcohol, but if it's two eliminations, perhaps it's a loss of HBr twice, leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Wait, another thought: Maybe when KOH is used in such a reaction, it could cause the formation of an epoxide. But that doesn't fit either. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts protons leading to a ring opening. Wait, but adamantane is a very stable structure.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane? No, I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone via some kind of elimination. Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR of product 1 shows:

4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That could be a methylene group (-CH2-) attached to something deshielded, like a carbonyl. Because if it's a carbonyl, the adjacent CH2 would show up around 4-5 ppm, as in a ketone or ester.

The 1.94 ppm for 2H is probably another CH2 group, maybe in a more shielded environment, like part of a ring or adjacent to less electronegative groups.

The middle peak at 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests a lot of equivalent protons. Maybe these are in a bridge structure, like the adamantane skeleton.

Wait, if product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's an ester or a ketone. But how does that come from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Wait, another angle: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but not to an alkene. Maybe it's a formation of a carbonyl group via some mechanism. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation leading to a ketone. But that would require specific structures.

Wait, perhaps it's a ring expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternative approach: Let me think about the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group.

So, what reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would produce a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe it's a double elimination with water or hydroxide. Wait, if two bromides are eliminated, perhaps via two E2 mechanisms, each removing a Br and a H, forming a double bond. But that would give an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Hmm, maybe it's a Fittig reaction? No, that's for aryl halides.

Alternatively, could it be that KOH is acting as a base, removing two HBr molecules and forming a carbonyl group? That is, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbene or something that rearranges into a carbonyl. Wait, but I'm not familiar with such a direct process.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by hydroxide, but in a way that leads to a carbonyl. Wait, for that, perhaps the compound is a vicinal dihalide, which upon substitution with two hydroxides would form a geminal diol, but that would need adjacent OH groups, which I don't think would produce a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps elimination forms a ketone via a different mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when treated with KOH, two E2 eliminations occur, each removing H and Br, but the two eliminations lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. How?

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that elimination leads to the formation of a bridgehead carbonyl. Wait, adamantane has four bridgehead carbons. If two adjacent bridgehead carbons each have a Br, elimination would form a double bond between them. But a bridgehead double bond is forbidden in some cases due to Bredt's rule, but adamantane is a polycyclic structure, and maybe it's allowed. 

Wait, but then where would the carbonyl come from? Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't from elimination but from some kind of substitution leading to a ketone. But how? Maybe the base doesn't act as a base but as a nucleophile in a substitution. Wait, if KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a SN2 substitution, but for each Br, but that would give a diol. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination (two E2s) leading to the formation of a triple bond. But a triple bond's carbons would have sp hybridization, and the IR for C≡C is around 2100-2250 cm^-1, but the given IR is 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the initial product isn't product 1, but perhaps product 1 is a diol, and then another reaction happens. No, the question says product 1 is formed by heating with KOH, and then product 2 is formed by heating with aluminum isopropoxide.

Wait, perhaps the heating with KOH is a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, and the IR at 1720 is from an adjacent carbonyl? Or maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. How can 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Let me think about possible mechanisms.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder type? No, that's for dienes and dienophiles.

Wait, perhaps the compound is undergoing a thermal elimination, losing two HBr molecules, and forming a carbonyl. Let me think: if two adjacent C-Br groups each lose HBr, the adjacent carbons would form a double bond, but that would be an alkene. However, perhaps under certain conditions, it could form a carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated diene, and then some further reaction forms a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a Br and a hydrogen, leading to a carbene, which then forms a carbonyl. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR data again. Product 1 has a signal at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests multiple equivalent protons, perhaps in a bridge structure, and 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2.

If the 4.79 ppm is a CH2 next to a carbonyl, perhaps it's an ester or ketone. So, maybe the structure is an adamantane with a ketone group and a CH2 group attached. For example, (adamantane-1-yl) ketone or similar.

Wait, could it be 1-adamantanone? Let me think. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules via elimination, perhaps forming a conjugated diene, but that wouldn't give a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps one Br is replaced by OH, but that doesn't lead to a ketone either.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that would require two carbonyls, which doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen-like rearrangement? I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility arises. Maybe the reaction forms an epoxide, but I don't think so because the IR doesn't show the typical epoxide peaks around 1250 cm^-1.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is an alcohol, but the IR doesn't support that. The 1720 peak is more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a singlet. That suggests that the two protons are equivalent and not split into multiple peaks, meaning they have no neighboring hydrogens. So, it's a CH2 group attached to something that doesn't have adjacent protons.

If that's a CH2 next to a carbonyl, like a ketone, then the structure would be something like R-CO-CH2-R', where R' is another adamantane group.

Wait, but why would the two CH2 protons be a singlet? Because there are no adjacent protons. So, if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, perhaps each CH2 is attached to two carbonyls. But then that would be a geminal di-ketone, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester group. Wait, but an ester would have a carbonyl, but the structure would have an OR group attached to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone, like cyclopropane with a ketone. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a methylene group (CH2) that's part of a bridge structure, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but I thought that wouldn't explain the IR peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkene and an alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the initial reaction is a substitution, but not a simple one. For example, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an OH group. So product 1 would be 1,3-diol-adamantane. But then, why the IR shows 1720 cm^-1?

Wait, maybe the diol is further oxidized. But under what conditions? KOH is a strong base but not an oxidizing agent. Unless it's a very specific scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol undergoes an intramolecular dehydration to form a carbonyl. Wait, but that would require the diol to be in a position that allows for a hemiacetal or similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a diol but a ketone, and the two Br atoms are eliminated as HBr, each time forming a carbonyl. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination forms a ketone via some rearrangement. For example, maybe a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that's more for carbocation shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diradical which then forms a carbonyl. But I'm not too familiar with that.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to move to the next reaction and see if that helps.

**Step 2: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**

Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, especially in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So if product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps this step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but on what substrate?

Wait, product 1 is 1,3-dibromo... wait, no, product 1 is the result after the KOH reaction. If product 1 is a ketone, then when treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I'm not sure what the electrophilic species would be.

Wait, another thought: Aluminum isopropoxide can also be used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes, but I don't know if that's applicable here.

Wait, product 1 has a carbonyl, so perhaps in product 2, something reacts with that carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester, and this step is an acylation.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Let's see, if product 1 is an ester (like RCOOR'), then treating with Al(OiPr)3 might lead to some kind of acylation of arenes, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure of product 1, it's hard to tell what's happening in step 2. Let me think again about product 1.

Product 1's H NMR:

4.79 (2H, singlet)

2.41-2.23 (10H, probably a multiplet)

1.94 (2H, maybe a triplet or something else)

So, the singlet at 4.79 for 2H suggests a CH2 group with equivalent protons and no adjacent Hs. The 10H between 2.41-2.23 could be from bridgehead protons in adamantane. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to the carbonyl.

If the structure is something like (CH2)CO-adamantane, then the CH2 would be next to the carbonyl. So the 4.79 ppm is the CH2 attached to the carbonyl (maybe a ketone), making it a CH2CO group.

So, product 1 is likely an adamantane with a ketone group and a CH2 group attached to that ketone.

So, product 1 is probably 2-adamantanone or something similar? Wait, no, because I think 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate to form a bridgehead double bond, but if it's a bridgehead, it can form a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is 1-adamantanol, but that wouldn't explain the IR.

Wait, maybe the structure is 1,3-diketone. No, that doesn't make sense with the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol. But the IR doesn't support that. So, I'm back to thinking that product 1 is a ketone.

Once I have the ketone, the next step is reaction with Al(OiPr)3. Hmm, perhaps this is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but on what? Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, but adamantane doesn't have aromatic rings. So maybe this isn't the case.

Wait, maybe it's a different kind of acylation. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester, which when treated with Al(OiPr)3 could undergo some kind of acylation, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and the Al(OiPr)3 is used for some addition. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of another possibility: Perhaps product 1 is a dihydroxy compound (diol), and Al(OiPr)3 is acting as a catalyst for some kind of elimination to form an alkene. But then, the IR peak at 1720 would still be a problem.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al(OiPr)3 might lead to some kind of enol formation or other rearrangement. Or perhaps it's a Claisen-like condensation.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Let me proceed to the next step.

**Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**

Once product 2 is formed, it undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. The conditions (-78°C and use of dimethyl sulfide) suggest that it's a reductive workup, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, ozonolysis followed by dimethyl sulfide usually gives aldehydes and ketones without further oxidation.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would be the ozonolysis products.

But to figure out the coupling pattern, I need to know the structure of product 3, or at least the environment of the hydrogen in question.

Wait, but let's retrace. Product 3's NMR is the focus. The question is about the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Deshielded protons are typically found in environments with less shielding, such as near electronegative atoms or in vinylic positions. But in product 3, after ozonolysis, the structure would have carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 would have carbonyls where the double bond was.

Let me think: The coupling pattern arises from neighboring hydrogens. The most deshielded hydrogen would be near a carbonyl group, perhaps as an aldehyde or ketone.

But in product 3, what would cause a coupling? If the hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl, it might be a CH2 group next to the carbonyl, but in that case, the hydrogen would be split based on neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of an aldehyde group, but aldehyde protons typically show as singlets because they have no neighboring hydrogens (since the aldehyde is RCHO).

Wait, but the question specifies excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent. So if there are any acidic protons, like aldehyde protons, which can exchange with D2O, but in this case, the solvent is likely CDCl3, so maybe any exchangeable protons are not considered. But the most deshielded hydrogen is not exchangeable, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a conjugated system or near a carbonyl.

But back to the previous steps, I'm getting stuck on what product 1 and product 2 are. Let me try to make an educated guess.

**Alternative Approach: Determining Product 1**

Product 1's IR shows a carbonyl. Its NMR shows a singlet for 2H at 4.79, which is probably a CH2 connected to an electronegative group (like O). The 10H between 2.41-2.23 suggests they are part of the adamantane structure, perhaps in a bridgehead position.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's 1-adamantanone? Wait, 1-adamantanone would have a carbonyl group at a bridgehead, which is possible because adamantane is highly rigid.

So, 1-adamantanone structure would have a CO group attached to a bridgehead carbon. The adjacent CH2 groups would be part of the adamantane structure.

But how does that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Another thought: Perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two HBr molecules) leading to a carbonyl group. Wait, but in elimination, you usually form a double bond. How do you form a carbonyl?

Oh! Wait a minute, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism or some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination forming a conjugated diene, which then undergoes a retro-Diels-Alder to form a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination leading to the formation of a ketone via the loss of HBr twice, but I'm not certain of the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide, which then undergoes ring-opening to form a carbonyl. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative. No, but cyclopropane doesn't have a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tricyclic compound with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like an ester, but that doesn't fit with the IR of 1720 being a ketone.

Wait, another angle: The 1H NMR of product 1 has 10H in the middle region, which is characteristic of adamantane's bridgehead protons. The 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests a CH2 attached to something deshielding, like a carbonyl.

So, product 1 is probably an adamantane derivative with a ketone group and a CH2 group attached to the ketone. So, the structure could be:

(CH2)CO-adamantane.

Wait, but how does that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a dihydroxy compound, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol, but the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe the structure is a bicyclic compound with a ketone.

Another thought: KOH is a strong base. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. But I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bridged bicyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diradical which then forms a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but a substitution, and the product is a geminal diol, which could tautomerize into a carbonyl. Wait, that could make sense.

If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes substitution with KOH, each Br is replaced by OH, giving a geminal diol (two OH on the same carbon). But geminal diols are unstable and can tautomerize into carbonyl compounds. Wait, but geminal diols (like HO-CR2-OH) can tautomerize to a carbonyl (CR=O) via keto-enol tautomerism. So, if two OH groups are on the same carbon, they can form a carbonyl.

So, after substitution, product 1 would be a gem-diol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone.

So, product 1 would be a ketone, and the NMR makes sense for that.

So, the reaction steps would be:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → (substitution with KOH) → 1,3-diol → tautomerizes to ketone (product 1).

So, product 1 is a ketone derived from the gem-diol.

Then, product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid. Perhaps this is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but again, adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, the Lewis acid could catalyze another reaction, perhaps an elimination.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. If we treat it with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, maybe it forms an enol, which could undergo some kind of cyclization or addition.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an aldehyde, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps product 1 is 1-adamantanol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, let me think again. If product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a ketone group, then product 2 is formed by treating it with Al(OiPr)3.

Al(OiPr)3 is often used in Friedel-Crafts, but without an aromatic ring, maybe it's used for acylation of some other structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's used to facilitate the formation of an enolate.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, under Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an acetylated product of product 1, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a dimer formed via some coupling reaction, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps product 2 has an alkene. Because ozonolysis is a reaction that acts on alkenes. So, product 2 must have a double bond for ozonolysis to occur.

So, maybe product 2 is an alkene, formed by some elimination in step 2.

Let me retrace:

- Product 1 has a carbonyl group, probably a ketone.

- Step 2: Product 1 heated with Al(OiPr)3 → product 2.

If product 1 is a ketone, and step 2 is an elimination reaction, perhaps product 2 is an alkene. How?

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol that eliminates to form an alkene. But earlier, I thought product 1 had a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which under Al(OiPr)3 undergoes elimination to form an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enone (a conjugated enol), but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to outline possible structures.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone (say, 1-adamantanone), then product 2 could be an enol ether or some kind of enol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, when product 1 (a ketone) is treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes a Claisen condensation, but without an aromatic ring, that's unlikely.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps product
