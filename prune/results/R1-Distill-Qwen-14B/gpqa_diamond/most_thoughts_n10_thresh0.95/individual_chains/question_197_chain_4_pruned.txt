Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product. The options are A, B, C, D. 

Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... Wait, I remember that when alkenes react with HI, it's an addition reaction. But wait, red phosphorus is usually used to remove H2O or something else. Oh right! Red phosphorus and HI can be used to perform a hydrohalogenation, but more commonly, I think of the use in the preparation of alkenes from alcohols, maybe? Or wait, another thought: when you have an alcohol and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, that's a dehydrohalogenation reaction. Wait, no, wait, that's when you have an alcohol and you convert it into an alkene by eliminating H2O. No, wait. Oh, wait, red phosphorus is used in the presence of HI to convert alcohols into alkyl halides. Let me think: when an alcohol reacts with HI and red phosphorus, the -OH is replaced by -I. Because red phosphorus helps in the substitution.

So, the initial step is to figure out what Compound X is. Because once I know that, I can predict what happens when it reacts with HI and red phosphorus.

The data given are IR and NMR spectra. Let's look at the IR first.

IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, probably O-H stretch. So there might be an alcohol group, maybe a carboxylic acid? But wait, the IR also has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid, or maybe an acid derivative. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around the area where aromatic C=C stretching occurs, so that suggests an aromatic ring.

The 1H NMR spectrum: Let's go through it step by step.

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is probably an -OH proton. If it's a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol or a phenolic -OH. But in the IR, there's a 1720 cm-1 peak, which could indicate a carbonyl. If the NMR shows a broad peak around 10 ppm, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But in this case, it's 10.5, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid -OH, but those are usually even broader and might not show up as singlets because of exchange with water. Wait, but the question says compound X is reacting with HI and red phosphorus. If it's a carboxylic acid, reacting with HI might not change it much, but maybe it's an ester or another carbonyl-containing compound.

Wait, let's look at the rest of the NMR. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are typical for an aromatic ring with two substituents. The coupling suggests a para-substituted benzene. Because in the para substitution, each proton is next to two equivalent protons, so they would be doublets.

So, the ring probably has two substituents in the para positions. The 8.0 ppm is more downfield, so that's probably the protons next to the substituent with electron-withdrawing groups. The 7.2 ppm is upfield, so maybe attached to something electron-donating.

Looking at the substituents: the 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde, but if the compound has a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester. Alternatively, if it's an acid, the -COOH would have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, but that's a possibility.

Wait, but let's think about the other NMR signals. There's a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). That's a terminal methyl group, probably attached to a CH2- group. For example, in an ethyl group: CH2CH3. And a triplet at 0.9 ppm implies that it's connected to a CH2 which is split into a triplet. Also, a 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): that could be a CH2 connected to something else, maybe a branching point. 

A 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) seems like a CH group attached to something that causes it to split into a multiplet. So perhaps a CH connected to two other CH2 groups or something like that.

Another peak at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a triplet of three protons as a doublet, so that's a CH(CH3) group. So, maybe a isopropyl group or a secondary carbon.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group (from the IR 1720 cm-1), and an isopropyl or similar group.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. Let's say the benzene ring has two groups in para positions. One is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester), and the other is an isopropyl or similar group.

Wait, let me try to reconstruct the structure. The 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde, but that's a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Let's think, if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would show a broad O-H stretch (which would be in the 3400–2500 cm-1 range) and a strong carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, which fits with the 1720 cm-1. But then, the NMR of a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak for the -COOH proton, which could be around 10–12 ppm. But the given NMR has a 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester. Esters have carbonyl peaks around 1720 cm-1, but the O-H stretch would not be present, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton. Then, the peak at 1720 would be a ketone or ester. Wait, but aldehydes have IR peaks around 2820 and 2720 (the aldehyde C-H stretch) and a strong carbonyl around 1720. But in the IR data, the 2800–2500 cm-1 region is a broad peak, which might include the aldehyde C-H stretch. Hmm, but if the aldehyde is present, the IR would have a peak around 2800 and 2720 cm-1, which would be sharp and possibly show up in the 2800–2500 region. So maybe that's possible.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm in the NMR would then be the aldehyde proton. So if the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative, maybe substituted with some groups.

But let's think about the NMR data again.

Looking at the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So in a para-substituted benzene, the protons adjacent to the substituent would be at 8.0 ppm (if the substituent is electron-withdrawing), and the ones opposite would be at 7.2 ppm.

Wait, but if the substituent is an aldehyde group, which is electron-withdrawing, then the ring protons would be more downfield. So the aldehyde group is in the para position, and perhaps another substituent is an isopropyl group, but that's just a guess.

Wait, but let's look at the other signals. At 2.9 ppm, a triplet of 1H, perhaps a CH connected to something else. 1.7 ppm, a multiplet of 2H, perhaps a CH2 connected to another CH. 1.4 ppm, a doublet of 3H, which would be a CH(CH3). And 0.9 ppm, a triplet of 3H, which is a CH2CH2CH3 group, perhaps.

Wait, putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a propanal group (CH2CH2CHO?) No, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe a propyl group attached to the benzene ring, but with a carbonyl group somewhere.

Wait, another thought: the substituent could be a ketone. For example, a benzophenone derivative. But wait, if the substituent is a ketone, perhaps the structure is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester group. Let's think: if the substituent is an ester, then the carbonyl in the IR would be around 1720 cm-1, which fits. But then, where's the O-H in the IR? Oh, because if it's an ester, there's no O-H, so the broad peak in IR would be from something else. But wait, the IR data includes 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, possibly from an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a benzyl alcohol derivative with a carbonyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acetyl group attached to the benzene ring. For example, acetophenone. But then, the NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. But in this case, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which suggests a terminal methyl group, so perhaps a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like benzaldehyde with an ethyl group attached. Let me think: if the substituent is a propanal group, then the structure would be something like CH2CH2CHO attached to the benzene ring. But wait, that might not fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group with a longer chain. Let's reconstruct the possible structure.

Looking at the NMR:

- Aromatic protons: 8.0 (d, 2H), 7.2 (d, 2H) → para-substituted benzene.

Other protons:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): likely an -OH or aldehyde proton.

Wait, if the compound is a phenol, the -OH would be in the 5-7 ppm region, but that's just for phenols. Wait, no, phenolic OH protons are usually around 5-7 ppm, but if it's an aldehyde, it's higher. So 10.5 is more like an aldehyde.

But then, the IR shows a broad peak at 3400–2500, which would be the aldehyde's C-H stretch (the aldehyde has a strong absorption around 2820 and 2720, which are typically sharp). But the IR also shows a 1720 cm-1, which would be the carbonyl.

But wait, the broad peak in IR might be from another source. Maybe the compound has both an aldehyde and an alcohol group? But that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a ketone group or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the NMR signals. Let's try to sketch a structure.

Assuming the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone), and the other is a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group attached to a carbonyl group.

Wait, let's think. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH connected to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like Ph-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that might fit. Let me think: the substituent on the benzene is a ketone (O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3). So the structure would be something like 4-(3-methylbutan-2-yl)benzaldehyde? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propan-2-yl group attached to the benzene ring via a ketone. For example, (4-(2-propyl-2-oxo)phenyl) something. Hmm.

Wait, let's try to reconstruct the structure. The aromatic ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (maybe a ketone), and the other is a tertiary substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a branch.

Wait, considering the NMR peaks:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH that's connected to the carbonyl. For example, in a structure like Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH3. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a carbonyl group and a branched chain. Let me think about the signals:

Looking at the NMR:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): this is the end of an ethyl group, like CH2CH3.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps two CH2 groups adjacent to branching.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH connected to other groups.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a propan-2-yl group (isopropyl) attached to a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-C(O)- group connected to something else. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch. For example, something like CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CO- attached to the benzene.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to figure out what the substituent is. The substituent on the benzene has a carbonyl group (from the IR), and some branching as per the NMR.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm. So that's a CH2CH2CH3 group. The triplet would come from the CH2 next to the CH3. So, perhaps it's a -CH2CH2CH3 group.

Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be a CH2 connected to a CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a CH3 attached to a CH. So, the structure could be something like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, that's a straight chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branched chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) suggests a CH connected to two different groups. Let me try to imagine a structure where a CH is connected to a carbonyl, a CH2, and a CH(CH3). So, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group attached to a CH group that is connected to a CH2 and a CH(CH3) group, and then a CH2CH3.

So putting it all together: the benzene ring is attached to a carbonyl group (like a ketone), which is connected to a CH that is connected to a CH2 group (which is connected to the triplet at 0.9 ppm), and another CH(CH3) group.

So, the substituent would be: O=C-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but how many carbons does that make? Let's count.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is (CH2)2CHCH(CH3)-CO- attached to the benzene.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on reconstructing the substituent. Maybe I should think about the possible options given.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so looking at the options, the products are either substituted benzoic acids or substituted toluenes.

Wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So as I thought earlier, that's a reaction where an alcohol is converted into an alkyl iodide, via substitution. So, if the starting compound (Compound X) has an -OH group that's replaced by -I, then the product would be an alkyl iodide.

But wait, looking at the options, the products don't have iodine. So perhaps the reaction is elimination, forming an alkene. Wait, no, because the reagents are HI and red phosphorus, which typically lead to substitution, not elimination.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are used to convert alcohols to alkyl halides. For example, primary alcohols become R-I, secondary become R-I, and tertiary become R-I as well, though maybe under different conditions.

So, if Compound X is an alcohol, then the reaction would replace the -OH with -I. So the product would have an -I group.

But looking at the options, none of the products have iodine. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydration or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by HI, but alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is an ester. When esters react with HI, they might undergo hydrolysis. For example, esters can hydrolyze in acidic conditions to form carboxylic acids. But wait, if Compound X is an ester, then reacting with HI might form a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure if red phosphorus is involved in that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution.

Wait, but let me get back to the initial compound. Let's try to figure out what Compound X is.

IR: 3400–2500 cm-1 (broad) → likely an O-H stretch.

1720 cm-1 → carbonyl, likely an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid.

1610 and 1450 cm-1 → aromatic C=C.

NMR:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) → perhaps an -OH or aldehyde.

The aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 suggest para substitution.

Looking at the other NMR:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → a CH group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → a CH2 group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → a CH3 attached to a CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) attached to a chain. Let's say the structure is something like benzaldehyde with a substituent.

Wait, another thought: the 10.5 ppm peak could be a carboxylic acid. So, the structure would be a benzoic acid with substituents.

Wait, benzoic acid has the structure Ph-COOH. The NMR for benzoic acid would have a broad peak around 10 ppm for the -COOH proton, which fits the 10.5 ppm peak. The IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 3400 cm-1 and a strong carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, which matches the 1720 cm-1. The other peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are consistent with aromatic C=C.

So, Compound X could be a benzoic acid derivative.

Now, looking at the NMR, the substituent on the benzene would be a carboxylic acid group and another substituent. The aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm suggest that the substituent is in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

So, the substituent would be in the 4-position if the -COOH is in position 1. Now, the substituent would be a chain with a branching, as per the NMR.

So, the substituent is probably a chain attached to the benzene ring in the para position to the -COOH group.

The substituent's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): CH

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): CH2

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): CH3 attached to a CH

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): CH2CH3

This suggests a chain like CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3 attached to the ring. Wait, that's a isopropyl group attached to a CH
