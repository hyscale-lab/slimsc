Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, and they have the same masses. 

Wait, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is P2 = 3*P1? Wait no, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter, which would mean P1 = P2 /3. So Planet_1 is closer in, as shorter orbital period implies closer orbit around the star, right?

The stars: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's interesting. So even though the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both have same radii. So same size, but different masses.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)Â² * (a / R_star), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, not exactly, but that's the general idea. Alternatively, the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. The probability is approximately (R_planet + something) over something else, but maybe I should think about the formula more accurately.

Wait, I think the transit probability (p) is given by p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a (1 - e^2)) / (sqrt(1 + (m_p sin i)/(M_s)) )) ), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, another formula I recall is p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a (1 - e^2)) / (sqrt(1 + (M_p sin i)/(M_s)) )) ), but since both are edge-on, sin i is 1, and e is 0 (since they have circular orbits). So the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s), assuming edge-on, which is the maximum case. Wait, no, I think that's not exactly accurate. Let me think again.

I think the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a/R_s)) * (something else), but maybe that's not the right way. Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet to the area of the star, multiplied by the impact parameter. No, maybe not. Alternatively, the probability can be thought of as the fraction of the orbit where the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. 

Wait, the transit probability equation I think is:

p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a (1 - e^2)) / (sqrt( (a (1 - e^2))^2 + (R_s + R_p)^2 )) ) )

Wait, no, that's the duration or something else. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the transit occurs, which is (R_s / a)^2. Because the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on enough to cause a transit depends on the relative sizes. So the formula I've heard before is p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a )^2, which simplifies to (R_p^2 * R_s^2) / (a^2 R_s^2) ) = (R_p^2) / a^2. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because if a is small (closer in), the probability would be higher, which makes sense because the planet is more likely to pass in front.

Wait, no, maybe I mixed it up. The correct formula for the transit probability is p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( R_s / a ), but I'm not sure. Let me think more clearly.

The transit probability is the product of two factors: the geometric probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it crosses our line of sight, and the fraction of the orbit during which the planet could transit. But since both have circular orbits, the impact parameter comes into play.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about the formula for the transit probability. I think the transit probability (the probability that a randomly oriented orbit will result in a transit) is given by:

p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / ( (a / R_s) ) )

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a/(R_s))), but I'm not confident anymore.

Wait, let me look it up in my notes. Oh wait, I can't look it up, I have to think. So the transit probability is given by the formula:

p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a )

So p = (R_p^2 * R_s) / (R_s^2 * a ) ) = (R_p^2) / ( R_s a )

Wait, that's possible. Let me think again. The transit probability is the area of the planet's disk relative to the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that
