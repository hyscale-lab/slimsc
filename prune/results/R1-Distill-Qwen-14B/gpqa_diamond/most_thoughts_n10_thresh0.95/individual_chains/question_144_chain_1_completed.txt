Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I need to figure out the answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question gives me some data: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula for the mean decay length (L) is L = v * τ, where τ is the lifetime. 

Wait, but how do I find the lifetime τ? Oh, right! The lifetime is related to the width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for a particle, Γ is the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), and τ is the uncertainty in time (Δt). So τ ≈ ħ / (Γ). But wait, Γ is the decay width, right? So τ is the mean lifetime, which is ħ divided by Γ.

Wait another thing, units are crucial here. Let me make sure I handle the units correctly. Γ is given as 320 MeV. I need to convert that into GeV because the other energies are in GeV. Oh, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ is 0.32 GeV.

Now, to find τ, I can use τ = ħ / Γ. But what's the value of ħ in appropriate units? I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Right, because ħ is about 197.3 MeV·fm, but in GeV terms, that's 0.1973 GeV·fm, but more accurately in seconds it's about 6.58e-25 GeV·s.

So plugging in the numbers: τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me calculate that more precisely: 6.582 divided by 0.32. 6.582 /0.32 is roughly 20.56875, so yeah, 2.056875e-24 s.

Next, I need to find the velocity v. How do I find the velocity of the meson? I think relativistic dynamics come into play here. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So E = gamma * m c². But since we're working in units where c=1 (as is common in particle physics), E = gamma * m.

So gamma is E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So gamma is 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found using beta = v/c. We know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So, let's solve for beta.

Gamma squared is (4/3)^2 = 16/9. So 1/(1 - beta^2) = (16/9) → 1 - beta^2 = 9/16 → beta² = 1 - 9/16 = 7/16 → beta = sqrt(7/16) = sqrt(7)/4 ≈ 0.6614.

Wait, let me compute that again. Gamma is 8/1.2 = 2.666...? Wait wait, wait, 8 divided by 1.2 is actually 6.666..., right? Because 1.2 * 6 = 7.2, 1.2 * 6.666 is 8. So gamma is 6.666… which is 20/3. So gamma squared is (400/9). So 1/(1 - beta²) = 400/9 → 1 - beta² = 9/400 → beta² = 1 - 9/400 = (400-9)/400 = 391/400 → beta is sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775). So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, but wait, wait, wait a second. Let me recalculate that.

Wait, gamma is 8/(1.2) = 80/12 = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

So gamma = 20/3.

So gamma squared is (400/9) ≈44.444.

So 1/(1 - beta²) = gamma² = 400/9.

→ (1 - beta²) = 9/400.

→ beta² = 1 - 9/400 = (400 -9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887c. Let me compute that square root more accurately. Hmm, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887? Let me check with calculator steps. Wait, 0.988^2 is (0.98)^2=0.9604, 0.988^2: (0.98 +0.008)^2 = 0.9604 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008² = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = approx 0.976144. But 0.9775 is a bit higher, so let's say 0.9887 squared is 0.9775 → so beta ≈0.9887.

Wait, but wait a second, I can also compute beta as sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). So 1/gamma squared is 9/400, so 1 - 9/400 is 391/400, so same as before. So yes, beta is sqrt(391/400) ≈0.9887.

So v = beta c ≈ 0.9887 * c. Since c is 3e8 m/s, v is about 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈2.966e8 m/s.

Now, I have τ = 2.056875e-24 seconds, and v ≈2.966e8 m/s.

So the mean decay length L = v * τ = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Calculating the exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute that.

2.966 * 2 = 5.932, 2.966 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1686. So total ≈5.932 + 0.1686=6.1006.

So 6.1006e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m, and D is 4.0655e-16. So my calculation gives around 6e-16 m, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me double-check that.

Wait, gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6667.

So gamma = 20/3 → gamma squared is 400/9 ≈44.4444.

So 1/(1 - beta^2) = 400/9 → 1 - beta^2 = 9/400 → beta^2 = 1 - 9/400 = 391/400 → beta = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887. So that part was correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the lifetime. Let me think again: τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but Γ is the total decay width. The formula for the lifetime is τ = ħ/(Γ). So with Γ in GeV, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = 6.582e-25 s·GeV / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s → 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875 → so 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 seconds. That part seems correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the velocity. Because E is 8 GeV, which is way higher than the rest mass. So the velocity should be close to c, but perhaps the exact value requires more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute beta more precisely. Let me compute sqrt(391/400) accurately.

391/400 =0.9775. So square root of 0.9775.

Let me compute it with more precision.

Let me use a calculator approach. Let's say x = 0.9775.

We can approximate sqrt(x) around x=1: Let me write x = 1 - δ, where δ=0.0225.

Using the expansion sqrt(1 - δ) ≈ 1 - δ/2 - δ²/(8) - ... 

So δ=0.0225, so sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ 1 - 0.01125 - (0.0225)^2/(8).

(0.0225)^2=0.00050625, divided by 8 is ≈0.00006328125.

So 1 - 0.01125 = 0.98875, minus 0.00006328 is 0.9886867.

Wait, that gives me approximately 0.988687.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Let me compute it more accurately using another method.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Newton-Raphson method. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

Let me take an initial guess. Let me guess that sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.

Wait, 0.9887^2 = (0.9887)^2.

Compute 0.9887 * 0.9887:

9887 * 9887.

Wait, maybe I can compute it as (10000 - 113)^2.

Wait, but perhaps a quicker way is to compute 0.9887^2.

(0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + (0.0087)^2.

0.98^2 =0.9604.

2*0.98*0.0087=1.96 *0.0087= approx 0.017052.

(0.0087)^2= approx 0.00007569.

Adding together: 0.9604 + 0.017052 =0.977452 + 0.00007569=0.97752769.

But our target is 0.9775. So 0.9887^2 is 0.97752769, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So the actual value is a little less than 0.9887.

So let's try 0.9886.

0.9886^2: let's compute it.

0.9886 * 0.9886.

Again, (0.98 + 0.0086)^2.

0.98^2 =0.9604.

2*0.98*0.0086=1.96 *0.0086=0.016816.

(0.0086)^2=0.00007396.

Adding: 0.9604 + 0.016816 =0.977216 +0.00007396=0.97728996.

Hmm, that's 0.97728996, which is less than 0.9775. So the square of 0.9886 is 0.97728996. Our target is 0.9775, so the square root is between 0.9886 and 0.9887.

Let me find the difference. 0.9775 -0.97728996 =0.00021004.

The difference between 0.9887² (0.97752769) and 0.9886² (0.97728996) is about 0.00023773 per 0.0001 increase in x (from 0.9886 to 0.9887).

So we need 0.00021004 / 0.00023773 ≈ 0.883 of the way from 0.9886 to 0.9887. So 0.9886 + 0.0000883 ≈ 0.9886883. So sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.988688.

So beta is approximately 0.988688. Therefore, v = beta c ≈ 0.988688 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, that's the same as before. So perhaps my initial calculation of v is correct.

So L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this again.

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Multiply 2.966 * 2.056875 = (let me compute this with more precision)

2.966 * 2 =5.932.

2.966 * 0.056875:

0.05 *2.966=0.1483,

0.006875 *2.966 ≈ 0.0203225.

So 0.1483 +0.0203225 =0.1686225.

So 5.932 + 0.1686225 =6.1006225.

Now, 6.1006225e (8 + (-24)) =6.1006225e-16 m.

So L≈6.1e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the options are near 6e-16. The options are A)5.0e-16, B)4.06e-15, C)5.0e-15, D)4.06e-16.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me see: E = gamma * m c². Since we're in units where c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma = E/m =8 GeV /1.2 GeV= 6.666666...

So gamma is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta. Let me think again about beta.

Wait, gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Wait, 1/gamma squared is (3/20)^2=9/400 =0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775, same as before.

So beta is sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.988688.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should compute beta more accurately, but perhaps that's not the mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the calculation of the mean decay length. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The mean proper lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ.

But when the particle is moving, the observed lifetime is longer, it's τ' = gamma * τ.

Wait, no! Wait, the mean lifetime τ is the proper time (the lifetime in the rest frame). When the particle is moving, the lifetime as observed is longer by gamma. So the mean lifetime from our perspective is gamma*tau.

Wait, wait, no. Because the lifetime observed is longer due to time dilation. So the proper lifetime is tau, and the observed lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, but when you compute the mean decay length, it's v multiplied by the observed lifetime, right? Because the lifetime we observe is longer.

So I think I made a mistake here. In my previous calculation, I used tau as the proper lifetime, but in reality, the lifetime observed is gamma * tau. So the mean decay length is v * gamma * tau.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify.

The lifetime in the rest frame is tau = ħ/(Γ). But when the particle is moving at a speed v, the lifetime we observe is longer by the Lorentz factor gamma. So the mean lifetime is gamma * tau.

So the mean decay length L is v multiplied by the observed lifetime. So L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, but wait, does that make sense? Because tau is the proper lifetime, so the moving particle's lifetime is gamma tau. So yes, L = v gamma tau.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation by not including gamma. Let me redo the calculation with this correction.

So L = v * gamma * tau.

So v is beta c, so L = beta c * gamma * tau.

Gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) =6.6667.

Tau is ħ / Γ.

So let me compute each term again.

Tau = ħ/(Γ) =6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV =2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma=20/3≈6.6667.

Beta is 0.988688.

So L= beta * c * gamma * tau.

Compute each term:

beta ≈0.988688,

c=3e8 m/s,

gamma=20/3,

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L=0.988688 *3e8 m/s * (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, 3e8 times 20/3 is (3e8) * (20/3) =20e8.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

beta * c = 0.988688 *3e8 =2.966064e8 m/s.

gamma=20/3.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L= (2.966064e8 m/s) * (20/3) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Wait, (20/3) is approximately 6.666667.

So 2.966064e8 m/s *6.666667 = ?

2.966064e8 *6.666667 ≈ let's compute that.

2.966064e8 *6 =1.7796384e9,

2.966064e8 *0.6666667≈1.977376e8.

So total ≈1.7796384e9 +1.977376e8 =1.977376e8 is 0.1977376e9.

1.7796384e9 +0.1977376e9= approx 1.977376e9.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 2.966064e8 * (20/3) =2.966064e8 *6.66666667.

Compute 2.966064e8 *6=1.7796384e9,

2.966064e8 *0.66666667≈(2.966064e8 *2/3)≈1.977376e8.

So sum is 1.7796384e9 + 1.977376e8= approx 1.977376e8 is 197,737,600.

Wait, but 1.7796384e9 is 1,779,638,400.

Adding 197,737,600 gives 1,977,376,000.

So 1.977376e9 m/s.

Now multiply by tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L=1.977376e9 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 1.977376e9 *2.056875e-24.

The exponents: 1e9 *1e-24=1e-15.

So 1.977376 *2.056875 ≈ Let me compute that.

1.977376 * 2 =3.954752,

1.977376 *0.056875≈ let me compute that:

0.05 *1.977376=0.0988688,

0.006875 *1.977376≈ approximately 0.013602.

So 0.0988688 +0.013602 ≈0.11247.

So total is approximately 3.954752 +0.11247=4.067222.

So L≈4.067222e-15 meters.

Wait, that's about 4.067e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16.

So this is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but why did I get a different result after correcting for gamma? Because I realized that the lifetime observed is gamma * tau, so I included the gamma factor again. So that's where I went wrong earlier. Initially, I didn't account for time dilation correctly.

So the correct mean decay length is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15 m) and option D is 4.0655e-16 m, which is an order of magnitude smaller.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

where \( v \) is the velocity of the particle and \( \tau \) is the mean lifetime. The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the mean lifetime \( \tau \)
The decay width is given as \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The energy of the meson is \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = \beta c \approx 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The observed lifetime is longer due to time dilation, and is given by:

\[
\tau_{\text{observed}} = \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

Thus, the mean decay distance is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{observed}} = v \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (6.6667) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( v \cdot \gamma \):

\[
v \cdot \gamma = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (6.6667) \approx 1.977 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Now, multiply by \( \tau \):

\[
L = (1.977 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated mean decay distance \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
