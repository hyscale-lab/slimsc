Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. But I'm a bit rusty on the details. Let me think about what the question is asking.

The question says that X is a meson resonance, and we need to find its mean decay distance. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so I guess it's something involving very tiny distances, which makes sense for particles decaying quickly.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to how long the particle lives, or its lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the further it can travel before decaying. But since mesons are bosons, maybe they have a short lifetime. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

So, the mean decay distance (L) is probably calculated using the particle's lifetime (τ) and its velocity (v). The formula would be L = v * τ. Right, because distance is velocity multiplied by time.

But how do I find the lifetime τ? I think it's connected to the particle's width Γ. Oh yeah, the uncertainty principle! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the lifetime and energy are inversely related. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Wait, but do I need to include factors like the mass or anything else?

Wait, another thought. I remember that for a particle, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense because a larger Γ (wider width) means a shorter lifetime. So higher energy uncertainty leads to a shorter lifetime.

But wait, the production energy is given as 8 GeV. How does that come into play here? The mass of the particle is 1.2 GeV, which is much less than 8 GeV. Hmm, is there something about the kinetic energy or the available energy for decay that I'm missing?

Wait a second, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The mean decay distance is determined by the particle's lifetime and its velocity. So first, I need to find the lifetime τ using Γ, then find the velocity, and then multiply the two.

So let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using Γ.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson.
3. Multiply v by τ to get the mean decay distance L.

Step 1: τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, the units need to be consistent. I think ħ is in J·s. Let me get the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV. I need to convert Γ into Joules. Oh, right, because the units have to be consistent. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. Let me compute that.

Γ = 320 MeV = 320e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV. Let me compute that: 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = (3.2e8) * 1.602e-19 = wait, no. 320e6 is 3.2e8? Wait 320 million is 3.2e8? Wait no, 320 million is 3.2e8? Wait 1e6 is a million, so 320 million is 3.2e8? Wait no, 320e6 is 3.2e8? Wait 320 million is 320,000,000, which is 3.2 x 10^8. Oh yeah, that's right. So 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11 J.

Wait, let me compute it properly: 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = (320 * 1.602) * 1e-13. Because 1e6 * 1e-19 = 1e-13. Hmm, 320 * 1.602 is 320 * 1.6 is 512, and 320 * 0.002 is 0.64, so total is 512.64. So that's 512.64e-13 J, which is 5.1264e-11 J.

So Γ is 5.1264e-11 J.

Now, τ = ħ / Γ. So ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So τ = 1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11.

Let me compute that: 1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 ≈ (1.0545718 / 5.1264) * 1e-23. 1.0545 / 5.1264 is approximately 0.2057.

So τ ≈ 0.2057e-23 s. Which is 2.057e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the exponents. 1e-34 / 1e-11 is 1e-23. So yeah, 1e-34 / 1e-11 is 1e-23. So yes.

Wait, but another way: 1e-34 / 1e-11 = 1e-23. Correct.

So τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds. Hmm, that's a really short lifetime. Makes sense for a resonance.

Wait, but another point: the production energy is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is produced at a much higher energy than its rest mass. So it's moving relativistically. So the velocity is close to the speed of light. So v ≈ c, which is 3e8 m/s.

Wait, so velocity v is approximately c. So I can approximate v as c for calculation purposes. So v ≈ 3e8 m/s.

So now, L = v * τ = (3e8 m/s) * (2.057e-24 s) = 6.171e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the options are 6.17e-16. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gives around 6e-16 m, but the closest options are A and D. Let me see why.

Wait wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Γ. Let me go back.

Wait, the mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width is Γ_X = 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Hmm, but wait, the width is part of the Breit-Wigner distribution, which relates to the lifetime. So I think the initial approach is correct.

But perhaps I forgot to consider the energy of the particle. Oh, wait! The meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV. So maybe I need to calculate its velocity based on its energy.

Wait a minute, I think that's the mistake. Earlier, I assumed v ≈ c because the energy is much larger than the mass, right? Let me think again. The energy E is 8 GeV, which is much higher than the rest mass (1.2 GeV), so the particle is ultra-relativistic, so v is approximately c. So that's correct.

But perhaps the lifetime depends on the particle's energy. Wait, no, the width Γ is given, and as per the uncertainty principle, the lifetime is inversely proportional to Γ, regardless of the energy. Or does the width depend on the energy?

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. The width Γ is given as 320 MeV. So perhaps the calculation is correct as it is.

Wait, but let me think again. The energy is 8 GeV, which is 8000 MeV. The mass is 1200 MeV, so the particle's kinetic energy is much higher. So the gamma factor γ would be E/(m c^2) = 8000 / 1200 ≈ 6.6667.

So γ = 6.6667.

Wait, but for the velocity, we can calculate it using beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/γ^2)}.

Wait, let me compute beta. For γ=6.6667, gamma squared is (6.6667)^2 ≈ 44.444. So 1/γ^2 is ~ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, so v isn't exactly c, but very close. But whether this affects the result? Let me see.

In my previous calculation, I took v as c and got L ≈6.17e-16 m, but none of the options match that. The options are either ~5e-15, ~4e-15, ~5e-16, or ~4e-16.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the velocity. Let me compute beta correctly.

Wait, let's compute gamma more accurately. E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c², when we plug into the equation, perhaps the units cancel out correctly. Let me compute gamma.

E_X = 8 GeV, m_X c² = 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then beta is sqrt(1 - (1/γ^2)).

So 1/γ² = 1/( (6.6667)^2 ) = 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) = let me compute that accurately. The square root of 0.9775.

Well, sqrt(0.98) is approximately 0.98995. Let's see, 0.98995^2 = 0.98 * 0.98 is 0.9604; no, wait, 0.98995 is about 0.98^2? Wait no, 0.98995 squared is: (0.99 - 0.00005)^2 ≈ 0.9801 - 2*(0.99)*(0.00005) + (0.00005)^2 ≈ 0.9801 - 0.000099 + negligible. So 0.980001. So 0.98995^2 ≈ 0.980001. But wait, I need sqrt(0.9775) which is less than 0.98995.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it accurately. Let's see:

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

Let me make an approximate calculation. Let me think of it as sqrt(0.9775) = x.

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(a) around a=1.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute it numerically.

Let me think: 0.98^2 is 0.9604. 0.988^2: (0.98 +0.008)^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144. Wait, that's pretty close.

Wait, 0.988^2 = (988)^2 * 1e-6 = (976144) * 1e-6 → 0.976144.

But 0.9775 is higher than 0.976144. So let me compute 0.988 + delta)^2 = 0.9775.

(0.988 + d)^2 = 0.9775.

Expand: 0.988² + 2*0.988*d + d² = 0.9775.

We know 0.988² is 0.976144.

So 0.976144 + 2*0.988*d + d² = 0.9775.

Subtract 0.976144: 2*0.988*d + d² = 0.9775 - 0.976144 = 0.001356.

Assuming d is very small, d² is negligible.

So 2*0.988*d ≈ 0.001356 → d ≈ 0.001356 / (2*0.988) ≈ 0.001356 / 1.976 ≈ ~0.000687.

So x ≈ 0.988 + 0.000687 ≈ 0.988687.

So beta ≈ 0.9887.

So v = 0.9887 c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So maybe using v = 0.9887 c would slightly change the calculation. Let me recalculate L with v = 2.966e8 m/s.

Earlier, I had τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

So L = v * τ = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = ?

2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.966 * 2.057) * 1e-16.

2.966 * 2.057 ≈ let me compute that:

2 * 2.057 =4.114

0.966 *2.057: approximately 2.000.

So total is about 6.114.

Wait, more accurately:

2.966 *2.057:

= (3 - 0.034) * (2 + 0.057)

= 3*(2) + 3*(0.057) - 0.034*(2) -0.034*(0.057)

= 6 + 0.171 - 0.068 - 0.001938

= 6 + 0.171 =6.171 → minus 0.068 →6.103 → minus 0.001938→6.101.

So 6.101e-16 m.

Hmm, so about 6.1e-16 m. But none of the options are close to that. The options are A)5.02e-16, D)4.06e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Γ in Joules. Let me recheck that.

Γ is 320 MeV. 1 MeV = 1e6 eV. So 320 MeV = 320e6 eV.

Each eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 320e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 320e6 * 1.602e-19.

320e6 is 3.2e8, so 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11 J. So that's correct.

Wait, so Γ is 5.1264e-11 J. τ = ħ / Γ.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So τ = 1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = approx 2.057e-24 s.

Wait, but what about relativistic effects on the lifetime? Because the lifetime I'm calculating is the proper time (τ), and in the lab frame, the lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, the lifetime τ is the proper lifetime, which is the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. So when it's moving, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame would be longer by gamma. So perhaps I should multiply τ by gamma to get the observed lifetime.

Ah, that's a crucial point! Because the particle is moving at a high speed, the lifetime we observe is longer than the proper lifetime. Because of time dilation. So the actual lifetime in the lab frame is τ' = γ * τ.

So that changes the calculation. Because earlier, I used τ as the proper lifetime, but L is v * τ', which is v multiplied by gamma times tau.

Wait, so let's correct that.

L = v * τ' = v * gamma * tau.

So tau is 2.057e-24 s.

Gamma is 6.6667.

So tau' = 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

So L = v * tau' = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s.

Let me compute that.

2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = (2.966 * 1.371) * 1e-15.

2.966 * 1.371: Let me calculate.

2 *1.371=2.742.

0.966 *1.371= approx 1.323.

Adding together: 2.742 +1.323=4.065.

So 4.065e-15 meters.

Wait, that's option B: 4.0655e-15 m. But option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. But wait, my calculation got 4.065e-15 m, which matches option B.

Wait, but wait a second, in the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is 4.0655 x 1e-15 m, which is 4.0655 femtometers? Or wait, 1e-15 m is 1 femtometer, right? But 4e-15 m is 4 femtometers.

Wait, but let me go back. My calculation here: L = v * gamma * tau.

Yes, that's correct because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So that's where the factor comes in.

So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.065e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this value.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation:

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666..., correct.

Tau = ħ / Γ = 1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = approx 2.057e-24 s.

Tau lab frame is gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 = approx 1.371e-23 s.

v = beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

L = v * tau_lab = 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = 4.065e-15 m.

Yes, that's correct. So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.065e-15 m, which is option B.

But wait, the options have option B as 4.0655e-15 m. So that's a match.

Wait, but the options also have option D as 4.0655e-16 m. Oh, but our calculation is 4.065e-15, which is 40.65e-16, so D is 4.0655e-16, which is ten times smaller. So that's why I need to make sure.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship \( L = v \cdot \tau' \), where \( \tau' \) is the lifetime in the lab frame and \( v \) is the velocity of the particle. The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by \( \tau = \hbar / \Gamma \), and due to time dilation, \( \tau' = \gamma \cdot \tau \), where \( \gamma = E / (m c^2) \).

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The decay width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 320 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \). Converting to joules:
\[
\Gamma = 320 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 5.1264 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J}.
\]
The reduced Planck constant is \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Thus:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{5.1264 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the rest energy \( m_X c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). The Lorentz factor is:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the lab-frame lifetime \( \tau' \)
Using time dilation, \( \tau' = \gamma \cdot \tau \):
\[
\tau' = 6.6667 \times 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
For a relativistic particle, \( v \approx \beta c \), where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - (1 / \gamma^2)} \). Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]
Thus:
\[
v = \beta c = 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:
\[
L = v \cdot \tau' = 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]
\[
L = (2.966 \times 1.371) \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \approx 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which matches option **B**.

Answer: B
