Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y, is represented by a 2x2 matrix. It's given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and determine which of the given statements (A-D) is correct.

Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues are related to the spin. Since a muon is a spin-1/2 particle, its spin matrices should be similar to the Pauli matrices. But wait, the S matrix here isn't the Pauli matrix. Let me think about S. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The σ_y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is exactly the S matrix given here. So S is σ_y, and c is h/(4π). 

Wait, the spin angular momentum operator S is related to the Pauli matrices by S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli vector. But here, Ay = c·S, and c is h/(4π). Let me compute c·S. Wait, actually, S is given as the matrix, so perhaps S itself is (ħ/2) σ_y. Hmm, maybe I should compute Ay explicitly.

Wait, the given S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So S is σ_y. Then Ay = c * σ_y. With c = h/(4π). So Ay becomes (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Wait, the standard Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when we multiply by a scalar, the eigenvalues get scaled by that scalar. So for σ_y, the eigenvalues are ±1, so for Ay, they would be (h/(4π)) * (±1). So the eigenvalues a would be ±h/(4π). So the real part is ±h/(4π), and the imaginary part is zero. So any option that talks about the eigenvalues having non-zero imaginary parts is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, no, because the eigenvalues are real. So A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That also can't be right because the eigenvalues are real and of the order h/(4π), which is a small number compared to 1. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Well, for angular momentum, in quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of a component (like A_y) are also eigenfunctions of the square of the angular momentum (A²) because A² commutes with all components. However, they don't necessarily commute with other components, like A_z. Wait, but wait, the total angular momentum J has J² and J_z as commuting operators, but in this case, A is the intrinsic spin, so perhaps the same applies. So the eigenfunctions of A_y would also be eigenfunctions of A². So C's first part is correct. But would they be eigenfunctions of Az? Because [A_y, A_z] = iħ A_x (or something like that), so they don't commute. Therefore, eigenfunctions of A_y can't be eigenfunctions of A_z. So C's statement is correct: eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So C might be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what this means. The matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the operator. So D's statement seems correct. Wait, but the statement says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, eigenfunctions can form a basis, but perhaps all of them (eigenfunctions) are the basis functions. Since Ay is 2x2, it has two eigenfunctions which form an orthogonal basis. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but can both C and D be correct? Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So I need to check each option.

Let's go back to the options. Let's think about each statement.

Option A: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts. But as I said earlier, the eigenvalues are real. So A is wrong.

Option B: Same problem as A. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct because A² commutes with all components. So they can share the same eigenfunctions. But they can't be eigenfunctions of Az because [Ay, Az] = i A_x, which is non-zero, so their eigenfunctions are different. So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis for the two-dimensional space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options are all statements during the calculation. So which ones are correct?

Wait, but the question says which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, the issue is which options are correct.

Looking at the options again:

C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. Therefore, the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenfunctions (once found) form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options are single-choice. So which one is correct?

Wait, the question asks during the calculation, which statement is correct. So perhaps during the calculation, the correct statements are C and D, but since only one option is correct, maybe only C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps D is incorrect. Because the statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Wait, the matrix operator is defined with respect to a basis. The eigenfunctions are specific to that operator, but perhaps the basis is already given. Hmm, perhaps D is correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the matrix S is given. The eigenfunctions are vectors in the 2x2 space. So the eigenfunctions of Ay (as a 2x2 matrix) will form a basis for the space. So D's statement is correct.

So both C and D are correct. But the options are single-choice.

Wait, let me reevaluate.

Another approach: let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

σ_y has eigenvalues ±1. So Ay's eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * (±1) → ± h/(4π). So eigenvalues are real, which rules out options A and B.

So now, the eigenvectors of σ_y are the same as those of Ay. What are the eigenvectors of σ_y?

The eigenvalues of σ_y are 1 and -1. The eigenvectors for σ_y can be found by solving (σ_y - λ I) |v> = 0.

For λ = 1:

σ_y - I = [[-1, -i], [i, -1]]
The equations are -v1 -i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2. So the eigenvector can be written as [ -i, 1 ]^T. Or any scalar multiple.

Similarly, for λ = -1:

σ_y + I = [[1, -i], [i, 1]]
The equations are v1 -i v2 = 0 → v1 = i v2. So eigenvector [i, 1]^T.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T and [i, 1 ]^T.

So looking at options C and D:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

A² is the square of the angular momentum. For spin-1/2 particles, A² would have eigenvalues s(s+1) ħ², where s=1/2 → (3/4) ħ². Since A² commutes with all components, any eigenstate of Ay would be an eigenstate of A². So statement C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors, being two in number, form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to see which options are correct. Let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az. So yes, correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, the matrix operator is expressed in the standard basis. Its eigenvectors will form an orthogonal basis for the space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow for multiple correct answers. So perhaps the correct answer is C and D, but looking at the options, only one is given. Wait, the options are A to D, single choice.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the matrix operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix. Its eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors that form a basis. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. So that's correct.

But let's look at the options:

The question is, which statement is correct during the calculation? So probably, both C and D are correct. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the statements. Let me read them again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the matrix is expressed in a certain basis (usually computational basis). The eigenvectors of the matrix are specific to that basis. So, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are in that basis, so they form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

Therefore, both C and D seem correct. But the options are A to D, and only one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the question says which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, which statements would be considered correct.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation of eigenvalues, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, without the actual calculation, I'm a bit stuck.

But considering the options, I think the correct statements are C and D.

Wait, but the options are multiple-choice, and I have to choose the correct option.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the problem.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σ_y. Then Ay is (h/(4π)) σ_y.

The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, so eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π). So eigenvalues are real, so A and B are wrong.

So the correct options are C and D.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D, each a statement.

So now, the question is which of the four statements is correct.

Statement C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so same eigenvectors. So C is correct.

Statement D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space. So D is correct.

Wait, but in this problem, the matrix operator is 2x2, so perhaps the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors.

But the eigenfunctions are specific vectors, not the basis. Unless the operator's eigenfunctions happen to align with the standard basis, which they don't in this case.

Wait, the standard basis is |0> = [1;0], |1> = [0;1]. The eigenvectors of Ay are [i;1] and [-i;1], which are not the same as the standard basis. So the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis vectors of the operator.

Wait, the operator's matrix is given in the standard basis. So the basis functions are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvectors are different from the basis vectors, except in specific cases.

So perhaps statement D is incorrect.

Because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the same as the basis functions (the standard basis vectors). So D is incorrect.

So the correct statement is C.

Hence, the answer is C.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented as a 2×2 matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A_y \) need to be analyzed, and the correctness of the given statements must be determined.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli \( \sigma_y \) matrix, which has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are scaled by \( c \), giving \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, so any option suggesting nonzero imaginary parts for the eigenvalues is incorrect.

2. **Option A:**
   - Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), and the imaginary parts are zero.

3. **Option B:**
   - Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \).
   - This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

4. **Option C:**
   - States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator), but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component).
   - This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning their eigenfunctions can overlap. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are distinct.

5. **Option D:**
   - States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).
   - This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are specific vectors in the 2D space and do not coincide with the standard basis vectors (e.g., \( |0\rangle = [1; 0] \) and \( |1\rangle = [0; 1] \)).

### Conclusion:
- Options A and B are incorrect because they misrepresent the eigenvalues.
- Option D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not the same as the basis functions of the operator.
- Option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).
