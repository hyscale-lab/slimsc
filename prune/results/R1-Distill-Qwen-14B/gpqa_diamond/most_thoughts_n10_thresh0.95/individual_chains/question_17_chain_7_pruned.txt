Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant, K, tells us how strong that complex is. So the higher the K, the more stable the complex.

Wait, the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution. That probably means the concentration of Ca^2+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio because the complex is Ca-EDTA. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

The formula for the formation constant K would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Right, because the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. So K is equal to that ratio.

But wait, in solution, the EDTA is probably in various protonated forms. Oh wait, but the problem says the pH is ideal. I think that means that EDTA is fully deprotonated, so essentially, the concentration of EDTA^4- is equal to the total EDTA concentration minus whatever is bound in the complex. But wait, wait, no. Wait, in this problem, the solution is just the Ca-EDTA complex. So maybe the free EDTA and free Ca²+ are what we're considering.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, that's the concentration of the complex. So the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Alternatively, wait. The solution is a complex, so when it dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4- into the solution. But the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is the initial concentration. So the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are both 0.02 M, but that's before considering the dissociation.

Wait no, that's not right. The formation constant equation is K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So if we have the complex, then [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. So let me set up the equation.

Let me define:
Let’s say the concentration of the complex is C = 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. Let me denote x as the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So:

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA²−] = C - x ≈ C because K is so large (5e10), so x will be very small compared to C. So we can approximate [CaEDTA²−] ≈ C.

Wait, but K is very large, which means the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal. That would mean x is very small. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−] = x, and [CaEDTA²−] ≈ 0.02 M.

So plugging into K:

K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02 / x².

We know K is 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 → Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So x² = 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → x² = 0.4e-12 → x = sqrt(0.4e-12).

Let me compute that. Square root of 0.4e-12 is sqrt(4e-13) → wait, wait, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13? No, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13 multiplied by 0.1? Wait, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13 * 0.4? Hmm, no: 0.4e-12 is 4e-13 * 10? Wait, wait, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13 multiplied by 10?

Wait, 0.4 is 4e-1. So 0.4e-12 = 4e-1 * e-12 = 4e-13? No. Wait, 0.4e-12 = 4e-13? Because 0.4 is 4 *10^-1. So 4e-1 * 1e-12 =4e-13. Oh wait, no, that's 4e-13. So 0.4e-12 = 4e-13 * 10? No, that's not right. Let me compute 0.4e-12.

Wait, 1e-12 is 0.000000000001. 0.4e-12 is 0.4 * that, which is 0.0000000000004, which is 4e-13.

Wait, no. 0.4e-12 = 4e-13? Let me see: 0.4 is 4 *10^-1. So 4e-1 *1e-12 =4e-13. Yes, correct.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Because 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7, so
