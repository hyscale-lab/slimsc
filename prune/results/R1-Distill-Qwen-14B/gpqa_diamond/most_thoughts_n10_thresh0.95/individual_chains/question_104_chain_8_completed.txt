Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Okay, let's read the question carefully.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, and they have circular orbits. 

The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the star's velocity moving towards or away from us. The key here is that the size of this shift relates to the mass and orbital period of the planet.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how much longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the mass of the planet and other factors. The formula I think is K = (v) = (G * (M_planet) * sin(i)) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3) ) )^(1/1) ) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P.

Wait, another approach: the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum speed the star moves due to the planet. The formula for K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and semi-major axis. 

But since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun), and the planets have similar masses, maybe we can find a relation between their velocities and periods.

Wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/ something) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula that relates K and the period. Let me recall the correct formula.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) )

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star (Neptune vs Sun-like star), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

So K ≈ ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But since both planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune), and the stars are same mass, and the orbits are circular so sin i is 1 (i=90 degrees, edge-on), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K ∝ (1/P^(1/3)).

Wait, let me think again. K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Since M_p and M_star are same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So if K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7, then K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3).

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let's make it clear. Let me write the proportionality:

K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant for same M_p and M_star.

So, P^(1/3) = C / K → P = (C/K)^3.

So for two planets, P1 = (C/K1)^3, P2 = (C/K2)^3.

So P2/P1 = ( (C/K2)^3 ) / ( (C/K1)^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, because when you take the ratio:

P2/P1 = ( (C/K2)^3 ) / ( (C/K1)^3 ) ) = ( (K1/K2) )^3.

Because C cancels out, and (1/K2^3 ) / (1/K1^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Given that K2 is larger than K1, since 7 >5, K2/K1 = 1.4, so K1/K2 = 1/1.4 ≈0.714.

Then P2/P1 = (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.714 * 0.714 is about 0.51, multiplied by 0.714 again is about 0.365.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, which means it's shorter. Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, it's shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So P2 is shorter, so the ratio is less than one.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85.

So the correct answer would be option A, which is approximately 0.36.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I mixed up the ratio.

Wait, let me double-check.

We have K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So P ∝ 1 / K^3.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1.

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So K1=5, K2=7.

So (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.7143 * 0.7143 ≈ 0.5102, multiplied by 0.7143 gives ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, so P2 is shorter.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Since 0.364 is less than 1, it's shorter. So the ratio is ~0.36. So the answer is option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity method indicates that \( K \propto 1 / P^{1/3} \), meaning \( P \propto 1 / K^3 \). 

Given that planet #1 causes a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)) and planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)), we calculate the ratio of their orbital periods:

\[
P_2 / P_1 = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
P_2 / P_1 = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is shorter. Since the question asks how many times longer \( P_2 \) is than \( P_1 \), the answer is approximately 0.36.
