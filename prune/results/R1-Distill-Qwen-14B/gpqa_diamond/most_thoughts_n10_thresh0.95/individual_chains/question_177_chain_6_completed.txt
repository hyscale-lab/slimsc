Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read it again.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same too. Because if T were different, the lambda_max would change.

Then, the question mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, but I'm not sure how velocity comes into play here. Maybe it's a redshift or blueshift effect? Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength can shift. But wait, the question says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So maybe the measured peak wavelength is affected by their velocities.

Wait, but the way the question states, the wavelengths they found are the same. So if Star_2 is moving, its emitted peak wavelength would be Doppler shifted. So to have the same observed lambda_max, there must be some adjustment. Hmm, maybe I should think that the intrinsic (rest frame) temperatures are the same because their observed peak wavelengths are the same after considering velocity.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The peak wavelengths observed are the same. So for Star_2, due to its high velocity (700 km/s), the observed lambda would be different from its intrinsic. But since the observed lambda is same as Star_1's, which has zero velocity, I think that Star_2's intrinsic peak must be shifted.

Wait, let me think again. Star_1 has a wavelength lambda_max1, and Star_2 has a wavelength lambda_max2. But they observed both to have the same lambda_max. So, Star_2 must have a different intrinsic lambda_max, but due to its velocity, the observed one is same as Star_1's.

Ah, right, so maybe the Doppler effect comes into play here. So for Star_2, its emitted peak is at lambda_rest, but due to velocity, the observed lambda is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) or something like that. Wait, the formula for Doppler shift depends on whether it's approaching or receding. Since the radial velocity is positive (700 km/s) for Star_2, I think that's the velocity away from us, so it's a redshift.

Wait, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. So the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted) compared to its rest frame.

So if Star_1 is at rest, its observed lambda is lambda1 = b / T1. Star_2's intrinsic lambda_rest would be lambda2_rest = b / T2. But due to its velocity, the observed lambda2 is lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive if moving away (redshift). So the observed lambda for Star_2 is (lambda2_rest) * (1 + v/c).

But according to the problem, the observed lambdas are the same. So lambda1 = lambda2_obs.

So lambda1 = lambda2_rest * (1 + v/c). But lambda2_rest is b / T2, and lambda1 is b / T1.

So substituting, b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c).

The b's cancel out. So 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) / 1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-arrange. From 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c), that would mean T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). Hmm, but wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer than its rest frame. So if lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v/c), then since lambda1 = lambda2_obs, lambda1 must be longer than lambda2_rest. That would imply that T1 is lower than T2, because lambda is inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, but I'm confused. Let's take it step by step.

The problem says both stars have the same observed peak wavelength. So their observed lambdas are the same. But their rest frames might be different because of their velocities.

For Star_1: observed wavelength is lambda1 = lambda1_rest (since v=0, so no Doppler shift). So lambda1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: observed wavelength lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v/c), since it's moving away. So lambda2_obs = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c).

But according to the problem, lambda1 = lambda2_obs.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c)

Rearrange,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

So T2 is higher than T1. Because (1 + v/c) is greater than 1. So Star_2 is hotter in its rest frame.

Wait, but that feels a bit counterintuitive. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be longer than the rest frame. But since the observed lambda of Star_2 is the same as Star_1's, which is at rest and has a certain lambda, that means Star_2's rest lambda must be shorter than Star_1's. Because when you redshift a shorter wavelength, you get a longer wavelength.

So, Star_2's rest frame would have a shorter lambda than Star_1's, which implies a higher temperature. Because lambda is inversely proportional to temperature.

So, back to the equation: T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

But wait, let me check the Doppler shift formula. The relativistic Doppler effect for wavelength is:

lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no. Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Wait, I'm a bit shaky on that. I think for non-relativistic speeds, the approximation is lambda_obs ≈ lambda_rest * (1 + v/c), since v is much less than c.

In this case, 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light (c is about 3e5 km/s, so 700/3e5 ≈ 0.00233). So the approximation should be okay.

So for Star_2, the observed lambda is lambda2_obs ≈ lambda2_rest * (1 + v/c). Since v is positive when moving away, this is a redshift.

But since lambda1 = lambda2_obs, we can write:

lambda1 = lambda2_rest * (1 + v/c)

But lambda1 is the rest wavelength of Star_1, which is b/T1.

Lambda2_rest is the rest wavelength of Star_2, which is b/T2.

So:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v/c)

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v/c)

Wait, that would mean T2 is larger than T1. Because (1 + v/c) is 1 + 700/(3e5) ≈ 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.00233.

So T2 ≈ 1.00233 * T1.

But wait, this seems like a very small difference, but perhaps it's significant for the problem.

Now, moving on. The question is about the luminosities of the two stars.

The luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

L = 4π R² σ T⁴

Where R is radius, T is effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the luminosity ratio L1 / L2 would be:

(L1 / L2) = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

Because the 4π and sigma cancel out.

Given in the problem:

R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5.

And from earlier, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) ≈ T1 * 1.00233.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that T2 was larger than T1, but let me make sure.

Wait, I have T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). So, yes, T2 is a bit larger.

But the problem states that Star_1 has a larger luminosity than Star_2. Hmm, but let's compute.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)² * T1⁴ ) / ( (R2)² * T2⁴ )

Simplify:

= ( (2.25 R2²) * T1⁴ ) / ( R2² * T2⁴ )

The R2² cancels:

= (2.25) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Now, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) → Let me express T2 in terms of T1.

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) → T2^4 = T1^4 * (1 + v/c)^4

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / ( (1 + v/c)^4 )

Wait, wait no. Let me substitute T2^4.

Wait, T1^4 / T2^4 = [ T1 / T2 ]^4 = [ 1 / (1 + v/c) ]^4 = 1 / (1 + v/c)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v/c)^4 )

So,

L1 = L2 * [2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4 ]

So the factor by which L1 is greater than L2 is [2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4 ].

Wait, but v is 700 km/s. Let me compute (1 + v/c) first.

v = 700 km/s, c ≈ 3e5 km/s → v/c ≈ 700 / 300000 ≈ 0.0023333.

So, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.0023333.

So (1 + v/c) ≈ 1.0023333.

Compute (1.0023333)^4.

Hmm, let's approximate this. Let me compute it step by step.

First, ln(1.0023333) ≈ 0.002329 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3... for small x).

So ln(1.0023333) ≈ 0.002329.

Then, ln( (1.0023333)^4 ) = 4 * 0.002329 ≈ 0.009316.

Exponentiate this: e^0.009316 ≈ 1.00937.

Alternatively, compute it directly using (1.0023333)^4.

Compute step by step:

(1.0023333)^2 = 1.0023333 * 1.0023333.

Which is approximately 1 + 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2.

Wait, that's 1 + 0.004666 + (0.00000544) ≈ 1.00467144.

Then, (1.00467144)^2 = (1.00467144)^2.

Again, 1 + 2*(0.00467144) + (0.00467144)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.00002182 ≈ 1.0093647.

So, (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.009365.

So, 1/(1.009365) ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * (1/1.009365) → approx 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Wait, so the factor is approximately 2.228, which is about 2.23.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~2.23.

Option B is ~2.32, which is higher.

Wait, but wait—did I make any mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.

Wait, no. Because the L1/L2 is 2.25 divided by (1.009365), which is 2.25 * 0.9907. Let me compute 2.25 * 0.9907.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275, and 2.25 * 0.0007 is 0.001575. So total is approximately 2.229.

So about 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, earlier I thought that the Doppler shift would affect the temperature. But another approach is considering that the luminosity is determined by their intrinsic properties, not the observed wavelength. Hmm, wait no. Because the luminosity calculation would be based on the star's actual radius and temperature. The Doppler shift affects the observed temperature and luminosity.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The problem states that the stars are radiating as black bodies, so their luminosity is based on their radius and actual temperature.

But the observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars. So, considering that, the actual temperatures of the stars would be related through the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature. So, the observed temperature of a star with rest temperature T and velocity v would be T_obs = T * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ), but I'm a bit unsure of the exact formula.

Alternatively, using the approximation for small v/c, the observed temperature would be T_obs ≈ T * (1 - v/c).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. Suppose the observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars. So lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs.

But lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + v/c) for Star_2 (since moving away), and lambda_rest for Star_1 is lambda1_rest.

So,

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v/c)

So,

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + 700/3e5) ≈ 1.002333 * lambda2_rest.

Since lambda is inversely proportional to temperature, lambda1_rest = b / T1, lambda2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = 1.002333 * (b/T2)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = 1.002333 / T2 → T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So T2 is slightly higher than T1. But when computing luminosity, which depends on T^4, this makes a small difference.

So, the luminosity ratio is:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4)

R1 is 1.5 R2 → R1^2 = 2.25 R2^2.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * ( T1^4 / ( T2^4 ) )

But T2 = T1 * 1.002333 → T2^4 = T1^4 * (1.002333)^4.

So,

T1^4 / T2^4 = 1 / (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1/(1.009365) ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228 → ~2.23.

So the factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but the options also have A) ~2.25, D) ~2.23.

So the correct answer would be D.


Astronomers are analyzing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and a mass 1.5 times greater. The observed peak wavelengths of the two stars are the same, indicating that their temperatures are related through the Doppler effect due to Star_2's radial velocity of 700 km/s (Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s). Using the Doppler shift formula for wavelength, the observed wavelength of Star_2 is redshifted, and the relationship between the rest wavelengths is given by:

\[
\lambda_1 = \lambda_2^{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v/c),
\]

where \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\). Substituting \(v/c \approx 0.002333\), we find:

\[
1 + v/c \approx 1.002333.
\]

Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the rest wavelengths are related by:

\[
\lambda_1 = \lambda_2^{\text{rest}} \cdot 1.002333.
\]

The temperature of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its peak wavelength (\(T \propto 1/\lambda\)), so:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333.
\]

The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4,
\]

and the luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
\]

Given \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\), we have \(R_1^2 = 2.25 R_2^2\). Substituting \(T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333\), we find:

\[
T_2^4 = T_1^4 \cdot (1.002333)^4.
\]

Thus, the luminosity ratio becomes:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25 \cdot T_1^4}{T_1^4 \cdot (1.002333)^4} = \frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4}.
\]

Approximating \((1.002333)^4\), we calculate:

\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1.009365.
\]

Therefore:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx \frac{2.25}{1.009365} \approx 2.23.
\]

The factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 is approximately 2.23, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
