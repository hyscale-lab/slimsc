Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interatomic distance... oh right, in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms. In a cubic system, that's the edge length, but rhombohedral is a bit different. Oh right, a rhombohedron is like a cube that's been deformed so all sides are equal but the angles aren't 90 degrees.

So, in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which means all edges a, b, c are equal, and all angles α, β, γ are equal. So in this case, a = b = c, and each is 10 Angstroms? Wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, for a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be the edge length. But rhombohedral is more complex.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is indeed the same as the edge length. But in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron. So for a rhombohedral structure, a = b = c, but the angles are all the same and not 90 degrees. So the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter 'a' here. So a = 10 Angstrom.

Wait, but that's confusing. Because in some cases, the interatomic distance might not directly be the lattice parameter, but in a simple case like this, perhaps it is. So I'll proceed with a = 10 Angstrom.

Now, interplanar distance for (hkl) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)(cos^2 α + ... ) )) Wait, no, maybe I should recall the correct formula.

Wait, the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is:

1/d^2 = (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) + (2hk cos γ)/(a b) + (2hl cos β)/(a c) + (2kl cos α)/(b c)

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, for a rhombohedral system where a = b = c and α = β = γ, the formula might simplify.

Wait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell can be considered as a cube that's been stretched or compressed along the diagonals, so it's a special case. So for a rhombohedral system, all edges are the same (a = b = c), and all angles are the same (α = β = γ).

So, for a rhombohedral system, the formula for interplanar distance simplifies. Let me think.

The formula for d in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2), but in a rhombohedral system, since the angles are not 90 degrees, this gets more complicated. So perhaps the formula can be expressed in terms of the unit cell parameters. 

Wait, I think the correct formula when the unit cell is rhombohedral (so a = b = c, and angles α) is:

d^2 = (a^2) / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle of the rhombohedral system. Because all angles are the same here, θ=30 degrees.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me try to find the correct expression.

Alternatively, the general formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system (a=b=c, α=β=γ) is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if the formula is correct. Let me think again.

In a general triclinic system (all a, b, c different and angles different), the formula is:

1/d^2 = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) + (2hk cos γ)/(a b) + (2hl cos β)/(a c) + (2kl cos α)/(b c)

But in the case of a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and α = β = γ = α.

So substituting into the general formula:

1/d^2 = (h²)/(a0²) + (k²)/(a0²) + (l²)/(a0²) + (2hk cos α)/(a0²) + (2hl cos α)/(a0²) + (2kl cos α)/(a0²)

Factor out 1/a0²:

1/d^2 = [ h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos α + 2kl cos α ] / a0²

Which can be rewritten as:

1/d^2 = [ (h + k + l)^2 (cos α) ] ? Wait, no.

Wait, let's compute the numerator:

h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos α + 2kl cos α

Wait, can we factor this? Let me see: Let's factor out cos α from the cross terms.

= h² + k² + l² + 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl )

Alternatively, perhaps it's better expressed as:

= h² + k² + l² + 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl )

So, d = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl ) )

So now, for the (111) plane, h = 1, k =1, l=1.

So plugging in h=1, k=1, l=1:

d = a0 / sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 cos(30 degrees) (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) )

Compute the denominator:

Inside the square root:

3 + 2 cos(30) * (3) = 3 + 6 cos(30 degrees)

Because (1*1 + 1*1 +1*1) is 3.

Wait, no: 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl ) → since h=k=l=1, hk=1, etc. So 2 * cos α * (1 +1 +1) = 2 * cos α *3 → 6 cos α.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 6 cos α )

So,

d = a0 / sqrt(3 + 6 cos α )

Since a0 is 10 Angstrom, and α is 30 degrees.

Now, compute cos(30 degrees). Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So,

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 +6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3 sqrt(3)

So,

Denominator = sqrt(3 + 3 sqrt(3) )

Let me compute this numerically.

Compute 3 +3 sqrt(3):

sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732.

3 *1.732 ≈ 5.196.

So 3 +5.196 =8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ ?

Well, sqrt(8.1) is about 2.846. 2.846^2=7.99. 2.86^2=8.1796. 2.86^2=8.1796. 8.1796 is approximately 8.18.

So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So denominator is 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ ?

Compute 10 / 2.863: Let's see.

2.863 * 3 =8.589.

Hmm, 2.863 *3=8.589, which is less than 10.

So 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493.

Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait, wait a second. No, I think I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Because the denominator is sqrt(3 +6 cos α ), which I calculated as sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

But 10 / 2.863 is approximately 3.493 Angstrom. But looking at the options, the smallest option is 8.95. So that's way off. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me go back and check.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the formula. I think I might have gotten the formula wrong.

Wait, from the general formula, 1/d² is the sum of h²/(a²) + ... etc.

Wait, for a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, and angles are all the same. So yes, the formula I used earlier is correct.

Wait, but wait, another thought: Could I have confused the formula for d² with something else? Let me think again.

Wait, considering that the Miller indices are (111), perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell can be considered as a cube that's been skewed. So the interplanar distance for (111) can be calculated using the same approach as in cubic systems, adjusted for the angles.

Wait, in a cubic system, d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). So for (111), d_cubic = a / sqrt(3) ≈ a / 1.732.

But in our case, the structure is not cubic, it's rhombohedral. So the formula would differ because of the angles.

I think the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, because when α is 90 degrees, the cross terms (2hk cos 90) become zero, and we get the cubic formula. So this makes sense.

So for (111), h=k=l=1. So:

d = a / sqrt( 3 + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) cos 30 )

Which is a / sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

Which is a / sqrt(3 + 3 sqrt(3) )

As before.

So a is given as 10 Angstrom.

So computing the denominator:

3 +3 sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So denominator is sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

So d≈10 / 2.863 ≈3.493 Angstrom.

But the options are all around 9-10 Angstrom. So this can't be right. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance given is not the lattice parameter a. Hmm. Maybe I misunderstood the problem. The question says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom".

Wait, wait. In a crystal, the interatomic distance might refer to the distance between nearest atoms in the structure, which might not be the same as the lattice parameter a. For example, in a face-centered cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a sqrt(2)/2, which is less than a.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a in terms of the interatomic distance.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, each atom is at the corner of the cube. So the nearest neighbor distance is a, same as the lattice parameter.

In a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is a, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a function of the angles.

Wait, another approach. Let me model the rhombohedral structure as a unit cell. Each atom is at each corner, but the vectors are a, b, c, with a = b = c and angles alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance can be found using the structure's geometry.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the edge length a. So a=10 Angstrom is given. Then, proceeding as before, d=3.493 Angstrom.

But the options are way larger, so that can't be right. So perhaps the given interatomic distance isn't the lattice parameter a. Maybe I'm getting a and the interatomic distance confused.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest atoms in the structure, which might be given by a, or perhaps by a function of a and the angles.

Wait, for a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is the same as the edge length a, because each atom is at a corner of the rhombohedron, and each corner is connected to three edges. So the nearest neighbor distance would be a.

Wait, but in that case, with a being 10 Angstrom, the interplanar distance for (111) would be about 3.49 Angstrom, which isn't any of the options.

So perhaps I'm miscalculating the formula. Let me check another source.

Wait, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is different.

Wait, I found a reference that says that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But wait, that's what I did earlier. So that seems correct.

Hmm, but I'm getting a much smaller d than the options. So perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a but something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two specific atoms in the structure, not the edge length a. For example, perhaps in the (111) plane, the nearest neighbor distance is different.

Wait, maybe I should model the structure. Let's think about the structure.

In a rhombohedral lattice, the basis vectors are a, b, c, each of length a (10 Angstrom), and the angles between them are 30 degrees.

Each atom is at the corner of the rhombohedron. So the distance between two adjacent atoms (nearest neighbors) would be a, but perhaps there are other distances.

Wait, but perhaps the interatomic distance isn't the edge length but another distance, such as the distance between two atoms along a diagonal.

Wait, for example, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is a, not the face diagonal (a√2) or the body diagonal (a√3). So perhaps in this case, the interatomic distance is the edge length a.

So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, then a=10 Angstrom.

So then, the calculation I did earlier, which gives d≈3.493 Angstrom, is correct but not matching the options.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) (cos α + cos β + cos gamma) ) ) ?

No, trying to think of another formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should be using is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 +k^2 + l^2)(cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma) )

Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors come into play, but I can't remember the exact expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a general hexagonal or other system, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the diffraction condition. Wait, but perhaps that's not necessary here.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I'm supposed to use the formula for a cubic system but adjust it for the angles.

Wait, for a cubic system, the (111) interplanar distance is a/(sqrt(3)).

But in this rhombohedral case, the structure is more compressed because of the 30-degree angles, which would cause the interplanar distance to be larger than the cubic case.

Wait, no, in a way, when the angles are smaller than 90 degrees, the interplanar distance might be shorter or longer. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the denominator in the formula. The denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 cos(30)). Cos(30) is positive, so 3 +6*(0.866) = 8.196. So denominator is around 2.863.

So 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493.

But the options are all in the 8s and 9s. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have negative signs? Let me think.

Wait, no, the formula for 1/d² is [h² +k² +l² + ...], so it's positive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but then, with the same numbers:

h=k=l=1, so h² +k² +l²=3.

hk + hl + kl=3.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 2*3*cos30 )

= sqrt(3 -6*(0.866)).

Compute 6 *0.866=5.196.

So 3-5.196= -2.196. Which would be sqrt of a negative number, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

So that formula can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe using the relation between the reciprocal lattice and the interplanar distance.

Wait, another approach: Let me model the basis vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length a =10 Angstrom, and the angles between them are 30 degrees.

So the vectors can be written as:

a = [a, 0, 0]

b = [a cos α, a sin α, 0 ]

c = [a cos β, a (cos γ - cos α cos β)/sin α, a sqrt( 1 - cos^2 β - ( (cos gamma - cos alpha cos beta)/sin alpha )^2 ) ]

Wait, perhaps that's too complicated, but perhaps if all angles are 30 degrees, the expressions simplify.

Wait, but maybe using vector methods to find the interplanar distance.

Wait, the (111) plane is defined by the Miller indices (1,1,1). So the normal vector to this plane is (1,1,1).

The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes along the direction of the normal vector. Hmm.

Wait, more precisely, the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = | (a * h + b *k + c * l) | / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + ... )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the reciprocal basis vectors.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a)( ... ), but maybe that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the volume of the unit cell and then compute the reciprocal.

Wait, the volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 β - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma) )

But since α=β=gamma=30 degrees,

Volume = a³ * sqrt(1 - 3*(cos 30)^2 + 2*(cos30)^3 )

Compute cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So (cos30)^2 = 3/4 =0.75.

So:

Volume = a³ * sqrt(1 - 3*0.75 + 2*(0.8660)^3 )

Calculating inside the sqrt:

1 - 2.25 = -1.25

2*(0.866)^3 ≈2*(0.6495)≈1.299.

So:

-1.25 +1.299 = 0.049.

So sqrt(0.049) ≈0.221.

Thus, Volume = (10)^3 * 0.221 ≈ 1000 * 0.221 = 221 Ang^3.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how this helps me find the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps I can use the relation between the unit cell parameters and the reciprocal lattice.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the formula for the Miller plane (hkl) in a rhombohedral system:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α )

But in our case, α=β=γ=30 degrees, so:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos30 + 2hl cos30 + 2kl cos30 )

Which is the same as what I did earlier.

So for (111):

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6 *0.866) =10 / sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.493 Angstrom.

But the options given are all much larger. So this suggests that I'm using the wrong formula or the given interatomic distance is not a.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in rhombohedral structure is a. So a=10 Angstrom, which is correct.

But if that's the case, why are the options so much larger than my computed value?

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula in terms of another parameter.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the formula should have a negative sign. Let me think: what if the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α.

Wait, then for (111):

1/d² =3 -6 cos30.

Which is 3 -6*(0.866)≈3-5.196= -2.196. Which is negative, which can't be possible. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Another thought: Perhaps I should be using the reciprocal of the (hkl) plane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system with that of a hexagonal system. Let me think.

Wait, in a hexagonal system, the formula for (hkl) planes is different, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the structure of the (111) plane.

In a cubic system, the (111) planes are the planes that cut the edges at one unit each. So the normal vector is along (1,1,1). The distance between these planes is a/(sqrt(3)).

But in a rhombohedral system, the same Miller indices would correspond to a different arrangement of planes, perhaps leading to a different interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / (sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2hk cos(alpha) + 2hl cos(beta) + 2kl cos(gamma) )).

Which is what I used earlier.

Wait, but then again, the calculation leads to d≈3.49 Angstrom, which is way off the given options.

Wait, the options are 9.08, 8.95, 9.54, 10.05.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a, but something else. Let me think: perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two atoms in the structure, which could be along a different direction.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a. But perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a multiplied by some factor due to the angles.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the distance between two adjacent atoms in the structure. For example, the distance between the atoms at (0,0,0) and (1,0,0) is a. But if the structure has a basis, perhaps the interatomic distance is different.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify a basis, so perhaps the structure is simple, with atoms only at the corners.

Wait, wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not the edge length a. Let me think: in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. So if a=10, then yes, the nearest neighbor is 10 Angstrom.

But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is a multiplied by a factor related to the angles.

Wait, for example, perhaps the distance between two neighboring atoms is a, but the formula for d requires using the reciprocal of the lattice vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the correct formula but the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, which is the interplanar distance for (111), but that would mean the options are not matching.

No, that can't be. The question is asking for the (111) interplanar distance given the interatomic distance is 10.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation I keep getting gives d≈3.49 Angstrom, but the options are all much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a, but the nearest neighbor distance in the structure is something else. Let me think: perhaps the nearest neighbor distance in the structure is not a but a multiplied by some function of the angles.

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance can be found using the vectors.

The displacement vector between two adjacent atoms (from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0)) is a along the x-axis, so the distance is a. So interatomic distance is a.

Wait, but perhaps another way to approach this is to compute the volume of the unit cell and then calculate the volume per atom, but I'm not sure how that would help with the interplanar distance.

Wait, let me look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the relation between interplanar distance and the volume of the unit cell.

In a cubic system, the volume is a³, and the interplanar distance d is a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But in a rhombohedral system, the volume is a³ * sqrt(1 - cos² α - cos² β - cos² γ + 2 cos α cos β cos γ).

In our case, since all angles are 30 degrees, the volume is a³ * sqrt( 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 ) )

Which, as before, is a³ * sqrt( 1 - 9/4 + 2*(3*sqrt(3)/8) )

Wait, 1 -9/4 is -5/4. 2*(3 sqrt(3)/8 )=3 sqrt(3)/4 ≈1.299/4≈0.3248.

So Volume = a³ * sqrt( -5/4 + 0.3248 )= a³*sqrt( -1.25 + 0.3248 )= a³*sqrt( -0.9252 ), which is imaginary. That can't be right, so I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate:

1 -3*(3/4) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

= 1 - 9/4 + 2*( (3*sqrt(3))/8 )

= (4/4 -9/4 ) + (6 sqrt(3))/8 )

= (-5/4) + (3 sqrt(3))/4 )

So the expression inside the sqrt is (-5 + 3 sqrt(3)) /4.

Compute 3 sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So (-5 +5.196)/4= (0.196)/4=0.049.

So sqrt(0.049)=≈0.221.

So volume= a³ *0.221.

Hmm. So for a=10:

Volume=1000 *0.221=221 Ang^3.

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is related to the volume and the unit cell parameters.

Wait, another approach: The number of unit cells in a given volume, perhaps, but I'm not seeing a connection.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a)(a, 0, 0) )

Wait, no, in a general system, the reciprocal vectors are defined as:

b1 = (2π/a) [1/(a^2 (1 - cos^2 α - ... )) ] Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the structure factor, but that's probably not helpful here.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system as:

d = a / ( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos γ )^0.5 )

But with the same calculation as before.

Hmm.
