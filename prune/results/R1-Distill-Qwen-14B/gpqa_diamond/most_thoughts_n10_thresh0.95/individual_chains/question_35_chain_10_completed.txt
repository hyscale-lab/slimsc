Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can figure out.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, which is a muon's property. The operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix in the form Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). I remember that matrices like this often come up in spin-1/2 systems, like electrons, but muons are similar in terms of spin.

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, among the options A to D, choose which statement is correct during this calculation.

First, I need to recall how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors. For a matrix operator, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So, let me write down the matrix Ay. Since Ay = c·S, and c is h/(4π), I can compute it.

Matrix S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Multiplying by c, Ay becomes:
[ 0       -i*c ]
[ i*c      0  ]

Plugging in c = h/(4π), Ay is:
[ 0        -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  0       ]

So, let me denote c = h/(4π) for simplicity. Then, Ay is:
[ 0   -i c ]
[ i c   0  ]

To find the eigenvalues, I'll compute the determinant of (Ay - λ I):

| -λ     -i c      |
| i c    -λ       | = 0

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i c)(i c) = λ² - (i c)^2.

Wait, (i c)^2 is (i^2)(c^2) which is (-1)c^2. So the determinant is λ² - (-c²) = λ² + c² = 0.

So, λ² = -c². Taking square roots, λ = ± i c.

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary numbers: +i c and -i c. Because λ² = -c², which leads to λ = ± i c.

Wait, but c is h/(4π). So substituting back, λ = ±i (h/(4π)).

Looking at the options, let me check:

Option A says imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, my calculation shows the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, so real parts are zero. So option A is saying the imaginary parts are ±2πh, but let's compute: c = h/(4π), so i c is i h/(4π). The imaginary part of the eigenvalue is ± h/(4π). So the imaginary parts are ± h/(4π), real parts are zero. So option A is incorrect because it says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which is way bigger. Also, the real parts in A are non-zero, which isn't the case here.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Doesn't match our result. Our eigenvalues have real part zero, and imaginary parts ± h/(4π). So B is incorrect.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. I know that for angular momentum operators, the square of the angular momentum (like A²) commutes with the individual components. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A². But does it necessarily mean it's not an eigenstate of, say, Az?

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, if an operator commutes with another, their eigenstates can be shared. But in this case, A² and Ay commute, so any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². So the first part of option C is correct. But what about Az? Well, Ay and Az don't commute. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of Az. So the statement in option C says "can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az." That seems correct. So C might be the correct option. But let's check the other options first.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. I'm not exactly sure what this means. Basis functions usually refer to the basis in which the matrix is diagonal. So if Ay is represented in the eigenbasis, then its matrix would be diagonal. So the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors. So if Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D's statement seems correct as well.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. The matrix given is in the standard basis, probably the eigenbasis of another operator. But the eigenfunctions of Ay would form a different basis if Ay isn't diagonal in the current basis. So for the matrix given, which is not diagonal, the eigenfunctions are the basis when you diagonalize it. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Maybe D is correct as well.

Wait, but let's think about the specific matrix. The matrix S is the Pauli Y matrix, right? Because the Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So S is σy. So Ay = c σy. The eigenvalues of σy are ±i, so eigenvalues of Ay are ±i c, which is ±i (h/(4π)).

So eigenvalues are imaginary. So for the eigenvalues, only the imaginary part is non-zero, so the real parts are zero, which matches what I found earlier.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which for a spin-1/2 particle is (ħ/2)^2 * 3 (since S² = s(s+1) ħ², and s=1/2, so s(s+1) = 3/4, so S² = (3/4) ħ². Wait, but in this case, the operator is Ay, which is part of the angular momentum, so A² would be (Ay^2 + Az^2 + ...? Wait, no, the square of the total angular momentum is A² = (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2. So, the eigenvalues of A² are s(s+1)ħ², where s is the spin quantum number. For a muon, which is a lepton, s=1/2, so A² has eigenvalues (3/4) ħ².

But if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, then it's automatically an eigenstate of A², because [A², Ay] = 0. Because A² is the Casimir operator which commutes with all components. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az? Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are not the same. So an eigenstate of Ay cannot be an eigenstate of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm. The matrix given is in the standard basis. The eigenvectors of Ay will form a different basis. So, when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for that representation. So option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Wait, that's a bit confusing. The matrix is given in a certain basis, perhaps not the eigenbasis. So the basis functions (like the standard basis vectors) are not the same as the eigenfunctions of Ay unless the matrix is diagonal in that basis.

In this case, the matrix for Ay is not diagonal. Because S is σy, which is not diagonal. So the standard basis vectors are not the eigenfunctions. Thus, the eigenfunctions form a different basis. So D's statement is correct only if the given basis is the eigenbasis. Since the given matrix is not diagonal, that's not the case. So the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions (standard basis) of Ay as given. So D is incorrect in that sense.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me re-examine the options:

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That's correct because A² and Ay commute, so eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But since Ay and Az don't commute, eigenfunctions of Ay aren't those of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I'm not sure what exactly is meant here. The matrix is in the standard basis, but the eigenfunctions form a different basis. So unless the matrix is diagonal in the standard basis, which it isn't, the statement would be incorrect. So D is incorrect.

So looking back, the correct statements are option C and possibly another one if I made a mistake.

Wait, let's think again about the eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues we found are λ = ±i c, where c = h/(4π). So they are purely imaginary. So the real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ± h/(4π).

Looking at option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't fit.

Option A: imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because 2πh is much larger than h/(4π). So no.

So the only option talking about the eigenvalues correctly isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, no, this is a multiple-choice question, and I need to pick the correct statement.

Wait, let's re-examine the options. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option C is about the eigenfunctions. Let's think again. The square of the angular momentum operator, A², commutes with each component, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So the first part of option C is correct. The second part says the eigenfunction can't be an eigenfunction of Az. Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenstates are not the same. So the statement in C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, perhaps it's suggesting that the eigenvectors are the basis vectors for the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors span the space. But I'm not sure if that's what the statement is implying. Alternatively, it's saying that the eigenfunctions form the basis for the matrix. I think D is correct because any operator's eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, but the matrix representation is in a particular basis. So the eigenfunctions could form an orthonormal basis, but the given matrix is not in that basis. So perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but the operator is 2x2, so it acts on a two-dimensional space. Its eigenvectors, being two, form a basis for that space. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions in their own right. So D's statement is correct. So D says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, the matrix is given in the standard basis, but the eigenfunctions are in a different basis. So the basis functions of the matrix would be the standard basis vectors, which aren't the same as the eigenfunctions. So D's statement is incorrect? Because the matrix is given in a particular basis (say, computational basis), and the eigenfunctions form a different basis.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again about the options.

Option C is correct because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So option C is a correct statement.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the matrix \( A_y - \lambda I \) becomes:

\[
A_y - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 
-\lambda & -i c \\ 
i c & -\lambda 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - \lambda I) = (-\lambda)(-\lambda) - (i c)(i c) = \lambda^2 - (i c)^2.
\]

Since \( (i c)^2 = -c^2 \), the equation becomes:

\[
\lambda^2 + c^2 = 0.
\]

Solving for \( \lambda \), we get:

\[
\lambda = \pm i c.
\]

Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvalues are:

\[
\lambda = \pm i \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, with the imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and real parts equal to zero.

### Step 2: Analysis of the Options
#### **Option A**
This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are zero, not \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

#### **Option B**
This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely imaginary with imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are zero, not \( \pm 1 \).

#### **Option C**
This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so an eigenstate of \( A_y \) cannot be an eigenstate of \( A_z \).

#### **Option D**
This option claims that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is ambiguous but likely incorrect. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the space, but the matrix \( A_y \) is given in the standard basis, which is not diagonal. Therefore, the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the matrix as given.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
