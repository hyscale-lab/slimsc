Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about particle physics and the decay of a boson. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question provides a Lagrangian term, and the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

First, I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the mass of the boson is greater than twice the mass of the fermion. Because E=mc², so the rest mass energy of the fermion pair has to be less than the boson's mass.

So the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let me jot down the masses of the known fermions. The top quark is super heavy, about 173 GeV, so way beyond 6 GeV. But the others are lighter. For example, the bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV, charm about 1.5 GeV, strange around 0.5 GeV, up and down are even lighter, maybe 0.5 GeV each? Then, the charged leptons: electrons are ~0.0005 GeV, muon ~0.1 GeV, tau ~1.77 GeV. Oh wait, wait, wait. Tau is about 1.77 GeV. So twice the tau mass is about 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pairs are allowed.

Wait, but wait: every decay has to be into a pair of particles. So for each fermion f, X can decay into f and f-bar if 2m_f < m_X.

Let me list the possible fermions:

Quarks: u, d, s, c, b, t. But t is too heavy, so can't decay into t t-bar.

Leptons: e, mu, tau. So e, mu, and tau.

Now, the problem says the interaction is given by the Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about that equation. Let me parse it. Oh wait, the structure is like a Yukawa coupling. The term is -λ f (something), but more accurately, the term is probably something like λ f ψ ψ X. So the interaction is X ψ ψ, which means that X can decay into ψ and ψ-bar.

So the decay products would be any fermion-antifermion pair provided their combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

So for each possible fermion:

b quark: mass ~4.5 GeV. 2m_b = 9 GeV. Oh wait, 9 GeV is more than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b b-bar. Because 6 GeV is less than 9 GeV. So b quarks are out.

Similarly, c quark is about 1.5 GeV. 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6, so c c-bar is allowed.

Tau lepton is about 1.77 GeV, so 2m_tau ~3.54 GeV <6 GeV, so tau pairs allowed.

Other quarks: s, u, d are lighter. For example, s is about 0.5 GeV, so 2m_s is 1 GeV <6. So s s-bar allowed.

u and d: even lighter, so definitely allowed.

What about the charged leptons? e and mu. Their masses are negligible. 2m_e is 0.001 GeV, which is way under 6. Similarly, 2m_mu is 0.2 GeV. Both allowed.

But wait, the problem is about the fermions that are allowed in the decay. But the interaction term must be considered. Because the term is L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps the structure is that X is interacting with a single fermion species? Or is it a sum over all possible fermions? Because in a typical Yukawa interaction, the term would be something like X ψ ψ summed over the fermion types it couples to.

Wait, so looking at the Lagrangian, it says fψ_f(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe that's a typo or notation issue, but perhaps the interaction is X ψ_f ψ_f, which would mean that X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f-bar. So for each fermion f that X can interact with, the decay X→ ψ_f ψ_f-bar is allowed, provided the mass condition holds.

But the problem is, which fermions are X allowed to couple to? Because the Lagrangian is given as a specific form. Let me see the structure again: the term is -λ f ψ_f(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and the correct term is something like λ X ψ_f ψ_f, which would be a Yukawa coupling. If that's the case, then X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it couples to, provided the mass condition is satisfied.

But the problem says the interaction is between X and fermions, so I think X can interact with any fermion. So all fermions are possible decay products, provided their mass is less than half of X's mass, which is 3 GeV.

Wait, no, wait. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for each fermion f, 2m_f must be less than 6 GeV. So m_f <3 GeV.

So let's list the fermions with m_f <3 GeV:

- Up quark: ~2.2 MeV (<<3 GeV)
- Down quark: ~4.7 MeV (also <<3)
- Strange quark: ~95 MeV (<<3)
- Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV (OK)
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV (2m_b =9 GeV>6 GeV, so no)
- Top quark: 173 GeV way out.

Leptons:

- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV
- Tau: ~1.77 GeV (2m_tau ~3.54 GeV <6 GeV, so allowed)
So, X can decay into any fermion pair where each fermion has mass <3 GeV.

So the possible fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. But wait, each decay is into a pair of the same fermion, like u u-bar, d d-bar, etc., and same with leptons.

So looking at the options, which include these possibilities.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b, s, u, d, tau+tau-, e+e-.

Wait, but b quark is 4.5 GeV, 2m_b=9 GeV>6 GeV. So that's not allowed. So Option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So c has m=1.5 GeV, so 2m=3 GeV <6 GeV. So allowed. Tau: 1.77*2=3.54 <6. Mu: 0.105*2=0.21<6. So all included in B are allowed. What about c? Yes, allowed.

Option C: same as B but includes t and tau. Wait, no, C also has t, which is way too heavy. Because t quark is 173 GeV, so 2m_t is way over 6 GeV. So X can't decay into t. So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me look again at option B. It says X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+tau-, mu+mu-, e+e-. Yes, all these are allowed. Because 2m_c=3 GeV <6, 2m_tau ~3.54 GeV <6.

So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be allowed, the mass of the boson must satisfy \( 2m_f < m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass of the Boson**: The boson \( X \) has a mass of 6 GeV. Therefore, the maximum mass of the fermion pair \( f \bar{f} \) that \( X \) can decay into is \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (since \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

2. **Fermion Masses**:
   - **Quarks**:
     - \( u, d, s \): Masses are much less than 3 GeV, so \( X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s} \) are allowed.
     - \( c \): Mass is approximately 1.5 GeV, so \( X \to c \bar{c} \) is allowed.
     - \( b \): Mass is approximately 4.5 GeV, so \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), making \( X \to b \bar{b} \) forbidden.
     - \( t \): Mass is approximately 173 GeV, so \( X \to t \bar{t} \) is forbidden.
   - **Leptons**:
     - \( e \): Mass is negligible, so \( X \to e^+ e^- \) is allowed.
     - \( \mu \): Mass is approximately 0.105 GeV, so \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \) is allowed.
     - \( \tau \): Mass is approximately 1.77 GeV, so \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.54 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \), making \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \) allowed.

3. **Interaction Term**: The Lagrangian term \( \mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y) \) indicates that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs \( f \bar{f} \). Thus, \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \), provided the mass condition \( 2m_f < m_X \) is satisfied.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, A is incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, B is correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( X \to t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden because \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, C is incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, D is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order are \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), corresponding to **Option B**.
