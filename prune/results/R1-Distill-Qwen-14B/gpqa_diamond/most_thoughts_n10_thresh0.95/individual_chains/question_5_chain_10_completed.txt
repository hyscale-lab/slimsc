Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see. The operator is given as P, and we're looking for its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator is in an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin are often represented by Pauli matrices, but I'm not entirely sure how that works here.

Wait, the problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of their matrices. So Px, Py, and Pz are each 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write down what each component is.

Px is (ħ/2) times a matrix with elements [0 1; 1 0]. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [0 -i; i 0], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And Pz is (ħ/2) times [1 0; 0 -1], the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P must be a vector operator, meaning it's given in terms of components along x, y, and z. So the operator P itself would be the vector sum in the direction of n. So if n is in the x-z plane, it can be expressed in terms of its components along x and z, but no y component because it's in the x-z plane. So n would have components (n_x, 0, n_z), right?

Wait, but for a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1. So any direction in the x-z plane can be written as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if we use spherical coordinates. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? I think θ is the angle from the z-axis. So yeah, n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) but since it's in x-z, phi is 0 or 180? Or actually, since it's in the x-z plane, the angle phi is 0, so the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, the x-z plane would have any angle for phi=0 or pi, because phi is the angle in the xy-plane. So in x-z, phi is 0 or pi, making the direction (sinθ, 0, cosθ) but with theta measured from the z-axis. Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently.

Alternatively, since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (a, 0, b), where a² + b² =1. So any unit vector in x-z plane is (cosθ, 0, sinθ), assuming θ is the angle from the x-axis. Wait, no, from the x-axis, it's the usual polar coordinates. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as n = (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² =1.

So the operator P would be given by P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. 

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, so P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So substituting P into this equation: (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> 

Since each component of P is multiplied by ħ/2, let's factor that out. P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly for others. So:

( n_x (ħ/2) σ_x + n_z (ħ/2) σ_z ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Factor out (ħ/2):

(ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can cancel (ħ/2) from both sides, assuming ħ ≠0:

(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) |ψ> = |ψ>

So now, the equation is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) |ψ> = |ψ>

We can write this as a matrix. The matrices for σ_x and σ_z are:

σ_x = [[0, 1],
        [1, 0]]

σ_z = [[1, 0],
        [0, -1]]

So n_x σ_x is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]], and n_z σ_z is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]].

Adding these together:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix M is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

The eigenvalues of M are determined by solving det(M - λ I) =0.

The determinant equation is (n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) - (n_x)^2 = 0.

Expanding:

(-n_z^2 - λ n_z + λ n_z + λ^2) - n_x^2 = 0
Wait, let me compute (n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) = (-n_z^2 - λ n_z + λ n_z + λ^2) = λ^2 - n_z^2.

So determinant equation: λ^2 - n_z^2 - n_x^2 =0.

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 (since n is a unit vector), this becomes λ^2 -1=0 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

We're interested in the eigenvalue +1.

So the eigenvector equation is (M - I) |ψ> =0.

M - I is [[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]]

So the matrix is:

Row 1: (n_z -1)   n_x

Row 2: n_x       (-n_z -1)

We can write this as a system of equations:

(n_z -1) ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ =0

n_x ψ₁ + (-n_z -1) ψ₂ =0

Let me take the first equation: (n_z -1) ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ =0 → ψ₂ = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] ψ₁, assuming n_x ≠0.

Wait, but if n_x is zero, then the direction is along z. But in our case, n lies in x-z, so it's possible that n_x is zero (pointing along z). But the problem says it's an arbitrary direction, so we can't assume n_x is zero. So proceed.

So ψ₂ = [(1 - n_z)/n_x] ψ₁

Let me represent the eigenvector as [ψ₁, ψ₂]^T.

Now, let's substitute ψ₂ into the second equation.

n_x ψ₁ + (-n_z -1) ψ₂ =0 → n_x ψ₁ + (-n_z -1) [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ψ₁ ] =0

Multiply through by n_x to eliminate the denominator:

n_x^2 ψ₁ + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) ψ₁ = 0

Factor ψ₁:

[ n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z) ] ψ₁=0

Compute the bracket:

Expand (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z) = (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z)

= -n_z + n_z^2 -1 + n_z 

Simplify: (-n_z +n_z) cancels out, so we have n_z^2 -1.

So the bracket becomes:

n_x^2 + (n_z^2 -1) = [n_x^2 +n_z^2 ] -1 

But n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1, so this is 1 -1=0.

So the equation is 0 * ψ₁=0 → which is always true. So the first equation is sufficient to find the eigenvector.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ψ₁, (1 - n_z)/n_x ψ₁ ]

So, for simplicity, set ψ₁ =1. Then ψ₂ = (1 -n_z)/n_x.

So the eigenvector is [1, (1-n_z)/n_x ]^T.

But wait, we need to normalize it. So the normalization condition is |ψ₁|^2 + |ψ₂|^2=1.

Compute |ψ₁|^2 + |ψ₂|^2 = 1^2 + | (1-n_z)/n_x |^2.

So 1 + ( (1 -n_z)^2 ) / (n_x^2 )

But n_x^2 =1 - n_z^2, because n_x² + n_z^2 =1.

So (1 -n_z)^2 / (1 -n_z^2 ) = [ (1 -n_z)^2 ] / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ] ) = [ (1 -n_z) ] / [1 +n_z ]

So the normalization factor becomes sqrt( 1 + [ (1-n_z)/(1 +n_z) ] )

Wait, let me compute it:

Let me compute the denominator after substituting n_x² =1 -n_z².

So denominator = 1 + (1 -n_z)^2 / (1 -n_z^2 )

Which is 1 + [ (1 -n_z)^2 ] / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ]

Simplify numerator:

(1 -n_z)^2 = (1 -n_z)(1 -n_z )

Denominator is (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z )

So the fraction becomes [ (1 -n_z)(1 -n_z) ] / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ] = (1 -n_z)/(1 +n_z )

So the sum is 1 + (1 -n_z)/(1 +n_z )

Combine the terms:

[ (1 +n_z) + (1 -n_z) ] / (1 +n_z ) = [2 ] / (1 +n_z )

So the sum is 2/(1 +n_z )

Therefore, the normalization factor is sqrt(2/(1 +n_z )) )

Wait, because the normalization is sqrt( [1 + (1 -n_z)^2/(1 -n_z^2) ] ) = sqrt( 2/(1 +n_z) )

So the eigenvector, when normalized, is [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), [1 -n_z]/(n_x sqrt(2/(1 +n_z)) )) ]

Wait, maybe I should express ψ₁ and ψ₂ with the normalization factor.

Alternatively, since the eigenvector is [1, (1 -n_z)/n_x ]^T, and the normalization is sqrt(2/(1 +n_z)), the normalized vector is:

ψ = [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) , (1 -n_z)/(n_x sqrt(2/(1 +n_z))) ) ]

Simplify the second component:

(1 -n_z)/(n_x sqrt(2/(1 +n_z))) ) = (1 -n_z) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/(2) ) ) / n_x

But n_x^2 =1 -n_z^2 = (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z )

So n_x = sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )

Wait, but the direction in x-z plane can have n_x positive or negative. But when you take the square root, you have to consider the sign. But perhaps we can take n_x positive for simplicity, as the direction is arbitrary.

So, n_x = sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )

So, (1 -n_z)/(n_x) = (1 -n_z) / sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/(1 +n_z) )

So the second component becomes sqrt( (1 -n_z)/(1 +n_z) ) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

= sqrt( (1 -n_z) (1 +n_z) ) / sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) )

Wait, no:

Wait, the second component is (1 -n_z)/(n_x ) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

But (1 -n_z)/(n_x ) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/(1 +n_z) )

So:

sqrt( (1 -n_z)/(1 +n_z) ) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

= sqrt( (1 -n_z) (1 +n_z) / (1 +n_z) ) * 1/sqrt(2) )

Wait, no, let me compute it step by step.

sqrt(a) * sqrt(b) = sqrt(a*b).

So, (1 -n_z)/(n_x) = sqrt( (1-n_z)/(1 +n_z) )

Multiply by sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

So sqrt( (1-n_z)/(1 +n_z) ) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) = sqrt( (1-n_z) * (1 +n_z) / (1 +n_z) ) / sqrt(2) )

Wait, that's: sqrt( (1-n_z) * (1 +n_z) ) / (1 +n_z) ) ?

No, wait, it's sqrt( (1-n_z)/(1 +n_z) * (1 +n_z)/2 ) )

The (1 +n_z) cancels out:

sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

So the second component is sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck.

So, the first component is sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), and the second is sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But wait, what about the sign? Because in the original eigenvector, the second component was (1 -n_z)/n_x, which is positive if n_x is positive, but when normalized, does the sign matter?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me double-check.

The eigenvector from the equation is [1, (1 -n_z)/n_x ]

Which, when normalized, becomes [ a, a*(1 -n_z)/n_x ], where a is the normalization factor.

The normalization factor is sqrt(1 + ( (1 -n_z)^2/(n_x^2) ) )

But n_x^2 = 1 -n_z^2, so:

a^2 = 1 / [ 1 + ( (1 -n_z)^2 )/(1 -n_z^2 ) ]

= [1 -n_z^2 ] / [ (1 -n_z^2 ) + (1 -n_z)^2 ]

Wait, denominator:

(1 -n_z^2 ) + (1 -2n_z +n_z^2 ) = 1 -n_z^2 +1 -2n_z +n_z^2 = 2 -2n_z

So a^2 = (1 -n_z^2 ) / (2 -2n_z )

= (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z ) / [ 2(1 -n_z) ) ] = (1 +n_z ) / 2

So a = sqrt( (1 +n_z )/ 2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

ψ = [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) * (1 -n_z)/n_x )

But (1 -n_z)/n_x = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/(1 +n_z) )

So:

ψ₂ = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/(1 +n_z) )

= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

So the components are:

ψ = [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Hmm, that looks familiar. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin-up state along some direction n can be written as:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |1>

But in our case, phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane (so phi is either 0 or pi, but since n is arbitrary, perhaps the solution has to account for that? Alternatively, maybe the eigenvector is written without the phase factor because n is in the x-z plane and the direction's azimuthal angle phi is zero. So the phase factor e^{i phi} becomes 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is written as [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Wait, but n_z is cos(theta), if theta is the angle from the z-axis. So let's define theta as the polar angle from the z-axis. Then n_z = cos(theta), and n_x = sin(theta) (since in x-z, the direction is (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)) ), but wait, if theta is the angle from the z-axis, then n_z = cos(theta), and n_x is sin(theta) * cos(phi). But since we're in x-z, phi is zero or pi. So n_x = sin(theta) * 1, assuming phi=0.

So substituting n_z = cos(theta), the components become:

sqrt( (1 + cos(theta))/2 ) and sqrt( (1 - cos(theta))/2 )

Recognize that (1 + cos(theta))/2 = cos^2(theta/2)

Similarly, (1 - cos(theta))/2 = sin^2(theta/2)

So the components become cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2)

Thus, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but what about the phase? Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have a phase factor, but the problem doesn't specify any. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Looking at the options, let's check:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like a spherical harmonic or an angular momentum eigenstate, but I think the correct one is C.

Wait, but the question says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So theta is the angle from the z-axis, so the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Looking at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait. The problem says to calculate the eigenvector for P with eigenvalue +ħ/2. But in the earlier steps, we found that the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but wait a second. The operator P is proportional to the Pauli matrices, which are spin matrices. So eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along direction n.

So the spin-up state along n is indeed represented as [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But in this problem, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so e^{i phi} is 1, so the state simplifies to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The components are:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli X matrix),
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Y matrix),
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Z matrix).

The operator $\vec{P}$ in the direction of $\vec{n}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane, satisfying $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle.
\]

Substituting $\vec{P}$ into the equation and factoring out $\hbar/2$, we get:

\[
(n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z) | \psi \rangle = | \psi \rangle,
\]

where $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices. The matrix representation of $(n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z)$ is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of this matrix are $\pm 1$, and we are interested in the eigenvalue $+1$. Solving the eigenvalue equation $(M - I)| \psi \rangle = 0$, where $M = n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z$, we find the eigenvector proportional to:

\[
| \psi \rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize this eigenvector, we compute the normalization factor:

\[
\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{1 - n_z}{n_x}\right)^2}.
\]

Using $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$, we simplify the normalization factor to:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{2}{1 + n_z}}.
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Substituting $n_z = \cos\theta$ and $n_x = \sin\theta$ (where $\theta$ is the angle of $\vec{n}$ from the z-axis), the eigenvector simplifies to:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the form of the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it corresponds to a spherical harmonic representation, not the spin-up state.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the derived eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and complicates the normalization.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
