Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. Then it's asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. Oh wait, but how does that relate to the number of stars?

The number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let's write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since d is 1/plx, substituting that in, N would be proportional to d^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think they're asking for the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at a distance r. So like, the number per unit volume in that shell.

I remember that the volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in a shell would be proportional to the density times the volume. If the number of stars is proportional to r^5, then the density (number per unit volume) would be N/(volume) which is r^5/(r² dr) )= r^3/(dr). Wait, but that seems a bit off.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think. The number of stars in a region is proportional to 1/plx^5, and since plx is 1/d, that's d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Now, if I have a small change in distance dr, the number of stars in that slice dr would be d^5 multiplied by something. But wait, the total number isn't just d^5; I think I need to consider the number per unit volume, perhaps.

Wait, maybe it's better to express N as a function of d. Since N ∝ d^5, the number per unit distance would be d^5. But that's not accounting for how many stars are in a thin shell. Oh wait, no, because the number of stars depends on the volume up to distance d, but in this case, the question is about the number per unit distance, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the initial statement is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when plx increases (which means closer stars), the number of stars decreases as 1/(plx^5).

Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So for a given distance range, say from r to r + dr, how does the number of stars change?

Hmm, but N is proportional to d^5, so the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be the derivative of N with respect to d. So dN/dr = derivative of (k d^5) with respect to d, which is 5k d^4. So the rate of change is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So maybe it's the derivative, which is 5 d^4. But looking at the options, I don't see an option with d^4. Wait, the options are in terms of r, so perhaps it's expressed as r^4. Option C is r^4.

Wait, but the options are about how the number changes, so the rate of change is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases as r^4 when moving to larger distances. So the correct option is C) ~ r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it in terms of the number density. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit volume (density) would be N/(volume), and the volume up to distance d is (4/3)π d^3. So the density would be (d^5)/(d^3) = d^2. But that's the density, not the number in a shell. Wait, but the number in a shell dr is 4πd² dr multiplied by the density. If the density is d^2, then the number in the shell would be 4π d^2 * d^2 dr = 4 π d^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (dr) is proportional to d^4. So that again points to option C, r^4.

So the correct answer should be C.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with distance as \( d^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we consider the number of stars in a thin spherical shell of thickness \( dr \) at distance \( r \). The volume of this shell is proportional to \( r^2 \, dr \), and the number of stars in the shell is proportional to the density of stars multiplied by the volume. Since the total number of stars \( N \propto r^5 \), the density of stars is proportional to \( \frac{N}{\text{volume}} \propto \frac{r^5}{r^3} = r^2 \). Therefore, the number of stars in the shell is proportional to \( r^2 \cdot r^2 \, dr = r^4 \, dr \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of distance (\( r \)) increases with distance as \( r^4 \). This corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
