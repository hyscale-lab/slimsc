Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, specifically something to do with stars and exoplanets. Let's try to unpack what's being asked here.

The question is about comparing the brightness variation caused by a planet transiting a star with the variations caused by star spots. So, the setup is that a star similar to the Sun has some dark spots on one hemisphere. These spots have a filling factor of 20%, meaning they cover 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K.

The key point is that when the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing the observed brightness (as seen from Earth) to vary. This variation can mimic the effect of a planet transiting the star, which also causes a dip in brightness as the planet blocks some light.

The task is to find out what radius a hypothetical planet would need to have to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots. So, if the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would create the same signal in the light curve?

Hmm, okay. So I think I need to compute the relative change in brightness (the signal) caused by the spots and then figure out what planet size would cause the same change.

Let me start by recalling how the transit method works. When a planet passes in front of a star, it blocks a fraction of the star's light. The change in brightness (ΔF) is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the change is (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

But wait, this is for a planet transiting the star. The problem here is about star spots. So I need to model the spots as regions that are dimmer than the rest of the star.

So, the first step is to calculate the change in brightness caused by the spots. Since the spots are cooler, they emit less light. So when they come into view, the total brightness of the star decreases.

Let me think about this. The star's total brightness is the sum of all the light from its surface. If a part of the star (like a spot) is cooler, it contributes less light. So the brightness variation when the spot is visible would depend on the area of the spot and how much less bright each spot is compared to the rest of the star.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun, Rstar = R_sun. The spots are covering 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface area. So one hemisphere is 50% of the star's total surface area. So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the fraction of the star's surface area covered by spots is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10% of the star's total surface.

But wait, the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. The hemisphere's area is (4π Rstar²)/2 = 2 π Rstar². So the spot area is 0.2 * 2 π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The total area of the star is 4π Rstar². One hemisphere is 2π Rstar². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so the spot area is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

Now, each spot is cooler. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, so the flux per unit area (like the Stefan-Boltzmann law) is σ T^4. So the normal flux from the star is F = σ (6000)^4. The spots have a temperature of 5000 K, so their flux is F_spot = σ (5000)^4.

The difference in flux between the spots and the rest of the star is ΔF per unit area: (F - F_spot) = σ (6000^4 - 5000^4).

The total decrease in flux when the spots are facing us is the area of the spots multiplied by this difference. But wait, when the spots are on the near side, the star's overall flux is reduced by the amount that the spots contribute. So the change in flux ΔF is (Area of spots) * (F - F_spot).

Wait, no. Because the spots are cooler, when they are in view, the total flux is lower than when they are not. So the change in flux when the spots are visible is ΔF = (Area of spots) * (F_spot - F), but since F_spot < F, this would be negative. Alternatively, the relative change in flux is (ΔF)/(F_total), where F_total is the total flux without spots.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the fractional change in brightness. The total flux without any spots is F_total = 4π Rstar² * F (since F is already per unit area). When the spots are visible, the flux is F_total_spots = (4π Rstar² - Area_spots) * F + Area_spots * F_spot.

So, the fractional change in flux is (F_total - F_total_spots) / F_total.

Let me compute that.

F_total = 4π Rstar² * F = 4π Rstar² σ T^4.

F_total_spots = (4π Rstar² - A_spots) * F + A_spots * F_spot.

Which is F_total_spots = 4π Rstar² F - A_spots (F - F_spot).

So, F_total - F_total_spots = A_spots (F - F_spot).

Thus, fractional change is [A_spots (F - F_spot)] / [4π Rstar² F] 

= (A_spots / (4π Rstar²)) * (F - F_spot)/F.

Now, A_spots is the area covered by spots. Wait, earlier calculation: A_spots = 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

So, (A_spots / (4 π Rstar²)) ) = (0.4 π Rstar²) / (4 π Rstar²) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1.

That's 10% of the star's surface covered by spots.

Then (F - F_spot)/F = [σ (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [σ (6000^4)] ) = (6000^4 -5000^4)/(6000^4).

Calculate that:

Let me compute 6000^4: 6^4 = 1296, so 6000^4 = 1296e12 (I think in terms of (K)^4, but units don't matter here).

Similarly, 5000^4 = 5^4 = 625, so 625e12.

So the difference is 671e12 (1296e12 - 625e12 = (1296-625)*e12 = 671e12).

So (671e12)/(1296e12) = 671/1296 ≈ 0.517.

So, the fractional change is 0.1 * 0.517 ≈ 0.0517, or about 5.17% decrease in brightness when the spots are facing us.

Wait, but wait a second. The star has only one hemisphere with spots. So only when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute to the brightness dip. So the variation in brightness would be this 5.17% when the spots are visible, and when the other hemisphere is visible (no spots), the brightness is higher.

Wait, but wait, the spots are on only one hemisphere. So the star's brightness varies as the spotted hemisphere rotates into and out of view.

So, the maximum dip is 5.17% when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

But the key here is that the variation in flux is 5.17% when the spots are visible. But since the star is only partially spotted, perhaps the maximum dip is when all spots are facing us. But wait, the star is rotating, so when the hemisphere with spots is facing us, we see the spots. The other time, we don't.

Wait, but for the purpose of the light curve, the modulation would be a dip in brightness when the spotted area is visible. So the maximum dip is 5.17% when all the spots are in view. But since the star is a sphere, the spots are only on one side, so the change would be when that side is visible.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, it's "as only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation." So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute to a dip in brightness. When the other hemisphere (without spots) is facing, the star is at maximum brightness.

So the maximum dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. So the fractional change in brightness is 5.17% (assuming all the spots are visible when the hemisphere is facing us). But wait, the spot filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so when the hemisphere is facing us, only 20% of its area (which is half the star) is spots. So the actual area of spots facing us is 0.2 * (2π Rstar²) = 0.4 π Rstar². So the earlier calculation leads to a 5.17% dip.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The star has a radius R, so the total surface area is 4 π R².

The spotty hemisphere is 2 π R², and 20% of that is spots. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are covering 0.4 π R² of the star's surface. The rest of the star (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) is normal.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is:

F_spots_visible = (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) * F + 0.4 π R² * F_spot.

The normal flux is F_normal = 4 π R² * F.

So the fractional change is (F_normal - F_spots_visible) / F_normal.

Which is:

[ (4 π R² F - (4 π R² - 0.4 π R²) F - 0.4 π R² F_spot ) ] / (4 π R² F )

Simplify:

= [ (4 π R² F - 4 π R² F + 0.4 π R² F - 0.4 π R² F_spot ) ] / (4 π R² F )

= [0.4 π R² (F - F_spot) ] / (4 π R² F )

The π R² terms cancel out.

= [0.4 (F - F_spot)] / (4 F )

= (0.4/4) * (F - F_spot)/F

= 0.1 * (F - F_spot)/F.

Which is what we had earlier.

So, 0.1 * (6000^4 - 5000^4)/(6000^4) = 0.1 * (671/1296) ≈ 0.1 * 0.517 ≈ 0.0517, or 5.17% decrease.

Now, the brightness variation is 5.17% when the spots are visible. But wait, the question says that this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal, what is the planet's radius compared to the star's radius?

So, the planet would cause a dip in brightness when it transits. The dip amplitude is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

Because the planet blocks a part of the star's light, so the fractional change is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but that's when the planet is exactly in front, blocking that area. So the maximum dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

In our case, the dip due to spots is 5.17%. So the planet's dip would have to be the same, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517.

So solving for Rp/Rstar:

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ sqrt(0.0517) → Let me calculate that.

What's sqrt(0.0517)? Well, 0.0517 is about 0.05.

sqrt(0.05) is about 0.2236. But wait, 0.05 is 5% so 0.0517 is a bit higher.

Wait, 0.228^2 is approximately 0.051984 because 0.228 * 0.228 = (0.23 - 0.002)^2 ≈ 0.0529 - 0.002*0.46 + 0.000004 ≈ 0.0529 - 0.00092 + 0.000004 ≈ ~0.052.

Wait, wait, let me actually compute 0.228^2:

0.228 * 0.228.

0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.

0.2 * 0.028 = 0.0056, twice (since both terms are 0.2 and 0.028 but cross terms). So 2 * 0.0056 = 0.0112.

0.028 * 0.028 = 0.000784.

So adding up: 0.04 + 0.0112 = 0.0512, plus 0.000784 is 0.051984. So 0.228^2 = approx 0.051984, which is about 5.2%—close to our value of 5.17%.

So, sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.2275.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.228.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, option A is ~0.39, B is 0.07, C is 0.11.

Wait, 0.228 isn't one of the options... Hmm.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-express the dip due to the planet. The dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So the dip is 5.17%, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.2275, which is approximately 0.23.

But none of the options are around 0.23. Hmm. So perhaps I messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the dip due to the spots is not 5.17% but smaller. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, the calculation was:

(F - F_spot)/F = (6000^4 -5000^4)/(6000^4) = (6000^4)/(6000^4) - (5000^4)/(6000^4) = 1 - (5/6)^4.

Because 5000 is 5/6 of 6000.

So, 5/6 is approx 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

So 0.517747 * 0.1 (from the 10% area) is 0.0517747 ≈ 5.177% dip. So earlier calculation is correct.

Wait, so the dip is about 5.177%. So the planet's dip would have to be the same, meaning (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177, so Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275. So approximately 0.228.

But the options given don't have this value. Hmm.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.11, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, perhaps I forgot something about the geometry. Oh, wait a second! The star's radius is Rstar, and the planet is orbiting in front of the star, but the area blocked is (Rp/Rstar)^2, but wait, the star has a radius Rstar, and the planet's radius is Rp. The area blocked is π Rp² / π Rstar² = (Rp/Rstar)^2. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the spot's effect is not actually a dip of 5.17%, but something else. Let me think again. Oh! Wait, the star's total flux is the sum of all the flux from each part of the star. When the spot is visible, the flux from that area is lower. So the dip is (area of spots) * (F - F_spot) / (total flux).

Wait, but the total flux is F_total = 4 π Rstar² * F.

When the spots are visible, the flux is (4 π Rstar² - A_spots) * F + A_spots * F_spot.

So the difference is F_total - [ (4 π Rstar² - A_spots) F + A_spots F_spot ] = A_spots (F - F_spot).

So the fractional change is [A_spots (F - F_spot)] / [4 π Rstar² F ].

Which we've calculated as 0.0517.

So the dip is 5.17%.

But perhaps I should think about the maximum possible dip. Wait, when the entire star is covered by spots, the dip would be (F - F_spot). But in this case, only 10% of the star's surface is spotted.

Wait, but perhaps another factor is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. So the dip is when the spots are in front. So the dip is the 5.17% I calculated.

But the planet would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2. So for the same amplitude, (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.0517 → Rp/Rstar= sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.2275.

But in the options, the closest is option C) ~0.11, which is way lower. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the star's brightness variation due to the spots is not just the area times the difference in flux, but perhaps considering that the spots are cooler but only on a hemisphere. Wait, no, because when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute that amount to the dip.

Wait, perhaps because only one hemisphere is spotty, the maximum dip is when that hemisphere is fully visible, but perhaps the actual dip is when the spots are facing us, and the other hemisphere is at full brightness. So perhaps the calculation is correct.

Wait, but maybe I should think of the maximum dip as when the planet blocks a certain area, but the effect of the spots is a steady dip. Hmm, no, because as the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, so the dip caused by the spots is the 5.17% I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio of the dip caused by the planet to the dip caused by the spots. And set them equal, then solve for Rp/Rstar.

So, the dip from spots is 5.17%, dip from planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 5.17%.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(5.17%) → sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.2275. So approximately 0.228.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's re-look at the problem statement and the options.

The options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, maybe I forgot to consider that the star's spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view, but perhaps the other hemisphere is not completely spot-free. No, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the rest is normal.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me re-calculate the area.

The problem says that the filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Hemisphere area is 2 π R^2.

So spots area = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

Which is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1 → 10% of the star's total surface.

So that was correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is not about the dip in brightness when the spots are visible, but the variation in brightness caused by the rotation, i.e., the difference between when the spots are visible and when they aren't. So the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible, and the minimum is when all the spots are visible. The amplitude is the difference between these two.

Wait, but in the case of a planet, the dip only happens when the planet transits. So the amplitude is the dip, which is when the planet is in front. So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But perhaps in the case of the star, the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, which would be 5.17%.

Wait, but the question says, "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star."

So, the amplitude of the brightness variation is equal for both the star with spots and the planet transit. So the amplitude for the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2, and the amplitude for the star is 5.17%. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But that's not any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot's effect. Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation due to the spots is not the dip but the variation as the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip, and then go out of view, returning to full brightness. So the amplitude is the 5.17% dip.

But perhaps the planet's effect is a steady dip, whereas the star's effect varies with rotation. But the question says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So perhaps the maximum dip is the same as the planet's dip.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the star's brightness varying between 1 and (1 - 0.0517) → 0.9483 when the spots are fully visible. So the amplitude is 0.0517 (the dip).

The planet would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2. So to have the same amplitude, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.2275.

Again, same result. But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the fractional change due to the spots.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the fractional change in brightness as (F_spot - F) instead of (F - F_spot).

Because when the spots are visible, the flux is lower, so F_total_spots = F_total - A_spots (F - F_spot).

So the dip is A_spots (F - F_spot) / F_total.

Which is same as before. So 5.17% dip.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the fact that the planet's transit affects the brightness more because it's a flat disk blocking the center of the star, whereas the spots are spread over the surface. Hmm, but that shouldn't matter for the total dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's variation is not a dip but a rise when the spots are not visible. Wait, no. When the spots are not visible (other hemisphere), the brightness is higher, but when the spots are visible (this hemisphere), it's lower. So the maximum dip is 5.17%, and the maximum brightness is 100%.

So the amplitude is the dip of 5.17%.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the maximum possible dip (when the entire star were covered) and the actual dip here.

But according to the problem, the star is not entirely covered, but only 20% of one hemisphere.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem is about the same signal, but maybe the star's variation is a sinusoidal variation due to the spot rotation. The planet's transit would cause a sharp dip, but the question is about the amplitude, not the shape.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation has a certain amplitude, which is the same as the planet's dip.

So in that case, the calculation is correct, but perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of (Rp/Rstar)^2.

(0.2275)^2 = 0.05178, which is correct.

So, why are none of the options near 0.23?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the dip but the variation in brightness as a function of rotational phase. Let me think again.

Wait, the star is rotating, and the spots come into and out of view. The maximum dip is 5.17%, and the brightness variation would be modulated, but the amplitude of the brightness variation would be the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, which is 5.17%.

The planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2. So for the same amplitude, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But that's not any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional change due to the spots. Let me re-calculate.

The area of spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere) → 0.2 * (2 π R²) → 0.4 π R².

The total area of the star is 4 π R².

The fractional area of spots is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1 → 10%.

Each spot has a flux of F_spot = σ T_spot^4 = σ (5000)^4.

The normal flux per unit area is F = σ (6000)^4.

So the fractional difference per spot is (F - F_spot)/F = 1 - (5000/6000)^4 = 1 - (5/6)^4.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So the fractional change due to the spots is 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775, which is 5.1775%.

So the dip is about 5.18%.

So then, the planet's (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

Again, that's about 0.228.

Looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the dip but the variation in brightness due to the planet's orbital phase, which I don't think is the case. The question says the star's brightness variation is due to rotational modulation, and this can resemble an exoplanet transit.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the situation where the star's rotation causes a dip in brightness that is similar in amplitude to a planet transit. So the maximum dip is 5.17% as we found.

But the exoplanet's transit dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So setting that equal to 5.17% gives Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.228, which is about 0.23.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's radius is the same as the Sun, but the planet's radius is relative to the star. So perhaps I messed up the units. No, because Rstar is given, and Rp is relative to Rstar.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the area blocked by the planet, but also considering limb darkening or something else. But in this calculation, we're assuming uniform brightness across the star, so limb darkening isn't considered.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are only on one hemisphere, and as the star rotates, the spots come into view, but the other side is normal. So perhaps the variation in brightness isn't a full dip but a partial one, and the amplitude is the difference between when the spots are entering and exiting the view.

Wait, but the maximum dip when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible is 5.17%, and that's the amplitude we're considering.

So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 0.23, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the area of the spots is 20% of the entire star's surface. The problem says "one hemisphere" is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the area is 20% of the hemisphere.

Ah, wait! Wait a minute. The entire star's surface is 4 π R². One hemisphere is 2 π R². If the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere, the area is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So the fraction of the star's surface area covered by spots is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, which is 10%. So the calculation was correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or I'm missing something. But since the options don't have 0.23, perhaps I should re-examine the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the area of the spots as 20% of the star's surface, not the hemisphere. That would be a miscalculation on my part. Let's re-express this.

If the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, then the area is 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R².

So the area of the spots is 0.8 π R².

Then, the fractional area is 0.8 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.2 → 20% of the star's surface is covered.

In this case, the fractional change in brightness would be 0.2 * (F - F_spot)/F = 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355, or 10.355% dip.

Then, setting (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.322, which is close to option D) ~0.32.

Ah! That makes sense. So perhaps I misinterpreted the filling factor.

The problem says, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor of 20% is for the hemisphere, not the entire star.

But if the user thought that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then the area would be 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R². Then the calculation would proceed as before, leading to (Rp/Rstar)=0.32.

So perhaps the confusion is in the interpretation of the filling factor. If the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then the area is 20% of 4 π R², leading to a dip of 10.355%, which would require a planet of radius ~0.32 Rstar.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the problem states that the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the correct approach is the one I did earlier, leading to 0.227. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on the hemisphere, but when the star rotates, the spots only cover a certain portion as seen from Earth. For example, when the star is viewed edge-on, the entire hemisphere's spots would be visible, but as the star rotates, the spots would come in and out of view, but perhaps the maximum area blocked is only a portion.

Wait, but no, the problem states that the star's rotation causes periodic variation, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are fully visible, causing maximum dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as a delta in brightness, but not accounting for the entire area.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the maximum signal from the planet to be the same as the minimum brightness variation caused by the spots.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots, and this can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation from the spots would be the same as from the planet's transit.

So, the dip from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

The dip from the spots is 5.177% → 0.05177.

So, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is C) ~0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121)= 0.11, which is (0.11)^2=0.0121, which is 1.21% dip. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the dip but the overall brightness variation, considering that the star's brightness is modulated as the spots rotate into and out of view. The maximum dip is 5.17%, and the average brightness is the same as before.

So the amplitude is 5.17%.

But again, that would require the planet to have a dip of 5.17%, leading to Rp/Rstar=0.2275.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the change in brightness not as a dip but as a variation due to the spots being on the day side or night side as the star rotates. But that's more related to starspots causing changes in the measured brightness as the star's rotation brings spots into and out of view, but in a way that could mimic a planet's transit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as a function of the planet's orbital phase, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation due to spots is similar to a planet's transit, but in terms of the light curve shape. For the same amplitude, but perhaps the duration or the depth.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of relative changes in brightness when the spots are present and absent.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the star's brightness variation is not a full dip but a partial one, so the amplitude is the difference between the two brightness levels.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible, and the minimum is when all spots are visible. So the amplitude is the difference between max and min, which is 5.17%.

The planet's transit would cause a dip equal to (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So setting (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But again, not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the entire area of the spots but only a portion. Wait, let me re-read the problem statement.

"One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

Ah, so the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2 π R²) = 0.4 π R².

So the earlier calculations are correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000 K. But perhaps I should calculate the flux ratio correctly.

Wait, let me recalculate the flux ratio.

F = σ T^4.

F_spot = σ (T - ΔT)^4 = σ (5000)^4.

F = σ (6000)^4.

So, F_spot / F = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So, F - F_spot = F (1 - 0.482253) = F * 0.517747.

So, the dip is 5.17747% of the total flux.

So, the dip is 5.177%, leading to Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the fractional change as (F_spot - F) instead, but that would give a negative dip, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me see what the options are again.

Option C is 0.11, which would correspond to (0.11)^2 = 0.0121, which is 1.21% dip. That's much smaller than our 5.17% dip.

Option D is 0.32 → (0.32)^2 = 0.1024 → 10.24% dip.

Hmm, that would be the dip if the area of the spots was 20% of the entire star (0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R² → 20% of the star's surface). So, if the filling factor was 20% of the entire star, the dip would be 10.24%, which matches option D.

But the problem states that the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, not the entire star. So perhaps the intended answer is D) ~0.32, assuming that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star. But according to the problem statement, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere.

So, perhaps the intended answer is not matching the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on the hemisphere, and the area is 20% of the hemisphere, but the star's radius is the same as the Sun, and the planet's radius is being compared to the star's radius.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The dip due to the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2. The dip due to the spots is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.05177.

So, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, which is approximately 0.23.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps the intended answer is C) ~0.11.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip due to the spots. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the spots are cooler, so when they are on the far side, the star appears brighter, leading to a variation in brightness that could be interpreted as a planet. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the difference in brightness when the spots are on the near side and the far side, leading to a modulation in brightness as the star rotates. The amplitude of this modulation would be the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

So, the star's brightness when spots are visible is F_1 = F_total - A_spots (F - F_spot).

The brightness when spots are not visible (other hemisphere) is F_2 = F_total.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_2 - F_1) = A_spots (F - F_spot).

Thus, the fractional amplitude is (F_2 - F_1)/F_2 = [A_spots (F - F_spot)] / F_total.

Which is the same as before: 5.17%.

So, same conclusion.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is not present, but considering the options, the closest would be option D) ~0.32, assuming the filling factor was 20% of the entire star. But according to the problem, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so that approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the area again. Let me think of the star's radius as R. The hemisphere area is 2 π R², and 20% of that is 0.4 π R².

So, the area of the spots is 0.4 π R².

The star's total area is 4 π R².

So, the fraction is 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1, as before.

So, the dip is 5.17%.

But without any of the options matching, I'm a bit stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me try to find where I might have gone wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. But perhaps the calculation should be done in terms of flux ratios, considering that the flux from the spots is F_spot = (5000/6000)^4 * F.

Which is what I did earlier.

But perhaps I should calculate the ratio of the flux from the spots to the total flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the star rotates, leading to a sinusoidal variation. The amplitude of this variation would be the same as the planet's dip.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the entire star's surface is covered by spots, but only a fraction is covered, leading to a different calculation. But no, the problem states that only one hemisphere has spots with 20% filling.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is not a dip, but a variation in the same way as a planet's transit, where the planet blocks part of the star. So the dip is the same, but perhaps the problem is considering the star's rotation causing a dip that's similar to the planet's transit.

But again, same conclusion.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is not about the dip but the change in brightness over time. The star's brightness variation due to spots would have a certain amplitude, and the planet's would have the same. But the calculations still lead to the same conclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the planet's transit depth as the same as the star's brightness variation when the spots are only partially visible. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum possible dip when all of the star's surface is covered by spots, but that's not the case here. The problem states only a hemisphere is covered.

So, perhaps the intended answer is D) ~0.32, but according to my calculations, it's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the area of the spots is 20% of the star's surface, not the hemisphere. So, if the area is 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R², then the dip is 0.8 π R² /4 π R² * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355 → 10.355% dip.

Then, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218 → ~0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps the intended interpretation was that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere. So the correct answer would be D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information and Setup
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and one hemisphere has an area of \( 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere:  
     \[
     A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
     \]
   - The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is:  
     \[
     \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.1 \, (10\%).
     \]

3. **Flux Difference**:
   - The flux per unit area is proportional to \( T^4 \) (Stefan-Boltzmann law). The flux from the star is \( F = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \), and the flux from the spots is \( F_{\text{spot}} = \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \).
   - The fractional difference in flux per unit area is:  
     \[
     \frac{F - F_{\text{spot}}}{F} = 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4.
     \]
   - Calculating \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):  
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.48225.
     \]
   - Thus,  
     \[
     \frac{F - F_{\text{spot}}}{F} = 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.
     \]

4. **Fractional Brightness Change**:
   - The total fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible is:  
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2} \cdot \frac{F - F_{\text{spot}}}{F} = 0.1 \cdot 0.51775 = 0.051775 \, (5.1775\%).
     \]

### Planet's Brightness Variation
The dip in brightness caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:  
\[
\Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
\]
To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set:  
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.051775.
\]
Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):  
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2275.
\]

### Reconciling with Options
The calculated value of \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.2275 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the filling factor of 20% is interpreted as covering 20% of the entire star's surface (instead of just one hemisphere), the area of the spots becomes:  
\[
A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.8 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
\]
The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is then:  
\[
\frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = \frac{0.8 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.2 \, (20\%).
\]
Recomputing the fractional brightness change:  
\[
\Delta F = 0.2 \cdot 0.51775 = 0.10355 \, (10.355\%).
\]
Setting \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355 \):  
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218 \, (32.18\%).
\]
This matches **Option D (~0.32)**.

### Conclusion
The discrepancy arises from the interpretation of the filling factor. If the filling factor refers to 20% of the entire star's surface, the correct answer is **D (~0.32)**. If it refers to 20% of one hemisphere, the calculated value (~0.2275) does not match any option. Based on the provided options, the intended interpretation likely assumes the filling factor applies to the entire star.

**Answer: D**
