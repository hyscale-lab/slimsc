Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me see what the question is about. Hmm, the problem states that we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function of each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Interesting, and when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, so x<1 and x>3, they don't show up. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Wait, wait. So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function usually must satisfy certain conditions. One of the main ones is that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. Oh right, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from negative infinity to positive infinity should be 1.

But wait, in this case, the wave function is given only for the region where the particle exists, which is x between 1 and 3. So the particle cannot be found elsewhere. That makes sense. So the wave function outside this region must be zero, I suppose, but the given function applies between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the wave function as given is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh, so it's a complex wave function, with a real part and an imaginary part. But when we calculate the probability density, we need the square of the absolute value. So the probability density is ψ*(x) ψ(x), where * denotes the complex conjugate.

Let me write that out. ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i. So the complex conjugate, ψ*(x), would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5)i. Multiplying them together gives the probability density.

So ψ*(x)ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2 + [a/sqrt(1+x)]*(0.5i) - [a/sqrt(1+x)]*(0.5i). Wait, but the imaginary parts would cancel out because one is positive and the other is negative. So the cross terms cancel, and we're left with [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.25). So the probability density is a^2/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me correct that. The product of (a + bi)(a - bi) is a² + b². Oh wait no, that's when you have a + ib and a - ib. Wait, actually, no, in this case, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5i. So ψ is a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ* is a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Multiplying them together:

(a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) - (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i). Wait, that's more complicated. Alternatively, we can compute it as (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2, because when you multiply (a + b)(a - b) if b is imaginary, the cross terms are imaginary and they cancel. So the result would be (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25).

Wait, but wait, (a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i) times (a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i) equals [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) - (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i). Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me expand it properly.

Let me denote A = a/(sqrt(1+x)), B = 0.5i.

So (A - B)(A + B) = A² + AB - BA - B². But AB is (a/(sqrt(1+x))) * 0.5i, BA is 0.5i * (a/(sqrt(1+x))), so AB - BA would be zero because they are the same but opposite signs. So the cross terms cancel, and we have A² - B². Wait, no, because B is 0.5i, so B squared is (0.5i)^2 = (0.25)(i²) )= 0.25*(-1) = -0.25.

Wait, let's compute it correctly. (A - B)(A + B) = A² + A B - B A - B². But since B is a scalar (0.5i, a scalar multiplied by i), AB and BA are the same. So AB - BA is zero. So we're left with A² - B². So the product is [a²/(1+x)] - (0.5i)^2. Which is [a²/(1+x)] - (-0.25), because (0.5i)^2 = 0.25 i² = -0.25. So the product is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

So the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, but this must be integrated from x=1 to x=3, and the integral must equal 1 because the total probability is 1.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me write that as:

∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

So I can split this into two integrals:

∫₁³ [a²/(1+x)] dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1.

Let me compute each integral separately.

First integral: a² ∫₁³ [1/(1+x)] dx.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

So that's a² [ln(1+3) - ln(1+1)] = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)].

But ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). So first integral is a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫₁³ dx = 0.25 [3 -1] = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So the equation becomes:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking the square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To solve the problem, we start with the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \psi^*(x)\psi(x)
\]

The complex conjugate of the wave function is:

\[
\psi^*(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i
\]

Multiplying these together:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The total probability of finding the particle between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\) must equal 1. Thus, we integrate the probability density over this interval:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx
   \]
   The integral of \(1/(1+x)\) is \(\ln(1+x)\), so:
   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 [3 - 1] = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Subtracting 0.5 from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately **0.85**, which corresponds to option **B**.
