Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the peak wavelength emission for a black body is determined by Wien's Law, right? So Wien's Law says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. If both stars have the same lambda_max, that would mean they have the same temperature. Hmm, but wait, are they assuming they're black bodies? Oh, the problem says they do, so yes, same peak wavelength implies same temperature.

Wait, but wait, no. Because when you calculate the peak wavelength, you're considering the surface temperature. Oh, right, because stars emit radiation based on their surface temperature. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, they must have the same temperature. So T1 = T2.

But wait, the problem says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But when we talk about the Doppler effect, it affects the observed wavelength. But in the problem, they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which would be their rest wavelengths, I think. Because if the star is moving, the observed wavelength would shift. But the problem says that the wavelengths are the same. So does that mean their rest wavelengths are the same, or their observed wavelengths are the same? Hmm, probably the rest wavelengths because it says through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So that would be their emitted peak wavelengths. So if the observed peak wavelengths are the same, then the Doppler shift must have corrected for any velocity. Wait, but how?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The radial velocity is the component of the star's velocity along the line of sight. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; if moving away, redshifted. The problem says Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so no shift. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted), or if moving towards, shorter (blueshifted). But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same. So Star_2's emitted peak wavelength is different, but due to its velocity, the observed wavelength is same as Star_1's emitted wavelength. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest to be the same. So if Star_2 is moving, its observed lambda_max would be different. But the problem says the observed wavelengths are same. So that would imply that the Doppler shift from Star_2's velocity brings its lambda_max to match Star_1's. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rest wavelengths, so the actual peak wavelength emitted by each star. If that's the case, then the temperatures must be same because the rest wavelengths would be the same. So T1 = T2. But wait, that would mean the Doppler shift is affecting the observed wavelengths. Let me think.

Let me try to approach this. The problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So for Star_1, which has a radial velocity of 0, its observed wavelength is its rest wavelength. For Star_2, which has a velocity of 700 km/s, its observed wavelength is the rest wavelength multiplied by Doppler factor.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest. If it's moving away, longer. Since the observed lambda_max is same as Star_1's, which is at rest, then Star_2's rest lambda_max must be different but shifted to match.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So let me model this.

Let me denote:
lambda_observed_1 = lambda1_rest (since radial velocity is 0)
lambda_observed_2 = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2 / c), where v2 is radial velocity. Wait, but the formula depends on whether it's moving away or towards. Typically, the Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c)

Where v_r is the radial velocity, positive if moving away (redshift), negative if moving towards (blueshift). So if Star_2 is moving away, v_r is positive; moving towards, negative.

In the problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The question doesn't specify direction, so I think radial velocity could be positive (moving away) by convention. So Star_2's observed wavelength would be longer than its rest wavelength.

But the observed wavelengths are same for both stars. So lambda_observed_2 = lambda_observed_1.

But Star_1's lambda_observed is same as its rest, so:

lambda_2_rest * (1 + v2/c) = lambda_1_rest

But since both are black bodies, their rest wavelengths are lambda_max = b / T. So, lambda_1_rest = b / T1, lambda_2_rest = b / T2.

If the observed wavelengths are same, then:

b/(T2) * (1 + v2/c) = b/(T1)

So,

(1 + v2/c) = (T2 / T1)

Hmm, but wait, since star 1 is at rest, its observed lambda is same as rest. So star2's observed lambda is same as star1's rest lambda.

So,

lambda_observed_2 = lambda_rest_1.

So,

lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c) = lambda_rest_1.

But from Wien's law,

lambda_rest_1 = b / T1,

lambda_rest_2 = b / T2.

So,

(b/T2) * (1 + v2/c) = b/T1.

Simplify:

(1 + v2/c) / T2 = 1/T1

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

Wait, but that would imply that T1 is less than T2 if v2 is positive (since denominator is larger). But wait, is that correct? Let me think. If Star_2 is moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer than rest. But for the observed wavelength to be same as Star_1's rest wavelength, which is shorter than Star_2's rest wavelength, that would imply that Star_2's rest wavelength is shorter. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not get into this and instead think about the problem differently. Maybe the initial assumption that the temperatures are same is incorrect because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually considering the rest frame of each star, so it's their intrinsic temperatures. Because when we talk about the luminosity, it's in their rest frame. So maybe the initial approach of assuming the same temperature is correct, but the radial velocities affect the observed luminosity. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, for Star_1 and Star_2:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴,

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

The ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5²) * (T1/T2)^4.

But wait, what about the Doppler effect on the observed luminosity? Because if a star is moving towards us or away, the observed flux can change due to Doppler boosting or dimming. But I think the problem is talking about their intrinsic luminosity, not the observed one. Because the question is about computed luminosities. So, perhaps the radial velocities don't affect the intrinsic luminosity, but affect the observed flux. Hmm, but the problem says "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2", which would imply intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap:

We have two stars, same peak wavelength (so same T?), but different velocities.

Wait, if the observed peak wavelengths are same, but they have different velocities, then their temperatures must be different.

Wait, because:

If Star_2 is moving with velocity v, then the observed lambda_max is lambda_2_rest * (1 + v/c).

But the observed lambda_max for both stars is same, so:

lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v/c)

But lambda_rest is b / T, so:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c)

So T1 is smaller than T2 because (1 + v/c) is greater than 1.

But wait, Star_1 has R = 1.5 R2, and T is T1 = T2/(1 + v/c). So let's plug that into the luminosity ratio.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / ( R2^2 ) * (T1^4) / (T2^4 )

= (2.25) * ( (T2 / (1 + v/c)) ^4 ) / (T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (1/(1 + v/c)^4 )

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4.

But v is 700 km/s. Let's compute v/c.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333... approximately 0.002333. So 1 + v/c is approximately 1.002333.

Wait, but (1 + v/c) is a small increment, but we're raising it to the 4th power. Let's compute (1.002333)^4.

Let me compute ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.00233 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x for small x). So ln(1.002333^4)=4 * 0.00233 ≈ 0.00933. So exp(0.00933) ≈ 1.00938. So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00938.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00938 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 2.25 divided by approximately 1.00938.

2.25 / 1.00938 ≈ Let me compute 2.25 / 1.009.

Well,

1.009 * 2.22 = ?

1.009 * 2 = 2.018,

1.009 * 0.22 = 0.222 + (0.009 *0.22)= 0.222 +0.00198=0.22398.

So 2.018 + 0.22398 ≈ 2.24198. So 2.22 *1.009 ≈ 2.242.

But 2.25 is a bit higher. So 2.25 /1.009 is approximately 2.25 / 1.009 ≈ 2.228.

Wait, but wait, let's compute more accurately.

1.00938 ≈ 1 + 0.00938.

Using the formula 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

So 1/(1.00938) ≈ 1 - 0.00938 = 0.99062.

So 2.25 * 0.99062 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275. So approximately 2.2275.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.2275.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, option C is ~2.35, etc. So the closest is D.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me recheck the initial setup.

Wait, the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So our calculation found L1/L2 ≈ 2.2275, which is about 2.23. So the factor is approximately 2.23, which would be option D.

But I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the velocities wouldn't affect the temperature, but in this case, they do because of the Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength and thus influencing the temperature assumption.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to account for the Doppler shift to find the actual temperatures because the observed wavelengths are the same. So the earlier calculation seems correct.

Another way to compute (1 + v/c)^4:

v = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/300 ≈ 0.023333.

Wait, no, 700 /3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 0.0023333.

Ah, right, so v/c is approximately 0.0023333.

Then (1 + v/c) = 1.0023333.

We can compute (1.002333)^4.

Compute step by step:

(1.002333)^2 = 1.002333 * 1.002333.

Let me compute:

1 *1 =1,

1 *0.002333 =0.002333,

0.002333 *1=0.002333,

0.002333 *0.002333 ≈ ~0.00000544.

Adding up:

1 + 0.002333 +0.002333 +0.00000544 ≈ 1 + 0.004666 +0.00000544 ≈ 1.00467144.

So (1.002333)^2 ≈ 1.004671.

Now, square that to get to the 4th power.

(1.004671)^2 = ?

Same method.

1 *1 =1.

1 *0.004671 =0.004671,

0.004671 *1=0.004671,

0.004671 *0.004671 ≈ ~0.0000218.

Adding up:

1 + 0.004671 +0.004671 +0.0000218 ≈ 1 + 0.009342 + 0.0000218 ≈ 1.0093638.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.0093638.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0093638.

Compute 2.25 / 1.0093638.

Let me compute:

1.0093638 * 2.228 = ?

Approximate:

1.0093638 *2.228 = 2.228 + (0.0093638 *2.228).

0.0093638 *2.228 ≈ approx 0.02086.

So 2.228 + 0.02086 ≈ 2.24886.

But 1.0093638 *2.228 ≈ 2.24886, which is higher than 2.25. So 2.228 *1.0093638 = 2.24886, which is about 0.00114 less than 2.25.

Hmm, perhaps a better approximation.

Alternatively, compute 2.25 / 1.0093638.

Let me set up 2.25 / 1.0093638 = ?

1.0093638 = 1 + 0.0093638.

So, 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + ... for small x.

x = 0.0093638.

So,

1/(1.0093638) ≈ 1 - 0.0093638 + (0.0093638)^2 - (0.0093638)^3.

Compute:

0.0093638 ≈ 0.009364.

(0.009364)^2 ≈ 0.0000877.

(0.009364)^3 ≈ 0.000000823.

So,

1/(1.0093638) ≈ 1 - 0.009364 + 0.0000877 - 0.000000823

= (1) + (-0.009364 + 0.0000877) - 0.000000823

= 1 - 0.0092763 - 0.000000823 ≈ 0.990722877.

So,

2.25 * 0.990722877 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.000722877 ≈ 0.001626.

So total approx 2.2275 + 0.001626 ≈ 2.2291.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23. So the factor is around 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Radius of Star_1: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
   - Mass of Star_1: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \)
   - Radial velocity of Star_1: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Radial velocity of Star_2: \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Observed peak wavelengths of both stars are the same.

2. **Wien's Law and Temperature**:
   The peak wavelength of black body radiation is given by \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant and \( T \) is the temperature. Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the Doppler-shifted wavelengths must match:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{observed, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{observed, 2}}.
   \]
   For Star_1 (at rest), \( \lambda_{\text{observed, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest, 1}} \). For Star_2 (moving with velocity \( v_2 \)), the observed wavelength is:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{observed, 2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest, 2}} \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right),
   \]
   where \( c \) is the speed of light. Equating the observed wavelengths:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{rest, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest, 2}} \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right).
   \]
   Using \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T} \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}}.
   \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4,
   \]
   where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}} \):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{T_2}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}} \right)^4}{1}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right)^4}.
   \]

4. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), so:
     \[
     \frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333.
     \]
   - \( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \approx 1.002333 \).
   - \( \left( 1.002333 \right)^4 \approx 1.00938 \) (computed using the binomial expansion or iterative multiplication).
   - Substituting:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.00938} \approx 2.2275.
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately \( 2.23 \), which corresponds to option D.

**Answer: D**
