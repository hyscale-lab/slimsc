Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think this through.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Wait, wait, so astronaut A is 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. Both are going in the same direction, so their velocities are in the same direction.

First, I need to find the relative speed between them. Oh right, in special relativity, you can't just subtract the velocities normally. You have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), I think. Wait, no, wait. Since both are moving in the same direction, let's say the frame is moving with the first astronaut, looking at the second.

Wait, actually, when dealing with relative velocity, if I want the speed of B as seen by A, I should use the formula for the relative velocity. Let me remember the formula correctly. Oh right, it's (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, I'm not sure if I got the order right. Let me think: If A is at rest and B is moving at velocity v, then the relative speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), but I might be mixing up the order.

Wait, more accurately, the formula for the relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, u and v are speeds as measured in the lab frame. So, in this case, u is the speed of B (0.5c) and v is the speed of A (0.6c). So, the relative speed of B from A's perspective would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait, no, actually, the formula is (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/c²), where u' is the velocity of B as observed from the frame moving at velocity v (A's frame). Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Alternatively, the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)), where v is A's speed, and u is B's speed. So, since A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c, the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, that would give (−0.1c)/(1− (0.3 c²)/c²) → (−0.1c)/(1−0.3) → (−0.1c)/(0.7) → approximately −0.1428c. But relative speed is a positive quantity, so it's about 0.1428c. So, the relative speed is about 0.14c. That's one of the options, looking at the choices.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. The correct formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). But in this case, u is B's speed (0.5c) and v is A's speed (0.6c). So, substituting, (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. Divided by (1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/c² )= 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 0.7. So, the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. But since speed is positive, it's 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's the relative speed. So, looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So that narrows it down.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Remember, the relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, for the first astronaut (2m, 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So, E1 = Gamma1 * m * c² * 2m? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the mass is 2m, so E1 = (gamma1) * (2m) c²? Wait, no, wait, no: the mass is 2m, so E = gamma * m_total c². Oh wait, no, the relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where m is the rest mass. So, if the astronaut's rest mass is 2m, then E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c².

Similarly, for the second astronaut (3m, 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25) ) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So, E2 = Gamma2 * (3m) c².

Calculating each:

E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So, total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So, with the relative speed being 0.14c, which matches options C and D.

So, the correct option should be C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². Let me quickly recalculate the energies to make sure.

Gamma1 for 0.6c: (0.6)^2 = 0.36, 1-0.36=0.64, sqrt(0.64)=0.8. 1/0.8=1.25. E1=1.25 * 2m c²=2.5 m c². Correct.

Gamma2 for 0.5c: (0.5)^2=0.25, 1-0.25=0.75, sqrt(0.75)=≈0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660≈1.1547. E2=1.1547 *3m c²=3.464 m c². So together 2.5 +3.464≈5.964, which is 5.96 when rounded. So option C, which says E=5.96 mc². So the correct answer is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of the two astronauts is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.5c\) (velocity of the second astronaut) and \(v = 0.6c\) (velocity of the first astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.1428c
\]

Since speed is positive, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

#### Energy of the first astronaut (mass = \(2m\), velocity = \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the second astronaut (mass = \(3m\), velocity = \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 = 5.964m c^2
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\).

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
