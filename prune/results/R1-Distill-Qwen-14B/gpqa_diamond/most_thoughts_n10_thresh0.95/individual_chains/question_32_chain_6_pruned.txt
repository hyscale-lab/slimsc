Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of a certain nucleus, X, is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, okay.

Wait, I remember that Lithium typically has 3 protons. Oh wait, no, wait. Li usually has an atomic number of 3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, right? Because the atomic number is 3, so protons are 3, neutrons 3, so mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

So I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed v is 0.96c. I think this is a relativistic mechanics problem. The energy of a particle depends on its rest mass and its velocity. 

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can calculate gamma first.

Let me compute v: 0.96c. So v² = (0.96c)² = 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) ≈ 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me calculate 0.0784's square root.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784). Let me think: 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, but wait, actually, that's the mass defect approach. But for the purpose of this calculation, I think we'll approximate the rest mass as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but maybe it's easier to just find the mass of Li-6 from a table.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approximate the mass of Li-6. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01525 u, where u is the atomic mass unit. Wait, I remember that the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, neutron is about 1.008665 u. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Let me compute the expected mass: 3 * (1.007276) + 3 * (1.008665) = 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u. But the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.01525 u. So the mass is less due to the binding energy. So the rest mass is 6.01525 u.

Wait, but wait, this is in atomic mass units. I need to convert this into kilograms or into GeV/c². Oh, right, because energy is in GeV, so using the conversion factor where 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². 

So 6.01525 u would be 6.01525 * 931.5 MeV/c². Let's compute that. 

6.01525 * 931.5 = let's see:

6 * 931.5 is 5589, and 0.01525 *931.5 is approximately 14.18. So total is 5589 + 14.18 ≈ 5603.18 MeV, which is 5.60318 GeV.

Wait, but wait, I should be precise. Let me compute 6.01525 *931.5:

First, 6 *931.5 = 5589.00 MeV.

0.01525 *931.5: Let's compute 0.01 *931.5 =9.315, and 0.00525 *931.5 = approx 4.885. So 9.315 +4.885=14.20.

So total is 5589 +14.20 =5603.2 MeV, which is 5.6032 GeV.

So the rest mass energy m0 c² is approximately 5.6032 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m0 c². So gamma is about 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 *5.6032 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3*5.6032 is 16.8096. 0.5714 *5.6032: Let's compute 0.5 *5.6032 is 2.8016, 0.0714 *5.6032 ≈ 0.4018. So adding up: 2.8016 +0.4018=3.2034. So 3.5714 *5.6032 ≈16.8096 +3.2034≈20.013 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately. 3.5714 *5.6032.

Let me do it step by step.

3.5714 ×5.6032.

Breaking it down:

3.5714 ×5 =17.857

3.5714 ×0.6 =2.14284

3.5714 ×0.0032=0.01142848.

Adding them up: 17.857 +2.14284 =20.0 (exactly 20.0), and +0.01142848 is 20.0114 GeV.

Wait, wait, 3.5714 ×5 =17.857.

5.6032 is 5 +0.6 +0.0032.

So 3.5714 ×5 =17.857.

3.5714 ×0.6 =2.14284.

3.5714 ×0.0032 = 0.01142848.

So sum all three: 17.857 +2.14284 =20.0 (exactly 20.0), plus 0.01142848 is 20.01142848 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 20 as an option. Wait, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, the calculation I made gives about 20.01 GeV, which is close to option C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma more accurately. Because I approximated sqrt(0.0784) as 0.28, but let's compute more accurately.

v=0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly? Let me check: 0.28 *0.28=0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So maybe my calculation of the rest mass energy was a bit off. Let me check that again.

The mass of Li-6 is about 6.01525 u. Each u is 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.01525 * 931.5 MeV = ?

Let me compute 6 ×931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01525 ×931.5 = let's compute that.

0.01 ×931.5 =9.315.

0.005 ×931.5=4.6575.

0.00025 ×931.5=0.232875.

So 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725, plus 0.232875 is 14.205375 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.205375=5603.205375 MeV, which is 5.603205375 GeV.

So m0 c² is 5.6032 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.57142857 *5.6032 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6032.

Another approach: 3.57142857 is 25/7 approximately. Because 25/7 is about 3.57142857.

So 25/7 *5.6032 = (25 *5.6032)/7.

25 *5.6032 = 140.08.

140.08 /7 =20.01142857 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.0114 GeV. But the options given are A) ~18, B) ~23, C) 20.132, D) ~21.4.

So 20.01 is close to option C, 20.132. But why this discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation of the mass. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as the atomic mass, but with a different approach. Wait, Li-6 is a nucleus, so perhaps I should consider just the nucleons.

Wait, in reality, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy. So the mass of Li-6 is 6.01525 u, which is correct. So the calculation would use that.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Oh wait, perhaps I approximated sqrt(0.0784) as exactly 0.28, but perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the exact value of the mass.

Wait, let me double-check the exact mass of Li-6. I think I remember that the exact value is about 6.01525 u. Let me confirm: the standard atomic weight of Li-6 is 6.01525 u. So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the energy is given per nucleon, but no, the question refers to the nucleus, so the entire nucleus's energy is considered.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the energy is given in terms of the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, but the question says "energy of the nucleus X", which in relativistic terms usually refers to the total energy, including rest mass.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused between total energy and kinetic energy. The problem states "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)", which is the kinetic energy imparted to the ions. Or is it the total energy?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. In particle physics, when we talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy. But sometimes, depending on the context, it might refer to the total energy. Hmm, I think for heavy ions like nuclei, the total energy is usually considered, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think: The problem states that the speed is 0.96c. So perhaps the energy is the total energy, which includes the rest mass. So my previous calculation of 20.01 GeV would be the total energy. But the options don't have that, but option C is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for gamma. Let me re-calculate gamma with more precise steps.

v = 0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 = 0.9216 c^2.

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, as before.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.6032 GeV more accurately.

Let me compute 5.6032 *3.57142857.

5.6032 ×3 =16.8096.

5.6032 ×0.5 =2.8016 → 16.8096 +2.8016 =19.6112.

5.6032 ×0.07142857
