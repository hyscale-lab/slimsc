Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options given. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, let's break this down.

First, looking at the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, the structure of that product... Let's see. The nitrile group is CN. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Reacting with NaCN and reagent A gives a hydroxy nitrile. Oh, wait, I think this is a nucleophilic addition to a ketone. So ketone plus CN- (from NaCN) would add to the carbonyl. Then, perhaps after some steps, you get the nitrile and an alcohol.

Wait, the reaction mechanism. For ketones reacting with HCN (or CN-), it's a nucleophilic addition. The carbonyl oxygen becomes an alcohol after some steps. So in general, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. The structure would be R2C(OH)CN, where R is CH3 in this case.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN (providing CN-) and some reagent A to form (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the hydroxy and methyl are on the same carbon as the nitrile? Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's consider the structure: the nitrile is on carbon 1, then the hydroxy and methyl are on carbon 2.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's number the butanenitrile. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So carbon 1 is CN, carbon 2 is CH2, etc. Wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but that's more accurately written as CH2CH2CH2CN, but maybe I'm not getting the structure right.

Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN. So the carbon chain is four carbons, with the nitrile on carbon 1, then from 2, there's a hydroxy and methyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, the CN- would add to the carbonyl carbon. The mechanism would proceed through the formation of an addition compound.

So in the first step, the ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with CN- (from NaCN) to form a cyanohydrin, which is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. (CH3)2C(OH)CN would be a 3-carbon chain? Because (CH3)2CO is 3 carbons. Adding CN as the fourth? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. So that would be four carbons: the first is CH2CN, then CH2, then C(OH)(CH3)2. No, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. The reagent A is required for the first reaction. What kind of conditions are needed for the formation of a cyanohydrin?

In general, the formation of cyanohydrin from ketones involves adding HCN under acidic conditions. The acid protonates the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks. Then, water leaves, and you get the cyanohydrin. So for this, the reaction would require an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or H2SO4. So reagent A is probably an acid.

Looking at the options, option A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm. So if reagent A is H3O+ (like HCl or H2SO4 acting as a source), then that would make sense for the first reaction. So the first reaction uses H3O+ as A.

So in the first reaction, the reagent is H3O+.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

The conversion of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically involves hydrolysis. The common reagents are strong acids, like H2SO4 with heat, or using a strong base like NaOH. But since the starting material already has a hydroxyl group, perhaps the conditions are different.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So, maybe it's undergoing hydrolysis. The reaction condition B is H2O, so perhaps it's an acidic or basic hydrolysis.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under strong acidic or basic conditions. But in this case, since the product is a carboxylic acid, it's probably hydrolysis. Let me think about the reagents.

Looking at the options for B: option A and B have B as HCl and CH3COOH respectively. Options C and D have B as HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, the second reaction uses B as a reagent along with H2O. So what reagents are used for nitrile hydrolysis?

Typically, hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done using a strong acid, like HCl, with heat, or using a strong base like aqueous NaOH, followed by acid work-up.

But in this case, the product is a hydroxy acid, so perhaps it's a hydrolysis under specific conditions. Wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when it's hydrolyzed, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. So:

R-C≡N → R-COOH

But the presence of an adjacent hydroxyl group might influence the mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acidic work-up after hydrolysis.

Wait, another thought: If the nitrile is treated with an acid like HCl in H2O, it can hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid. The reaction is:

R-CN + H2O (acid) → R-COOH + NH3 (which is neutralized by HCl)

So in this case, if B is HCl, then the nitrile would hydrolyze to the acid.

Looking at the options, which option has B as HCl? Option A and C. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for the second reaction, B is HCl in option A and C.

Wait, but what about the first reaction. If I thought reagent A is H3O+, then options A and B are the possibilities for A. So if the first reaction uses H3O+, then in the first reaction, A is H3O+.

So for the first reaction, the reagent is H3O+, which is present in options A and B.

In the second reaction, if B is HCl (needed for hydrolysis), then the options would be A and C.

Wait, but the options are connected. Reagent A in the first reaction is H3O+ in option A, and B is HCl. So that would fit.

Let me think again. The second reaction: nitrile to carboxylic acid. So it's a hydrolysis reaction. The conditions for that are typically strong acid (like HCl) or strong base. Since the question uses B as the reagent, which is H2O plus B.

Wait, perhaps it's a hydrolysis in acidic conditions. So adding HCl and water.

So for the second reaction, B would be HCl. So option A has B as HCl. So that would fit.

So putting it together, the first reaction uses H3O+ (so A is H3O+), and the second uses HCl (so B is HCl). So the correct option is option A.

Wait, wait, but let me double-check.

If the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone, then acid is needed. So H3O+ is correct.

The second reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. HCl (B) as a reagent with H2O would provide the acidic hydrolysis condition.

So yes, option A seems correct. So the answer would be option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the correct reagents A and B from the given options.

### Reaction 1:
The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one ((CH₃)₂CO) to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the nitrile group (CN⁻) from NaCN adds to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. The reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack. Based on this, reagent A is identified as H₃O⁺, which provides the necessary acidic conditions.

### Reaction 2:
The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group (-CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction likely proceeds under acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl (B = HCl) provides the necessary acidic environment for this hydrolysis.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions. H₃O⁺ is needed for the first reaction, and HCl is required for the second reaction.  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough to efficiently hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid in the second reaction.  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it does not provide the necessary acidic conditions for nucleophilic addition.  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which correspond to **Option A**.
