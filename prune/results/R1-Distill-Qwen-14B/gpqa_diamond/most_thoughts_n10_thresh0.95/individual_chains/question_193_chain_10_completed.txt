Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, it's like N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). The options are A to D, each involving different powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (d, often in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax. So, d = 1 / plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Wait, so if plx is inversely proportional to distance, then plx = 1/d. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let's substitute plx with 1/d. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Simplifying that, 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range. That is, how does the number of stars change as you go further out, like the density of stars at a certain distance.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of stars in a thin shell at a distance r. If N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But wait, that can't be right because the volume of a shell increases with r squared, or something like that. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the number of stars observed depends on the volume of the region you're looking at. But in this case, the question says that within a specific region, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So maybe this "region" is a certain solid angle in the sky, and the depth is determined by the parallax.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. If I think about a specific region in the sky, the number of stars you count depends on how many are within that region up to a certain distance. So maybe the count depends on distance cubed or something else.

Wait, let me think again. The question says that N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But that's how the count N varies with distance. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So per unit distance, perhaps.

Wait, are they asking about the number of stars per unit distance (like the density), or the rate of change of the number with distance?

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r. So the number of stars in a thin shell would be proportional to the surface area of the sphere (which is 4πr²) multiplied by the thickness dr and the density of stars, which would depend on distance.

But in this problem, it's given that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx^5) = d^5. Wait, but that's the total number of stars within that region up to distance d. So the number increases as d increases, but how about the rate of change of N with d?

If N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5 d^4. But wait, that's the change in the total number as you go to a larger distance. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in that region, per unit range of distance.

Wait, perhaps they want the number per unit volume or per unit distance. Let me think about this. If the number of stars in a region increases as d^5, then the number of stars per unit distance would be d^5 per some distance. But more accurately, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume is what's being considered.

Wait, the number density of stars is typically number per unit volume. Volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So if within a certain solid angle, the number of stars up to distance r is N(r) = kr^5, then the number density (stars per volume) would be N(r)/( (4/3)πr³ ) ) = kr^5 / r³ = kr². So the number density increases as r². But that's just my initial thought. Alternatively, maybe the number per unit distance is dN/dr = 5 kr^4. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a region per unit distance, which would be the derivative of N with respect to r. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (or perhaps per unit volume) increases as r^4. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me re-examine the question. It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's asking for the number of stars per unit distance. So if N ∝ r^5, then per unit distance, the change would be proportional to r^4. But wait, is that the case?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of stars per unit volume, which would be N(r) / (volume up to r). So if N(r) is proportional to r^5, and the volume is proportional to r^3, then the number density is proportional to r^2. So the number density increases as r squared. But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. The number of stars observed in a region of the sky is a function of how many are within a certain distance. So N = f(d). The problem states that N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5.

But if you plot N against d, you'll see that for each unit increase in d, how much N increases. So the rate of change of N with d is dN/dd = 5d^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases as d^4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ~r^5, but the rate would be r^4, which isn't among the options. Hmm, the options are A: r^3, B: r^5, C: r^4, D: r^2.

Wait, option C is r^4. So if the rate of change is proportional to r^4, the answer would be C.

But wait, another angle. The number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr) would be proportional to the surface area (4πr²) times the number per unit area. If the number per unit area is proportional to d^5, but wait, that doesn't make sense because d is the distance from the observer. Wait, perhaps the number per unit area at a distance r is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars in the shell would be 4π r² * (number per unit area), which would be 4π r² * (r^5) = 4π r^7. But that seems too high. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars in a shell at radius r is proportional to (r^5) * (4π r² dr) ) = 4π r^7 dr. But that can't be right because that would mean the number of stars increases rapidly with r, which isn't typical.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the number as a function of distance and the number per unit distance.

Wait, the original problem says that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So for a given distance d, the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So perhaps it's about the derivative dN/dr. If N = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the rate at which the number of stars increases with distance is proportional to d^4, which would be option C.

But why is the answer not r^5 then? Because the total number is N ∝ r^5, but the change per unit distance is r^4. So the correct answer would be C.

Alternatively, perhaps the reasoning is different. Since the number of stars in a region depends on the volume, which scales as r^3, but the number of stars is scaling as r^5, so the number per unit volume is scaling as r^2. But that's not what the question is asking.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the number of stars is inversely proportional to the parallax to the fifth power, which is directly proportional to distance^5. So for each unit of distance, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. So N ∝ r^5. So the number in that region increases as r^5. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about how the number of stars increases as you move from one distance to another, say from r to r+dr. So the number of stars between r and r+dr would be proportional to the derivative of N with respect to r. So if N(r) = kr^5, then dN/dr = 5kr^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Alternatively, if the question is about the number of stars in a region as a function of distance, it's increasing as r^5. But the question mentions per unit range. So I think the correct interpretation is the rate of change, which is the derivative, so r^4. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because if the number of stars up to distance r is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars between r and r+dr would be approximately the derivative, which is 5r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be option C, which is ~r^4.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\(\text{plx}\)) is inversely proportional to distance (\(d\)), i.e., \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}\), substituting this into the equation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the total number of stars in the region increases as the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance, \(r\)." This implies the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of \(N\) with respect to \(r\). If \(N \propto r^5\), then:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \(r^4\). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \), corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
