Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question is: a light beam is going through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light relative to the observer? The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that when you have moving media, like a medium that's moving relative to an observer, things get a bit tricky. Normally, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? But that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer.

But here, the medium is moving. Oh, right! This is probably a case where you have to consider both the medium's motion and the light's speed within it. So, maybe I should look into the concept of relative velocity here.

I think the key here is to use the velocity addition formulas from special relativity. Oh wait, no, because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Wait, no, that's only for light in a vacuum. Wait, what about in a medium? Hmm, this might complicate things.

Wait, the problem states that the glass has an index of refraction n. So the speed of light within the glass is c/n when the glass is at rest. But when the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed of the light?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. In special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the observer's motion. But in a medium, the speed of light is slower, and perhaps the medium's motion affects it.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of the frame of reference. The lab frame is where the glass is moving at velocity v. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. So, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass.

In the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But in the lab frame, where the glass is moving, how does that change?

Wait, maybe I should apply the velocity addition formula. The velocity of the light in the lab frame would be the velocity of the medium plus the velocity of the light relative to the medium. But wait, in relativity, that's not exactly how it works because velocities don't just add linearly.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²), where u' is the velocity in the medium's frame, and v is the velocity of the medium relative to the lab.

Wait, but in this case, the light's velocity in the medium's frame is c/n. So u' is c/n. So plugging into the formula:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify the denominator. Let's compute that term: (c/n * v)/c² = (v)/(n c). So denominator is 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So u becomes [ (c/n + v) ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So,

u = ( (c/n) + v ) * (n c) / (n c + v )

Let me compute the numerator: (c/n + v ) * n c.

Multiply each term by n c:

(c/n * n c) = c * c = c².

v * n c = n c v.

So numerator is c² + n c v.

Denominator is n c + v.

So u = (c² + n c v) / (n c + v )

We can factor c out of numerator and denominator:

u = c (c + n v) / ( c (n) + v )

Wait, the denominator is n c + v, same as in the numerator's factor.

Wait, but this would be u = c (c +n v) / (n c + v )

Hmm, but c is a constant here, being 1 as per the problem statement. So substituting c=1,

u = (1 * (1 + n v )) / (n + v )

Which is (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v ), which matches.

Wait, but wait. Oh, but hold on a second. Because light in the medium is moving at c/n in the medium's frame, but when the medium is moving, the observed speed might not just be a simple addition.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, that's exactly what I did. So when the medium is moving at v, the light's speed in the lab frame is (u') + v all over the 1 + (u' v)/c² term.

So according to that, the correct answer would be option A.

But wait another thought: in reality, the speed of light in a medium depends on the frame of reference. But according to the theory, the speed of light in a medium is c/n in the medium's rest frame, but when the medium is moving, the speed as measured in the lab can't exceed c, right?

Wait, but in this calculation, using c=1, the denominator (n + v) could be larger than the numerator (1 +n v), but if n is greater than 1, and v is positive (moving towards the observer), then the denominator would be n + v, and the numerator 1 + n v.

Wait, let me think about the units. Oh, no, because in the formula, the velocities are in terms of c. Wait, no, in the problem statement, the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, so the velocity v would be in units where c is 1. So v is a fraction of c, like 0.8, etc.

Wait, but in any case, I think the approach is correct. So the answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we consider the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the index of refraction. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to simplify further:

\[
u = \frac{c^2 + n c v}{n c + v}
\]

Factoring \( c \) from the numerator and denominator:

\[
u = \frac{c (c + n v)}{c (n) + v}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem), substitute \( c = 1 \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A
