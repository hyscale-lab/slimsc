Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh, and the pH is ideal, which I think means that the solution is such that the EDTA is in its proper form to chelate the metal ion. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects much here. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. 

Wait, the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Since the Ca-EDTA complex is present, the free Ca²+ ions would be low because most of the Ca²+ is bound by EDTA. 

So, I think this is a problem involving the formation of a complex ion. The formula for the formation constant (Kf) would probably be useful here. Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

Wait, but the stoichiometry here is 1:1, right? So the complex is formed when one Ca²+ ion binds with one EDTA^4- ion. 

The formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, I think I can set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to model this.

Let me denote:
- The concentration of the complex (CaEDTA^2-) as 0.02 M initially. Since the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution, I think that means the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- were such that they form the complex, but after reaction, the complex is 0.02 M.

Wait, but if all the Ca²+ and EDTA are used to form the complex, then before considering any dissociation, [Ca²+] would be zero. But that can't be right because the complex can dissociate a little, leading to some free Ca²+ in solution. So, I should model the dissociation of the complex.

So, the dissociation reaction is:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant Kf is 5e10, but I think for the dissociation, the constant would be the inverse. So Kd = 1/Kf. Let me compute that: Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. 

Now, at equilibrium, for every mole of complex that dissociates, it produces one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. 

But wait, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's assume that the change is x, so the equilibrium concentrations would be:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kd is very small, x would be very small compared to 0.02)

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So, plugging into the dissociation constant equation:

Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-]
2e-11 = (x)(x) / (0.02)

Which is 2e-11 = x² / 0.02

Multiply both sides by 0.02:

x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13

Taking the square root:

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 times 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Let me compute: 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. Squared is about 1e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the math again. So, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. Square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

So, [Ca²+] is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, let me think again. Did I model the problem correctly? Because another way to approach this is using the formation constant.

The formation constant Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But in a 0.02 M solution of CaEDTA^2-, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are both x. So,

5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2)

So, x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, same as before. So x ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Yes, that's correct. So the concentration of Ca²+ is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]\) is approximately 0.02 M (since \( K_d \) is very small, the dissociation is minimal). Let the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium both be \( x \). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ]\) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
