Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, right? But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. So I'm guessing I need to apply some sort of relativity here. Oh right, because when the medium is moving, the speed of light as measured in the lab frame might change.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, and the beam is also moving towards the observer. So the observer is watching the light coming towards them, while the glass is moving towards them as well. Hmm.

I remember from special relativity that velocities don't just add linearly. Oh right, it's the velocity addition formula. So if you have two objects moving relative to each other, you can't just say their velocities add up; you have to use the formula from Einstein's theory.

Wait, so the speed of light in the glass when it's at rest is c/n. But since the glass is moving, we have to find the speed in the laboratory frame. Let me think: in the frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So I need to transform the velocity of the light from the glass's frame to the lab's frame.

But wait, wait. Wait a second. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass is moving. So in the glass frame, the light's velocity is c/n towards the observer. But the glass is moving towards the observer at v. So I need to find how this velocity transforms.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is towards the observer. So the light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer.

Wait, no, wait. The question says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So if the beam is going towards the observer, the glass is moving in that same direction towards the observer. So maybe I should model this as the glass is moving in the same direction as the light's propagation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the velocity of the light in the glass. In the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. So, the light's velocity in the glass frame is u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Now, to find the lab frame's measurement of the light's velocity, I think I need to apply the velocity addition formula. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² ), but wait, that's only when the movement is in the same direction. So u' is the velocity in the moving frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the lab.

Wait, but in this case, the glass is moving towards the observer, so in the lab frame, the glass's velocity is v. In the glass's frame, the light's velocity is u' = c/n. So using the velocity addition formula, the lab observes the light's speed as u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² ).

So substituting u' = c/n, that gives u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Wait, let's compute the denominator. Let me compute ( (c/n) * v ) / c². That's (v c)/(n c²) ) = v/(n c). So denominator is 1 + v/(n c).

So the whole thing becomes u = [ (c/n + v) ] / [ 1 + (v)/(n c) ) ]

Hmm, let's factor out 1/n from the numerator. Wait, c/n is (c)/n, and v is just v. So the numerator is (c + n v)/n. So numerator becomes (c + n v)/n.

The denominator is 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v) / (n c). Because 1 is n c/(n c) and v/(n c) added gives (n c + v)/(n c).

So putting it all together, u = [ (c + n v) /n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Dividing these two fractions: multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator.

So [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c/(n c + v) ) ] 

Simplify. The n cancels in numerator and denominator: (c + n v) * c / (n c + v)

Wait, n c + v is the same as v + n c. So denominator is v + n c.

So u = [ (n v + c ) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, wait, the numerator is (c + n v) * c. So that's c (c + n v) = c^2 + c n v.

The denominator is (n c + v) = n c + v.

Wait, that's the same as v + n c. So the expression becomes [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v).

Wait, can this be simplified further? Let me factor out c from the denominator. Hmm, denominator is c (n) + v. So not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator differently. Let me think about it.

Wait, the numerator is c (c + n v) and the denominator is v + n c.

Which is the same as denominator: n c + v. So, the expression is [c (c + n v)] / (n c + v) )

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as c (c + n v) / (n c + v) ) = c (c + n v) / (v + n c )

Wait, that's the same as c (c + n v) / (n c + v) ). So perhaps this can be rewritten as c times (c + n v) divided by (n c + v). Hmm.

Wait, but let me see if this expression can be simplified. Let me factor out n from the denominator and numerator.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the denominator as (n (c) ) + v. Hmm.

Wait, but c is 1 in this problem. Because the problem states "Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1." Oh right! So c=1.

So substituting c=1, the expression becomes [ (1 + n v) * 1 ] / (n *1 + v )

So u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Wait, so the speed of light in the glass according to the lab frame is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v), option C is (1 +n v)/(n -v), and so on.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me recheck the velocity addition formula. Because sometimes I get the formula backwards. Let me recall: if the frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to frame S, then the velocity u' in S' is related to u in S by u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² )

Wait, but in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, so in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the frame of the glass (S') is moving at velocity v relative to the lab (S). So when we measure the velocity of the light in the lab frame (S), u, given that in S' it's u' = c/n.

So applying the formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

But since c=1, this simplifies to (u' + v) / (1 + u' v )

Because substituting c=1, c²=1, so denominator is 1 + (u' v) /1 = 1 + u' v.

So substituting u' = c/n = 1/n. So,

u = ( (1/n ) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the fraction in the denominator.

Numerator: (1 + n v )

Denominator: n (1) + v = n + v.

So u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which matches option A, which is (1 +n v)/(n +v). So the speed is (1 + n v)/(n +v). Hmm.

Wait, but let's think again. The speed of light in a medium is c/n when the medium is at rest. But when the medium is moving, shouldn't the observed speed still be c in the lab frame? Because according to Einstein's postulates, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame.

Wait, oh! Wait, that's a big point. So according to special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But what about in a medium? Because the speed c/n is the speed of light in the medium when the medium is at rest. But if the medium is moving, does that change the speed as observed?

Wait, that's a good point. So I think that the speed of light in the medium isn't necessarily c/n when the medium is moving. Because from the lab frame, the light's speed is determined by the velocity addition formula, which would give a different value.

Wait, but wait, this is a bit conflicting. Because in reality, according to SR, the speed of light in a medium is not necessarily c. Only in vacuum is it c. So the speed of light in a moving medium would depend on the relative motion, right?

So perhaps the initial approach I took with the velocity addition formula is correct, leading to the answer (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. If the medium is moving, does the speed of light in that medium change according to the lab frame? I think it does, because the medium's motion affects how the light propagates relative to the lab.

But another way to think about it: the velocity of light is c in any inertial frame, but in a medium, the speed is c/n in the medium's frame. So when the medium is moving, the lab would measure a different speed. So using the velocity addition formula is the correct approach.

So the answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the principles of special relativity. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, which is also propagating toward the observer. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( c/n \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. However, since the glass is moving relative to the laboratory frame, we must apply the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the speed of light in the laboratory frame.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u' \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, which is \( c/n \).
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.
- \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is given as \( c = 1 \).

Substituting \( u' = c/n \) into the formula, we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplifying the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \), this becomes:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n}
\]

Thus, the expression for \( u \) becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

To simplify further, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This is the speed of light in the glass as observed in the laboratory frame. Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \)**

Answer: A
