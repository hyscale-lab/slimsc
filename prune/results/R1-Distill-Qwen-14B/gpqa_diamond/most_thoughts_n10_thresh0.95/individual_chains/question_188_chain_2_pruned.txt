Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, but I'll ignore them for now and figure it out.

Wait, I remember that for cubic crystals, calculating interplanar distances is straightforward using the formula d = a/(n√h² + k² + l²) where a is the lattice parameter and hkl are the Miller indices. But wait, this isn't a cubic crystal; it's rhombohedral. So the formula must be more complex because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal (alpha = beta = gamma). So the structure is a bit different. The interplanar distance formula for a general crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } } * a

Wait, no, that's not quite right. I think the formula is derived from the reciprocal of the dot product of the plane vectors. Let me think again. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h a_1 + k a_2 + l a_3)^2 + ... }} }

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a rhombohedral system. Since a = b = c, but angles are different. Or in this case, all angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, no, in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell vectors are a, a, a but with angles alpha, beta, gamma. The volume of the unit cell is a^3 multiplied by the square root of 1 - cos² alpha - cos² beta - cos² gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma. Hmm, but maybe that's not directly needed here.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is similar to the cubic case but adjusted for the angles. So for the (hkl) plane, the formula would involve the angles. Let me look up the general formula.

Ah, right, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha)}} }

Wait no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, in a cubic system where all angles are 90 degrees, the formula simplifies because cos 90 is zero. So the formula for a cubic system becomes d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²).

But in a rhombohedral system, the angles are not 90 degrees. So I think the correct formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl cos\beta + kl cos alpha)}} * a

Wait, no. Because in the cubic case, the formula is a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l²)) times 1, but when angles are present, the denominator increases because of the cos terms. So maybe the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } }

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure of the unit cell.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, a, a but the angles between them are 30 degrees each. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron with all edges a, and all angles 30 degrees.

The interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl cos\beta + kl cos alpha) } } * a

Wait, but wait, in the cubic system, when angles are 90, cos terms are zero, so the formula reduces to a/sqrt(h² +k² + l²).

So for this problem, h=1, k=1, l=1. So let's plug in the numbers.

Given: a is the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstrom. So a=10.

Angles alpha, beta, gamma are each 30 degrees.

So the denominator becomes:

h² +k² + l² + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)

Since h=k=l=1,

Denominator = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2[ (1)(1) cos(30) + (1)(1) cos(30) + (1)(1) cos(30) ]

So that's 3 + 2[ 3 * cos(30) ]

Wait, cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 3 terms of cos(30), each multiplied by 2:

So 2 * 3 * 0.8660 = 6 * 0.8660 = 5.196.

So denominator is 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is approximately sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

Then, d = a / (sqrt(...)) → 10 / 2.863 ≈ ?

Let me compute 10 / 2.863.

Hmm, 2.863 is approximately sqrt(8.196), correct. Let me calculate 2.863^2: 8.196.

So 10 / 2.863 → let's compute this.

2.863 * 3 = 8.589, which is larger than 10.

Wait, 2.863 * 3.5 = 10.0205. So 3.52?

Wait, wait, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, since 2.863 is approximately 2.86. 10 / 2.86 ≈ 3.496.

Wait wait, no, wait I think I messed up.

Wait, denominator is 8.196, so sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863. So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.496 Angstrom? But wait, the options are around 8-10 Angstroms. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait! I think I messed up the formula. Oh no, wait. Maybe it's the reciprocal of the expression. Let me recheck.

Wait, the actual formula for d is 1 divided by the square root of the sum. Oh wait, no: the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ ... }}, right? Because for cubic, d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). So when a=10, and the denominator is sqrt(8.196)=2.863, d is 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.496.

But the options are all around 9, 8, or 10. So this can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a second. Oh wait, no! Wait, the interatomic distance given is 10 Angstrom. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, is the interatomic distance the same as the lattice parameter a? Or is it different.

Wait, rhombohedral systems have their atoms at the corners of the rhombohedron. So the interatomic distance would be the distance between the atoms, which in the cubic case is a√2, but in rhombohedral it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I confused a with the interatomic distance. Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√2 for diagonal, but in a face-centered cubic it's different.

Wait, wait, no.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure with atoms at each corner, the nearest neighbor distance (interatomic) is a√(1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = a. So the interatomic distance is a, because the nearest neighbors are along the edge, separated by a. Oh no, wait, that's not right. Because in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is along the cube edge, so the distance is a.

Wait, but in a face-centered cubic (FCC), the interatomic distance is a√2 /2, because the nearest neighbor is along the face diagonal, but wait, in BCC it's different.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think of the simple cubic structure. Each atom is at the corner of a cube. So the edge length is a. The nearest neighbor is along the cube edge, so the distance between atoms is a. So for simple cubic, a is the interatomic distance.

But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, all the atoms are at the corners, so the interatomic distance (nearest neighbor distance) would be the edge length a. So the given a is 10 Angstrom. So that part was correct.

So why is my calculation giving d=3.496, but the options are around 9?

Ah! Wait a minute. Because perhaps I've used the wrong formula. Let me double-check the formula for interplanar distance. Maybe I had the reciprocal wrong.

Wait, another approach. The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can also be written in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula derived from the unit cell vectors.

The general formula for d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } } * a

Wait, but a is the lattice parameter, which for rhombohedral is the edge length. So if the interatomic distance is a, then a=10.

Let me recalculate.

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So,

sum = h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)

= 1+1+1 + 2[ (1)(1) cos 30 + (1)(1) cos 30 + (1)(1) cos 30 ]

= 3 + 2*(3 * cos(30 degrees)).

cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 3 * 0.8660 = 2.598.

Multiply by 2: 5.196.

So sum = 3 +5.196 =8.196.

sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d= a / 2.863 ≈ 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.496 Angstrom.

But none of the options are around 3.5. The options are:

A) 9.08

B) 8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here. Maybe I mixed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Oh wait! Wait, I think I forgot that in a rhombohedral system, the angles are between the vectors, so perhaps the formula is written differently. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the product of vectors.

Wait, another approach: The formula for interplanar spacing may also be expressed using the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

G = [ [ a², a² cos gamma, a² cos beta ],
       [a² cos gamma, a², a² cos alpha ],
       [a² cos beta, a² cos alpha, a² ] ]

But for a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So the metric tensor becomes:

G = [
[a², a² cos 30, a² cos 30 ],
[a² cos 30, a², a² cos 30 ],
[a² cos 30, a² cos 30, a² ]
]

The reciprocal metric tensor G^{-1} is used in the interplanar distance formula.

The (hkl) plane's interplanar distance is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h G_{11} + k G_{22} + l G_{33}) + 2(hk G_{12} + hk G_{13} + kl G_{23}) ) )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the formula for d is:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos gamma + hk cos beta + kl cos alpha) } } * a.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for another way.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the structure factor or the Miller indices. The (111) plane in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } }

Wait, another source says that the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl cos\beta + kl cos alpha)}} } * a

But plugging the numbers as before, we get d=3.496 which is not in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe the formula is actually:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² - 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } }

Wait, no, that can't be, because for cubic, angles are 90, so cosines are zero. So the denominator becomes sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 ), which is correct.

But in our calculation, it's with plus signs. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the interplanar distance in terms of the volume of the unit cell. Maybe the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl cos\beta + kl cos alpha) } }

But that brings me back to the same previous calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula is using the reciprocal of the inverse matrix. Let me approach this with the metric tensor.

The metric tensor G is defined as:

G = \begin{bmatrix}
a^2 & a^2 \cos\gamma & a^2 \cos\beta \\
a^2 \cos\gamma & a^2 & a^2 \cos\alpha \\
a^2 \cos\beta & a^2 \cos\alpha & a^2
\end{bmatrix}

For rhombohedral, since alpha=beta=gamma=30°, so cos 30°=√3/2≈0.866.

So,

G = a² * [
[1, 0.866, 0.866],
[0.866, 1, 0.866],
[0.866, 0.866, 1]
]

The (hkl) plane has reciprocal lattice vector components that are h, k, l. The interplanar distance d is given by:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl cos\beta + kl cos alpha) } } * a

Wait, but that's what we did before. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor to get the (hkl) interplanar distance.

The formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h G_{11} + k G_{22} + l G_{33}) + 2(hk G_{12} + hl G_{13} + kl G_{23}) ) }} }

Wait, G is the metric tensor, so G_{11}=a², G_{12}=a² cos gamma, etc.

So,

h G_{11} + k G_{22} + l G_{33} = h a² + k a² + l a²

= a² (h +k +l)

Similarly,

hk G_{12} = hk a² cos gamma

Similarly for the others.

So putting it all together,

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( a² [ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha ] ) )

= 1/(a) * sqrt( [ ... ]^-1 )

Wait, because the expression inside the sqrt is a squared term multiplied by a².

Wait, let me re-express:

d_{hkl} = 1 / ( sqrt( a² [ h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha ] ) )

= 1/(a sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha ) )

= (1/a) * [ h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ]^(-1/2)

Hmm. So that would give d as 1/(a times sqrt(...)). But that can't be right because for h=k=l=1, a=10, the denominator would be sqrt( ... ) as before.

Wait, but if a is 10, then 1/(10 * sqrt(8.196)) ) = 1/(10 * 2.863) ) = 1/(28.63) ≈ 0.0349 Angstrom, which is way too small. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) } } * a

Wait, no, that was the initial approach, leading to d=3.496, which doesn't match the options. So perhaps the correct formula is different.

Wait, maybe the denominator is [h² +k² +l² - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) ]? Let me try that.

So sum = 3 + 2 ( 3 * 0.866 )

Wait, no, that would be 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

But if it's 3 - 5.196 = -2.196, which can't be because we can't take the square root of a negative number. So that's impossible.

Alternative thought: perhaps the formula uses the inverse of the dot product of the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the reciprocal lattice vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a) (1, 1, 1)

Wait, no, that's not right. Reciprocal lattice vectors are calculated from the metric tensor.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors (b1, b2, b3) satisfy:

bi · bj = delta_ij,

where · is the dot product in the reciprocal space.

Alternatively, for a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal basis vectors can be expressed as:

b1 = (2π/a) (1, 1, 1)

Wait, no, that's perhaps a simplification. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The interplanar distance can be found from the relation:

d = (interatomic distance) / |m|

Where m is the vector normal to the plane, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another formula. I found online that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance (d_{hkl}) is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 +k^2 +l^2 +2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha)}}

Wait, that's what I used earlier. So for (111), we
