Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about titrating diluted acetic acid with NaOH. So, we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.0200 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, its concentration decreases, which will affect its pH.

Alright, initial volume is 20.00 cm³, concentration 0.05 M. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the new volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.0400 liters). To find the new concentration, I can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

Let me calculate that. M1 is 0.05, V1 is 0.0200 L. V2 is 0.0400 L. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging in the numbers: (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Oh yeah, because when you dilute, the moles stay the same. So moles of acetic acid before dilution: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³, total volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. So, I need to find pH when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. And also at the equivalence point.

Wait, what's the volume of NaOH needed to reach 25% titration? Let me think. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.0400 L = 0.001 moles. So at 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added. Since the reaction is 1:1, that's how much reacts.

So, moles of NaOH added at 25%: 0.00025 mol. Moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the volume at 25% titration will have increased. Because we're adding NaOH. Let me figure out how much NaOH is added.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, volume V = moles / M = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 mL. So total volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL (0.0425 L).

Now, the concentrations in the solution at 25% titration:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the volume correct? Because when you add 2.5 mL of NaOH to the 40 mL solution, the total becomes 42.5 mL, yes.

So, now, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

What's pKa? Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) which is around 4.74. Wait, let's calculate it accurately. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 10^(-4.74). So pKa is 4.74.

So, [A^-] is about 0.005882 M and [HA] is 0.017647 M. The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.74 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.263. That's approximately 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value. So that's a possible option.

Wait, but I thought that when you have more HA than A^-, the pH should be below the pKa. Since 25% has been titrated, the buffer is 75% HA and 25% A^-. So the ratio A^- / HA is 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3, which is 0.333, so the pH is pKa + log(1/3), which is about 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. So that seems correct.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will have acetate ions in water, which can hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

Wait, but how much acetate do we have? Let's calculate moles. Initially, 0.001 moles of acetic acid. At equivalence, all of it is converted to acetate. So moles of acetate = 0.001 mol.

The total volume at equivalence is initial volume plus NaOH volume. Let me find how much NaOH is needed.

Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So total volume is 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression.

Let x be [OH^-] produced. The Kb expression is Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

Taking square root: x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, that's around 9.02. But none of the options have that. Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate Kb more accurately. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10. Yes, that's correct.

Then, Kb = 5.405e-10. So, Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Square root is sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5.

Wait, maybe in my approximation, I should consider if x is small enough. 1.04e-5 is 0.0000104, and 0.02 is 0.02, so 0.00001 is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds. So pOH is about 4.98, pH 9.02.

But looking at the options, the equivalence point options are 6.73, 7, 7.00, 6.92, etc. Hmm, that's way lower than 9. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the concentration of acetate. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 mL of water, the volume is 40 mL, so concentration is 0.025 M, correct.

At equivalence, all 0.001 mol acetic acid is neutralized, so we have 0.001 mol acetate.

But wait, the total volume is 40 mL + volume of NaOH added.

Wait, how much NaOH is added? Moles needed is 0.001 mol, since 1:1. At 0.1 M, volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So total volume is 40 +10 =50 mL, so 0.05 L. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, but when you have acetate in solution, it's a weak base. So pH should be around 9, but the options don't have that. Hmmm. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not just acetate, but also the hydroxide from water. Or maybe I should use the formula for the hydrolysis of acetate.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the exact equation without approximation. Let me try that.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Let x be [OH^-]. Then,

( x * (x + [H+ from water])) / (0.02 - x) ) = 5.405e-10.

Wait, but that's complicated because [H+] and x are related through water. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact quadratic equation.

So, Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

So, x^2 = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. Which gives [OH^-] = 1.04e-5, pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

But the options don't have pH near 9. Let's look again at the options, perhaps I messed up the initial calculations.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73  
C) 4.73; 7.00

D) 4.57; 6.92

None of these have equivalence point near 9, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the equivalence point calculation because the acetate isn't as strong a base as I thought. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the concentration.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me re-examine the problem. The problem is about titrating the diluted acetic acid with NaOH.

Wait, is the solution at equivalence point a solution of sodium acetate (which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base) in water. So, sodium acetate will dissociate completely, giving CH3COO^- and Na^+.

So, yes, the solution is 0.02 M acetate, but perhaps I forgot to consider activity coefficients or something, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let's recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5, so Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the solution is a buffer, but at equivalence point, it's a solution of the salt, which is a conjugate base.

Wait, another approach: the concentration is 0.02 M acetate. So, using the Kb expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for weak base:

OH^- = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5, as before.

So pH is 9.02. But none of the options have that. So I must have made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³, 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then adding 20 cm³ of water, so total volume 40 cm³. Moles remain 0.001, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's right.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is about a 25% titration based on the volume, not moles. But that doesn't make much sense. Oh wait, no, the 25% is of the titration, which refers to moles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that at equivalence, the solution is not just acetate but also some H+ or OH- from the hydrolysis, but I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point's pH. Because the options suggest that the equivalence point pH is around 7, perhaps I did something wrong earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point differently. Maybe I should take into account that when you have a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the anion.

Wait, another possibility: when you add a strong base like NaOH to a weak acid, the equivalence point is where the moles of base equal moles of acid. The solution at equivalence point is a solution of the conjugate base. So, the acetate ion, CH3COO^-, which is a weak base.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH correctly. Let me recheck.

Molarity of acetate is 0.02 M.

The Kb is 5.405e-10. So, Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5, pOH = 4.98, pH = 14 -4.98 =9.02.

But again, none of the options have that. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part of the problem.

Wait, maybe the initial diluted acetic acid concentration was miscalculated. Let me go back.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not with the equivalence point but with the
