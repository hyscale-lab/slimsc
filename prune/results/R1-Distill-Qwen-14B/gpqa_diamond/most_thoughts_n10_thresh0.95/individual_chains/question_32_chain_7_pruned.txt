Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think this through step by step.

The question states that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. I need to find the energy of RHIC so that this speed is achieved. The options are given in GeV, so I think I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus moving at that speed.

Wait, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, Li is Lithium. The usual lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6. I'll need the mass of Li-6 for this calculation.

So first, I remember that the total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by the rest mass energy. The formula is E = gamma * m_0 c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Given v = 0.96c, let's compute gamma. Let me plug in the numbers.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's calculate the denominator first. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass of a nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but I think for this problem, we can approximate it as the atomic mass. Alternatively, perhaps we can look up the mass of Li-6. I'm not exactly sure of the exact value, but maybe I can find it or approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass number and the average mass of a nucleon. Let's think. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², similar for a neutron. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons in total.

If each nucleon is roughly 938 MeV, then the total rest mass would be around 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that. 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. So m_0 c² would be about 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. The actual rest mass of Li-6 is probably a bit less than 6 * 938 MeV because when nucleons bind together, the mass slightly decreases due to the binding energy. But maybe for this problem, the approximation is sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps the exact mass is needed, so I should look it up.

Wait, I don't have exact data here, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the given mass in terms of the atomic mass. Let me recall. The atomic mass of Lithium-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.013 u is 6.013 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.013 *931.5 is about 12.11 MeV. So total is 5589 +12.11=5601.11 MeV, which is 5.60111 GeV. Hmm, so about 5.601 GeV. So m_0 c² is approximately 5.601 GeV.

Wait, but wait again. The actual mass of a nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy. So for Li-6, let me think: the atomic mass is given as approximately 6.013 u. So I can use that. So 6.013 u * 931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that more accurately.

6.013 multiplied by 931.5. Let me do this step by step.

6 * 931.5 = 5589.0 MeV.

0.013 *931.5 = 12.1095 MeV.

So total is 5589 +12.1095 = 5601.1095 MeV, which is 5.6011095 GeV. Rounded to four decimal places, that's 5.6011 GeV.

So m_0 c² is approximately 5.6011 GeV.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by that. Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.6011 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 *5.6011.

Hmm, let's do 3.5714 *5 =17.857, and 3.5714 *0.6011.

Wait, 5.6011 can be thought of as 5 + 0.6011.

So 3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 * 0.6011: Let's compute 3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284.

3.5714 *0.0011 = approximately 0.0039285.

Adding them: 2.14284 +0.0039285≈2.1467685.

So total E is 17.857 +2.1467685 =20.0037685 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because when I multiply 3.5714 by 5.6011, I think I might have messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should do this more accurately.

Compute 3.5714 *5.6011.

Let me think of it as 3.5714 *5.6011 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857, 3.5714 *0.6 =2.14284, 3.5714 *0.0011=0.00392854.

Wait, but 5.6011 is 5 + 0.6 + 0.0011.

So 3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.6 =2.14284.

3.5714 *0.0011=0.00392854.

Adding them: 17.857 + 2.14284 =19.99984, plus 0.00392854 gives 20.0037685.

Hmm, so about 20.0038 GeV.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419 GeV, which is close to 20.004 GeV. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me re-calculate gamma. v=0.96c, so (v/c)=0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Calculating (0.96)^2: 0.96 *0.96 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857... approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, that's correct. So gamma is about 3.57142857.

Now, the rest mass energy: 5.6011 GeV.

So 3.57142857 *5.6011.

Let me compute this more precisely.

5.6011 *3 =16.8033.

5.6011 *0.57142857.

Wait, 3.57142857 is 3 + 0.57142857
