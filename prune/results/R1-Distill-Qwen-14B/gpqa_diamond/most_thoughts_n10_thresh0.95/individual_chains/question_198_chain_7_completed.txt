Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, it's the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. So higher β means a more stable complex. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

So, the problem is about the various Co-SCN complexes. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^n+, where n is the number of SCN- ligands. The stability constants β1 to β4 correspond to the complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 SCN- ligands, respectively. Or wait, maybe β1 is for the first complex, like [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, etc. I'm a bit confused about the charges, but maybe I don't need to worry about that for this problem.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN ligands. So that's the β2 complex, which is β2=40. So I need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]^something in the solution.

To find the distribution of the complexes, I think we use the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the formation constants and the concentrations of the metal and ligand.

Let me think about the distribution. The idea is that each complex can form, and the fractions depend on β and the concentrations. The fractions are given by the expressions involving β and the concentrations. Oh right, the fraction f_n for the complex with n ligands is given by (β1β2...βn) multiplied by ([L]^n) divided by (1 + β1[L] + β1β2[L]^2 + ... + β1β2...β4 [L]^4), where L is the ligand concentration.

Wait, no. Or maybe each step is a sequential addition. For example, the first complex is [CoL]^2+, then [CoL2]^+, etc. But the exact charge might matter in terms of the stability constants. Hmm.

Alternatively, I remember that the fraction of a complex can be found using the formula:

f_n = (K_n [L]^n) / (sum from k=0 to 4 of K_k [L]^k )

Where K_k is the cumulative stability constant for k ligands. Wait, but in this case, β is given as the stepwise stability constants. Or is β the overall or cumulative? Hmm, this is a crucial point.

Wait, stability constants can be either stepwise or overall (cumulative). The question says β1, β2, etc., are the stability constants. So I need to clarify their nature. Typically, β is the cumulative constant, but sometimes it's the stepwise. Let me think.

Wait, the stepwise stability constant for the nth ligand is β_n = K_n / K_{n-1}, where K_n is the cumulative constant. So if the given β values are stepwise, then the cumulative would be the product up to that point.

Wait, but the problem says "stability constants" for each complex. So if β1 is for [CoL]^2+, β2 for [CoL2]^+, etc. So perhaps βn are the cumulative constants for each step.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The general approach is to write the formation of each complex step by step. For each n, the fractional concentration f_n is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n) / (sum from m=0 to 4 (β1 β2 ... βm [L]^m) )

But wait, the denominator is sum of all possible complexes, including the free ion (n=0), where the term would be 1 (since product of zero β's is 1, and [L]^0 is 1).

Alternatively, perhaps each β is the stepwise formation constant. For example, β1 is the formation of [CoL]^2+ from Co^2+ and L. Then β2 is the formation of [CoL2]^+ from [CoL]^2+ and another L. So the overall for [CoL2]^+ is β1 * β2.

In that case, the cumulative beta for each complex is the product of the stepwise betas up to that point.

So, for each complex [CoL]^2+ (n=1), the cumulative β is β1 =9.

For [CoL₂]^+ (n=2), the cumulative β is β1*β2=9*40=360.

Similarly, n=3: 9*40*63=9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

n=4: 22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So assuming these are the cumulative constants for each complex.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the problem gives four β values, probably for each possible complex up to four ligands.

Wait, but four ligands? Co(II) typically forms complexes with six ligands, but maybe in this case, it's four. Hmm, but maybe the problem only considers up to four ligands. Well, the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is two ligands, so n=2.

So, the fractions would depend on the product of the β's for each level.

Wait, but if each βn is the overall (cumulative) for n ligands, then for each complex, the formation constant is βn.

So, for each n, f_n = βn [L]^n / (sum for m=0 to 4 (βm [L]^m) )

Wait, but m=0 would be the free Co^2+ ion, but β0 would be 1, since it's the formation of the zero complex. So [L]^0 is 1, so the term is 1.

Wait, but wait, in the denominator, each term is βm [L]^m, right? So for m=0, that's 1 * [L]^0 =1.

Wait, but I think for the free ion, the term is 1 (since no ligands are bound), and for each m complex, the term is βm [L]^m.

So, the total denominator is sum from m=0 to 4 of βm [L]^m.

So, in this case, [L] is the concentration of thiocyanate, SCN^- which is 0.1 M.

So, let's compute each term in the denominator.

Compute each βm * [L]^m:

m=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 =1 *1=1

m=1: β1=9 * (0.1)^1 =9 *0.1=0.9

m=2: β2=40 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4

m=3: β3=63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063

m=4: β4=16 * (0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

Now, sum all these terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So the denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for m=2 (dithiocyanato complex) is f_2 = (β2 [L]^2) / denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ approximately 0.169.

Wait, 0.4 divided by 2.3646?

Let me compute: 2.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 0.4, because 0.169 * 2.3646 ≈ 0.399 (since 0.17 *2.36 is about 0.4).

So, 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is about 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So if that's for m=2, that gives approximately 16.9% which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. Because maybe I made a mistake in miscalculating the denominator or the individual terms.

Let's recalculate each term:

[L] = 0.1 M.

m=0: 1 * 1 =1.

m=1: β1=9, [L]=0.1 → 9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

m=3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

m=4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Summing: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4→2.3; +0.063→2.363; +0.0016→2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

f2 = 0.4 / 2.3646.

Calculating 0.4 / 2.3646:

Let me compute 0.4 / 2.3646.

Well, 2.3646 * 0.169 = ?

2 * 0.169 = 0.338.

0.3646 *0.169 ≈ 0.3646 *0.17 ≈ 0.061982.

So total ≈ 0.338 + 0.061982 ≈ 0.39998, which is about 0.4. So 0.169 is correct.

So f2 ≈ 0.169 → 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but wait—does the question account for all cobalt species, including the free Co²+?

Yes, because the denominator is the sum including all possible species, including the free ion.

So why is the answer option D?

Looking back at the options, option D is 16.9% which matches our calculation.

But wait, I thought the blue complex was maybe a higher or lower n. Hmm, but the question specifically says dithiocyanato, which is two ligands, so n=2.

So the fraction is 16.9% which is option D.

But wait, the answer options include option C as 38.1%. Did I make a mistake? Let's think again.

Wait, maybe the stability constants are given as stepwise rather than cumulative. That would change the calculations. Because if βn are the stepwise constants, then the cumulative constant for each complex is the product of all stepwise constants up to that point.

So, for n=1, β1=9 → cumulative β1=9.

n=2: β1*β2=9*40=360.

n=3: 9*40*63= 22680.

n=4: 22680 *16= 362880.

In that case, the denominator would be sum for m=0 to 4 of [cumulative βm * [L]^m].

So let's recalculate:

[L] =0.1.

m=0: 1 *1 =1.

m=1: 9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2: 360 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

m=3: 22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

m=4: 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Now sum all these:

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

The term for m=2 is 3.6. So f2 = 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05557 ≈ 5.56%.

That's not matching any of the options. Hmm, so perhaps my initial assumption was correct that the βs are the cumulative constants.

Wait, but the problem says the stability constants of the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So perhaps they are cumulative. Because if they were stepwise, the numbers would be way higher.

So the initial approach where m=0 to n=4 with βm as the cumulative, gives f2≈16.9%.

So the correct answer would be D)16.9%.

But let me check the options again.

The options are:

A)42.3%
B)25.6%
C)38.1%
D)16.9%

So D matches our calculation. So why would one of the other options be correct?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the denominator. Let me recheck.

Wait, the free ion is m=0, which is 1.

Then each complex is m=1 (β1=9), m=2 (β2=40), etc. So in the denominator, each term is βm * [L]^m.

Wait, that's correct. Because for each complex, the term is βm * [L]^m.

So in that case, the denominator is 1 + 9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Which is 1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

So f2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 → 16.9%, which is D.

So why does the option C is 38.1%? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes regardless of charge or something else? Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the total amount of Co in each complex.

Wait, the problem states: "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species."

So all species include the free Co²+ and all the complexes.

In our calculation, for m=2, the fraction is 16.9%, which is D.

So why is option C 38%? Let me think, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, another thing: perhaps the [L] is different. Wait, the problem says [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So [L] is 0.1.

Wait, but in the denominator, the terms are [L]^m multiplied by βm.

So perhaps I'm correct.

Alternative approach: perhaps the stability constants are given as the log β, but no, the problem gives them as β.

Alternatively, maybe the [Co] is 0.01 M, but that's the total cobalt concentration. But in the distribution, the [Co] is part of all species, but the fractions are based on the ligand's concentration.

Wait, no, because the fractions are calculated using the ligand concentration and the stability constants. The [Co] total is the sum of all the fractions, but since each fraction is normalized, the total [Co] is accounted for.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the [Co] is distributed among the complexes and the free ion. But in the calculation, the fractions are based on the ligand concentration and the stability constants, so the total [Co] would be the sum of all f_n times the overall concentration.

Wait, no, the fractions are calculated as the ratio of each species to the total, so their sum is 100% regardless of the total concentration.

Ah, but wait, perhaps the [L] is 0.1 M, but the [Co] is 0.01 M. So the concentration of Co is lower. Does that affect the calculation?

No, because the fractions are calculated based on the stability constants and the ligand concentration. The actual concentration of Co doesn't directly affect the fraction, as the fractions are a ratio. Unless the solution is so dilute that activity coefficients come into play, but that's beyond the scope here.

So, I think my initial approach is correct, giving 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁺) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations. The stability constants β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16 correspond to the cumulative equilibrium constants for the formation of complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ligands, respectively. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

The fraction of a complex with \( n \) ligands is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [L]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^{4} \beta_m [L]^m}
\]

where \( \beta_m \) is the stability constant for the \( m \)-ligand complex, \( [L] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), and \( \beta_0 = 1 \) for the free cobalt ion.

### Step 1: Calculate each term in the denominator
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{For } m = 0: & \quad \beta_0 [L]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \\
\text{For } m = 1: & \quad \beta_1 [L]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \\
\text{For } m = 2: & \quad \beta_2 [L]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \\
\text{For } m = 3: & \quad \beta_3 [L]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \\
\text{For } m = 4: & \quad \beta_4 [L]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \\
\end{align*}
\]

### Step 2: Sum the terms to find the denominator
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the fraction for \( m = 2 \) (dithiocyanato complex)
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [L]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 4: Convert to percentage
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
