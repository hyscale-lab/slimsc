Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, first, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think SMEFT is a framework where you consider all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). So the SM has certain symmetries, and SMEFT must respect those as well.

So the SM has Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Operators in SMEFT, being effective, must respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1, Lorentz Symmetry, has to be respected. So that's a yes.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, like shifts in position. So if the theory has Poincare symmetry, it implies the theory is invariant under translations. The SM does have Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT should as well. So option 2, Poincare, must be respected. So 1 and 2 are in.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you talk about effective theories, you might have operators that don't respect some symmetries. But SMEFT is specifically built to maintain the same symmetries as the SM. So yes, Poincare symmetry is part of that.

Now, what about CP and CPT? The SM has CPT symmetry. SMEFT would also include operators that respect CPT. But wait, can operators violate CP? Because in the SM, for example, certain processes can violate CP, like in the electroweak interactions. So perhaps the operators in SMEFT can have CP violation.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. SMEFT includes all possible operators that are consistent with the symmetries of the SM. So if the SM allows for some operators that violate CP (like in the CKM matrix), then SMEFT would allow such terms as well. So the operators themselves can potentially violate CP, but does that mean that CP symmetry is not a symmetry that SMEFT must respect?

Wait no, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if some operators in SMEFT violate CP, then the theory as a whole doesn't have CP symmetry. But wait, maybe the question is about whether the operators must individually respect the symmetry, or whether the theory as a whole must respect it. Hmm.

Wait, I think the point is that all operators in SMEFT must have terms that respect the same symmetries as the SM. So for example, the SM respects Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP. Because in the SM, some processes violate CP (like in the CKM matrix), but the SM still respects CPT.

Wait, but wait. The SM's Lagrangian is CPT invariant. Because when you construct the theory, the interactions are such that CPT symmetry holds. So all the operators in SMEFT must respect CPT because that's a symmetry of the SM. But CP symmetry is not necessarily respected because the SM allows for CP violation.

So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, but they must respect CPT. So the question is, which of these symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect.

So looking back at the options: the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators.

So let's consider each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Yes, all operators must be Lorentz-invariant. Because they are part of the SM's symmetry, SMEFT must include terms that are Lorentz scalars.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Since the SM has Poincare, SMEFT does too. So all operators must be Poincare invariant.

3. CP symmetry: No. Because the SM allows for operators that violate CP (like the CKM phase), SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry.

4. CPT symmetry: Yes, because the SM is CPT invariant, so SMEFT must respect CPT.

So which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So option C) 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me think again — sometimes, I might have mixed up whether the operators must individually respect the symmetry or the theory must have the symmetry. But I think it's the former. So each operator must be a scalar under the symmetry. For example, all operators must be Lorentz scalars, which is 1. Poincare symmetry requires translation invariance, so the operators must not depend on position, which is already part of being a Lorentz scalar. So yes, 2 is included.

CP symmetry is not required because the SM already allows for CP violation, so the operators can have terms that break CP. But CPT is a requirement because the SM respects it. So all operators must be CPT invariant.

So the correct answer must include 1,2,4.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So the answer is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model (SM). These symmetries include Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. However, CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT because the SM already allows for CP violation in certain processes (e.g., through the CKM phase). Therefore, SMEFT can include operators that violate CP symmetry.

### Analysis of Each Symmetry:
1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because they are constructed as Lorentz scalars, consistent with the SM.
2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance, is also respected by all SMEFT operators because the SM has Poincaré symmetry.
3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all SMEFT operators, as the SM allows for CP violation, and SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP.
4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is respected by all SMEFT operators because the SM is CPT-invariant, and SMEFT maintains this symmetry.

### Conclusion:
The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré symmetry (2)**, and **CPT symmetry (4)**. CP symmetry (3) is not required because SMEFT can include operators that violate it.
