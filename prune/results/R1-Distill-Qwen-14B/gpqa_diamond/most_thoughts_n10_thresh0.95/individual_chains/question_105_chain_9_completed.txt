Okay, so I need to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, but it has dark spots covering one hemisphere. The spots have a filling factor of 20%, and the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler. The scenario is that when the star rotates, these spots cause changes in brightness that look like an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is asking, if the star wasn't spotted, what would be the radius of a planet needed to produce the same brightness variation amplitude.

Wait, so the observed brightness variation from the spots is mimicking a planet transit. So I need to compare the two scenarios: one where the star has spots causing the variation, and another where a planet causes the same variation. So I need to find the planet radius Rpl such that the brightness dip when it transits is equal to the dip caused by the spots.

First, let me think about how the brightness variation works.

When a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. The formula I remember is: 
ΔF = (Rpl / Rstar)^2 

Because the area blocked is the area of the planet relative to the star, and flux is proportional to area.

But wait, in this problem, the star has spots that are cooler. So when the spots rotate into and out of view, the star's observed brightness changes because the spots are darker. The star's normal brightness is when the spots are on the far side, and when a spot comes into the front, the observed flux drops because that part is cooler.

So I think the variation caused by the spots is different from a planet transit. Let me model both scenarios.

First, the star's total flux without spots: F0 = σ T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is Teff.

But the star has spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots. Each spot has a temperature of (6000 - 1000) = 5000 K.

Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the surface area is spots. Each spot is at T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So the total flux without considering rotation would be F = F0 * (1 - f) + f * F_spot.

Wait, F0 is the flux per unit area of the star. So F0 = σ * (6000)^4.

F_spot = σ * (5000)^4.

So the total flux when the spots are on the front side is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

f is 0.2, so:

F = 0.8 * F0 + 0.2 * (F_spot).

The flux without any spots (f=0) would be F0. So the change in flux when spots are visible is ΔF_spot = F - F0 = 0.2*(F_spot - F0).

Wait, but when the star is unspotted, F is F0. When the spots are on the side facing us, the flux is F as above.

So the change is F = F0 * [0.8 + 0.2*(F_spot / F0)].

So F_spot / F0 is (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4. Let's compute that.

(5/6)^4: 5^4=625, 6^4=1296. 625/1296 ≈ 0.482.

So F_spot = 0.482 * F0.

So F = 0.8 * F0 + 0.2 * 0.482 * F0 = [0.8 + 0.0964] * F0 = 0.8964 * F0.

So the observed flux when spots are visible is 0.8964 * F0, compared to F0 when spots are on the far side.

So the relative change in flux is (F - F0)/F0 = (0.8964 - 1) = -0.1036, or -10.36% change.

Wait, but wait, when the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower. So the maximum dip would be when the spots are fully visible. So the maximum dip is about 10.36% of F0.

Wait, but the star is only spotted on one hemisphere. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So when the star is rotating, the spots come into view and out of view. But since one hemisphere is covered, when the star rotates, the spots are either visible or not. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the lower flux; when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, the flux is higher? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the star is a sphere. So if one hemisphere (say, the front) is spotted, when the star rotates, different parts come into view. Oh, wait, perhaps the situation is that the star has spots on one side, and when that side is facing us, we get the lower flux. But when the star rotates 180 degrees, the same side is facing away, so the unspotted hemisphere is visible. So the maximum flux is when the unspotted side is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted side is facing us.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% of the star's surface. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see 20% of the spots covering the hemisphere. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the total surface covered by spots. So if the spots are on one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then each hemisphere would have 10% coverage? Hmm, perhaps I should think of the filling factor as the fraction of the entire surface covered by spots. So each hemisphere would have spots covering 10% of its area. No, wait, if the total is 20%, and the spots are all on one hemisphere, then the covered area on that hemisphere is 20% of the total surface area, which is the same as 10% of the hemisphere's area. Because the hemisphere is half the surface.

Wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4πR². So each hemisphere is 2πR². So if the spots cover 20% of the entire surface, that's 0.2 * 4πR² = 0.8πR². So on a single hemisphere (2πR²), the spots take up (0.8πR²)/(2πR²) ) = 0.4, so 40% of the hemisphere? No, because 0.8 divided by 2 is 0.4, so 40% of each hemisphere? Hmm, perhaps I should think that the spots are all on one hemisphere and cover 20% of the entire star's surface. So when that hemisphere is facing us, we see 20% of the star's surface as spots. So the visible flux would be 80% of F0 (normal) plus 20% times F_spot.

Wait wait, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the star's surface that's spots is 20% of the entire surface, so 20% is covered by spots. So the flux is:

F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

Which is 0.8 F0 + 0.2 * F_spot.

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side, so F = F0.

So the maximum change is when the spots are visible. The variation in flux is F0 - [0.8 F0 + 0.2 F_spot] = 0.2 (F0 - F_spot).

Wait, let me compute F_spot again.

F_spot = σ (5000)^4, and F0 = σ (6000)^4.

So F_spot/F0 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So F = 0.8 * F0 + 0.2 * 0.4823 F0 = (0.8 + 0.09646) F0 ≈ 0.89646 F0.

So when the spots are visible, the flux is 0.89646 F0.

When the spots are not visible (the other hemisphere is facing), the flux is F0.

So the flux variation is F0 (when unspotted) and 0.89646 F0 (when spotted). So the amplitude (change) is F0 - 0.89646 F0 = 0.10354 F0, about 10.35% of F0.

Wait, but wait. When the planet transits, the flux drops by (Rpl / Rstar)^2 * F0. So to get the same amplitude, we set (Rpl / Rstar)^2 * F0 = 0.10354 F0.

So (Rpl / Rstar)^2 = 0.10354.

Taking square root: Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(0.10354) ≈ 0.3218.

So Rpl ≈ 0.3218 Rstar, which is about 0.32. But wait, that's in the options. Option D is ~0.32. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, no, the situation is that the spots cause a 10% dip, but when a planet transits, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So for the planet to cause the same dip as the spots, we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10354.

Which gives Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10354) ≈ 0.3218, so about 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. The spot situation is only showing a dip of about 10%, but the exoplanet transit would cause a dip of Rpl^2 / Rstar^2. So we set that equal to 0.10354.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is 0.32^2=0.1024, close to 0.10354.

So the answer would be D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second, when the planet transits, the dip is proportional to (Rpl / Rstar)^2. So if the dip is 0.10354, then (Rpl/Rstar)^2=0.10354, so Rpl/Rstar is about 0.3218, which is ~32% of the star's radius. So option D is correct.

But wait, the problem says "produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". So the spots cause a dip of about 10%, so the planet must cause a dip of the same 10%, which would require Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.32.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~0.39, which is about 0.39^2=0.152, which is a 15% dip. That's larger than 10%, so not matching.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait wait, let me recheck the math.

F_spot = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5^4=625, 6^4=1296. 625/1296≈0.482253.

So F =0.8 F0 + 0.2 * 0.482253 F0 = 0.8 + 0.0964506 = 0.8964506 F0.

So the flux when spotted is 0.89645 F0.

The change (dip) is F0 - 0.89645 F0 = 0.10355 F0.

So the flux amplitude (the dip) is 10.355% of F0.

So the planet's transit must cause the same dip. So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32, option D.

So the answer is D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the scenarios of both the star with spots and the planet transit.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Star with Spots**:  
   - The star has a filling factor of 20%, meaning 20% of its surface is covered by cooler spots.  
   - The effective temperature of the star is \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and the spots have a temperature \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - The flux from the star without spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.  
   - The flux from the spotted star is given by:  
     \[
     F = (1 - f) F_0 + f F_{\text{spot}},
     \]  
     where \( f = 0.2 \) is the filling factor, and \( F_{\text{spot}} = \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \).  
   - Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), we find:  
     \[
     \frac{F_{\text{spot}}}{F_0} = \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.482.
     \]  
   - The total flux when the spots are visible is:  
     \[
     F = 0.8 F_0 + 0.2 (0.482 F_0) = 0.8964 F_0.
     \]  
   - The flux variation (dip) is:  
     \[
     \Delta F = F_0 - F = F_0 - 0.8964 F_0 = 0.1036 F_0.
     \]  
     This corresponds to a relative flux dip of approximately \( 10.36\% \).

2. **Planet Transit**:  
   - When a planet transits the star, the flux dip is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:  
     \[
     \Delta F = \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 F_0.
     \]  
   - To match the flux dip caused by the spots (\( 0.1036 F_0 \)), we set:  
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1036.
     \]  
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \):  
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.3218.
     \]  
     This corresponds to approximately \( 0.32 \) of the star's radius.

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - Option A (\( 0.39 \)): \( (0.39)^2 = 0.152 \), which corresponds to a \( 15.2\% \) dip, larger than \( 10.36\% \).  
   - Option B (\( 0.07 \)): \( (0.07)^2 = 0.0049 \), which corresponds to a \( 0.49\% \) dip, much smaller than \( 10.36\% \).  
   - Option C (\( 0.11 \)): \( (0.11)^2 = 0.0121 \), which corresponds to a \( 1.21\% \) dip, much smaller than \( 10.36\% \).  
   - Option D (\( 0.32 \)): \( (0.32)^2 = 0.1024 \), which corresponds to a \( 10.24\% \) dip, very close to \( 10.36\% \).  

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star is approximately \( 0.32 \) times the radius of the host star.
