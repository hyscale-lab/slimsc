Okay, so I have this question about general relativity or differential geometry, I think. The question gives me a metric and asks about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. So, the metric is in terms of x and y coordinates. I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But here, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere, which I think is a type of black hole solution, like the Schwarzschild solution. Oh wait, Schwarzschild has a metric with a singularity at r=2M, right? But I'm not sure.

Wait, pseudosphere—I think that's another term used for a black hole, maybe. Alternatively, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps it's the event horizon area of a black hole with radius 2. 

In Schwarzschild geometry, the area of the event horizon is 4πr², right? So for r=2, that would be 4π*(2)^2=16π. But wait, let me check the options. The options don't have 16π. Looking again, options B and C are 4π times (x² + y²) and (x² - y²), which don't look like numbers. Option D is infinity, A is zero. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach. The metric is given in terms of x and y. Let me see if I can recognize the coordinates. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Oh, that looks like the Schwarzschild metric in some coordinates. Wait, the Schwarzschild metric in usual coordinates is ds² = -(1 - 2M/r) dt² + (1 - 2M/r)^{-1} dr² + r² dθ². But the given metric here doesn't have a time component, only dx² and dy². So maybe it's a two-dimensional metric? Or perhaps it's a conformally flat metric in higher dimensions.

Wait, maybe this is the metric in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates or something else. Alternatively, perhaps this is a metric for a two-dimensional space, like the induced metric on a sphere in a higher-dimensional spacetime. Hmm.

Wait, the metric is conformally flat because it's a multiple of (dx² + dy²). So the line element is conformally related to flat spacetime. The conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). But what is the significance of this?

I think the area would involve integrating over a sphere. Wait, but in two dimensions, the area is just the integral of the determinant of the metric. Wait, no, in two dimensions, the area element would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere, which is a 2-sphere, I think. Or wait, no—pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, but in Schwarzschild, the event horizon is a sphere.

Wait, maybe I should compute the Ricci scalar or see if this is a solution to Einstein's equations. Alternatively, perhaps the area depends on the metric's properties.

Wait, let me think about the metric. It's ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the line element is only in x and y, which makes me think it's a 2-dimensional spacetime, but that's probably a simplification. Alternatively, perhaps it's written in a coordinate system where x and y are angular coordinates. Because in Schwarzschild, the radial coordinate is r, and the angular part is r² dθ² + r² sin²θ dφ². Hmm, but that doesn't directly match here.

Wait, the denominator 4 - x² - y² suggests that x² + y² < 4 for the metric to be real. So the region is inside a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But I'm not sure how that connects to the area of a pseudosphere.

Wait, the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the area is 4πr², which would be 16π. But looking at the options, the options don't have 16π. They have expressions with x and y, which doesn't make sense for the area. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question is about the area of the pseudosphere. But in the metric given, if the pseudosphere is described by this metric, what is its area?

Wait, the metric is given in 2D, but a pseudosphere is a 2D surface. So the area would be the integral over the surface. Let me think. The area A is the integral of sqrt(det g) dx dy, but since the metric is conformally flat, sqrt(det g) = 32/(4 -x² - y²). So the area would be the integral over x and y of [32/(4 -x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So x² + y² <4. So the integration area is the circle of radius 2. But wait, the integral becomes ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ, where r is sqrt(x² + y²), θ is the angle. Let me compute that.

Express in polar coordinates: x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So dx dy = r dr dθ.

The integral becomes ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 / (4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Compute the integral: 32/(4 - r²) * r dr. Let me compute the inner integral first.

Let me change variable: let u = 4 - r², then du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So integral from r=0 to r=2: 32/(u) * (r dr) → 32/(u) (-du/2). But when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ (u from 4 to 0) [1/u] (-du/2) → 32 * (1/2) ∫ (from 0 to 4) (1/u) du.

Which is 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du. But ∫(1/u) du from 0 to 4 diverges because as u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln(u) approaches negative infinity. So the integral would be 16 [ln u from 0 to4] → 16 (ln4 - (-∞)) → infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because a pseudosphere should have finite area. Or maybe in this case, the metric leads to an infinite area? But why?

Wait, I'm integrating the area element of the pseudosphere. But if the metric is singular at r=2 (since denominator becomes zero), perhaps the area is infinite. So the area would be infinite, which would correspond to option D.

But wait, the options are:

A)0,

B)4π(x² + y²),

C)4π(x² - y²),

D)+infty.

So the correct answer would be D, +infty.

But I'm a bit confused because the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and such surfaces have finite area. Wait, no, wait. A pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) is a surface in Euclidean space with finite area, but in the context of general relativity, perhaps the metric given here is singular, leading to an infinite area.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral. Let me recheck. The integral of 1/u from 0 to4 is ln u evaluated from 0 to4, which is ln4 - ln0. But ln0 is negative infinity, so the integral is infinity. So the area is indeed infinite.

So the area of this pseudosphere is infinite. Hence, the correct answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This metric describes a 2-dimensional spacetime that is conformally flat, with the conformal factor being \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) implies that the metric is only real for \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), corresponding to a region inside a circle of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane.

The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute this, the area element in the metric is given by \( \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy \). Since the metric is conformally flat, \( \sqrt{\det g} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). Thus, the area \( A \) is:

\[
A = \int \int \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \) contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), leaving:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2} \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot 32 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln u \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). Therefore, the area is infinite.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere described by this metric is infinite.

Answer: D
