Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, right, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction will involve neutralization. Let me think about each part step by step.

First, when we dilute the acetic acid. Initially, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (since 20+20=40). I think the concentration will change because we're diluting it.

Wait, dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The new volume V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = (1)/40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. Got it.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is to find the pH at 25% titration. Then, the pH at equivalence point.

Let me tackle each part.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity * Volume (in liters) = 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. Let me find the volume needed to reach equivalence.

Moles NaOH = moles acetic acid, so 0.001 = 0.1 * V → V=0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, because 0.1 M NaOH, so volume is moles divided by 0.1. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

But the problem is asking for the pH at 25% titration. So I guess 25% of the equivalence volume. Since equivalence is 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps 25% of the way to equivalence in the reaction. Hmm, but the question says 25% titration, which probably refers to
