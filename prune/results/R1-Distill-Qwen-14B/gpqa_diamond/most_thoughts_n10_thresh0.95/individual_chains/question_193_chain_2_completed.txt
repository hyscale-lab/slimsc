Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance based on the given relation. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. 

Wait, what's parallax again? Oh right, parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1/parallax. So if parallax is plx, then distance r is approximately 1/plx. 

So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and since plx is 1/r, I can substitute that in. Let's write that down: N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Wait, that would be N ∝ r^5? Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, and 1 divided by that is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So I think that means the differential, like the change in N with respect to r, dN/dr. Oh wait, wait, no. Because the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases as the fifth power. 

But the options are about how the number changes with distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. So for each unit increase in r, the number goes up by r^5. 

Wait, but wait another point. When you're considering the number of stars per unit volume, or per some other measure, it's often about the density. Oh wait, no, the problem says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So in that region, N is proportional to r^5. So, the number of stars in that region increases with distance to the fifth power. 

Wait, but I've heard that the number of stars per unit volume decreases with distance because stars are more spread out. But wait, the question is about how the number (total) in a region varies with distance. So if you have a region at a distance r, how many stars are in that region. 

Wait, maybe I should think about the flux or the density. For stars, the number density (stars per cubic parsec) usually decreases with distance because they're spread out, so n ∝ 1/r^2 or something like that. But this problem is different because the relation given is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which directly translates to N ∝ r^5. So in this specific case, the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. 

Wait, but isn't that counterintuitive? Because as you look further away, you're seeing more stars, but why would the number go up with r^5? Maybe because the region is expanding in volume as r increases, but the density is increasing even more? Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but according to the given relation, N is proportional to r^5, so the number of stars in that region increases with the fifth power of distance. 

So looking at the options, option B is r^5. So the number of stars in that region would change with distance as r^5. So the correct answer is B.


The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relation, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

This indicates that the number of stars in the region increases with the fifth power of distance. The question specifically asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, \( r \)), and the given relation directly implies \( N \propto r^5 \). 

Thus, the number of stars in the region increases as \( r^5 \), making the correct answer:

**Answer: B**
