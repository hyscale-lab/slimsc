Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about complex ions and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, also called formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the beta (β) value, the more stable the complex.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are [Co] = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, I think these are for the complexes [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2]^2+, [Co(SCN)3]^3+, and [Co(SCN)4]^4+ respectively.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ions, so that's the [Co(SCN)₂]²+ complex. So I need to find the fraction of this complex compared to all possible cobalt species in the solution.

I remember that in such problems, we can model the distribution of the metal between different complexes using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The general approach is to set up a fraction equation where each fraction represents the concentration of each complex relative to the total.

The formula for each fraction is (β^n * [SCN-]^n) / (1 + sum of all β^n [SCN-]^n terms). Wait, let me think. The fraction of a particular complex, say [Co(SCN)_n]^(n-), is given by (β_n [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of all terms (β_i [SCN]^i) for i from 1 to 4. Because the Co(II) can form complexes with 1 to 4 SCN- ions.

So the general formula for the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / Σ (from m=1 to 4) [ β_m [SCN]^m ]

In this case, we're interested in f_2, the fraction for the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]²+.

So let's compute each term in the denominator.

First, calculate each β_m multiplied by [SCN]^m.

Given that [SCN-] is 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

m=1: β1 * [SCN]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9
m=2: β2 * [SCN]^2 =40 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4
m=3: β3 * [SCN]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063
m=4: β4 * [SCN]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016

Wait, let me calculate each step:

m=1:
9 * 0.1 = 0.9

m=2:
40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

m=3:
63 * (0.1)^3 =63 * 0.001 = 0.063

m=4:
16 * (0.1)^4 =16 * 0.0001=0.0016

So the terms are 0.9, 0.4, 0.063, and 0.0016.

Now sum these terms to get the denominator.

Adding them up: 0.9 + 0.4 = 1.3; 1.3 + 0.063 = 1.363; 1.363 + 0.0016 ≈ 1.3646.

Wait, more accurately:

0.9 + 0.4 =1.3 → 1.3 + 0.063 =1.363 → 1.363 + 0.0016 =1.3646.

So denominator is 1.3646.

The numerator for f_2 is the term for m=2, which is 0.4.

So f2 = 0.4 / 1.3646 ≈ 0.2925.

Wait, let me compute that: 0.4 divided by 1.3646. 

Calculating 0.4 / 1.3646 ≈ 0.2925, which is about 29.25%.

Wait, but wait a second. The options given are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. Hmm, none of these are 29.25%.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the terms.

Wait, wait, perhaps I misapplied the stability constants. Oh wait, stability constants are for each step of formation, or are these overall constants?

Wait, another thought: the stability constant for each complex is the overall β for that complex. So [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) has a β value equal to the product of the stepwise formation constants. Or is β given for each complex as the overall formation constant?

I think in this case, the βs are for each complex, meaning that β1 is for [Co(SCN)]+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc. So the formation constants are given for the overall complexes.

So the formula I used earlier should be correct.

Wait, but let me recalculate the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate [Co(SCN)]^n as the concentration of the complex, and the sum is over all possible complexes and the free Co^2+?

Wait, wait a minute. No, wait. The initial assumption is that the total cobalt is the sum of all the complexes and the free ions. But in this problem, the total [Co] is given as 1e-2 M, which includes all species: free Co^2+ and all complexes.

Wait, no, wait! Wait, the way the fractions are calculated is relative to the sum of all possible species, including the free Co^2+.

Wait, another approach: The fractions are calculated as the concentration of each complex divided by the total concentration of all complexes and free ions.

Wait, but perhaps I should model the formation of the complexes step by step.

Let me think again.

The metal is Co^2+; the ligand is SCN^-.

The possible complexes are:

Co^2+ → [Co(SCN)]^+ → [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} → [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} → [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+}.

Each step has a certain stability constant, which is the ratio of the concentration of the complex to that of the previous species multiplied by ligand concentration.

Wait, but in the problem, the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So perhaps these are the overall β for each complex. For example:

β1 is [Co(SCN)]^+ / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )

Wait, no, that can't be right because the β values would then be stepwise, but the problem states they are stability constants for the complexes. So each βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions.

So the fraction of each complex is (βn [SCN]^n) / ( sum from n=0 to 4 [βn [SCN]^n ] + [Co^2+] )

Wait, but wait, the free Co^2+ is when n=0. Hmm, but in the given problem, the total [Co] is 1e-2 M, which includes all species: free Co^2+ and all complexes.

Wait, maybe the fraction is calculated as the concentration of each complex divided by the total concentration (sum of all complexes and free Co^2+).

Alternatively, there's another approach where we take into account the distribution of the species.

Another way to think about it is that the fraction of each species can be found by considering the formation of each complex step by step, using the given β values.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to model the formation of each complex in terms of the ligand concentration.

Let me outline the approach.

The general approach for such a problem is to calculate the fraction of each complex as follows:

The fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + [SCN] β1 + [SCN]^2 β2 + [SCN]^3 β3 + [SCN]^4 β4 )

Wait, but wait, that denominator seems to be missing a term for the free Co^2+. Because the denominator should include all possible species: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is the sum of all the terms, including the free ion term.

Wait, I think the denominator should be the sum of all terms where each term is [SCN]^m multiplied by the product of the β's up to that point. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the formation of each complex is a stepwise process, and each βn is the stepwise formation constant, not the overall. Hmm, but wait, the problem states they are stability constants of the complexes, which are overall constants.

Wait, perhaps I should model the species as follows:

The possible species are:

1. Co^2+ → free ion
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ → 1 SCN
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} → 2 SCN
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} → 3 SCN
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+} → 4 SCN

The formation of each complex is a stepwise process, so each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex.

So the fraction of each species can be calculated using their respective βn and the ligand concentration.

The formula for the fraction of each species is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum over all m of β_m [SCN]^m) )

But wait, the free Co^2+ is when n=0, so β0 = 1 (since [Co^2+] = [Co^2+][SCN]^0 / ([Co^2+][SCN]^0) ), which is not applicable. Alternatively, the free term is 1 (since β0 is 1, and [SCN]^0 is 1), so the denominator includes 1 as the term for m=0.

Ah, now
