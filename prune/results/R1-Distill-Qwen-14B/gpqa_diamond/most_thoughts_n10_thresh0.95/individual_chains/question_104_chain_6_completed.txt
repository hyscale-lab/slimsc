Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. 

The question says there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the key here is the relation between the Doppler shift (which is the velocity of the star) and the orbital period. Oh right, the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the distance between the star and planet. 

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ) * ( (1) / ( (P * (2π)) / (c * (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3)) ) )) ) Wait, maybe I'm mixing up factors here. Alternatively, I think the formula is K ≈ (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )) )

But wait, the problem states that both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun. So M_planet << M_star. So I can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. That should simplify the formula.

So the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, let me think again. The formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * ( (2π) / (c P ) )^(1/3) )

But for a circular orbit (e=0), the term (1 - e²) becomes 1, so that term is 1. So it's proportional to (M_planet) * ( (2π / (c P) )^(1/3) ) ) divided by M_star^(1/3) ), because (M_star + M_planet) ≈ M_star, so (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ≈ M_star^(1/3).

So putting it together: K ∝ (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

But wait, since both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), M_planet is the same for both. And M_star is the same (both stars are Sun-like). So K should be proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). 

Wait, that can't be right because if K is larger, that implies a smaller P? Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K is larger, P would be smaller. 

Wait the problem says that Planet #1 has a shift of 5 mA, Planet #2 has 7 mA. So K2 is larger than K1. 

So K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). Therefore P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). 

Let me write this as:

K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1 / K^(3) → P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3 

Because if K increases, P decreases. 

So the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Given K1 =5, K2=7.

So (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because K is larger when the star's velocity is higher, meaning a more massive planet or shorter period (since a shorter period would cause more wobble per unit time? Or is it the other way around? I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the formula again.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (2π) / (c) )^(1/3) ) / ( P^(1/3) ) ) ] * sin i 

Assuming sin i is about the same (but since we don't know, perhaps it's considered constant for the problem, as both planets are around their respective stars. So the ratio K2/K1 would be ( (M2 sin i2) / (M1 sin i1) ) * (P1/P2)^(1/3) )

But since M_planets are similar (Neptune), and assuming sin i is same (like both planets have similar orbital inclinations, which is a safe assumption if not stated otherwise), then K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

But wait, wait. Let me write it correctly.

Because K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So for two planets, K2 / K1 = (M2 / M1) * ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3) / (M_star2^(1/3) / M_star1^(1/3) )

But since M_star1 = M_star2, and M2 ≈ M1, the ratio becomes (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So rearranged, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

So plug the numbers: K1 =5, K2=7.

So (5/7)^3= (5^3)/(7^3) =125/343≈0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. Wait, that would mean P2 is shorter than P1, but the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1.

Wait wait wait. Wait, the question says: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

If P2 is smaller (0.364 * P1), then it's shorter, not longer. So that would imply that the answer is 0.36 times, so it's shorter, which would mean the ratio is less than 1. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1, which is less than P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. But the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because if it's shorter, then it's not longer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio backwards. Let me double-check.

We have K proportional to 1/P^(1/3).

So K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * constant.

K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * same constant.

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Which leads to P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, if K2 is larger than K1, then K1/K2 is less than 1, so (K1/K2)^3 is less than 1, so P2 is less than P1. So planet #2 has a shorter period than planet #1. So when the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1, the answer would be P2 is (0.36) times P1. So it's shorter. So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, the options are: A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

So the answer should be A, 0.36.

But wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Because I think the formula for K also includes (M_p / M_s), but since both are similar, it's the same. So yes, the conclusion remains.

So the answer is option A, ~0.36.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, \( K \), is proportional to \( 1/P^{1/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. This relationship arises because the star's velocity is inversely related to the cube root of the orbital period.

Given that both stars have the same mass as the Sun and the planets have similar masses to Neptune, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \( K_2/K_1 \) can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for the ratio of orbital periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
