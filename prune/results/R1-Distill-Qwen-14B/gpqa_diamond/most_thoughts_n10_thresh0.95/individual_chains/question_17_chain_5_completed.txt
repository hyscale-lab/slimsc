Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the stability constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complexation reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Oh wait, but EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so the formula might have more than one EDTA? No, wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for Ca-EDTA complexes, I think. So each Ca²+ binds one EDTA^4-.

The stability constant, K, is given as 5e10. Stability constant expressions... right, K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up K and Kf (formation constant). Oh right, K for the complex is the formation constant Kf. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But in this solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M? Well, assuming that all the Ca is in the complex form because Kf is large, which makes sense since Kf is 5e10, a very large number, meaning the complex is very stable.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. So the initial concentrations are such that [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

But we need to find [Ca²+] in solution. Since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and the complex is very stable, the dissociation of the complex would be minimal. So the amount of free Ca²+ would be very low.

Let me write down the equation again. Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the EDTA^4- concentration. Because EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on pH. Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so I guess we can assume that the majority of EDTA is in the correct deprotonated form (Y^4-) to form the complex. So the concentration of EDTA^4- would just be the free EDTA in solution minus whatever is used in the complex.

Wait, but wait. If all the Ca is in the complex, then the free EDTA would be the total EDTA minus the EDTA bound in the complex. But wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. I'm trying to figure out if the EDTA is in excess or if Ca is in excess. But the question is about the concentration of Ca²+ in solution, so perhaps the initial assumption is that the complex is formed, and we can approximate that the dissociation is negligible.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would be also x, assuming that each mole of complex releases one mole of each ion.

Wait, but that might not be correct because the total EDTA includes the free EDTA and the EDTA bound in the complex. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the total concentration of EDTA is equal to the concentration of the complex plus the free EDTA. But if the complex is very stable (Kf is large), then the dissociation is minimal, so [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the total EDTA minus the amount in the complex. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentrations can be considered as follows: the Ca-EDTA complex is at 0.02 M, and any dissociation would produce x amount of Ca²+ and x amount of EDTA^4-. So:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Then, Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10

So 0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10))

Wait, let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. 5e10 is 5e10.

So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

Taking square root: sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5 is 6.324e-7. Wait, 2e-6.5 is the same as 6.324e-7, because 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 times that is 6.32e-7.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Which would be option C) 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me go through that calculation again.

x² = (0.02) / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) → sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. So that's about 6.3e-7 M. So option C is the answer.

Wait, but another thought: in the expression for Kf, [EDTA^4-] is from the dissociation of the complex. But if EDTA is present in excess, then [EDTA^4-] would be higher, but in our case, we're assuming that all the EDTA is tied up in the complex because Kf is so large. Wait, no, because the EDTA isn't in excess. Wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So that's the initial concentration. So the free EDTA is x, and the complex is 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Ah, but wait, if the solution only has the complex, then the total EDTA is 0.02 M. So when the complex dissociates, the free EDTA is x and the complex is 0.02 - x. But if Kf is so big, the x is negligible compared to 0.02. So [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02. [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

So the Kf expression becomes 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2). So x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → 4e-13 → x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

So yes, the concentration is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex at 25 °C, we use the stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

### Key Assumptions:
1. The concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]\) is approximately 0.02 M since the dissociation is minimal due to the large stability constant.
2. Let the concentration of free calcium ions be \( x \). Then, the concentration of free EDTA ions \([ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ]\) is also \( x \) because the dissociation is 1:1.

### Stability Constant Expression:
\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]}{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ]}
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x \cdot x}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

### Solving for \( x \):
\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Conclusion:
The concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
