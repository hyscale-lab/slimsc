Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's see what I remember about the radial velocity technique.

So, the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. When a planet orbits a star, the star moves a bit in the opposite direction, causing a shift in the wavelength of its light. The size of this shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, I think.

The question states that two stars have the same mass, and each has a planet with similar Neptune masses. Both are in circular orbits. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, the RV method's shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude K being proportional to ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star) ) times ( (1/(1 + M_p/M_star)) )^(1/3) ) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) ). But wait, since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, M_p is negligible compared to M_star, so maybe we can ignore M_p/M_star. So approximately K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star) ) * (P)^(-1/3).

Wait, no, actually, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (2π / P) ) ]^(1/ (1 + M_p/M_star) )) ) * sin i

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_p/M_star is negligible, so 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1. Also, sin i is approximately 1 because the orbits are likely edge-on (since they found the planets), so we can ignore that.

So simplifying, K ≈ ( ( G * M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ) ) Hmm, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, the exact formula for radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ ( (27 * pi * G) / (2 c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) ) ) ] * ( (1) / (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and 1 + M_p/M_star ≈1. So it simplifies to:

K ≈ ( ( (27 pi G )/(2 c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), but since the stars are the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, the M_p and M_star terms would be similar for both planets. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars have similar masses to the Sun. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2, and M_star1 = M_star2. Therefore, the ratio K1/K2 should be proportional to 1 / (P1/P2)^(1/3). Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K increases, P^(1/3) must decrease, meaning P is smaller.

Wait, looking at the question, Planet #1 has K1 = 5 miliangstrom, Planet #2 has K2=7 miliangstrom. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But how does K relate to the orbital period? Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → K1 = constant / P1^(1/3), K2= constant / P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me think again: K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star) ) * ( (2π / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another approach: The RV semi-amplitude is given by K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star) ) ) * (1/(P))^(1/3) )

But again, assuming M_p << M_star, sin i ≈1, then K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3) )

So, K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 sin i1 ) / (M_star1^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M_p2 sin i2 ) / (M_star2^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) ]

Since M_star1 = M_star2 and M_p1≈M_p2, and sin i is ≈1, this simplifies to K1/K2 = ( P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) ) )

Which can be written as (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2.

So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, wait, let's substitute.

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → so (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

So, the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Given that K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So (5/7)^3 = (approx 0.714)^3 → let's compute that.

0.7^3 = 0.343, 0.71^3 ≈ 0.357, 0.714^3 ≈ let's compute:

First, 7/5 = 1.4, so 5/7 ≈ 0.7142857.

0.7142857^3: let's compute:

0.7^3 = 0.343.

But 0.7142857 is (5/7). Let's compute (5/7)^3.

5^3 = 125, 7^3=343. So 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So (5/7)^3 ≈0.364.

So P2 = P1 * 0.364 → P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is planet #2's orbital period than planet #1. So P2 / P1 = 0.364, which is about 0.36 times.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the relationship.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so higher K means shorter period.

Because K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K2 is larger than K1, which implies that P2 is smaller than P1.

So planet #2 has a shorter orbital period. But the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1.

Wait no, wait: K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K increases, P decreases.

So since K2 > K1, P2 < P1. So P2 is shorter. Therefore, P2/P1 is less than 1. So the ratio is 0.36.

So the answer is option A, ~0.36.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude \( K \) of this shift is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \). This relationship arises because the star's velocity is related to the orbital motion, which depends on the period.

Given that the two stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the RV semi-amplitude \( K \) depends only on the orbital period \( P \). The ratio of the periods \( P_2/P_1 \) can be derived from the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \( K_1/K_2 \) as follows:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(0.714\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times longer than planet #1's.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~0.36**
