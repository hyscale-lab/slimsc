Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. There's a small spherical cavity inside it, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity has a radius r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity.

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P that's outside the conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Alright, so I need to find the magnitude of E at point P. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different formula.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it is zero. But when you put a charge inside the cavity, things happen. I think the charge induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, right! The cavity is inside the conductor. So when you place a charge +q inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral overall, so the outer surface must have a charge equal to +q, because the inner surface has -q. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

But wait, another thing: the conductor's outer surface charge would distribute itself spherically symmetrically if the setup is symmetrical. But in this case, the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. Oh, so the setup isn't symmetrical. Hmmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. How does the charge distribution on the conductor affect the field at P? Well, for a spherical conductor with no charge, the field outside is like a point charge at the center. But here, the conductor has a net charge, but wait noâ€”the conductor is uncharged. Wait, no: when the cavity has +q, the conductor's inner surface gets -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance. So the total charge on the conductor is zero, because (-q) + (+q) = 0. So the conductor remains uncharged.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The conductor is initially uncharged. When you place +q in the cavity, which is inside the conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q. Since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. So the outer surface has charge +q.

But wait, no. Wait, the conductor's total charge is zero because it was uncharged. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Therefore, the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, and that
