Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. Hmm. 

The problem states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, so like N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh yeah, because parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance, or distance = 1/plx. 

So, if I want to express the number of stars N in terms of distance r, I can substitute plx with 1/r. Let me write that down. N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which would be 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that. 

Wait, (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. So 1 divided by that is r^5. Oh, because 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. 

Wait a minute, but does that make sense? Let me think about it again. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so as distance increases, parallax decreases. So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx decreases with distance, then N should increase. Because 1/(small number)^5 is a big number. 

So if distance increases, N increases as r^5. So when you look at a larger volume of space (as r increases), you're seeing more stars, and the number goes up with r^5. 

Now looking at the options, option B is ~ r^5, which matches what I found. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. 

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the substitution. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 = (1/plx)^-5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting gives (r)^-5? No, wait, 1/(plx) is r. So 1/(plx^5) is (1/plx)^5, which is r^5. Oh right, that's correct. So N is proportional to r^5. 

So the answer should be B, which is r^5.


The question involves determining how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5
\]

This shows that the number of stars is proportional to \( r^5 \). As distance increases, the number of stars increases rapidly with the fifth power of distance. Among the options provided, the correct choice is \( \sim r^5 \), which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
