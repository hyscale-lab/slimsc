Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The setup is that there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The question gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, and I need to find out which one is correct.

Wait, what do I remember about EDTA and complex ions? I think EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is one of those complexes. The formation constant, K, tells me about the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. When EDTA is present, it binds to the Ca²+ ions, so the concentration of free Ca²+ should be pretty low. Because the K is so large, the complex is very stable, so most of the Ca is tied up in the complex.

The formula for the formation constant, I think, is K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, Y is the EDTA^4- right? So the complex is CaY²-.

But wait, in solution, the EDTA might be in different protonated forms depending on the pH. Oh, the question says the pH is ideal, so maybe the assumption is that EDTA is in its Y^4- form. That would make the calculation easier.

So the solution is 0.02 M CaY²-. Let's call that concentration C. So C = 0.02 M. The total concentration of EDTA would be equal to the concentration of the complex because each complex has one EDTA^4- and one Ca²+. So [CaY²-] = 0.02 M.

Wait, but the complex is the only source of EDTA and calcium. So [CaY²-] = 0.02 M.

Now, the formation constant equation is K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, according to the problem, the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, before any dissociation, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial assumption is that all the EDTA and Ca are in the complex. But in reality, some will dissociate.

So, let me set up the variables. Let me let x be the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Then, the concentration of free EDTA^4- would be [EDTA^4-] = x as well because each dissociation releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So when it dissociates, each mole of complex produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So, if the concentration of free Ca²+ is x, then the concentration of free EDTA^4- is also x, assuming that the dissociation is x from the complex.

So, substituting into the formation constant equation, K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, the concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is (0.02 - x). But wait, wait, if x is the amount dissociated, then the complex concentration is (0.02 - x). But for weak dissociation, x might be very small compared to 0.02. Let's think about that.

Given that K is 5e10, which is a huge number, so the complex is very stable. So the dissociation will be minimal. So x will be much smaller than 0.02. Therefore, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, K = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So, solving for x:

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Then taking the square root: sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 6.5 is halfway between 6 and 7, so 2e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7? Because 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 1e-7, so 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 4e-13 → square root is 2e-6.5.

Wait, but 10^-6.5 is the same as 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) → 1e-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-7.

So 2e-6.5 is 6.324e-7.

So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the answer.

Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. We assumed that the complex dissociates slightly, and because K is so large, the dissociation is minimal, so the complex concentration remains approximately 0.02 M. Then we set up the equation and solved for x, which is the [Ca²+]. The calculation led us to about 6.3e-7, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant equation:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, the total concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant is given as \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). Assuming the pH is ideal and the dissociation of the complex is minimal, the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) and free EDTA (\(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\)) will be equal due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the complex. Let this common concentration be \( x \).

The concentration of the complex \([\text{CaY}^{2-}]\) can be approximated as 0.02 M because the dissociation is very small (due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \)).

Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} \implies 5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
