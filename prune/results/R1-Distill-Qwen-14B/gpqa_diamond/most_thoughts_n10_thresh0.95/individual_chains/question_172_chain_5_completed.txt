Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Let me try to unpack what's going on here. Hmm. So, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Both stars are in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies.

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor. So the population ratio between two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation.

The formula is something like N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower) / (k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but wait, the ratio is given for star_1 and star_2. So for star_1, the population is twice that of star_2. But wait, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I think that means N1/N2 = 2, where N1 is the number in the excited state for star_1, and N2 for star_2.

Wait wait, no, maybe. Let me think again. The question states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So for a specific energy level, say level E_upper, the population in star_1 is twice that of star_2. But the question is about the ratio of the populations in the same level between the two stars.

Wait, no. Maybe it's the ratio of the populations in the same level but between the two stars. So for example, N1 (star_1's level) is twice N2 (star_2's level) in the same energy level. Hmm, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the energy levels are the same for each star. Oh wait, no, the same energy levels exist for each star. So the ratio would be N1/N2 = 2, where N1 is the number in level E in star_1, N2 in star_2.

But wait, the Boltzmann factor depends on temperature. So perhaps the ratio between the two stars is given by N1/N2 = [ (g1/g2) * exp(−ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp(−ΔE/(k T2)) ) ]? Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, for each star, the ratio of populations in two energy levels (say, E_upper and E_lower) is given by N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) exp(−ΔE/(k T)). So for star_1, N1_upper/N1_lower = (g1/g2) exp(−ΔE/(k T1)), and star_2, N2_upper/N2_lower = (g1/g2) exp(−ΔE/(k T2)).

But the question is about the ratio of N1_upper to N2_upper. Wait, no, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps, for the same energy level E_upper, N1_upper is twice N2_upper. But then, that would involve the same energy level, so the ratio (N1_upper)/(N2_upper) = 2.

But wait, then what about the Boltzmann factor? Each star's N_upper depends on their own temperature.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

Let me denote the two energy levels as E1 and E2, with E1 > E2, so the difference is ΔE = E1 - E2 = 1.38e-23 J.

In each star, the ratio of populations is N_upper/N_lower = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But the problem says that in star_1, the excited level (assuming E_upper is the excited state) is twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, not sure. Let's read the question again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

So for a specific energy level (say, E_upper), the number of atoms in that level in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So N1_upper / N2_upper = 2.

But in each star, the ratio N_upper/N_lower depends on temperature and the energy difference.

So for star_1, N1_upper/N1_lower = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, N2_upper/N2_lower = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But we're interested in N1_upper / N2_upper = 2.

Wait, but where do these N_lower come into play?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the same energy level between the two stars. So, N1_upper / N2_upper = 2.

But how do we relate this ratio to the temperatures of the stars?

Wait, in LTE, each star has its own temperature. So for star_1, the population in E_upper is (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) times the population in E_lower. Similarly for star_2.

But I think we can model this as:

N1_upper / N1_lower = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

N2_upper / N2_lower = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ?

Wait, maybe I got the g factors wrong. Let me think: the statistical weights are g_upper and g_lower. So the ratio is (g_upper/g_lower) exp(−ΔE/(k T)).

But assuming that the lower level has g_lower and the upper g_upper. So for star_1:

N1_upper = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(−ΔE/(k T1)) * N1_lower

Similarly for star_2:

N2_upper = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(−ΔE/(k T2)) * N2_lower

But we're given that N1_upper is twice N2_upper: N1_upper = 2 * N2_upper

But how do we relate N1_lower and N2_lower? Hmm. Maybe I'm making this too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the ratio N1_upper/N2_upper.

But since each star is in its own LTE, their N_upper depends on their own temperature.

Wait, think about the ratio of the populations in the same level between the two stars.

So,

N1_upper = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(−ΔE/(k T1)) * N1_lower

Similarly,

N2_upper = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(−ΔE/(k T2)) * N2_lower

But we don't know N1_lower and N2_lower, but perhaps the ratio of N1_upper and N2_upper can be expressed in terms of their respective temperatures.

Wait, but for each star, the ratio of N_upper to N_lower is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, in star_1, N1_upper/N1_lower = (g1/g2) exp(−ΔE/(k T1)), and similarly for star_2.

But without knowing the ratio of N1_lower to N2_lower, perhaps it's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio N1_upper / N2_upper is equal to [ (N1_upper/N1_lower) / (N2_upper/N2_lower) ) ] * (N1_lower / N2_lower )

Hmm, but that introduces another term (N1_lower/N2_lower) which complicates things. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps we can consider the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors. Let me see.

We have N1_upper / N2_upper = 2.

But N1_upper = (g_upper/g_lower) exp(−ΔE/(k T1)) * N1_lower

N2_upper = (g_upper/g_lower) exp(−ΔE/(k T2)) * N2_lower

So,

(N1_upper) / (N2_upper) = [ (g/g') exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) * N1_lower ] / [ (g/g') exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) * N2_lower ]

Wait, no, that's not right because g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars. So they cancel out.

So,

(N1_upper)/(N2_upper) = [ exp(−ΔE/(k T1)) * N1_lower ] / [ exp(−ΔE/(k T2)) * N2_lower ]

Which is the same as exp( (ΔE/(k T2)) − (ΔE/(k T1)) ) * (N1_lower / N2_lower)

Hmm, but without knowing the ratio of N1_lower and N2_lower, this seems tricky.

Wait, maybe we can assume that the lower level's population is the same ratio between the two stars as the upper level. Or perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio N1_upper/N2_upper is given as 2, and we can express the ratio in terms of T1 and T2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio N1_upper / N2_upper equals the ratio of the respective Boltzmann factors, but scaled by some other terms.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ratio of the excitation in the same level. So the question says that for the same energy level, star_1 has twice the excitation (population) as star_2.

So, N1 = 2 N2, where N1 and N2 are the populations in the same energy level for stars 1 and 2 respectively.

But how does that happen? Since both stars are in LTE, each star's population in that level depends on their own temperature.

Wait, perhaps the population in the energy level is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. For each star, the number of atoms in a particular energy level is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

So, N_i = C exp(−E_i/(k T)), where C is a normalization constant (or perhaps includes the statistical weights).

Wait, but each energy level has a certain statistical weight (g), so the population in level E is N = (g) * exp(−E/(k T)).

But wait, no. The exact formula is N_i = (g_i) * exp(−E_i/(k T)) / Q, where Q is the partition function. But for the ratio between two stars, perhaps Q can be considered as a constant for each star, but when taking the ratio, it's about the same level.

Wait, perhaps I can model the ratio N1/N2 for the same energy level as:

N1 = (g) * exp(−E/(k T1)) / Q1

N2 = (g) * exp(−E/(k T2)) / Q2

So N1/N2 = [ exp(−E/(k T1)) / Q1 ] / [ exp(−E/(k T2)) / Q2 ]

= [ exp( E/(k T2) - E/(k T1) ) ] * (Q2 / Q1 )

But without knowing Q1 and Q2, maybe this is not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that the partition functions are the same for both stars, which might not be a valid assumption, but perhaps it's made for simplification.

If Q1 = Q2 = Q, then N1/N2 = exp( E/(k T2) - E/(k T1) )

But then, since N1 is twice N2:

2 = exp( E/(k T2) - E/(k T1) )

Take natural log on both sides:

ln(2) = [ E/(k) ] ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Rearranging:

ln(2) = [ E/(k) ] ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) )

Hmm, wait. So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So,

ln(2) = (E/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, but we have E = 1.38e-23 J. What's k, Boltzmann's constant? It's 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's the same as E.

Wait, E = k * something? Wait, in the problem, E is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So E = k * 1 K.

Wait, so E = k * (ΔE in terms of temperature). Let me compute E/k: E/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me rearrange this equation.

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

ln(2) * T1 T2 = T1 - T2

Hmm, but looking at the options, which one matches this rearrangement.

Let me look at the options again.

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which matches exactly what I have.

Wait yes, because from the equation I derived, ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) which is option D.

So the correct equation would be option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population ratio of particles in different energy levels under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann factor is given by:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(N_{\text{upper}}\) and \(N_{\text{lower}}\) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \(g_{\text{upper}}\) and \(g_{\text{lower}}\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the population of iron atoms in the upper energy level of star_1 is twice that of star_2. This gives the ratio:

\[
\frac{N_{1,\text{upper}}}{N_{2,\text{upper}}} = 2.
\]

For each star, the population ratio between the upper and lower levels is:

\[
\frac{N_{1,\text{upper}}}{N_{1,\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{N_{2,\text{upper}}}{N_{2,\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio of these two expressions:

\[
\frac{\frac{N_{1,\text{upper}}}{N_{1,\text{lower}}}}{\frac{N_{2,\text{upper}}}{N_{2,\text{lower}}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Using the given ratio \(\frac{N_{1,\text{upper}}}{N_{2,\text{upper}}} = 2\), we substitute:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Substituting \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches **Option D**:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
