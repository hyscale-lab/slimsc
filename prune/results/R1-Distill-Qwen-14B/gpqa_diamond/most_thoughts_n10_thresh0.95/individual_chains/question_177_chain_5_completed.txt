Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. We're supposed to find the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

So, I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh wait, right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, how do I find the temperatures of these stars? The peak wavelength at which a black body emits is given by Wien's law, which is λ_max ≈ (hc)/(5kT), or more commonly written as λ_max = (b) / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (about 2.898×10^-3 m·K).

The question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So λ_max for both stars is the same. So from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max = b / T, so if λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 must equal T2.

Wait, but wait a second. The radial velocities are given. Oh, right, the Doppler effect might affect the observed wavelength. So the star's emission is shifted due to their motion towards or away from us. So the observed wavelength (λ_observed) is different from the rest wavelength (λ_rest) because of their velocities.

So, for each star, the observed wavelength λ is λ_rest multiplied by (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, the radial velocity for Star_1 is zero, so its observed wavelength is the same as the rest wavelength. For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. So, the observed λ for Star_2 is λ2_observed = λ2_rest * (1 + 700e3 / c), where c is the speed of light.

But the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, λ_observed for Star_1 is λ1_rest, and for Star_2 it's λ2_observed. But these two are same.

So, λ1_rest = λ2_observed.

But λ2_observed is λ2_rest multiplied by (1 + v_r2 / c). Wait, but v is the radial velocity of Star_2. Let me think about the sign. If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshift). So, if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then λ2_observed is λ2_rest * (1 + 700e3/c). Wait, but wait, the formula for Doppler shift when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive when moving away.

So, let me get this right. If a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So, Star_2's observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength. Star_1's observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength because v_r1 is zero.

But the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So λ1_rest = λ2_observed.

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c).

Hmm. But from Wien's law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T, so if λ1_rest = λ2_observed, then λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c).

But wait, λ1_rest is the rest wavelength of Star_1, which is based on its temperature, and λ2_rest is the rest wavelength of Star_2, which is based on its temperature. But earlier, I thought both T1 and T2 are the same because their observed λ_max are same, but now I'm getting that maybe that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me re-examine this.

In the problem statement, it says the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest were the same. That means the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ1_obs_max = λ2_obs_max.

But for each star, λ_obs_max is equal to their own λ_rest_max multiplied by the Doppler factor.

So, for Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_rest * (1 + v_r1/c) → v_r1 is zero, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c) → v_r2 is 700 km/s, so λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + 700e3/c).

And since λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c).

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T.

So, for Star 1: λ1_rest = b / T1.

For Star 2: λ2_rest = b / T2.

Substituting into the previous equation:

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c).

We can cancel out b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c).

Rearranging:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c).

Wait, but wait, I think I must have miscalculated. Let's see:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c).

Substituting λ1_rest = b/T1 and λ2_rest = b/T2:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c).

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c).

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c).

Wait, that would mean T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c). But 1 + v/c is greater than 1, so T2 would be higher than T1. But wait, that can't be right because the observed λ_max is same. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction. Because when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the observed λ_max is longer. So, if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its observed λ_max is longer than its rest λ_max.

But Star_1's observed λ_max is the same as its rest λ_max. So, if the observed λ_max for both are same, that would require that Star_2's rest λ_max is shorter than Star_1's rest λ_max by a factor of (1 + v/c). Because λ_obs for Star_2 is longer than its rest, but it's equal to Star_1's rest.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach it with numbers.

Let me define:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest × (1 + v1/c).

λ2_obs = λ2_rest × (1 + v2/c).

Given that v1 is 0, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

v2 is +700 km/s (assuming away from us), so λ2_obs = λ2_rest × (1 + 700e3/c).

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest × (1 + 700e3/c).

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T.

So,

λ1_rest = b / T1,

λ2_rest = b / T2.

Substituting into the equation:

(b / T1) = (b / T2) × (1 + v/c).

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) × (1 + v/c).

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

But wait, (1 + v/c) is (1 + 700e3 / (3e5e3)) ) because c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

Wait, 700 km/s is 700e3 m/s, but c is about 3e5 km/s → 3e8 m/s. Hmm, better to compute the ratio correctly.

Let me compute v/c where v is 700 km/s.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 7/(3e3) ≈ 0.0023333.

So (1 + v/c) ≈ 1.0023333.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.0023333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.0023333) approximately, using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1-x for small x.

But for exactness, perhaps I should just keep it as 1/(1 + 0.0023333) = 1/(1.0023333).

So, T1 ≈ T2 * 0.9977 (approx).

But wait, that's a small difference. Maybe it's negligible, but perhaps not. Let's proceed.

Now, the luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So, the ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2,

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 ) )

= ( (2.25 R2^2) * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4.

But from earlier, T1 = T2 / (1+ v/c) → T1 = T2 * (1/(1.0023333)).

So,

T1/T2 = 1/1.0023333 ≈ 0.9977.

So,

( T1/T2 )^4 ≈ (0.9977)^4.

Let me compute that. 0.9977^2 is approximately 0.9954 (since (1 - 0.0023)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0023 = 0.9954).

Then, 0.9954^2 is about 0.9908. So, (0.9977)^4 ≈ 0.9908.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.2278.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I account for all the factors correctly? Let me double-check.

Wait, the Doppler effect affects the observed wavelength, but when considering T, the rest temperature, that's correct.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the Doppler shift. The formula for the observed wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive if moving away. So, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer than its rest. But Star_1's observed λ is same as rest.

The problem says that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So, λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

Which leads to λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

So, substituting λ_rest = b / T,

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * (1 + v2/c).

So, 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Thus, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

So, T1 is less than T2 because denominator is a little more than 1.

But wait, when the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, which implies that the star's rest wavelength is shorter. So, higher temperature. Because λ is inversely proportional to T. So, if Star_2's observed λ is same as Star_1's rest λ, which is based on T1, then Star_2's rest λ is shorter, implying higher T2 than T1.

Wait, but according to the equation, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c). So, T1 is less than T2 when v is positive. So, T2 is higher than T1.

So, their temperatures are different.

Then, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 )/( R2^2 T2^4 ).

R1 = 1.5 R2.

So, R1^2/R2^2 = 2.25.

T1^4 / T2^4 = (T1/T2)^4 = ( (T2/(1 + v/c)) / T2 )^4 = (1/(1 + v/c))^4.

Which is (1/(1.0023333))^4 ≈ (0.9977)^4 ≈ 0.9908.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.2278.

Which is approximately 2.23, so option D.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute 1/(1.0023333) exactly.

Let me compute 1/(1.0023333):

1.0023333 is approximately 1 + 700e3/(3e5e3) → 700/(3e5) = 0.0023333.

So, 1/(1+x) where x=0.0023333.

The exact value can be found using a calculator, but perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator isn't feasible, but let me think.

1/(1.0023333) ≈ 1 - 0.0023333 + (0.0023333)^2 - ... (using the Taylor series 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +... for small x).

But x is 0.0023333, x squared is about 5.44e-6, so:

1/(1.0023333) ≈ 0.99766667 + (0.0023333)^2 ≈ 0.99766667 + 0.00000544 ≈ 0.99767211.

So, about 0.99767.

So (0.99767)^4.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.99767^2 = (0.99767)*(0.99767).

Let me compute:

(1 - 0.00233)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 0.995449 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.995454.

Wait, but that's using the approximation. Alternatively, perhaps a more accurate way is better.

Alternatively, 0.99767 * 0.99767:

= (1 - 0.00233) * (1 - 0.00233)
= 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2
= 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054
= 0.9953454.

Then, squaring that gives (0.9953454)^2.

Again, (1 - 0.0046546)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0046546 + (0.0046546)^2.

Which is approximately 1 - 0.0093092 + 0.00002166 → 0.99069246.

So, (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.990692.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990692 ≈ 2.2275.

Which is approximately 2.23, so option D.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So, 2.2275 rounds to approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, another thing to consider: the Doppler shift formula. I might have used the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: The Doppler shift formula for wavelength can be written as:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, no, that's for relativistic speeds. Wait, no, the relativistic Doppler shift is more complicated, but for non-relativistic speeds (v << c), the approximation λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) holds.

But in this problem, v is 700 km/s, which is about 0.23% of c, so the approximation should be fine.

Wait, but let me think about another approach: perhaps I should compute the ratio of the luminosities without making any approximations, to see if it's more precise.

Let me compute (1/(1.0023333))^4 exactly.

1.0023333 is 700/3e5, which is 7/(3000) → exactly, 7/(3000) = 0.0023333333.

So,

1.0023333333 = 1 + 7/(3000) = 1 + 0.0023333333.

So, 1/(1.0023333333) = (3000)/(3000 + 7) = 3000/3007.

So, 3000 / 3007 ≈ 0.9976666667.

So, (3000/3007)^4.

Calculating 3000/3007:

= approximately 0.9976666667.

So, 0.9976666667^4.

Let me compute 0.9976666667^2:

= (0.9976666667)^2.

= (1 - 0.0023333333)^2.

= 1 - 2*0.0023333333 + (0.0023333333)^2.

= 1 - 0.0046666666 + 0.0000054444.

= 0.9953387778.

Now, (0.9953387778)^2.

= (1 - 0.0046612222)^2.

= 1 - 2*0.0046612222 + (0.0046612222)^2.

= 1 - 0.0093224444 + 0.00002174.

= 0.9906982956.

So, (3000/3007)^4 ≈ 0.990698.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990698 ≈ 2.2275.

So, approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but the options are in ~2.23, which is option D.

So the answer should be D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \implies \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
\]

### Step 1: Relating Temperatures Using Wien's Law
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, meaning their observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are equal. Using Wien's law, the rest wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}.
\]

For Star_1, since its radial velocity is zero, its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength:  
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}.
\]

For Star_2, its observed wavelength is redshifted due to its radial velocity (\(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right).
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we equate:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right).
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}\), we get:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right).
\]

Canceling \(b\) and rearranging:

\[
T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the Doppler Factor
The speed of light \(c \approx 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), so:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333.
\]

Thus:

\[
1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \approx 1.002333.
\]

Substituting into the temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.997667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the Luminosity Ratio
The radii of the stars are given as \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4.
\]

Substituting \(R_1 / R_2 = 1.5\) and \((T_1 / T_2)^4 = (0.997667)^4\):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.997667)^4.
\]

First, calculate \((1.5)^2\):

\[
(1.5)^2 = 2.25.
\]

Next, calculate \((0.997667)^4\). Using approximations:

\[
(0.997667)^2 \approx 0.995339, \quad (0.995339)^2 \approx 0.9907.
\]

Thus:

\[
(0.997667)^4 \approx 0.9907.
\]

Finally, combine the results:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.2275.
\]

### Step 4: Selecting the Closest Option
The calculated ratio \(\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.2275\) is closest to option **D) ~2.23**.

**Answer: D**
