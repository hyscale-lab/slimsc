Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. So, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should form acetate ions and water. 

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. I need to find the concentration after dilution. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that. 0.05 * 20 = 1 mmol. Divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. At 25% titration, what's the pH? And at equivalence point.

First, let's find the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid initially: M * V = 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react 1:1 with acetic acid. So moles of NaOH required are 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but the question says 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. 

At 25% titration, the solution is a buffer because some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions. Let me think about the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. 

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is 0.001. When we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. 

So, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025. 

Now, the total volume of the solution is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³, which is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). 

So the concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). The pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) which is around 4.74 (since 1.85e-5 is about 1.8e-5; pKa is about 4.74). 

So pH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me calculate that ratio. 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.74 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26. Hmm, that matches one of the options. 

Wait, but wait—did I get the ratio right? Oh yeah, because [A^-] is 0.00025 and [HA] is 0.00075, which is 1:3 ratio. So the log(1/3) is -0.477, so yeah, pH is 4.74 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26.

Now, at equivalence point. All the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution. 

The moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) at equivalence are 0.001 moles. The total volume is 40 cm³ (original) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. 

To find pH, we can calculate [OH^-]. Since Kb is small, we can assume x is small. Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02. 

x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 ≈ 1.081e-11. So x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5. 

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH = 14 -4.98 ≈ 9.02. Wait, that's not matching any of the options. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, another approach: since the solution is of a weak base, the pH can be found using the formula for weak base hydrolysis. The concentration is 0.02 M.

The formula for [OH^-] is sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So [OH^-] =1.04e-5, pOH = log(1.04e-5) is around 4.98. So pH =14 -4.98= ~9.02.

But looking at the options, the equivalence points are 8.52, 6.73, 7.00, 6.92. None are around 9. So maybe I did a mistake. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the volume. Let me double-check the equivalence point.

Initial volume is 40 cm³. Added 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 50 cm³. Moles of acetate is 0.001. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) *1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression instead of approximation. Let's see. Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10. So
