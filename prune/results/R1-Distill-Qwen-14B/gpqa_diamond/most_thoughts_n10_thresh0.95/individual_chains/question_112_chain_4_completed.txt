Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question involves an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 when i != j and 0 otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, alright, let's break this down. First, I should probably normalize the state |alpha> because it's only given as proportional, not necessarily normalized. Then I need to figure out what the operator looks like and find its eigenstates because the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator.

Wait, but isn't the operator given in matrix form? So maybe I can express it and find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let me think. The operator A has elements Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because up and down are the only states here), the matrix would look like:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Right? Because for i=1, j=2 and i=2, j=1, the elements are ħ/2. The diagonal elements are 0 since i=j in those cases.

So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. I remember that such matrices are proportional to the Pauli matrices, specifically to the sigma_x matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (ħ/2) * sigma_x.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the eigenvalues of A should be ± ħ/2, but wait, let me confirm. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ± ħ/2. So the operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

But wait, the question is about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Because the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in the state |alpha>.

So first, I need to find the normalized state |alpha>. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me compute its normalization factor.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the inner product is (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i).

Let me compute each term:

(1 - i)(1 + i) = (1)^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1)= 2.

(2 + i)(2 - i) = (2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1)=5.

So the total inner product is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. The eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of sigma_x. I remember that |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, is that correct? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The eigenstates for sigma_x can be found by solving the equations (sigma_x)|+x> = |+x> and (sigma_x)|-x> = -| -x >.

Alternatively, I can recall that the eigenstates are |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2) when the basis is |0> and |1>, but in this case, our basis is |up> and |down>, which are the same as |0> and |1> for the Pauli matrices. So yes, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but I should double-check. For sigma_x, the eigenvectors are (1,1) and (1,-1), normalized. So |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Correct.

So I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. Let me define:

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>

I can express |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting, |alpha> = c1 [ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ) ] + c2 [ (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Grouping terms:

= [ (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But from earlier, we have |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So, equating coefficients:

( c1 + c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
( c1 - c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these two equations:

Equation 1: (c1 + c2) = (1+i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
Equation 2: (c1 - c2) = (2 - i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The right-hand side is (1+i)/sqrt(7), because |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ ... ].

Wait, no, let me re-express. The coefficient for |up> is (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7).

Similarly, the coefficient for |down> is (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So, I can write:

(c1 + c2) = (1+i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
(c1 - c2) = (2 -i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)

Let me compute those right-hand sides. Let's compute sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) as 1/sqrt(3.5), but that's not so helpful. Alternatively, I can factor it as sqrt(2/7).

But perhaps it's easier to solve for c1 and c2 by adding and subtracting the two equations.

Adding the two equations:

2 c1 = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Simplify numerator: 1+i +2 -i = 3.

So 2c1 = 3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → c1 = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = 3/(2 sqrt(7/2)) ) Hmm, perhaps better to write in terms of fractions.

Wait, sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is sqrt(2/7). So 3 * sqrt(2/7) / 2.

Wait, let me compute it as fractions:

sqrt(2/7) = sqrt(14)/7? Because sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)/7 = sqrt(14)/7. Oh, right, because sqrt(a)/sqrt(b) = sqrt(a/b) or sqrt(ab)/b.

So sqrt(2/7) = sqrt(14)/7. So 3 * sqrt(14) / (2*7) ) → 3 sqrt(14) / 14.

Wait, wait:

Wait, let me recompute:

c1 = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/ (2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait no, adding the two equations:

Equation 1: c1 + c2 = (1+i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Equation 2: c1 - c2 = (2 -i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Add them:

2 c1 = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ 2 c1 = [3] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ c1 = (3) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2 c2 = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ 2 c2 = (1 +i -2 +i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ 2 c2 = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ c2 = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Hmm, okay. So now c1 and c2 are known. But wait, perhaps it's easier to find the coefficients directly by expressing in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the inner product of |alpha> with each of the eigenstates of A.

Because the probability of measuring a particular eigenstate is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |alpha> and that eigenstate.

Wait, yeah, that's another approach. Let me think.

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, so the probability of measuring +ħ/2 is |< +x | alpha > |², and similarly for |-x>.

Let me compute < +x | alpha >.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | alpha > + < down | alpha > ]

Wait, but |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ]

So < up | alpha > is (1+i)/sqrt(7)
< down | alpha > is (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1/(sqrt(2)sqrt(7))) [ (1 + i + 2 - i ) ]

Simplify numerator: 1+2 =3; i -i =0 → 3

So this becomes 3/( sqrt(2) sqrt(7) ) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

So the probability is |< +x | alpha > |² = (3)^2 / (14) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the terms again.

Wait, (1+i) + (2−i) = 1+i +2 -i = 3.

So < +x | alpha > = (3) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

So the absolute square is (3)^2 / (14) )= 9/14 = 0.642857...

Which is approximately 0.64. Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 as the first probability.

Now, the other eigenstate is |-x>, so let me compute < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2)

So < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | alpha > - < down | alpha > ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) )

= [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / ( sqrt(2) sqrt(7) )

Simplify numerator: 1+i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So < -x | alpha > = (-1 + 2i) / ( sqrt(2) sqrt(7) )

The absolute value squared is [ (-1 + 2i) * (-1 -2i) ] / (2 *7 )

Compute numerator: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5/(14) → approximately 0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 is 0.642857, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357. Hmm, the options have 0.64 and 0.36 as option A. So that matches the first parts.

Wait, but another option, option D, has 0.61 and 0.29. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute the inner product again for < -x | alpha >.

Wait, < -x | alpha > = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2)

Which is ( (1 -2) + (i + i) ) / sqrt(14 )

So numerator is (-1 + 2i). So the inner product is (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

The absolute value squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 → (1 +4)/14=5/14 ≈0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571. So the first part of the question, the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.64) and 5/14 (≈0.36).

So looking at the options, option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36. So that would match the first part.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The average value is < alpha | A | alpha >.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Since A is a Hermitian operator, the average can be computed via the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. The probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for + and - respectively.

So the average would be (9/14)( ħ/2 ) + (5/14)( - ħ/2 )

= [ (9 -5) /14 ] * ħ/2

= (4/14) * ħ/2

= (2/7) * ħ/2

= (2 * ħ) / (14 * 2) )? Wait, no, wait.

Wait: 4/14 is 2/7. So (2/7) * (ħ/2) ) = (2 ħ) / (14) ) → ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A's average is ħ/7. So the first part is 0.64, 0.36, and average ħ/7. So that's option A.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the average. Alternatively, I could compute <alpha| A |alpha> directly.

Alternatively, since A is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2, perhaps it's easier to compute <A> = (ħ/2)( <sigma_x> )

The expectation value of sigma_x is <alpha | sigma_x | alpha >.

So I need to compute <alpha | sigma_x | alpha >. Let's compute this.

sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So sigma_x |alpha> would be a state where the components are swapped. Let me compute it.

Wait, |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So sigma_x |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ]

Then, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is (1/7) [ (1 -i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2 -i) ) ]

Wait, let's compute this:

(1 - i)(1 + i) = (1)^2 - (i)^2 = 1 +1=2.

(2 +i)(2 -i)=4 +1=5.

Wait, but wait, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is:

= (1/7) [ (1 -i) (1+i) + (2+i)(2 -i) ]

Which is (2 +5)/7 =7/7=1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because sigma_x can have eigenvalues ±1, and the expectation value can't be more than 1.

Wait, Wait, no, wait. Because |alpha> is expressed in the up and down basis, and sigma_x swaps up and down.

But let me compute this correctly. Let me write |alpha> as a column vector.

|alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T.

So sigma_x applied to |alpha> is:

sigma_x |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (2 -i), (1 +i) ]^T.

Then, the inner product <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is (1/7) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i)
= 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i *2 + i^2
= 2 -i - 2i -1
= (2-1) + (-3i)
= 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i)
= 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i^2
= 2 +2i +i -1
= (2-1) +3i → 1 +3i.

Wait, but wait, wait. When I take the inner product, it's the conjugate of the first component times the second component.

Wait no, wait. Let me correct this.

Wait, the inner product is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 - i) (2 -i) + (2 +i) (1 +i) ] all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7), so overall 1/7 times the sum.

Wait, let me compute each term correctly.

First term: (1 -i) (2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 → (2-1)=1 → 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i) (1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
= 2 +2i +i +i^2 → 2+3i -1 → (2-1)+3i → 1 +3i.

Adding the two terms: (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So the inner product is (1/7)*2 → 2/7.

Wait, so <sigma_x> is 2/7.

Then, <A> = (ħ/2) * <sigma_x> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Which matches what I computed earlier. So the average value is ħ/7.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 (9/14) and 0.36 (5/14), and the average is ħ/7. So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by computing the inner product \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle \), which gives a total of 7. Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

Next, we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the overlap \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \) and \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \). Substituting \( |\alpha\rangle \) into these overlaps:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle + \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right],
\]
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle - \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right].
\]

Using \( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \), we compute:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right] = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these overlaps:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64,
\]
\[
P(-x) = \left| \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the expectation value \( \langle A \rangle \) is proportional to \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \). Using \( |\alpha\rangle \), we compute:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Combining the results, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches the data in **Option A**.

Answer: A
