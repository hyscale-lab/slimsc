Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states for an electron. I remember that the spin operators in the z-basis are diagonal matrices with eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

The first part of the problem is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where the elements A_ij are ħ/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Hmm, wait, that sounds a bit confusing. Let me parse that again. So, the matrix A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 when i ≠ j, and 0 when i = j. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would look like:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, because if i is not equal to j, A_ij is ħ/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are 0, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are ħ/2. So yes, that's correct.

The second part is to find the average value of that operator.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question says that the operator has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Oh, wait, but that's not a diagonal matrix. So this operator, let's call it O, is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So O is a spin operator, perhaps in the x-direction? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the spin operator in x is (ħ/2) σ_x, which would be [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. So maybe O is the spin-x operator?

Wait, actually, the spin operator in the x-direction for an electron is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So O would be the spin-x operator. So the eigenstates of O would be the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, which are the states |+x> and |-x>, the spin eigenstates along x.

So the first part is to find the probabilities that the electron is in each of these eigenstates when measured along the x-direction. The second part is the expectation value of O.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not getting confused. The way the problem is phrased, the operator A is given by those matrix elements, which I think is the spin-x operator. So the eigenvalues of A (O) would be ± ħ/2, and the eigenstates would be |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of σ_x, the Pauli X matrix.

So the state |alpha> is given in the z-basis. So to find the probability of measuring +ħ/2 or -ħ/2 for O, I need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of O. Alternatively, since the eigenstates of O are the x-basis states, I can expand |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, and the coefficients will give the square roots of the probabilities.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the expectation value and the probabilities by using the matrix elements.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the probabilities by finding the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate of O.

First, let's write down |alpha> normalized, because the problem says it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I need to find the normalization factor.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me compute the norm squared of this state. The norm squared is (1+i)^*(1+i) + (2 -i)^*(2 -i) + cross terms. Wait, no, the norm is inner product of the state with itself. So |a|^2 + |b|^2 if the state is a|up> + b|down>.

So |1+i|^2 is (1^2 +1^2) = 2. And |2 -i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1 =5. So the total norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Now, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of O. Since O is the spin-x operator, whose eigenstates are |+x> and |-x> and they have the form:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, let me double-check that. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you apply it to |+x>, it gives |+x> multiplied by 1, and similarly for |-x>.

So, to find the expansion of |alpha> in the x-basis, I can write |alpha> as c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

So I'll compute c_+ = < +x | alpha > and c_- = < -x | alpha >.

Let me compute c_+:

c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) |alpha> * normalization factor.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it step by step.

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

The inner product < +x | alpha > is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So this becomes (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ]

But since <up|up> =1, <up|down>=0, <down|up>=0, <down|down>=1.

So this simplifies to (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) *1 + (2 -i)*1 ]

Which is (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ) ]

Adding the terms: (1+2) + (i -i) = 3 +0i. So 3.

So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute c_- = < -x | alpha >.

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ]

So again:

(1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Which simplifies to (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i)(1) + (2 - i)(-1) ]

Wait, let me do this step by step. The terms are:

(1+i) * 1 (from <up|up>)

- (1+i) *0 (from <up|down>)

+ (2 -i) *0 (from <down|up>)

- (2 -i) *1 (from <down|down>)

So it's (1+i) - (2 -i).

Adding these: (1 + i) -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i) = -1 + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Compute |c_-|^2: [ (-1 +2i) / sqrt(14) ] [ (-1 -2i)/sqrt(14) ) ] = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14≈0.357143.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which would round to about 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which would be about 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36 as probabilities. The average value is given as ħ/7. Hmm. Let me check the average value.

The average value is <O> = <alpha| O |alpha>.

Alternatively, since O is the spin-x operator, and in the x-basis, its diagonal elements are ± ħ/2. So the average value would be |c_+|^2*(ħ/2) + |c_-|^2*(-ħ/2) )?

Wait, no, because <O> = sum (probability_i * eigenvalue_i). Since |+x> has eigenvalue +ħ/2 and |-x> has eigenvalue -ħ/2.

So <O> = (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) ) = [ (9/14 -5/14 ) * ħ/2 ]

Which is (4/14)* (ħ/2) ) = (2/7) * (ħ/2) ) = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7, which is option A's third value.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that's the correct answer, I think.

Wait, but let me double-check the average value calculation. Alternatively, I can compute <O> using the original state and the matrix of O.

O is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal.

So O = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Expressed as a vector, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The expectation value <O> is |alpha>^† O |alpha>.

Compute this:

O has elements [[0, a],[a,0]], where a= ħ/2.

So O |alpha> would be:

First component: a*(second component)
Second component: a*(first component)

So |alpha>^† O |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * O * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

But O applied to |alpha> is:

O |alpha> = [ (a*(2 -i)/sqrt(7)), a*(1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

So when you take the inner product with |alpha>:

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ a*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) , a*(1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

So it's (1+i)(a*(2 -i)) /7 + (2 -i)(a*(1+i)) /7.

Factor out a/7:

a/7 [ (1+i)(2 -i) + (2 -i)(1 +i) ]

Wait, but (1+i)(2 -i) = 2(1) + 1*(-i) + i*2 + i*(-i) = 2 -i + 2i -i^2. i^2 is -1, so this becomes 2 +i +1 =3 +i.

Similarly, (2 -i)(1 +i) = 2(1) + 2i -i(1) -i^2 = 2 +2i -i +1 = 3 +i.

So adding them gives (3+i) + (3+i) =6 + 2i.

So the expectation value is (a/7) (6 + 2i) = (ħ/2 * 1/7) (6 +2i) ) = (ħ/(14)) (6 +2i).

Wait, but that has an imaginary part. But the expectation value of an observable must be real. Hmm, that can't be right. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake during the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I should compute <alpha| O |alpha> directly.

Let me represent |alpha> as a column vector: [[(1+i)/sqrt(7)], [(2 -i)/sqrt(7)]].

O is [[0, a], [a, 0]], where a= ħ/2.

So O|alpha> is a matrix multiplied by |alpha>:

First component: 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + a*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = a*(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Second component: a*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = a*(1+i)/sqrt(7).

Then, the conjugate transpose of |alpha> is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiplying this by O|alpha>:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) * a*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * a*(1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= a/7 [ (1-i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 +i^2. i^2 is -1.

So 2 -i -2i + (-1) = (2-1) + (-3i) ) =1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2 = 2 +2i +i + (-1) = (2-1) +3i =1 +3i.

Adding these two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2 +0i =2.

So the expectation value is a/7 * 2 = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/7.

Oh, right. So the expectation value is real and equals ħ/7. That matches our earlier calculation.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357, which rounds to 0.64 and 0.36. So option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to the \( z \)-basis. First, we normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \). The norm squared of the state is:

\[
|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( O \) with matrix elements \( O_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( O_{ij} = 0 \) if \( i = j \). This operator corresponds to the spin-\( x \) operator, which has eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), given by:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the overlap coefficients \( c_+ = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \) and \( c_- = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \). Substituting \( |\alpha\rangle \) and the definitions of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we calculate:

\[
c_+ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | + \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right),
\]

\[
c_+ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

Similarly, for \( c_- \):

\[
c_- = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | - \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right),
\]

\[
c_- = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Next, we calculate the average value of \( O \), which is the expectation value \( \langle O \rangle = \langle \alpha | O | \alpha \rangle \). Using the matrix representation of \( O \) and the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), we find:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( P(+x) - P(-x) \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( O \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
