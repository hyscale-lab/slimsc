Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me try to think through this. So, the question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature. When it's hotter, more atoms are in higher energy states because of thermal energy.

Wait, the problem states that the photospheres are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here. The Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature and the energy difference between those states.

The Boltzmann equation is something like n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. But wait, in this problem, it's about the excitation, so I think the ratio of excited atoms to non-excited (or ground state) is given.

But wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, maybe the ratio of the number of excited atoms to unexcited is 2:1 for star_1 compared to star_2. Wait, no, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level". So, for star_1, the number of atoms in the specific energy level is twice that of star_2. So, n1 = 2 * n2.

But wait, actually, I think the ratio would be proportional to the Boltzmann factor. Let me write down the equations. Let’s denote for star 1: n1 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star 2: n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). Oh wait, I think ΔE is the same for both, because it's the same energy level transition. So the problem states the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J, but maybe that's a red herring because the options don't involve the energy directly.

Wait, the problem says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2. So, taking the ratio n1/n2 = 2.

Using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

n1 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

n2 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, n1 / n2 = exp( ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) )? Wait, no, because when you take n1/n2, the (g_upper/g_lower) terms cancel. So:

n1/n2 = exp( (ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)) )

Wait, let me make sure. The denominator is n_lower. Oh, wait, n1 is the number in the excited state for star 1, n2 for star 2. So, for each star, n = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - ΔE/(k T) ), assuming that the ground state has lower energy and the excited state is higher by ΔE.

So, for star 1: n1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Star 2: n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio n1/n2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] ) )

Simplify that exponent:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) )

So n1/n2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) )

But the problem states that n1 = 2 n2. So:

2 = exp( [ ΔE/(k) (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ] )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

But wait, what is ΔE/(k)? Let me compute that. Oh wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So ΔE = k * something.

Wait, wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Oh! So that term simplifies to 1. Then the equation becomes:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1 T2 )

Wait, but wait, the equation we have is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

But since ΔE/(k) is 1, it's ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but looking at the options, which one matches this? Let's check each option:

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Yes, that matches. So the correct equation is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because when I took the ratio n1/n2, I had:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

But ΔE/(k) is 1, so yes, equation is ln(2)= (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that's the correct one. So the answer should be option D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars.

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is proportional to \( \exp(-\Delta E / (kT)) \), where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant. For star_1 and star_2, this gives:

\[
n_1 = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad n_2 = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right),
\]

where \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are the number of excited atoms in star_1 and star_2, respectively. Taking the ratio \( n_1 / n_2 \), the \( g_{\text{upper}} / g_{\text{lower}} \) terms cancel, leaving:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

The problem states that \( n_1 = 2n_2 \), so \( n_1 / n_2 = 2 \). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), the ratio \( \Delta E / k = 1 \). Substituting this simplifies the equation to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
