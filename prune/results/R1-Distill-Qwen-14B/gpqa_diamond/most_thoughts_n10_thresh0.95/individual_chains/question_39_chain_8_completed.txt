Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about wave functions and probability, right? Let me break it down.

So, there are ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i. And when they measure the position, none of the particles are found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. Wait, no, actually, the measurement found that particles are only between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region, but it's given as non-zero within? Or maybe not... let me think.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, but particles are found only between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside that region. So, perhaps the given wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, the problem says the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i in a part of space where it can exist. Oh, so maybe the wave function is zero outside of that region. So, the region where it's non-zero is between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but that would mean it's a complex function. I remember that the probability density is |psi|^2, which is the square of the absolute value. So, the probability density is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, because the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, no, wait: the wave function is a complex number, so its absolute square is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

So, |psi(x)|^2 is [ (a / sqrt(1+x))^2 ] + [ (-0.5)^2 ].

So, that's (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of |psi|^2 from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because the probability of finding the particle in all possible positions is 1.

So, the integral of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3 must equal 1.

Let me write that equation. Integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

I can split this integral into two parts: a² * integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus 0.25 * integral of dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3, it's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So putting it together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solve for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Take the square root: a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)).

Wait, let me compute this numerically. Because the options are numerical.

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 is about 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.7208.

So a squared is 0.7208, so a is sqrt(0.7208) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. That's close.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. I assumed that the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Because when you measure, particles are found only between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval. But in the given wave function, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So if this is non-zero only between 1 and 3, then outside that region, the wave function is zero.

But wait, if the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, then even within 1 and 3, it's a complex number. But the normalization would require integrating |psi|^2 over all space, but since it's zero outside, it's just the integral from 1 to 3.

Wait, but let me think again. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when I compute the square of the absolute value, it's the sum of squares of the real and imaginary parts.

So |psi|^2 = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral of this from x=1 to x=3 must be 1.

Which I did earlier.

So, I think the approach is correct. So the calculations:

The integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7208.

a ≈ sqrt(0.7208) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The probability density is \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). Since the wave function is normalized, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region where the particle exists (between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \)) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx \),
2. \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx \).

The first integral evaluates to \( a^2 \ln(1+x) \) from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), which simplifies to \( a^2 \ln(2) \). The second integral evaluates to \( 0.25 \times (3-1) = 0.5 \). Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7208.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7208} \approx 0.849.
\]

This value is closest to the option \( 0.85 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
