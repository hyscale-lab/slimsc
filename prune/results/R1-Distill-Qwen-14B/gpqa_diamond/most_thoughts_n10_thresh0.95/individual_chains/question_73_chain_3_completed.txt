Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity. I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just add them normally like you would in classical mechanics. So the first thing I think about is the formula for adding velocities in special relativity. 

The problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Let me tackle the relative speed first. From what I recall, when you're finding the velocity of one object relative to another moving at a high speed, you use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Here, u and v are the velocities of the two objects as seen from the stationary frame.

Wait, but which one is u and which is v? Oh, right. The relative speed depends on the frame of reference. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be the difference between their speeds. So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, actually, no. The formula is for when you have an object moving at velocity u in one frame, and another moving at v in that same frame. So if I want the velocity of B as seen from A's frame, which is moving at 0.6c relative to the stationary frame, I need to plug in u = 0.5c and v = 0.6c into the formula.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, no. The velocity addition formula is for when you have a frame S where object A is moving at u, and another frame S' moving at v relative to S. So if the stationary frame is S, and A's velocity in S is u = 0.6c, and B's velocity in S is v = 0.5c. Then, from A's perspective (S' frame moving at velocity u), B's velocity (u') would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

So plugging in the numbers: (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.1429c. But since speed is a positive quantity, the magnitude is 0.1429c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, but wait the options have v_rel as 0.14c in options C and D. So that's the first part done.

Now the second part: the total energy of the system. Hmm. So each astronaut has relativistic kinetic energy, but wait, wait. The total energy would include their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy. Or wait, maybe it's considering their rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, the total energy is given by gamma times m c squared.

So each astronaut's energy is gamma * m_i * c², where m_i is their rest mass. So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2 has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So his energy is 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². Which rounds to approximately 5.96 m c². So the total energy is about 5.96 m c². Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. 

Wait, wait, 0.6 squared is 0.36, so 1 - 0.36 is 0.64, sqrt is 0.8. 1/0.8 is 1.25. So 1.25 * 2m = 2.5 m. Yep.

For the second, 0.5 squared is 0.25, so 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. So 1/0.8660 is about 1.1547. So 3m * 1.1547 is about 3.464 m. 

Adding 2.5 and 3.464, you get 5.964 m, which is approximately 5.96 m c². 

Looking at the options:

Option C says v_rel is 0.14c and E is 5.96 m c².

Option D says v_rel is 0.14c and E is 5 m c².

So the correct option would be C.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, but when calculating their energies, do we use their rest mass or their relativistic mass?

Wait, their masses are given as 2m and 3m. I'm a bit confused here. Wait, in relativity, the rest mass is m, and the relativistic mass is gamma m. But in the question, the astronauts' rest masses are 2m and 3m. So when calculating their energies, it's gamma multiplied by their rest mass.

So yes, the calculations I did are correct.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c and the total energy is 5.96 m c². Looking again at the options, option C matches.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.6c\) (velocity of astronaut A) and \(v = 0.5c\) (velocity of astronaut B). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1429c
\]

Since speed is a positive quantity, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

1. **For astronaut A (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_A = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
   \]

2. **For astronaut B (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_B = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
   \]

The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
