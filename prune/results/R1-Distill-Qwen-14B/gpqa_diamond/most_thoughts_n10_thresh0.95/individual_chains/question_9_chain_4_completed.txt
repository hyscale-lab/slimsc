Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules involves different types of symmetry elements like planes, axes, and centers. The notation C3h must refer to a certain type of point group. Oh right, point groups are classified based on their symmetry elements. The C3h group is a type of trigonal planar symmetry. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. C3h is actually a type of point group with a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, I think I might have that mixed up. Oh wait, C3h is a point group that includes a three-fold axis perpendicular to a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane that bisects it.

So the question is about which of the given molecules has this symmetry. The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are A, B, C, D.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has a structure where boron is in the center, connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a -CH(CH3)2 group. So the structure is trigonal planar around boron. Wait, but does it have a C3h symmetry? Let me think about the symmetry elements. Each isopropyl group is identical, so rotation by 120 degrees should leave the molecule looking the same. That would give a C3 axis. Now, does it have a mirror plane? If the molecule is in a plane that includes the central boron and goes between the isopropyl groups, that would be a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, because if you imagine looking down the C3 axis, each isopropyl is symmetric across the plane. So yes, I think triisopropyl borate does have C3h symmetry. So option C is a candidate.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, something like a bridge structure. I think it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. Its structure is similar to adamantane but smaller. The molecule has a three-fold axis because of the bridge structure. Wait, but does it have a mirror plane? I'm not too sure. Quinuclidine has a high degree of symmetry, perhaps C3v symmetry? Or maybe C3i (which is inversion with C3). Hmm, I'm not certain, but I don't think it's C3h. I think it's more of a C3 symmetry without the mirror plane. So maybe D is not the answer.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Wait, that's a mouthful. The name suggests a tricyclic structure with three furan rings connected. The substituents are at specific positions. The molecule is a hexaone, so it has ketone groups. I'm not exactly sure about its structure. But in terms of symmetry, it's a tricyclic compound. Maybe it's a corannulene or something similar. I think it's a flat molecule with perhaps some symmetry. But does it have C3h? Well, if the molecule is symmetric along a plane perpendicular to a three-fold axis, then yes. Alternatively, maybe the three ketone groups are arranged symmetrically. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a planar molecule with three-fold symmetry, but does it have a mirror plane? Maybe. I'm not sure. I'll have to think about this.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Wow, that's even more complex. The name suggests a structure where a triphenylene group is connected to three furan rings. Triphenylene is a symmetric molecule, a fused benzene rings structure. So this compound is probably a tricyclic with multiple benzene rings attached. The numbering suggests multiple ketone groups. Hmm, considering the symmetry, if the triphenylene group is symmetric with three-fold symmetry, and the furan rings are arranged symmetrically around it, then the entire molecule might have C3h symmetry. For example, if each of the three furan rings is identical and arranged symmetrically around a central point, and the mirror plane is in a plane perpendicular to the three-fold axis, then it would fit C3h.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize each structure.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has a central B with three identical isopropyl groups. So the molecule is trigonal planar around B, and each isopropyl is symmetric. So when looking along the C3 axis (the three-fold rotation), each isopropyl is in a plane perpendicular to that axis. So if you have a mirror plane that's horizontal (perpendicular to the C3 axis), that would bisect each isopropyl group. So each group would be symmetric across that plane. Therefore, the molecule should have C3h symmetry. So that would make option C correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure. What's the exact symmetry of triisopropyl borate? I think it does have a three-fold axis. So when you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. Also, it has mirror planes. For example, a mirror plane that goes through the boron and bisects two of the isopropyl groups. Wait, but if the mirror plane is horizontal (i.e., perpendicular to the C3 axis), then looking along the C3 would mean the mirror plane is in that plane. So each isopropyl group is symmetric across that plane, which it is because they're all the same. So yes, that would make it C3h.

Now, looking back at the options. The question is which has C3h symmetry. So if option C (triisopropyl borate) has C3h, then the answer would be C.

Wait, but let me check the other options again. Let's see option D, quinuclidine. It's a bicyclo structure, and I think its symmetry is C3v, which has a three-fold axis and vertical mirror planes. If that's the case, then it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, which would make it not C3h. So option D is out.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-hexaone. The benzo rings substituted on the trifuran. How is the symmetry here? If the three rings are arranged symmetrically, perhaps each at 120-degree positions, then it might have C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is planar, then a mirror plane might exist. Wait, but if the molecule is a hexaone, it has six ketone groups? No, wait, the name says 1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So it has six ketone groups? That's a lot. Hmm, perhaps the structure is a flat, symmetrical arrangement. But I'm not very familiar with this particular compound. Alternatively, maybe it's more like a hexagonal arrangement with three-fold symmetry and a mirror plane, making it C3h.

But I think the first option, triisopropyl borate (option C), definitely has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, so it's C3h. So the correct answer is C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the symmetry elements of each option. **C₃h** symmetry involves a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the axis. Let us evaluate each option:

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate
Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar around boron, with a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that bisects the molecule, making it symmetric across this plane. This satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry. Thus, triisopropyl borate is a strong candidate.

### Option D: Quinuclidine
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure. While it has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃), it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Its symmetry is likely **C₃v**, which includes vertical mirror planes but not a horizontal one. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
This molecule is a tricyclic structure with three furan rings and six ketone groups. While it may have some symmetry, the arrangement of the rings and substituents does not clearly indicate the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). It is less likely to exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
This molecule has a triphenylene group connected to three furan rings. While the triphenylene group is symmetric, the overall structure does not clearly exhibit a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Thus, it is unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) clearly exhibits **C₃h** symmetry, as it has both a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The other molecules either lack these symmetry elements or do not clearly satisfy the **C₃h** criteria.
