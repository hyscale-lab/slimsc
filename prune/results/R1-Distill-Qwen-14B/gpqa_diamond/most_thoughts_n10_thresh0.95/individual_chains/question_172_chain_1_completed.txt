Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Let me try to break it down. I remember that when they talk about the photosphere, it's the layer of the star where light is emitted, right? And the question is about iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars. 

The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. I'm thinking, what does that mean for their temperatures? Oh right, in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

So, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels to temperature. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where n_i is the number of atoms in level i, E_i is the energy of that level, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me call that ΔE. So ΔE = E_i - E_j.

The question says that the population in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for each star, the ratio of populations (excited to ground, perhaps) is given. Let's denote n1 as the excited level population in star_1 and n2 in star_2. So n1 = 2 n2.

Wait, but wait. No, actually, the problem says the excited atoms are twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Wait, no, wait. The exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So that means n1 = 2 n2, where n is the number of excited atoms in each level.

Wait, but wait. No, wait. Maybe I got that wrong. Because the energy levels are for the same transition in both stars. So for each star, the excited state is a certain level. Let's say level 2 is excited, and level 1 is the lower state. So for each star, the ratio of n2 to n1 would be given by the Boltzmann factor. But in this problem, the ratio between the two stars is given. So for star_1, the excited level is twice as populated as in star_2. So n1_excited = 2 * n2_excited.

Wait, no, I think I need to think about each star's ratio first. Let me clarify.

For each star, the ratio of excited atoms (n_upper) to ground atoms (n_lower) is determined by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, the ratio is (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and similarly for star 2: (n_upper2 / n_lower2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But the problem says that for star 1, the excited atoms are twice as excited as in star 2. Wait, what's the exact statement? It says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. Hmm, so perhaps the excited level population of star_1 is twice that of star_2's excited level population. So n_upper1 = 2 n_upper2.

Wait, no, that wouldn't directly relate their temperatures, because the ratio of excited to lower level also depends on temperature. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the excited state to the total number of atoms is twice as much in star_1. No, perhaps the ratio is n_upper1 / n_upper2 = 2. So n_upper1 = 2 n_upper2.

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited level's population in star 1 to that in star 2 is 2:1. So n_upper1 / n_upper2 = 2.

But how do I relate this to the temperatures? Because each star has its own temperature, T1 and T2.

So let's write the ratio for each star.

For star_1: (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: (n_upper2 / n_lower2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem states that n_upper1 = 2 n_upper2. So n_upper1 / n_upper2 = 2.

So I can write:

(n_upper1 / n_lower1) / (n_upper2 / n_lower2) ) = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

(n_upper1 n_lower2) / (n_upper2 n_lower1) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But from the problem, n_upper1 = 2 n_upper2. So let me substitute that into the equation.

So (2 n_upper2 * n_lower2) / (n_upper2 * n_lower1) ) = 2 (n_lower2)/(n_lower1) ). So the left side becomes 2 (n_lower2 / n_lower1). 

Wait, this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps I should take the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors.

So let's take (n_upper1 / n_lower1) / (n_upper2 / n_lower2) ) = (exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )) / (exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )) )

Which simplifies to exp(ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )) 

Which is the same as exp( ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) )

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Hmm, yes.

So let me compute that exponent: ΔE/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

But we also have that n_upper1 = 2 n_upper2. So the ratio (n_upper1 / n_upper2) is 2.

But wait, the ratio (n_upper1 / n_lower1) / (n_upper2 / n_lower2) ) equals (n_upper1 n_lower2) / (n_upper2 n_lower1 ) = (n_upper1/n_upper2) * (n_lower2/n_lower1 )

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the ratio of the ratios.

Wait, the problem states that the excited atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So for each star, the ratio of upper to lower is given by the Boltzmann factor. But the ratio between the two stars is that n_upper1 = 2 n_upper2.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Let me denote the ratio of the excited states as R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1, and R2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2.

So R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that R1 = 2 R2.

Because n_upper1 = 2 n_upper2. Wait, no, because R is the ratio of upper to lower in each star. So if n_upper1 = 2 n_upper2, but the lower states could be different in each star, so I can't directly say R1 is twice R2. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the ratio between the two stars.

n_upper1 / n_upper2 = 2.

But each n_upper is given by n_upper = n_total * (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming that the partition functions are similar, but maybe they can be neglected or considered equal.

Assuming that the statistical weights (g_upper and g_lower) are the same for both stars, then n_upper for each star is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)) multiplied by the total number of atoms. But since the total number of atoms would vary between stars, maybe it's better to take the ratio between the two stars.

So n_upper1 / n_upper2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] ) * (n_total1 / n_total2 )

But I don't know anything about n_total1 and n_total2. So perhaps this approach won't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is for the same element, so the ionization state is same, so maybe the statistical weights are same for both stars. Then, the ratio n_upper1 / n_upper2 = exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) ) - (1/(T1)) ] )

And the problem states that this ratio is 2.

So:

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take natural log of both sides:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting,

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. What about k? Boltzmann's constant is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE is exactly equal to k. Because 1.38e-23 J is k's value. So ΔE = k.

So substituting,

ln(2) = (k) / (k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which can be rewritten as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), which matches. So the correct equation is D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \).

In LTE, the population of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. For each star, the ratio of the excited state population (\( n_{\text{upper}} \)) to the lower state population (\( n_{\text{lower}} \)) is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)) and \( T \) is the temperature of the star.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excited state population in star_1 is twice that in star_2, i.e., \( n_{\text{upper,1}} = 2 n_{\text{upper,2}} \). Taking the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{lower,2}}}{n_{\text{upper,2}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \( \frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{upper,2}}} = 2 \), the left-hand side becomes:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{lower,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}}.
\]

However, since the ratio of the lower state populations is not specified, the focus remains on the exponential term. Rearranging the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Using the identity \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \), this simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D, which is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
