Okay, so I'm trying to figure out these Michael addition reactions. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The product is an enolate, which then can react further.

Let's look at each reaction one by one.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate—actually, it's a strong, stabilized enolate. The other compound is the alpha-beta unsaturated ester. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, no—actually, wait, the structure is probably the acrylate as CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but substituted. Let me think again. The compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, I think. The structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but wait, the substituent is at the 3 position. Oh wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, it's CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, perhaps I should draw it mentally. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a substituent on the beta carbon (the CH2=CH- part). So the beta carbon is the one next to the carbonyl. So the substituent is on the double bond's beta position. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate—so the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, maybe not. Alternatively, it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but there's a p-tolyl group attached to the double bond. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Let me think again. The general formula for an acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group on carbon 3? So, structure: CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, but that would make the acrylate have a substituent beyond the double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with a substituent on the alpha position. Hmm, maybe I should look up the structure, but since I can't, I'll proceed with what I think.

In any case, the Michael donor is dimethyl malonate. It's a good nucleophile because it's resonance-stabilized. The acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, the malonate will attack the beta position of the acceptor. Let me imagine the structure of the acrylate: the carbonyl is at the end, with a double bond attached to a p-tolyl group. So when the malonate attacks, the enolate will add to the beta carbon of the acceptor. The product would then be a new carbon-carbon bond between the malonate's carbon and the beta carbon of the acceptor.

So, the product from A would be a new molecule where the malonate has added to the acrylate. Since dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH, when it attacks, the CH from the malonate would attach to the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the acrylate's structure is, say, CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the CH2? Or perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Hmm, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is on the middle carbon of the acrylate.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Then, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 2. So in that case, the alpha-beta unsaturated ester is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. When the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position, that would be the CH2 group. Wait, no—the malonate would attack the beta position of the acceptor. So the acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, so the beta position is the one adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, in CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, the carbonyl is at the end. So the alpha is the CH2, and the beta is the C(p-tolyl). Wait, no. The carbonyl is COOCH3, so the adjacent carbon is the alpha (CH2), and the next would be beta (the p-tolyl attached). So the double bond is between alpha and beta carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a substituent on the beta carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but in this case, one of the CH2's is substituted with a p-tolyl group. So it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Hmm, maybe that's the structure.

In any case, when the dimethyl malonate (CH2(COOCH3)2) acts as the nucleophile, its enolate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the attack would occur on the CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3's beta carbon. Wait, but the acrylate's structure is CH2=C(R)-COOCH3, where R is p-tolyl. So the beta carbon is the one attached to the R group. So when the enolate attacks, it would add to that beta carbon.

The product would be a new molecule where the malonate's CH is connected to the R-substituted carbon. So the product would have a structure like CH2(COOCH3)2 connected to the R group. So, the product could be a tricarboxylate with the R group attached.

Looking at the options, option A says A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So that would be (p-tolyl)-CH(COOCH3)2. So that makes sense because the malonate (which is CH2(COOCH3)2) would add to the beta carbon, which is the R-substituted position.

So for reaction A, the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So that's option A or B or others.

Moving to reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile, with MeOH and H3O+. So this is another Michael addition.

The piperidine is 1-(cyclohexenyl)piperidine. The cyclohexenyl group is a ring with a double bond. The piperidine's nitrogen is at position 1 of the cyclohexenyl ring. So the structure is cyclohexenyl (CH2)4NH. Wait, no, piperidine is a six-membered ring with one nitrogen. So 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine would have the cyclohexene ring attached to the nitrogen of the piperidine. So the piperidine is a ring with five CH2 groups and one NH. The cyclohexene is connected to the piperidine's nitrogen.

The other reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CHCH2CN, but in E configuration. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? Or is it NC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. But-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, butenitrile is CH2CHCN. Wait, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, but-2-enenitrile would have the nitrile group on C-1, with the double bond between C-2 and C-3. So it's CH2-CH2-CN but with double bond. Wait, but the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CN. Or is it CH2CH2CN? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. No, butenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN, but wait, butenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? That can't be right. Wait, the nitrile is on the first carbon, so but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN? No, wait, but that's but-3-enenitrile. Wait, the nitrile is on the first carbon, so but-2-enenitrile would be CH2CH=CHCN? No, that's not possible because butenitrile is four carbons. So but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN? Wait, but that would be three carbons between the nitrile and the double bond. Hmm, perhaps but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. Or maybe it's NC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with double bond. No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, butenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN, but that's actually 1-cyano-2-butene. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN
