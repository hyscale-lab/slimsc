Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. There are four options to choose from, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh wait, the formula I think is L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I find tau? Oh right, the mean lifetime tau is related to the width Gamma through the uncertainty principle. The formula is tau = hbar / Gamma, where hbar is the reduced Planck constant. Or is it hbar divided by Gamma? Wait, I think so. Because the width Γ is the inverse of the lifetime, but since Γ is the decay rate, it's Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but sometimes I've seen it written as tau = 1/(Gamma), but I think that's when the width is given in units where ħ is 1, which is common in particle physics. Oh right, in particle physics, energies and inverse times are often given in compatible units. So for example, GeV and MeV are units of energy, and inverse GeV would be time in some unit.

Wait, but in this problem, the width Γ is given in MeV. So how do I handle the units properly?

Let me think. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because when you have ħ in units of GeV·s, 1 GeV^-1 is roughly 6.58e-25 seconds. 

So, tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So let me make sure to convert Γ into GeV. Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s. Let me compute that.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. So tau ≈ 2.057e-24 s.

But wait, that's the proper lifetime. The particle is moving, so we need to consider its gamma factor to get the lab frame lifetime. Gamma is E/(m c²), but since we're working in units where c=1 (probably), so gamma = E_X / m_X.

E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV, so gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

So the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So gamma * tau = 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 s ≈ (6.6667 * 2.057e-24) s. Let me compute that.

6.6667 * 2.057 is approximately 13.71. So 13.71e-24 s, which is 1.371e-23 seconds.

Now, the decay length L is beta * gamma * c * tau. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula for decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Because the particle's speed is v = beta c, so the time it lives in the lab frame is gamma tau, and the distance is v times that time: beta c gamma tau.

So I need to compute beta. Since gamma = 6.6667, and gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), I can find beta.

Gamma squared is (1/(1 - beta^2)) = (gamma)^2. So 1 - beta^2 = 1/(gamma)^2.

Gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444. So 1 - beta^2 = 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So beta^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Yes, so beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 / E^2 )) since E = gamma m, so m^2 = (E^2)(1 - beta^2), so beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 / E^2)).

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV.

m^2 / E^2 = (1.44) / (64) = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Hmm, so beta is approximately 0.9887.

Now, putting it all together.

L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, but tau is already gamma multiplied by proper time. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the proper time is tau, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau, and the distance is v * (gamma tau) = beta c gamma tau. So that's correct.

So L = beta c gamma tau.

But tau is ħ / Gamma, which we calculated as 2.057e-24 s.

So let's compute each part.

Compute beta * gamma: 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.611.

Then, multiply by c, which is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So 6.611 * 3e8 m/s = 1.9833e9 m/s.

Wait, wait, no, wait a second. Wait, L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, tau is in seconds, so I need to compute beta * gamma * c * tau.

So:

beta ≈0.9887

gamma ≈6.6667

c=3e8 m/s.

tau≈2.057e-24 s.

So:

beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ approx 6.611.

Then 6.611 * c = 6.611 * 3e8 m/s ≈1.9833e9 m/s.

Then multiply by tau: 1.9833e9 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Wait, 1e9 * 1e-24 is 1e-15. So 1.9833 * 2.057 is approx:

Let me compute 2 * 2.057 is 4.114, but since it's 1.9833 which is almost 2, maybe 4.065 perhaps. Hmm.

Wait, 1.9833 * 2.057 = let me compute it more accurately.

1.9833 * 2.057:

First, 2 * 2.057 is 4.114.

0.9833 * 2.057: Let me compute 2.057 * 0.9833.

Wait, 2.057 * 0.9833 ≈ (2 * 0.9833) + (0.057 * 0.9833) )?

2 * 0.9833 = 1.9666.

0.057 * 0.9833 ≈ 0.0563.

So total is approx 1.9666 + 0.0563 = 2.0229.

So 2.0229.

Wait, but wait, 1.9833 is 2 - 0.0167. So 2.057 * (2 - 0.0167) = 2.057*2 - 2.057 * 0.0167.

Which is 4.114 - (approx 0.0345) = 4.0795.

So 4.0795.

Then, the product is 4.0795e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, which is higher. Option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to our calculation of approximately 4.08e-15. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations, maybe I missed a step.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta * gamma. Let me re-calculate that.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... exactly 20/3.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2/E^2))= sqrt(1 - (1.44/64))= sqrt(0.975625) = 0.98775 (more accurately, perhaps). Let me compute it exactly.

1.44/64 = 0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) = let's compute it.

0.9887 is an approximation. Let's compute it more accurately.

Let me approximate sqrt(0.9775). Let's see: 0.988^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2 = 0.9604 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.000064 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 ≈0.976144. Hmm, that's less than 0.9775. So 0.988^2= ~0.9761, which is less than 0.9775. So let's find x where x^2 =0.9775.

Let me try x=0.9885.

0.9885^2 = ?

Compute 0.9885 * 0.9885:

= (0.98 + 0.0085)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.0085 + 0.0085².

0.9604 + 2*(0.00833) + 0.00007225.

Wait, 0.98 * 0.0085 = 0.00833. So 2*0.00833 = 0.01666.

So 0.9604 + 0.01666 = 0.97706.

Plus 0.00007225 is 0.97713225. Hmm, which is a bit higher than 0.9775.

Wait, maybe I should compute 0.9887^2.

0.9887 * 0.9887.

Let me calculate it step by step.

Using (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, where a=0.98, b=0.0087.

a²=0.9604.

2ab=2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 = 0.017208.

b²= (0.0087)^2= approx 0.00007569.

So total is 0.9604 + 0.017208 = 0.977608 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.9776837.

Which is a bit higher than 0.9775.

So 0.9887^2 is about 0.97768, which is higher than 0.9775.

So maybe beta is approximately 0.9886?

Wait, but the exact value might not matter too much for the problem, as the options are precise.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute beta more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute gamma and beta more accurately.

Gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... which is 20/3.

Beta can be written as sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)).

Wait, 1.44/64 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775).

Hmm, perhaps it's better to use approximate sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta ≈0.9887.

So beta * gamma = 0.9887 * (20/3) ≈ 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ let's compute that.

6.6667 * 0.9887 = Let me do 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322. 0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 0.660. So total is 5.9322 + 0.660 = 6.5922.

Wait, but that's incorrect. Wait, 6.6667 * 0.9887.

Let me compute 6.6667 * 0.9887:

First, 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6667 * 0.9887: Let's compute 0.6667 * 0.9887.

0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ (approx 2/3) * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6591.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.6591 ≈6.5913.

So beta * gamma ≈6.5913.

Now, c is 3e8 m/s.

So, beta gamma c = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 1.9774e9 m/s.

Now, tau is 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

So, decay length L = beta gamma c tau = 1.9774e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 1.9774e9 by 2.056875e-24:

1.9774 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute that.

1.9774 * 2 = 3.9548.

1.9774 * 0.056875 ≈ approx 0.112.

So total approx 3.9548 + 0.112 = 4.0668.

So 4.0668e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this value. So the correct answer must be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2}} \),
- \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} \),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} \),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity factor \( \beta \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.2^2}{8^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The mean proper lifetime \( \tau \) is:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substitute the values:
- \( \beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5913 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \).

\[
L = 6.5913 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.057 \times 10^{-24}
\]

First, calculate \( 6.5913 \times 3 \times 10^8 \):

\[
6.5913 \times 3 \times 10^8 = 1.9774 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Then, multiply by \( 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
L = 1.9774 \times 10^9 \times 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \approx 4.0668 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The closest option to \( 4.0668 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
