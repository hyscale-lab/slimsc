--- Full Content ---
Alright, let's try to work through this chemistry problem. Okay, so the question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Hmm. Let's break down each step.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a four-fused cyclohexane structure. The 1,3-dibromo suggests that the two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons in the structure, probably in a way that they're vicinal.

Heating with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, probably leads to elimination. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an E2 reaction. Since it's heated, elimination is more likely than substitution. So, two dehydrohalogenation steps would occur, removing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. So when KOH is added, each Br would leave, but since they're adjacent, maybe the elimination leads to an allene (a compound with two double bonds) or a conjugated diene? Or perhaps a single double bond.

Wait, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. If the structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, then the Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads. So each elimination would form a double bond between those bridgeheads. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are usually not allowed due to Bredt's rule. Oh, but adamantane has a structure where some bridgehead positions are possible for double bonds. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a bicyclic structure with a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantadiene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each Br is eliminated to form a double bond. Wait, if two E2 reactions occur, each removing an HBr, then perhaps the compound loses two HBr molecules, forming a diene.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Looking at the NMR data given for product 1: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, possibly an ester or ketone.

Wait, but when you eliminate HBr, you typically form an alkene, but that doesn't explain the IR peak. Unless... maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but KOH is a base, so elimination is more likely.

Wait, unless it's a different mechanism. Another thought: If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps a di-elimination occurs, leading to a diepoxy structure? No, that doesn't fit with the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Where would the carbonyl come from? Oh, wait, maybe the KOH is causing a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. Hmm, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but that's for coupling aryl halides.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. How can that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Wait, KOH can act as a base or a nucleophile. Another possibility is that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and when treated with a strong base, an elimination occurs to form a carbonyl group. Wait, that's not possible via E2. Oh, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism or something else. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a beta-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the structure is undergoing a double elimination, forming a carbonyl. For example, if two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr each, perhaps they form a double bond adjacent to a bridgehead, but if that's not possible, maybe an alternative structure forms.

Wait, another angle: The NMR of product 1. The peaks are 4.79 (2H, perhaps a methylene attached to an electronegative group like oxygen). The 2.41-2.23 (10H) might be a decalin-like system, and 1.94 (2H) maybe another methylene.

If the 4.79 is a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps it's an ether or ester. But the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any carbonyl peaks, because in 1H NMR, carbonyls are usually not seen. The IR would show the carbonyl, though.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but that would show in the NMR as a singlet maybe, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. But an epoxide's O would show in the NMR as a triplet or something else, but the 4.79 (2H) could be the oxygen adjacent protons.

Wait, but in an epoxide, the protons are usually around 3-4 ppm, depending on substitution. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let's think: the IR shows a strong carbonyl. So if product 1 is a ketone, then the NMR would have a singlet for any equivalent protons. But the 4.79 (2H) is a triplet or something else.

Wait, maybe it's an enol ether? Or perhaps a cyclohexenone derivative.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Since both Br atoms are present, perhaps it's undergoing a double elimination to form a conjugated diene. But the IR data suggests a carbonyl, so maybe a conjugated enone.

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes an oxidation. Wait, but KOH isn't typically oxidizing. Unless it's a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, which then might undergo some reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanone. But I'm not sure how the structure would look. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of the formation of an epoxide. Wait, if two adjacent Br atoms are eliminated as HBr, and the resulting structure is an epoxide. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—would that form an epoxide with adjacent Brs? If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, eliminating two HBr would form a double bond, but that would be a diene if conjugated.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the NMR data again. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl, so product 1 has a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR shows four sets of peaks. The 4.79 (2H) could be adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests perhaps a ring structure, like four equivalent CH2 groups, but 10H would be five CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps a cyclohexane ring with substituents.

Wait, another possibility: the product could be an ester, like an adamantyl ester. But then, where would the ester group come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. If KOH is acting as a nucleophile, perhaps it substitutes a Br. But with two Brs, maybe two substitutions occur, leading to a diol? But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization, but that requires an ester and a base, which I don't think is the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an alkene and a carbonyl group. For example, if one Br is eliminated as HBr, forming a double bond, and the other Br might undergo some reaction.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane with a ketone group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoing dehydrohalogenation twice to form a conjugated diene with a carbonyl group. But how?

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The 4.79 (2H) might be a methylene adjacent to oxygen, like in an ester or ether. The 1.94 (2H) could be another methylene group, perhaps in a ring. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be a decalin system, as adamantane's structure has multiple equivalent protons.

If product 1 has a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone. For example, 1,3-diketone, but I'm not sure how that would look.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diketone. But then, the 4.79 ppm would need to be from something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. For instance, if one Br is substituted by an oxygen group. Wait, but KOH isn't a typical nucleophile for ester formation.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction forms an epoxide. But then, how would that lead to a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by oxidation. But KOH alone isn't an oxidizing agent.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an elimination but a substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so substitution is less likely unless it's SN2, but with two Brs, maybe two SN2 reactions occur.

Wait, if two SN2 reactions happen, each Br would be replaced by something. But what would that something be? KOH has OH-, so maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group, forming a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that can't be right.

Wait, but maybe the diol then undergoes some reaction. Or perhaps it's oxidized, but again, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on and see if the subsequent steps can give me clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions, but if product 1 is an ester or ketone, perhaps it undergoes acylation or alkylation.

Wait, but product 1's structure is unclear. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diene, heating with Al isopropoxide might lead to some cycloaddition, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and Al isopropoxide is used to form a more complex structure, but without knowing product 1, it's tough.

Moving on, product 2 is then treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it.

The product 3's NMR is the focus. We need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the deuterated solvent (so probably not OH or NH groups).

So, the most deshielded protons are typically those near electronegative atoms, like oxygen or in conjugated systems. In ozonolysis products, carbonyl groups are formed. The protons adjacent to carbonyls (alpha protons) are deshielded and show up downfield.

In ozonolysis of a double bond, the result is typically two carbonyl groups. For example, if the double bond was between C1 and C2, ozonolysis would give two carbonyls, each on C1 and C2.

Assuming product 2 has a cyclic or bridged structure with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls. Then, product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and the adjacent protons would show specific coupling patterns.

Wait, but how does the coupling pattern arise? Let's think about the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose the original double bond in product 2 is such that upon ozonolysis, each carbonyl has adjacent protons.

For example, if the structure is something like R-CH2-CH2-R', ozonolysis would break the middle double bond (if any), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave that, forming two carbonyl groups. Then, the adjacent protons would be on each side of the carbonyl.

In such a case, each proton adjacent to the carbonyl would be split by neighboring protons. For example, if each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, the protons on CH2 would couple with each other and perhaps with neighboring groups.

Wait, but if the structure after ozonolysis is such that each carbonyl has two adjacent protons, each of those protons would be coupled to two others. For instance, in a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, the CH2 protons would be next to each other. Each H on CH2 would be split by the adjacent H on the same CH2 (geminal coupling, but that's usually negligible) and by the H on the neighboring CH2 (vicinal coupling).

Wait, but in such a case, each CH2 would have two protons, each coupling with the other. So, each H would be a doublet, as each is split by one neighboring H. But wait, if each H is next to another H, and perhaps also next to another set of Hs from adjacent groups, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis has each carbonyl group adjacent to a CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2 group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, considering the initial structure: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. After elimination, perhaps product 1 is a ketone like 1,3-adamantanedione? But I'm not sure. Then, product 2 after treatment with Al isopropoxide (a strong Lewis acid) might undergo some Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but without an aromatic ring, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, which upon reaction with Al isopropoxide undergoes some cycloaddition, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide could undergo some acylation to form a more complex structure.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should think about the ozonolysis step. Ozone cleaves double bonds, and the product after work-up (with dimethylsulfide, a mild reductant) would form carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a single double bond, product 3 would have two carbonyls.

Wait, but the initial step's product (product 1) has a carbonyl, as per the IR. Then, product 2 is treated with Al isopropoxide. Maybe product 2 is an enol ether or another structure with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: Product 1's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 (2H). If that's a methylene next to an oxygen, perhaps it's an ether. Then, product 1 could be an epoxide.

Wait, if product 1 is an epoxide, then heating with excess Al isopropoxide might cause ring-opening. Wait, but Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, which could catalyze the ring-opening of epoxides via acid-catalyzed mechanisms, leading to carbocation formation. But I'm not sure what product 2 would be in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. For instance, if the reaction forms a cyclic ester, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diepoxide. No, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane elimination would more likely form a diene or a single carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a single elimination, forming a vinyl group, which upon oxidation forms a ketone. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, another approach: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, might lose two HBr molecules to form a ketone. Wait, is that possible? Like a double dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, but typically, dehydrohalogenation forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a conjugated diene that then undergoes some cyclization or oxidation, but KOH alone doesn't do that.

Maybe it's a case of the formation of a cyclic ketone. For example, if two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr, forming a ring with a double bond, but that would require a six-membered ring perhaps, which would then form a carbonyl upon some reaction.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible structures and their NMR.

Product 1's NMR: 4.79 (2H) could be an -OCH2- group. The 1.94 (2H) could be a bridgehead CH2. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be multiple equivalent CH2 groups in a ring.

If product 1 is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide, but that would have a different NMR. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal diol, but that's not matching the NMR.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone. Let's say it's 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, its NMR would show the carbonyl as a singlet, but the 4.79 ppm would be from something else. Alternatively, maybe the structure has a CH2 group near the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. If the structure is an ester, the 4.79 would be the ester oxygen adjacent CH2. Then, the IR would show the ester carbonyl at around 1720 cm-1, which matches.

So, if product 1 is an ester, then the structure would have an ester group. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where OH- attacks a carbonyl, but I don't see how that would form an ester.

Wait, another reaction possibility: the formation of a gem-dialkoxy structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and the NMR shows the alpha protons.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, the 4.79 (2H) could be the alpha protons. For example, if the structure is something like (CH2)2C(O)R, the protons on the adjacent CH2 would be deshielded and appear around 2.5 ppm. But in the NMR, the 4.79 is higher, which is more like an oxygen-bearing CH2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but the NMR doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the steps again.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR shows carbonyl)

product 1 → Al isopropoxide → product 2

product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3

The question is about product 3's NMR.

Assuming that product 3 is the result of ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds, the most deshielded hydrogen would be near a carbonyl group.

In ozonolysis, each carbonyl group would have adjacent (alpha) protons. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons.

For example, if each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, and those CH2 groups are connected to another CH2 group, the alpha protons would be on CH2 and might couple with adjacent Hs.

In such a case, each proton on CH2 would be adjacent to another H on the same CH2 (geminal, usually not split) and perhaps to Hs on the neighboring group.

Wait, but geminal coupling (same C) is usually not observed because the coupling constant is very small, but if the structure has symmetry, perhaps it's a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is adjacent to two different sets of protons. For example, if each CH2 is next to another CH2, each H would have two neighboring Hs (one on the same CH2 and one on the adjacent CH2). Wait, that might lead to a triplet of triplets or a more complex splitting.

Wait, let's consider a specific example. Suppose the ozonolysis of product 2 gives a structure like O=C-R, where R is a CH2-CH2 group. Then, the CH2 groups would be adjacent to each other, and each H on the first CH2 would couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Each H on CH2-1 would couple with two Hs on CH2-2. So, each H would be a triplet (n+1, where n=2 → triplet). But wait, if each H on CH2-1 is next to two Hs on CH2-2, which are equivalent, then each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but in reality, each H on CH2-1 would be split by the two Hs on CH2-2. Since the two Hs on CH2-2 are equivalent, each H on CH2-1 would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but each H on CH2-1 is also adjacent to another H on the same CH2. But geminal coupling is typically not observed because the coupling constant J is very small (~0-1 Hz), so it's usually not seen in the NMR. Therefore, the splitting would be due to the adjacent CH2 group.

So, each H on CH2-1 would be a triplet. But wait, if each H is coupled to two Hs (on CH2-2), then each would be a triplet. But if the two Hs on CH2-2 are not equivalent, it could be more complex.

Wait, but in a typical scenario, each H on CH2-1 would couple with two Hs on CH2-2, leading to a triplet. For example, in ethane-1,2-diol, each CH2 group's H would be a triplet because each H is adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2.

Wait, but in that case, each H would be a triplet because n=2 (two neighboring Hs). So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH2 groups are connected in a way that each H is coupled with two Hs, but those two Hs are part of a triplet themselves, leading to a more complex splitting. For example, each H is coupled with two Hs, each of which is split into a triplet, leading to a triplet of triplets. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe each H is coupled with two neighboring Hs from the same group and two from another, leading to a quintet, but that depends on the structure.

Hmm. But the options given are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

If the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, each H would see two neighboring Hs. So each would be a triplet.

But wait, in the case where each CH2 is part of a longer chain, like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, each CH2's H would be adjacent to two Hs on either side. For the middle CH2, each H would be coupled with two Hs on either side, but since the two Hs on one side are equivalent, and the two on the other are also equivalent, each H would have four neighboring Hs (two on each side), leading to a quintet (n=4 → pentet).

Wait, that makes sense. So, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 in the middle would have two Hs on each adjacent CH2. Each H on the middle CH2 would be split by four neighboring Hs, leading to a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks → pentet).

But wait, the end CH2 groups would each have only two neighboring Hs (from the adjacent CH2), so each H would be a triplet.

So in product 3, the most deshielded Hs would be on the end CH2 groups, which are triplets.

But wait, in ozonolysis, the product is typically two carbonyl groups, so maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. The middle CH2 would have adjacent Hs on both ends. Each H in the middle would be coupled with four Hs (two from each adjacent CH2), leading to a quintet. Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the middle CH2 would have four neighboring Hs, leading to a pentet.

But if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the middle CH2 has two Hs on each side, but each side is a CH2 group. So each H in the middle would be adjacent to two Hs on the left and two on the right, but each set of two is equivalent. So each H would see four neighboring Hs, leading to a quintet.

Wait, but in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, the two CH2 groups are each adjacent to a carbonyl. Each H on the first CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (but geminal coupling is negligible) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet, because n=2 (each H on the adjacent CH2). Similarly, the Hs on the second CH2 would also be triplets.

Wait, but if the structure is a four-carbon chain with two carbonyls at the ends, then each of the two CH2 groups in the middle would have Hs that couple with two Hs from one side and two from the other. So each H would be a triplet of triplets, but that depends.

Wait, perhaps each H on the middle CH2 is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH2. If each adjacent CH2 has two Hs, then each H on the middle CH2 would be split by four Hs. But in reality, if the two Hs on each adjacent group are equivalent, the splitting would be n=2 on each side, leading to (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, but that's a triplet of triplets. Alternatively, if the coupling constants are similar, it might appear as a quintet.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the options.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

In the case where each H is coupled with two Hs from one side and two from the other, but the couplings are similar, the splitting could result in a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling is with two equivalent Hs on one side and two on the other, but the coupling constants are the same, the splitting might be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two Hs on one adjacent CH2, causing a triplet, and perhaps another coupling with another set, leading to a more complex pattern.

Wait, in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, each CH2 group's Hs are adjacent to two Hs on the other CH2. So each H is coupled with two Hs, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But wait, product 3 would have two CH2 groups, each adjacent to a carbonyl. So each H on those CH2 groups would be adjacent to two Hs on the other CH2 group. So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but in that structure, each CH2 is next to another CH2, so each H would be split by two Hs (n=2 → triplet). So the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the middle CH2's Hs are adjacent to two Hs on each side (from the two CH2 groups), so each H would be coupled with four Hs. That would lead to a pentet (n=4 → five peaks).

But which structure is more likely?

If product 2 has a three-carbon chain with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls with a single CH2 in between. So the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, leading to each CH2 group's Hs being triplets.

Wait, but if the original product 2 has a four-carbon chain with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls with two CH2 groups in between, leading to O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the middle CH2's Hs would be coupled with four Hs, making a pentet.

But I'm not sure about the structure of product 2.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

But considering the options, and the fact that ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into two carbonyls, the adjacent CH2 groups would each have Hs that are split by two Hs on the other side, leading to triplets.

So the most deshielded H (on the CH2 next to the carbonyl) would be a triplet.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: in the ozonolysis product, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. The Hs on those CH2 groups are adjacent to the carbonyl and to another CH2 group. So each H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl is adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2. So each H is split into a triplet.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

Wait, but in the options, option B is triplet of triplets. How would that happen?

If each H is coupled with two Hs on one side (triplet) and another two Hs on the other side (another triplet), the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

But that would require each H to be coupled with two groups of two Hs each, which might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has branching, leading to each H being coupled with three different sets of Hs, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the initial product 2 has a bridge or a ring, leading to each H being coupled with multiple Hs in different environments, resulting in a more complex splitting pattern.

Hmm. But without knowing the exact structure of product 2, it's challenging to determine the exact coupling pattern.

Wait, another thought: the initial product 1 is 1,3-diketone, so when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a Claisen-like condensation or forms an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis would break into smaller fragments.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 after Al isopropoxide treatment is a more substituted alkene, which upon ozonolysis would form two carbonyls with adjacent CH2 groups.

But I'm not making much progress. Given the time I've spent, I think I should make an educated guess based on the options and the possible structures.

If each H is next to two equivalent Hs, it's a triplet. If next to two different groups of Hs, perhaps a triplet of triplets.

But in the case of ozonolysis producing two carbonyls with a single CH2 in between, each H on the CH2 would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, each CH2's Hs are next to two Hs on the other CH2, leading to triplets.

So the most deshielded H would be a triplet, option A.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The key steps and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C likely results in a dehydrohalogenation reaction. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm for 2H, 2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H, and 1.94 ppm for 2H) suggests a structure with a carbonyl group and adjacent CH₂ groups. A plausible structure for product 1 is an ester or a ketone.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**: Heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide likely introduces a double bond, forming product 2. This step sets up the molecule for ozonolysis in the next step.

3. **Ozonolysis**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups. Product 3 is expected to have carbonyl groups with adjacent CH₂ groups. The most deshielded hydrogen atoms in product 3 would be on CH₂ groups adjacent to carbonyls.

4. **Coupling pattern analysis**: The most deshielded hydrogen atoms in product 3 are on CH₂ groups adjacent to carbonyls. Each hydrogen on these CH₂ groups is coupled with two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group. This results in a splitting pattern of a triplet (n = 2, where n is the number of neighboring hydrogens).

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a triplet.

**Answer: A**
