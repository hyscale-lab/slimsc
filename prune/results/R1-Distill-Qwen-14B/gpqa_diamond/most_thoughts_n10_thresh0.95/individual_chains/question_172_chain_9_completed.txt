Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, and LTE is assumed, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So Boltzmann distribution applies here.

I remember that the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy states. The equation is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So maybe the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

Let me write out the Boltzmann equations for both stars.

For star 1:
R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))

For star 2:
R2 = (g2/g2') * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)) Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, I think in this problem, the energy difference and the statistical weights are the same for both stars because we're comparing the same transition in iron. So g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars. So the ratio g_upper/g_lower is the same for both. That means that the g terms would cancel out when taking the ratio of R1 to R2.

Wait, but in the question, it's about the specific energy levels. So probably the same transition is being considered, meaning the same ΔE and same g ratio. So when I take R1/R2, the g terms would cancel.

So R1 = (g/g') exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
R2 = (g/g') exp(-ΔE/(k T2))
So R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)] ) because when you divide the two, the exponentials subtract.

But wait, R1 = 2 R2, so R1/R2 = 2.

So 2 = exp( [ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)] )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)].

Hmm, so that's ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1). Let me rearrange that.

Wait, wait, let me write it as ln(2) = (ΔE/k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) )

So, which option matches this? Let me look at the options.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Wait, no, let me check the options again.

Option A: ln(2) = T2/T1 → No, that's way off.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) → Doesn't look right.

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2 → Hmm, not matching.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) → So, let's see. Let's manipulate what I have.

I have ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which is equal to (ΔE/k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

So, that's because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, substituting:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But wait, the problem gives that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. But wait, in the options, the left side is ln(2), and the right side is some expression without ΔE. So how does that fit?

Wait, perhaps the options are written in terms of T_1 and T_2. Let me see.

In the equation I have, there's a (ΔE/k) factor. But none of the options include ΔE or k. So perhaps the options have already accounted for that, maybe assuming ΔE/(k) is 1?

Wait, because 1.38e-23 J is the value for ΔE. Let me compute ΔE/k.

ΔE is 1.38e-23 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Ah! So ΔE/k is 1 K.

So substituting into the equation: ln(2) = 1 * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which matches option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D.


The question involves determining the correct equation for the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann distribution applies, and the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_{\text{upper}}\) and \(g_{\text{lower}}\) are the statistical weights, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
R_2 = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Given that \(R_1 = 2 R_2\), dividing the two equations gives:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Substituting \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation or the physical scenario.

**Answer: D**
