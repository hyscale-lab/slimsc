Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. The question is about finding the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space.

The density matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think this represents a mixed state because it's an equal mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩. So each state has an equal probability, right?

I'm trying to remember how density matrices are represented in terms of vectors. I think for a single qubit, the Bloch sphere comes into play. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside. But wait, how does the density matrix translate to a point in this space?

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, r is a vector in 3D space (like coordinates), and σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So if I can express ρ in that form, I can find r.

Expanding it, ρ = (1/2)( [1 0; 0 1] + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz ) which becomes (1/2)( [[1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z]] ) .

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute that. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1, 0],[0, 0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so this is just the identity matrix, and then multiplied by 1/2, so ρ is (1/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]].

Wait, so that's the same as the identity matrix divided by 2. So when I compare this to the general form, (I + r·σ)/2, the term r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So r·σ = 0, which implies that each component of r must be zero, right? Because if I have r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz = 0, then each r must be zero. Because σx, σy, σz are all separate and can't cancel each other unless r is zero.

So that would mean the vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0).

Wait, but wait a second. Is the density matrix ρ in this case a completely mixed state? I think so. A completely mixed state maximally mixed, which would correspond to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the origin. So the point is at (0,0,0).

So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the system has equal probability of being in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in the form:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector in 3D space. Expanding this, the general form of \(\rho\) becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For the given \(\rho\), we compute:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this to the general form, we see that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies \(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\). This means the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere representation, which is the center of the sphere. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
