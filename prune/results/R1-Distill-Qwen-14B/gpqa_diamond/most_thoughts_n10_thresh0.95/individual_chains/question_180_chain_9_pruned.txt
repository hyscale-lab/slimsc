Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me read it again.

Alright, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. The options are given, so I have to calculate and choose the correct one.

Wait, so the system is isolated. That probably means we don't have to consider any external fields or anything else influencing them. So the energy here is the electrostatic potential energy between the charges.

But wait, the problem says 12 are at 2m from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the setup is like this: one charge is at point P, and the other twelve are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 is 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P.

Wait, but all the 12 are at the same distance from P. So the system consists of one charge at the origin, and twelve surrounding it at 2 meters. But wait, are these twelve arranged in some particular configuration? The problem doesn't specify, so I think I have to assume something about their arrangement. Oh, wait, maybe it's a spherical arrangement, like a regular dodecahedron or something? Or perhaps it's a point charge at the center and twelve equally spaced around it in a sphere.

But for the purpose of calculating potential energy, maybe the arrangement doesn't matter because all the charges are equidistant from the central charge. Wait, but the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies between each pair. So the total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs of (k * q_i q_j ) / r_ij.

In this case, since the 13th charge is at P, and the others are all at 2m, the distance between the central charge and any of the 12 is 2m. But what about the distances between the 12 surrounding charges themselves? Since they're at 2m from P, their mutual distances can vary depending on their arrangement. Hmm, but the problem says they're "constrained" to stay at 2m from P. So they can't move closer or further from P, but they can move around as long as their distance from P is 2m. But how does that affect their mutual distances?

Wait, but if the 12 charges are all on a sphere of radius 2m, then the minimum potential energy would involve them being as close as possible to each other, right? Because the potential energy between two charges is k q_i q_j / r. Since they all have the same charge, 2e, which is positive? Wait, wait, 2e—wait, e is the elementary charge, which is positive. So 2e is positive. So if all the 12 are positive, they'd repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy (which, for repelling charges, would be the most negative? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, for two positive charges, the potential energy is positive because their product is positive, and r is positive, so U is positive. So when you have repelling charges, bringing them closer increases the potential energy. So to minimize the potential energy, you want them as far apart as possible. But wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, no. The potential energy between two positive charges is positive. So when you have multiple positive charges, the total potential energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials. Each pair contributes a positive amount. So the more pairs you have with small separation, the higher the potential energy. To minimize the potential energy, you want to arrange the charges so that their mutual distances are as large as possible. Because that would make each term (k q^2 / r) as small as possible, thus making the total sum as small as possible.

Wait, but in this problem, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So their distance from P is fixed. But their mutual distances can vary based on how they're arranged on the sphere of radius 2m. So the arrangement that maximizes the distances between as many pairs as possible would minimize the potential energy. Because each pair contributes (k (2e)^2 ) / r_ij, with r_ij being the distance between any two of the 12 charges.

So if all the 12 charges are equally spaced on the sphere, their average distance would be maximized, leading to the minimum potential energy for the system.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P, so the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is (k (2e)(2e) ) / 2m. So that's 12 times that value.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of all the pairwise interactions. So U = U1 + U2, where U1 is the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, and U2 is the potential energy between each pair of the 12.

So let's compute U1 first. The central charge is 2e, each of the 12 is 2e, and the distance is 2 meters for each. The potential energy for one pair is k * (2e)(2e) / 2. Since there are 12 such pairs, U1 = 12 * (k*(4e²)/(2)).

Wait, let me write that down. So each pair contributes (k * q1 * q2)/r. So q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, r is 2 m. So each is (k * (2e)^2)/2 = (k *4e²)/2 = 2 k e². Then 12 such pairs would be 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, wait, no. Wait, U1 is the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12. So each has a potential energy of (k * (2e)(2e)) / (2 m) = (k *4 e²)/(2) = 2 k e². So 12 of them, so 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e². So U1 = 24 k e².

Then U2 is the potential energy between each pair of the twelve charges. Since each of the twelve is 2e, and their mutual distances vary, but our goal is to find the arrangement that minimizes the total potential energy, which I think is when all the 12 are as far apart as possible on the sphere. Wait, but for twelve points on a sphere, what's the arrangement that maximizes the minimal distance between any two points? That's a well-known problem in geometry. The most symmetrical arrangement for 12 points on a sphere is the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Alternatively, maybe it's the vertices of an icosahedron. But in any case, each pair would have a certain average distance.

Alternatively, perhaps for the sake of this problem, the mutual potential energy of the 12 charges is considered as if they are each at the maximum possible distance from each other, but I'm not sure if that's applicable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the mutual distances are ignored, but I don't think so because the question is about the minimum energy of the entire system, which includes both the central charge's interactions and the 12 charges' mutual interactions.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So they can move on the surface of the sphere with radius 2m centered at P. So their mutual distances can vary, but how does that affect the total potential energy? Since each pair of the 12 contributes a positive term to the potential energy, to minimize the total U, we need to arrange them so that the sum of all these terms is as small as possible. Since each term is positive, making each term as small as possible would minimize the total sum. But for positive terms, making each term small is the same as making each r_ij as large as possible.

So the problem reduces to arranging the 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2m such that as many as possible pairs are as far apart as possible. But how do you compute the sum of all their mutual potential energies?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the 12 charges form a regular icosahedron, which is the configuration where the points are as far apart as possible on a sphere. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to compute U2 as if each charge is at the same distance from each other, but that might not be the case.

Wait, maybe I
