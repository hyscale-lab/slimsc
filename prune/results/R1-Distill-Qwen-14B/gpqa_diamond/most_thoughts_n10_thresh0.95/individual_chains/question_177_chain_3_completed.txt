Hmm, okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about stars and their luminosities. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, so the question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. Interesting, so both radius and mass scale similarly. But the problem is about luminosity, so I guess I don't need to focus on mass right away. 

The astronomers looked at the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, and found they're the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is the same, then T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature. 

Wait, but wait—Wien's Law says λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So same λ_max implies same T. So T1 = T2. That's a crucial point. 

Now, the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But when we're talking about the star's intrinsic properties, like temperature, the observed wavelength shift due to velocity might complicate things. But wait, earlier it said that the "wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So perhaps the measured λ_max is the same, but maybe due to Doppler shift? Or is that not relevant here? 

Wait, maybe the Doppler effect affects the observed wavelength. So if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its wavelengths would be blueshifted. If Star_1 is stationary, its wavelengths are at rest. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max is the same. 

Wait, but the question says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So if Star_2 is moving, the observed λ_max would be different because of the Doppler shift. But the problem states that both stars have the same observed λ_max. Hmm, that might complicate things. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. 

Wait, the problem says the "wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both. But that could mean that the intrinsic temperature must be the same as well? Or maybe not, because the Doppler shift can change the observed wavelength. 

Wait, let's model this. Let’s denote λ_obs as the observed wavelength, and λ_intrinsic as the star's own peak wavelength. The Doppler effect is given by:

λ_obs = λ_intrinsic * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) )

But wait, I might have the formula a bit mixed up. Let me recall the relativistic Doppler shift. For a star moving with radial velocity v (v much less than c), the approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But if v is positive when moving away, then a blueshift would be when approaching, so v is negative. 

Wait, but in this problem, Star_1 has 0 radial velocity, so its observed λ_max is same as its intrinsic λ_max. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let me assume that this is a radial velocity away from us. Or is it towards us? Wait, the problem just says radial velocities are 0 and 700. So Star_2 is moving with a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The direction isn't specified, but perhaps I can proceed without it. 

Wait, but the problem says the observed λ_max is the same. So for Star_2, the observed λ_max is λ_2_obs = λ_2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), assuming v_r is in units where c is incorporated. But maybe it's better to use the non-relativistic approximation. Let's see. 

In non-relativistic Doppler shift, the observed wavelength shift is: 

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

But for redshift, v_r is positive when moving away. If Star_2 is moving away, then its λ_obs would be longer than its intrinsic λ_max. But the problem states that the observed λ_max of both stars is the same. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 must be the same as Star_1's, which is at rest. 

So, let me denote λ_1_obs = λ_1_rest (since v_r1 is 0). And λ_2_obs = λ_2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c). 

But according to the problem, λ_1_obs = λ_2_obs. So:

λ_1_rest = λ_2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But according to Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T. So λ_1_rest = b / T1 and λ_2_rest = b / T2. 

So substituting, (b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b and rearrange:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2 / c )

So T1 = T2 * [1 / (1 + v_r2/c ) ]

But wait, v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let me compute that as a fraction of c. Let me recall that c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 is about 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333. So approximately 0.2333% of the speed of light. 

So in terms of a fraction, v_r2/c ≈ 0.002333. So 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.002333. 

So T1 ≈ T2 * (1 / 1.002333 ) ≈ T2 * 0.99767 . So T1 is slightly less than T2. 

Wait, but this might change the temperature ratio. Because earlier, I thought T1 = T2, but this would mean T1 is lower. But wait, perhaps I got the Doppler shift direction wrong. Because if Star_2 is moving away from us, its observed λ_max is longer, implying lower temperature. But the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both. So perhaps Star_2 must be moving towards us, which would cause a blueshift, making its observed λ_max lower. 

Wait, I think I messed up the sign. Let me clarify: 

If a star is moving towards us with velocity v, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshift). If moving away, longer (redshift). 

The problem states that the observed brightest wavelength (λ_max) is the same for both. So Star_2 must be moving such that its observed λ_max matches that of Star_1. 

So let me write the Doppler equation again. Let me denote v as the velocity of Star_2 relative to us. Let's say v is positive when moving away. 

So λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c ) 

Wait, no, wait: the correct Doppler shift formula for wavelength is: 

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z ), 

where z is the redshift. For a source moving away, z is positive, so λ_obs > λ_rest. For a source moving towards, z is negative, λ_obs < λ_rest. 

But in terms of velocity, another approximation is z = v/c for small velocities. 

So, for Star_2, λ_2_obs = λ_2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But λ_2_obs must equal λ_1_obs. Since Star_1 has v_r1=0, λ_1_obs = λ_1_rest. 

So:

λ_1_rest = λ_2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c )

As before. 

But since λ_rest is proportional to 1/T (Wien's law), this would imply:

λ_1_rest / λ_2_rest = (1 + v_r2/c )

Which is T2 / T1 = (1 + v_r2/c )

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So T2 is higher than T1 because v_r2 is positive (assuming Star_2 is moving away, which would cause a redshift, making λ_obs larger. But then if λ_1_obs is the same as λ_2_obs, the intrinsic λ_2_rest must be smaller since it's being redshifted. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the Doppler shift doesn't affect the temperature ratio because the observed λ_max is the same. Wait, perhaps I should ignore the Doppler shift because the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same, so any Doppler shift must already have been accounted for. So perhaps the actual temperatures of the stars are different, but the observed λ_max is the same. So the intrinsic λ_rest of each star would differ, but their observed λ_obs are same. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the stars' intrinsic (rest) wavelengths are the same, but that seems unlikely because their temperatures might differ. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to think differently. 

The problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same. 

But the stars' intrinsic λ_max (λ_rest) could be different, but because of their motion, their observed λ_max is the same. 

So, the observed λ_max for Star_1 is λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v1=0). 

The observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c ), assuming v_r2 is positive (moving away). 

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs → λ1_rest = λ2_rest (1 + v_r2/c )

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest (1 + v_r2/c )

But according to Wien's law, λ_rest = b/T. 

So, (b/T1) = (b/T2) (1 + v_r2/c )

Canceling b, we get T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So T1 = T2 [ 1 / (1 + v_r2/c ) ]

Which is approximately T2 * (1 - v_r2/c ), using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x. 

But v_r2 is 700 km/s, so v_r2/c ≈ 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333. So, 1/(1+0.002333) ≈ 0.997667. So T1 ≈ T2 * 0.997667. 

So T1 is slightly less than T2. 

But wait, I'm getting into the weeds here. Maybe the problem is assuming that the stars have the same temperature because the observed λ_max is the same. But that would only be true if the Doppler shifts are considered. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that the intrinsic λ_max (rest frame) is the same. But the question isn't entirely clear. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is making an assumption that the stars' temperatures are the same because the observed λ_max is the same, ignoring Doppler effects. But in reality, Doppler would affect the observed λ_max. 

Wait, the problem states that the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max is same, which means that the Doppler effect is taken into account. So the intrinsic λ_rest for each star could be different, but their observed λ_max is same because of their velocities. 

In that case, the temperatures of the stars would be different. Let me compute the ratio of temperatures. 

We have, for Star_1:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For Star_2:

λ2_obs = λ2_rest (1 + v_r2/c )

Since λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest (1 + v_r2/c )

But λ1_rest = b / T1,

λ2_rest = b / T2.

Dividing,

λ1_rest / λ2_rest = (b/T1) / (b/T2) ) = T2 / T1.

So,

T2 / T1 = (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

But then, we can compute the luminosity of each star. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4. So,

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So the ratio L1/L2 is:

(R1² T1^4 ) / (R2² T2^4 )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2,

R1/R2 = 1.5.

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So T1 = T2 * [ 1 / (1 + v_r2/c ) ].

So, T1^4 = T2^4 * [ 1 / (1 + v_r2/c )^4 ]

Putting it all together,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * [ T2^4 / (1 + v_r2/c )^4 ] ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

Wait, no, let me write it correctly. 

Wait, R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

Then,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4

Substituting,

= (1.5)^2 * ( [1 / (1 + v_r2/c ) ] )^4 

= (2.25) * (1/(1 + v_r2/c ))^4 

Now, v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute (1 + v_r2/c ) ≈ 1 + (700 / 3e5) = 1 + 0.0023333 ≈ 1.0023333.

So, [1/(1.0023333)]^4 ≈ (approx 0.99767)^4.

Let me compute (0.99767)^4.

Compute 0.99767^2 first: approx (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00233) + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.9953454. 

Then square that for the fourth power: (0.9953454)^2 ≈ (approx 0.99075). 

Wait, more accurately:

0.99767^2 = (approx) (1 - 0.00233)^2 = 1 - 2(0.00233) + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 0.99534.

Then 0.99534^2: let's compute 0.99534 * 0.99534.

Hmm, 0.995 * 0.995 = 0.990025. But since it's 0.99534, which is 0.00034 more than 0.995. 

So,

(0.995 + 0.00034)^2 = (0.995)^2 + 2*(0.995)*(0.00034) + (0.00034)^2 

= 0.990025 + 0.0006667 + 0.0000001156 ≈ 0.9906918. 

So approximately 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Compute 2.25 * 0.9907:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So total ≈ 2.2275 + 0.001575 ≈ 2.229075. 

Wait, that's about 2.229. But looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, and option A is ~2.25. So 2.23 is option D. 

Wait, but wait. Wait, did I make a mistake in the exponent? Let me double-check my calculations. 

Wait, [T1/T2]^4 = [1/(1 + v/c)]^4. So v_r2 is 700 km/s, v_r2/c = 700/(3e5) = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/300 = approx 0.023333. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 3e5 is 300,000 km/s. So 700 divided by 300,000 is 700/3e5 = 7/(3e3) = 0.0023333. So 0.2333% of c. 

So 1 + v/c = 1.0023333. So 1/(1.0023333) = approx 0.997667. 

So (0.997667)^4.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it with more precision.

Let me compute (1/(1.002333))^4.

Alternatively, compute ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.0023285. So ln(1.002333^4) =4 * 0.0023285 = 0.009314.

So e^(-0.009314) = approx 1 - 0.009314 + (0.009314)^2/2 - ... 

Approximately, e^-0.009314 ≈ 0.9907.

So back to calculation:

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.9907) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

So approximately 2.23, which is option D. 

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the Doppler shift more accurately. Let me see. 

Wait, let me think again. We have L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We have R1/R2 = 1.5.

T1 = T2/(1 + v_r2/c )

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * [1/(1 + v_r2/c )]^4.

Wait, but v_r2 is 700 km/s. So 700 / (3e5) = 0.0023333.

So 1 + v/c = 1.0023333.

So [1/1.0023333]^4 ≈ [0.997667]^4.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (1.0023333)^4 first, then take reciprocal.

(1.0023333)^4 ≈ (1 + 4*0.0023333 + 6*(0.0023333)^2 + ... )

But for small x, x=0.0023333,

(1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 +4x + 6x² +4x³ +x⁴.

Compute each term:

4x = 4*(0.0023333) = 0.0093332.

6x² =6*(0.0023333)^2 =6*(0.000005444)= ~0.00003266.

4x³=4*(0.0023333)^3=4*(0.00000001266)= ~0.0000000506.

x^4= (0.0023333)^4≈ 0.0000000003.

So summing these:

1 + 0.0093332 + 0.00003266 + 0.0000000506 + 0.0000000003 ≈ 1.0093659.

So (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.0093659.

So [1/(1.0023333)]^4 = 1/(1.0093659) ≈ 0.9907.

So same as before.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.23.

Thus, the correct answer is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the given data:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5R_2 \), where \( R_2 \) is the radius of Star_2.
   - The observed wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same.
   - Star_1 has a radial velocity of \( v_{r1} = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), while Star_2 has \( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).

2. **Wien's Law and Temperature**:
   - Wien's law states \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) is the peak wavelength and \( T \) is the temperature.
   - Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is the same for both stars, the Doppler shift must be accounted for. The observed wavelength is related to the intrinsic wavelength by:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c)
     \]
     For Star_1 (\( v_{r1} = 0 \)), \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{1,\text{rest}} \). For Star_2 (\( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)), \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v_{r2}/c) \).
   - Equating the observed wavelengths:
     \[
     \lambda_{1,\text{rest}} = \lambda_{2,\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + v_{r2}/c)
     \]
   - Using \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T \), we find:
     \[
     T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + v_{r2}/c}
     \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
     \[
     L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
   - The ratio of luminosities is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
     \]
   - Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5R_2 \) and \( T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + v_{r2}/c} \):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}\right)^4
     \]

4. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - \( v_{r2}/c = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333 \), so \( 1 + v_{r2}/c \approx 1.002333 \).
   - \( \frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c} \approx 0.997667 \), and raising this to the fourth power:
     \[
     \left(\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}\right)^4 \approx 0.9907
     \]
   - Substituting into the luminosity ratio:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.23
     \]

Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.

**Answer: D**
