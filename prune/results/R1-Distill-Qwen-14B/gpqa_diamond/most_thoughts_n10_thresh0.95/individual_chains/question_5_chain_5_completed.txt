Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Alright, let's break this down. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator along direction n.

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary but in the x-z plane. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Because it's in the x-z plane, the phi angle (azimuthal) should be zero, right? So the direction is along θ in x-z.

The operator P is given in terms of its components. So the operator along direction n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction's components. That is, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So P = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z.

I need to write out these matrices. Let me recall:

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. So matrix:
[ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So:
[ [0, -iħ/2], [iħ/2, 0] ]

Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So:
[ [ħ/2, 0], [0, -ħ/2] ]

So now, P = sinθ * Px + cosθ * Pz.

Let me compute that. Let me factor out ħ/2 since all terms have it.

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So combining the matrices:

The (1,1) element is cosθ*(1) + sinθ*(0) = cosθ.

The (1,2) element is sinθ*(1) + cosθ*(0) = sinθ.

Similarly, (2,1) is sinθ*(1), (2,2) is cosθ*(-1) → -cosθ.

Wait, wait, let me write it more clearly.

The matrix becomes:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

But all multiplied by ħ/2.

So the entire matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by the above.

Our goal is to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Since the operator is hermitian, its eigenvectors should be orthogonal and can be normalized.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

Which is equivalent to (P - (+ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0.

So let me write the matrix P - (ħ/2) I.

Each element:

(1,1): cosθ * (ħ/2) - (ħ/2) → (ħ/2)(cosθ -1)

(1,2): (ħ/2) sinθ

(2,1): (ħ/2) sinθ

(2,2): (-cosθ)(ħ/2) - (ħ/2) → (ħ/2)( -cosθ -1 )

But since we're dealing with homogeneous equations, perhaps I can factor out (ħ/2) from all elements. So the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ -1, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ] |ψ> = 0

Which simplifies, since (ħ/2) isn't zero, to:

[cosθ -1, sinθ;
 sinθ, -cosθ -1] |ψ> = 0.

So the system of equations is:

( cosθ - 1 ) a + sinθ * b = 0

sinθ * a + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0

Where a and b are the components of the eigenvector |ψ> = [a, b]^T.

Let me write these equations:

Equation (1): (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

Equation (2): sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

I can solve these for a and b.

From equation (1):

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ b ] / (cosθ - 1 )

Let me compute that denominator: cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2) [using the identity cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(θ/2) ]

So denominator is -2 sin²(θ/2). So,

a = [ - sinθ b ] / ( -2 sin²(θ/2) ) → a = [ sinθ ] / (2 sin²(θ/2) ) * b.

But sinθ is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ] * b → a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b → a = cot(θ/2) * b.

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Alternatively, we can express the ratio a/b = cot(θ/2).

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ a, b ] = [ cot(θ/2) * b, b ].

We can factor out b: [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize.

Compute the magnitude squared: (cot(θ/2))^2 + 1 = (cos²(θ/2)/sin²(θ/2)) + 1 = [ cos² + sin² ] / sin² → 1/sin²(θ/2).

So the normalization factor is sin(θ/2), because the magnitude is 1/sin(θ/2), so multiply each component by sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, let me check that. Let me substitute a = cot(θ/2) * b.

So, a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b.

So, the vector is [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) * b, b ].

If we choose b = sin(θ/2), then a becomes cos(θ/2). So the vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Yes, that makes sense. So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I think that for the spin-½ systems, the eigenstates for spin along direction n are given by these spherical harmonics or something. But perhaps I should double-check the signs.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is (P - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0.

But in the process, we found that the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but what about the phase? Because sometimes in quantum mechanics, the phase can vary, but the most common choice is to take the positive phases.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). But let me look at the options again.

Option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So that would match.

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the eigenvector is to be normalized. So the elements of the normalized eigenvector are these.

Wait, but wait—the options have options with hbar factors. Let me check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but the eigenvectors are dimensionless, because the operator is in units of ħ/2. So the normalization is just that. So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)), which includes hbar factors. Hmm, that's confusing because the eigenvectors are just vectors without units of ħ.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me double-check the way the operator was given.

Wait, the operator P is given as, for example, Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the operator is in units of ħ. So when we find the eigenvalue, it's in terms of ħ.

Wait, but the eigenvectors are vectors in a Hilbert space, which are dimensionless. So the components shouldn't have units of ħ. So options A and D have factors of ħ, which can't be right. So those options are incorrect.

So options B and C have the right structure. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is a standard spherical coordinate parametrization, but perhaps in this case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so e^{i phi} is 1. So the vector becomes (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which for a spin-½ system would be the same as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) when considering the spin-up state.

Wait, no. Because for spin-½ systems, the eigenvectors are given in terms of theta and phi as:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |up> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |down>

So in this case, phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So the vector becomes cos(theta/2) |up> + sin(theta/2) |down>.

Which would be exactly option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the correct answer is option C.

But wait, let me look back at the system equations I solved. The equations after substitution led me to a = cot(theta/2) * b.

And the normalized vector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So that's correct.

So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ along the direction $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and using the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, we find:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
Thus:
\[
\vec{P} = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle
\]
Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2}I$ from $\vec{P}$, the eigenvalue equation becomes:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0
\]
where $a$ and $b$ are the components of the eigenvector $|\psi\rangle = [a, b]^T$. Solving the system of equations, we find the relationship between $a$ and $b$:
\[
a = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b
\]
The eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
[a, b] = \left[\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right]
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The normalized eigenvector is:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: Includes factors of $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents a general spherical coordinate parametrization, but it includes a phase factor $e^{i\phi}$, which is not relevant here since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane (i.e., $\phi = 0$). This simplifies to $(\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$, which does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D**: Includes factors of $\hbar$ and additional coefficients $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the derived eigenvector.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
