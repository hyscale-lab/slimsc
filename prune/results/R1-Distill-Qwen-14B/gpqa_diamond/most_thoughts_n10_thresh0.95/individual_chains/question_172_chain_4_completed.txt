Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the problem again. 

The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're assuming the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can use the relevant equations from that context.

Hmm, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula, I think, is n2/n1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, wait. The problem states that star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So if I take n1 as the population in the excited state and n2 as the ground state, then n1/n2 would be 2. Or wait, maybe the other way around? Let me think. Oh, wait no, the ratio depends on how you define it. The question says that the excited level in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So, for star 1, the ratio of excited to ground is higher. 

Let me define it carefully. Let’s say for each star, the ratio of the excited state (n_e) to the ground state (n_g) is given. So for star 1, n_e1 / n_g1 = 2 * (n_e2 / n_g2). Because star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. Or wait, the problem says that the excited atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps n1 = 2 n2, where n is the population in the excited state. 

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of populations for the excited level relative to the ground level is different. Let me think: the Boltzmann factor is (n_upper / n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So if star_1 has twice as many atoms in the excited state compared to star_2, then (n_e1 / n_g1) = 2 * (n_e2 / n_g2). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe another way: the excitation is higher, so the ratio n_e/n_g is higher. So for star 1, this ratio is higher than that of star 2.

Let me write the equations for both stars. For star 1, (n_e1 / n_g1) = exp(-E/(k T1)), and for star 2, (n_e2 / n_g2) = exp(-E/(k T2)). Since E is the same for both (same energy difference), but T is different.

But the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Oh wait, wait. The exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So does that mean n_e1 = 2 n_e2? Or does it mean (n_e1 / n_g1) = 2 (n_e2 / n_g2)? Because "twice as excited" could imply that the number of excited atoms is twice as much, so n_e1 = 2 n_e2. But that would depend on the total number of atoms, which we don't know. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation ratio is twice as high, so n_e1/n_g1 = 2 (n_e2/n_g2). 

Wait, I think it's more likely that the ratio of the excited state to ground state is higher in star_1. So, (n_e1 / n_g1) = 2 * (n_e2 / n_g2). Because if star_1 has a higher temperature, the excitation is more, so more atoms are in the higher energy level.

So let's write the equations:

For star 1:
n_e1/n_g1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = R1

For star 2:
n_e2/n_g2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = R2

Given that R1 = 2 R2.

So now, R1 = 2 R2.

Taking the ratio, R1/R2 = 2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ]

Wait, let me compute that ratio:

R1/R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )
= exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )
= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Set that equal to 2:

exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

(ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, but wait, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is equal to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me compute:

1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

We can rearrange this as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE.

Wait, but I don't have the actual values to plug in. But looking at the options, let's see which equation matches.

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but from our equation:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So, (ΔE/(k)) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

But without knowing ΔE and k, we can't directly write ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) because that term would have a factor of ΔE/k.

Wait, so perhaps this approach isn't correct. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the ratios.

Alternative approach: Let's consider the Boltzmann factor for each star.

For star 1: n_e1 / n_g1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = ratio1.

For star 2: n_e2 / n_g2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = ratio2.

The problem states that star_1's excitation is twice star_2's. So, ratio1 = 2 * ratio2.

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) = - ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2)

Rearrange:

ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) = - ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] = - ln(2)

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

Which is the same as before.

Again, 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2).

But the options don't have ΔE or k. So perhaps we can express T1 in terms of T2 or vice versa.

Wait, but the question is about which equation is correct for the effective temperatures. So the equation we derived is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (ln(2) * k) / ΔE.

But since the options don't include any constants, perhaps the question is expecting us to write this in terms of the equation without the ΔE and k, which would only be the case if ΔE/(k) is a specific value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another approach: considering that the excitation is twice as much, perhaps n_e1 = 2 n_e2. But the problem states that the excitation (n_e) is twice as much, so n_e1 = 2 n_e2.

Wait, but n_e is proportional to (g_e / g_g) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). Assuming the same g (degeneracy) for both stars, then n_e1/n_e2 = exp( ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) -1/(T1) ] ).

Wait, but if n_e1 = 2 n_e2, then:

n_e1 / n_e2 = 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Taking ln:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which, again, leads us to the same equation as before.

But it's unclear how this leads to any of the options because the options don't have ΔE or k. So perhaps the question expects us to neglect the energy difference or treat it as a given, thus allowing us to express the temperatures' relation.

Wait, but the energy difference ΔE is given. Let me compute what (ΔE/k) is.

ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, that's interesting. Let me calculate ΔE divided by k.

ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wow, so ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting back into our earlier equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which becomes:

ln(2) = 1 * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is the same as option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me check: 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ). So if that's positive, then ln(2) is positive. But in our equation, it's equal to ln(2) equals (ΔE/k) times (1/T2 - 1/T1 ), which would be (ΔE/k)(1/T2 -1/T1 ) equals ln(2).

Wait, but because ΔE is positive, and for the ratio to be positive, (1/T2 -1/T1) must be positive, which would imply that 1/T2 > 1/T1 → T2 < T1. So star_1 is hotter than star_2.

So, substituting ΔE/k =1, equation becomes ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) *1.

Which is ln(2) = (1/T2 -1/T1 ).

Wait, but that's (1/T2 -1/T1 ) = ln(2) → 1/T2 -1/T1 = ln(2). Rearranged, this is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2), which is exactly option D.

So the correct equation is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but let me check the options. Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ). That's exactly what we have.

So yes, option D is the correct equation.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars.

In LTE, the distribution of particles between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{excited}}}{n_{\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( n_{\text{excited}} \) and \( n_{\text{ground}} \) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excited to ground state populations are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{excited,1}}}{n_{\text{ground,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{excited,2}}}{n_{\text{ground,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{excited,1}}}{n_{\text{ground,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{excited,2}}}{n_{\text{ground,2}}}.
\]

Taking the ratio of the Boltzmann factors:

\[
\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)} = 2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Using the identity \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
