--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully and then break it down.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. When X reacts with liquid Y, it releases a gas W. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B under normal conditions is very close to 277 K. 

Another part mentions that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Additionally, Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's start by considering each part of the reaction.

First, the reaction of X with liquid Y produces gas W. Since W's molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons, perhaps it's CO2 or H2O? Wait, CO2 has 12 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (each with 8 protons and 8 neutrons), but the molecule has 12 protons and 16 neutrons? No, wait, each molecule's total protons and neutrons. Let me think: the molecule's protons (atomic number) sum and neutrons (nucleus) sum must be equal.

Wait, maybe W is H2O? H2O has 2 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2*1 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 2*0 + 8 = 8. Oh, that's not equal. So that can't be.

Another possibility is NH3? No, wait. Let me think of another molecule. What if W is CH4? No, that's 1 C (6p, 6n) and 4 H (1p each, 0n). So total protons: 6 +4=10. Neutrons:6+0=6. Not equal.

Wait, maybe it's a molecule where each atom contributes equally. Like O2? No, O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons (each O is 8p,8n), so total protons 16, neutrons 16*2=32? No, wait, the molecule as a whole. Wait, maybe O2 has two atoms each with 8p and 8n. So total protons: 16, total neutrons: 16. So 16 each. Oh wait, that's equal. So the molecule O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So same number. That could be W. But O2 is a gas, yes. Alternatively, maybe it's another diatomic molecule like N2? Let me check: N has 7p and 7n. Two N atoms would give 14p and 14n. So 14 each. That also fits.

Wait, but the reaction between X and Y could be a common one. What if X is an alkali metal, like Na or K? Because they react violently with water (Y could be H2O). So when Na reacts with water, it produces NaOH, H2, and heat. Oh wait, but the gas W in this case would be H2. Wait, H2's molecule: 2 H atoms, each with 1p and 0n. So total protons: 2, neutrons: 0. Not equal. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe O2 is not the right gas.

Wait, what if the gas is NH3? No, because NH3 is a liquid at certain temps, but perhaps it's not relevant here. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. Water's melting point is 273 K (0°C), and 277 is just a bit above, so maybe B is something that melts just above 0°C. Or perhaps it's a solid that sublimates or something. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. So a substance that's solid at that temp. Maybe B is a metal, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about the product of the reaction between a keto acid and Substance X. The product contains 2 oxygen atoms. So if X is an alkali metal (like Na, K), and the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), reacting with X would produce a salt. For acetic acid, the reaction with Na would produce Na acetate (CH3COO−Na+), which has acetate ions. The acetate ion has two oxygen atoms. So that fits. So the product has 2 O atoms, which matches the statement.

So if X is an alkali metal, perhaps sodium (Na) or potassium (K). Now, the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X is a metal which has an isotope that's heavier. For example, Na has isotopes like Na-23 (most common, 11p,12n), Na-24 (11p,13n), Na-25 (11p,14n). So heavier isotopes would be Na-25, which is rare.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Li, which has isotopes like Li-7 and Li-6. Wait, but the heavier isotope would be Li-11? No, wait, Li usually has isotopes up to Li-8 or so. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but the problem says X is a substance known for incorporating a heavier isotope. Maybe it's Cl? Chlorine has Cl-35 and Cl-37 as main isotopes. But Cl usually doesn't react violently with a liquid Y. Alternatively, perhaps X is Na, and Y is water.

Wait, the reaction between Na and water is indeed violent, producing NaOH, H2, and heat. But in this case, the gas W would be H2. Let me check again about the number of protons and neutrons. H2 has two H atoms, so total protons: 2, neutrons: 0. Not equal. So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe gas W is another product. Let me think of another reaction. What if Y is another liquid, like an acid? For instance, if Y is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), and X is a metal like Zn. But then gas W could be H2 again, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of HCl, and X is a metal. But again, H2 would be the gas, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between X and a carbonate. For example, if Y is CO3^2- solution. Then, maybe the gas is CO2. Let's check: CO2 has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (each 8p, 8n). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Total neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. So 22 each, which matches the condition. That would make W CO2. 

So if X reacts with a carbonate solution (Y), releasing CO2 gas (W). That could happen if X is a strong reducing agent. For example, if X is a metal that reduces carbonate to CO2. Wait, but metals typically react with carbonate under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe X is a strong base, but that's less likely to produce CO2.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a different substance. Let me think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B which has a melting point near 277 K. So if G is a carbonate, when heated, it might decompose. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) decomposes upon heating to Na2O and CO2. But the B product here would be Na2O, which is a solid. Sodium oxide has a melting point of about 1462°C, not near 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: G is a hydroxide that, upon heating, loses water. For example, if G is copper hydroxide, heating it would release water. But then B would be the oxide. But copper's melting point is much higher.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal. Let me think of B's properties. It's a solid with a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. So the melting point is just above 0°C. What metal has a melting point around there? Hmm, mercury has a melting point around -39°C. Gallium's melting point is about 29.8°C. Oh, that's close to 277 K (which is 4°C). Wait, no, 277 K is 4°C. Gallium melts at around 30°C. Close, but not exactly 277 K. Alternatively, maybe it's indium, which has a melting point of about 156°C. No, that's way higher.

Wait, maybe B isn't a metal. Perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid that sublimates, like dry ice (CO2). No, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe B is a hydroxide that's dehydrating. Hmm...

Wait, perhaps I should think about the precipitate G. If X is a metal and Y is a salt solution, then G could be a precipitated metal hydroxide. For example, if X is Na and Y is a copper(II) sulfate solution, then Na would react, perhaps producing Cu(OH)2 as a precipitate. But then, heating Cu(OH)2 would produce CuO and water. But the melting point of CuO is much higher, around 2285°C. That doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, upon heating, releases B. Maybe G is a carbonate, and B is a metal oxide. So if G is MgCO3, heating would release CO2 and leave MgO. But MgO's melting point is about 2800°C, which is way higher.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. Heating sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B could be Na2CO3, but that's solid and has a much higher melting point.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.

Since the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X has 2 oxygen atoms, perhaps the product is a salt where the anion has two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is acetic acid (CH3COOH), reacting with X (a metal) would produce CH3COO−X+. The acetate ion has two oxygen atoms in the COO− part, so that fits. So X is likely a metal, like sodium or potassium.

Now, considering that X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So Na has isotopes like Na-23 (most common), Na-24, Na-25. So if X is Na, then it's possible it's using a heavier isotope. Alternatively, perhaps X is Cl, but Cl wouldn't react as violently with a liquid as Na does.

Wait, another possibility: X is an alkali metal. Let's say sodium (Na). So when Na reacts with water (Y), it produces NaOH, H2, and heat. But earlier, the gas W was H2, which doesn't fit the neutron and proton count. So maybe Y isn't water but another liquid.

Wait, perhaps Y is an acid, like H2SO4. Then, the reaction would produce SO2 or another gas. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a salt solution, like a carbonate. Let me think again about CO2 as the gas.

Wait, what if Y is a carbonate solution, like sodium carbonate. Then, adding X (maybe a metal) could cause a reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of HCl, and X is a metal. The reaction would produce H2 gas. But again, H2 doesn't fit the condition.

Hmm. Let me think about the gas W again. So W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Another possibility is CH4: C has 6p, 6n. H has 1p, 0n. So CH4: 6 + 4*1 = 10 protons, 6 + 0 = 6 neutrons. No, not equal. So no.

Wait, what if W is CO? Carbon monoxide. C has 6p, 6n. O has 8p, 8n. So CO's molecule: 6+8=14 protons, 6+8=14 neutrons. So 14 each. That fits! So W is CO. Now, is CO a gas produced in some reaction between a metal and a liquid?

Wait, but how would a metal and a liquid produce CO? Maybe if Y is a carbonate solution and X is a metal that's a reducing agent, like zinc. Then, the reaction might produce CO. Let me think: Zn reacting with sodium carbonate. Not sure, but perhaps under certain conditions, heating or something.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal and Y is a solution containing something else, like a nitrate. Maybe the reaction produces CO if a carbonate is formed and then decomposed. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: the precipitate G is formed when X reacts with Y. If Y is a solution of a salt that forms a precipitate with X. For example, if Y is a solution of a sulfate and X is a metal that produces a less soluble sulfate, but that's more about solubility rules. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with a solution of a metal salt, causing a precipitate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the melting point of B. If B's melting point is about 277 K (4°C), what could that be? Maybe a solid that's just above the freezing point of water. Or perhaps a solid that's a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point around 277 K. Wait, is that true? I'm not certain, but let me check. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like sodium bicarbonate, which decomposes upon heating but maybe the residue has a lower melting point.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Wait, another thought: if G is a carbonate such as Na2CO3·10H2O, heating it would remove water, and the anhydrous Na2CO3 would remain. But the melting point of Na2CO3 is about 830°C, so that's way higher than 277 K.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydroxide. For example, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) has a melting point of about 1390°C. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Maybe it's something like ammonium chloride, but that's a different scenario.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of the elements in X. Since X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry along with its analog, perhaps X is an alkali metal like Na or K, or perhaps it's something else like Li. These metals are used as reagents in various organic reactions, like in Grignard reagents or as bases.

If X is a metal, then the elements in X would be the metal and perhaps another element if it's a compound. But in the first part, X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So if X is a metal, it's a pure element, so it has isotopes. So in that case, X is a single element, and the cumulative atomic masses would be the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes present.

Wait, the question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". Wait, no, perhaps it's the lightest and heaviest isotopes within the elements in X.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: if X is Na, then the lightest isotope is Na-23 (mass 23), and the heaviest is Na-25 (mass 25). The sum would be 23 +25=48, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, so maybe X isn't Na.

Alternatively, perhaps X is potassium (K). K has isotopes like K-39 (lightest), K-40, K-41 (heaviest). So 39 +41=80, which is also not an option.

Wait, but the options given are 35, 25, 31, 29. So maybe the sum is 25, which is option B. But 25 could be from, say, 12 (carbon) +13 (another isotope), but that depends on the element.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is not a metal but a compound. For example, perhaps it's a compound like sodium borohydride (NaBH4), but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the initial reaction. If the gas W is CO, and the reaction produces a precipitate G which, when heated, gives B with a melting point near 277 K, perhaps the precipitate is a carbonate. For example, if X is a metal that reacts with a carbonate solution to form a metal carbonate precipitate, which upon heating gives the metal oxide and CO2.

But then, B would be a metal oxide. Let's say X is Mg. Mg reacts with sodium carbonate (if Y is a solution) to form MgCO3. Upon heating, MgCO3 decomposes into MgO and CO2. The melting point of MgO is around 2800°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different oxide. Wait, maybe B is a hydrated oxide or something. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound altogether.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the cumulative atomic masses. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. So perhaps the lightest and heaviest elements in X have atomic masses adding to one of these.

If X is something like Cl, then the isotopes are Cl-35 and Cl-37. So 35+37=72, which isn't an option. So that can't be.

Wait, what if X is a compound with two elements, one of which has light and heavy isotopes. For example, O and Cl in OClO (hypochlorous acid?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule like NH4Cl, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a base that neutralizes the acid, producing a salt with 2 oxygen atoms in the anion. For example, if X is NaOH and the acid is HCOOH (formic acid), then the salt would be NaHCOO, where the bicarbonate ion has two oxygen atoms? Wait, bicarbonate is HCO3−, which has three O. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, if the acid is H2SO4, but that's a strong acid and would produce SO4^2-.

Wait, maybe the acid is H2CO3 (carbonic acid). Reacting with X (a base like NaOH) would produce Na2CO3, which has three oxygen per carbonate ion. So that doesn't fit the 2 O atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the acid is a ketone-derived acid, like CH3COOH (acetic acid). Reacting with X (Na) would produce CH3COO−Na+, which has two oxygen in the acetate ion (O2). So yes, that fits.

So X is sodium. Now, sodium has isotopes. Sodium-23 (mass 23), sodium-24 (mass 24), sodium-25 (mass 25). So the lightest and heaviest isotopes would be 23 and 25. Their sum is 23 +25=48, which is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says to sum all the lighter and heavier isotopes present. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. It says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, perhaps X is a compound containing two elements, each with their own isotopes. So the lightest and heaviest would refer to the elements (atomic numbers) in X. For example, if X is NaCl, then the elements are Na (atomic number 11) and Cl (17). The lightest would be Na, heaviest Cl. Their atomic masses would be about 23 (Na) and 35.5 (Cl). Summing 23 +35.5=58.5, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule with two different elements, each contributing their own isotopes. Let me think of another compound.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let me think about the reaction again. If X reacts with Y to produce CO (gas W). So perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a carbonate solution, producing CO. Let's say X is a metal like Zn.

Zn reacts with Na2CO3. The reaction equation would be: Zn + Na2CO3 + H2O → ZnCO3 + 2NaOH + CO↑. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact reaction. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces CO gas.

In that case, X would be Zn, which has isotopes. The lightest isotope of Zn is Zn-64 (mass 64), and the heaviest is Zn-70 (mass 70). Sum is 64+70=134, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the options again. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

If the sum of lightest and heaviest atomic masses is one of these, maybe the elements are lighter elements. Let's see: for example, Carbon and Oxygen. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the elements in X are H and O. For example, if X is H2O. But then the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope, which would be in the hydrogen part (like D in H2O-D). But H2O is a liquid, and reacting with another liquid Y might not fit the scenario. Plus, the product with a keto acid would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with two elements, each with their own isotopes. So the lightest element is hydrogen (H) and the heaviest is, say, Cl. But again, their sum is 1 +35.5=36.5, which is close to option A (35), but not exact.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a diatomic molecule. For example, maybe X is Cl2, but it's a heavy element and wouldn't react violently with a liquid to produce CO. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating and should think of X as a halogen. For example, Cl2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements that have lightest and heaviest isotopes adding to an option value. Let's see: 25 is option B. So possible pairs could be 12 (C) and13 (Al?), but 12+13=25. Or 10 (Ne) and 15 (P), but 10+15=25. Wait, 10 is Ne, 15 is phosphorus. So Ne and P. Does X have these elements? Not sure.

Alternatively, 11 (Na) +14 (Si)=25. Hmm. But I don't see how X would be Na and Si.

Wait, maybe X is a molecule like SiH4. Then the elements are Si and H. The lightest element is H (mass 1), heaviest is Si (mass 28). 1+28=29, which is option D. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are C and O. 12 +16=28, not an option. Hmm.

This is getting tricky. Let me try to summarize what I have so far.

- X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W (same protons and neutrons in molecule: perhaps CO).
- The precipitate G, when heated, gives B with a melting point near 277 K (~4°C).
- X reacts with a keto acid to form a product with 2 O atoms, likely an acetate, so X is likely Na.
- X has a heavier isotope, so the sum of lightest and heaviest isotopes in X's elements.

If X is Na, the lightest isotope is Na-23 (mass 23), heaviest Na-25 (mass 25). Sum is 23+25=48, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm wrong about X being Na.

Alternative approach: Maybe X is a diatomic molecule of a gas. For example, O2. Then, the elements in X are O, which has isotopes O-16 and O-18. 16 +18=34, which isn't an option. Alternatively, Cl2: Cl-35 and Cl-37. 35+37=72, not an option.

Wait, another idea: perhaps X is a molecule like NO. Then, the elements are N and O. Their lightest isotopes are N-14 (14) and O-16 (16). Sum is 14+16=30, not an option. Alternatively, N-15 (15) and O-18 (18). 15+18=33, which is also not an option.

Hmm, perhaps X is a molecule with elements where the lightest is 12 (C) and heaviest is 13 (Al). Sum 25, which is option B.

Wait, but I don't see how that would fit the reaction scenario. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like CH3Cl, but again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule with elements where the sum is 29. For example, 12 (C) +17 (Cl)=29. But I don't see how that fits.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, upon heating, releases B with a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is 4°C. What solid has a melting point around 4°C? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate, which has a melting point of about 169°C. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrate that melts at that temperature. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate melts at around 277 K. Wait, I think that's right. Sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point of approximately 277 K (4°C). So if B is the anhydrous Na2CO3, which has a higher melting point, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps B is the decahydrate, which would be solid at 277 K.

Wait, but earlier, G is the precipitate, which upon heating releases B. So perhaps G is Na2CO3·10H2O, and heating it would remove water, leaving anhydrous Na2CO3. But then, B would be Na2CO3, which has a much higher melting point. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is the water of crystallization. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is the gas released when G is heated. For example, if G is a carbonate hydrate, heating it would release water. But then B would be H2O, which has a melting point of 273 K. Oh! 273 K is 0°C, and the question says it's very close to 277 K (4°C). So perhaps B is water? But water's melting point is 273 K, which is just 4 K less than 277 K. So that could fit.

But wait, water is a liquid at 277 K, not a solid. So if B is water, it wouldn't be a solid with a melting point near 277 K. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a different compound. Maybe B is a solid with a melting point near 4°C, like certain hydrates. For example, sodium acetate trihydrate has a melting point of about 277 K (4°C). So if G is sodium acetate trihydrate, heating it would dehydrate it, releasing water vapor. Then B would be the anhydrous sodium acetate, which has a higher melting point. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different product. Maybe the precipitate G is something like copper(II) hydroxide, which upon heating becomes copper(II) oxide and water. But CuO has a high melting point.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think of the elements in X. The sum of the lightest and heaviest element's atomic masses in X is one of the options.

If the options are 25, 29, 31, 35, perhaps X contains elements with atomic masses adding to one of these.

For example, if X contains C (12) and O (16), sum is 28, not an option. C and N: 12 +14=26, not an option. Maybe O (16) and F (19): 35, which is option A. So if X has O and F, their sum is 35. But how would that fit?

Alternatively, if X has Cl (35.5) and another element with mass about 35.5 - option would need to be 35, which is close. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: what if X is a compound like HCl? Then, the elements are H and Cl. H's lightest isotope is 1, Cl's heaviest is 37. So 1 +37=38, not an option. Alternatively, if X is Cl2, then sum is 35.5*2=71, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule like O2 or N2. O2: 16 +16=32, not an option. N2:14 +14=28, nope.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a diatomic molecule where the elements have atomic numbers adding to an option. For example, O (8) and F (9): sum 17, which isn't an option. Alternatively, N (7) and O (8): sum 15, not an option.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the possible answers. The options are 35,25,31,29.

If X is Cl, which has a heavier isotope (Cl-37), but the sum would be 35.5+37=72.5, which isn't an option. So perhaps that's not the case.

Another approach: perhaps X is a compound with elements where the lightest is 12 (C) and the heaviest is 13 (Al). Sum 25, which is option B.

Alternatively, the lightest is 1 (H) and the heaviest is 24 (Cr). Sum 25. So if X contains H and Cr, sum is 25. But I'm not sure how that fits.

Wait, perhaps X is something like HCl, which contains H and Cl. H's lightest is 1, Cl's heaviest is 37. Sum 1+37=38, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with O and F. O's lightest is 16, F's heaviest is 19. 16+19=35, which is option A.

Hmm, 35 is an option. So perhaps X contains O and F.

But how would that fit into the reaction scenario? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is Cl, but that doesn't fit with O.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the elements whose atomic masses add up to one of the options. For example, 25 could be 12 (C) +13 (Al), but that's 25. Alternatively, 11 (Na) +14 (Si)=25. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: 12 (C) +13 (Al)=25. So if X is a compound of C and Al. But I'm not sure how that would fit into the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the elements are Ne (20) and another element with 5. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should give up and make an educated guess based on the options. Considering that the correct answer is likely option C) 31, or option D) 29.

Wait, another thought: if X is a metal like Mg, which has isotopes Mg-24, Mg-25, Mg-26. So lightest is 24, heaviest 26. Sum is 50. Not an option.

Wait, another approach: the substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, along with its analog. Common reagents include Na (sodium), K (potassium), Li (lithium), or perhaps something like DMSO. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: the reaction between X and a keto acid produces a product with two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is acetate (CH3COO−), which has two O's. So X is Na, as discussed earlier.

But earlier that led to a sum of 48, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the elements in X are not just the metal but another element as well. For example, X could be NaOH, which has Na, O, H. So the lightest element would be H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Not an option.

Alternatively, X could be something like Na2O. Then elements are Na and O. Na's lightest is 23, O's heaviest is 18 (O-18). Sum 41. Not an option.

Alternatively, X is a compound with two elements where the sum is one of the options. For example, O and F: 16 +19=35, option A.

But how would that fit into the reaction? Maybe the reaction produces CO gas, which has C and O. So perhaps X is O and C.

Wait, but I'm stuck again. I think I've thought about this enough, and the most plausible option based on the sum of elements' atomic masses is option C) 31 or D)29. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)29, as 12 (C) +17 (Cl)=29.

Wait, wait. Another angle: the product of the reaction with a keto acid has two O atoms. Let me think of another example. If the keto acid is formic acid (HCOOH), and X is Na, then the product is NaHCOO. The bicarbonate ion has two O atoms in the COO− part. So yes, that's two O atoms.

So X is Na. Now, the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes in Na is 23 +25=48. Not an option. So perhaps there's another approach.

Wait, maybe X is not the metal itself but a compound. For example, sodium hydride (NaH). Then, the elements are Na and H. H's lightest is 1, Na's heaviest is 25. Sum 26. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with two different elements, each with their own isotopes. For example, Na and Cl. So Na's lightest is 23, Cl's heaviest is 37. Sum 23+37=60. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the elements in X are H and O. H's lightest is 1, O's heaviest is 18. Sum 19. Not an option.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another way. Let me think about the cumulative atomic masses. The question says to sum the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, if X is a compound with two elements, I need to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses.

Looking at the options:

A)35 → perhaps Cl (35.5) and another element with 0.5, which is impossible.

B)25 → could be 12 (C) +13 (Al), but not sure.

C)31 → perhaps 15 (P) +16 (O)=31.

D)29 → 12 (C) +17 (Cl)=29.

Wait, 12 +17=29. So if X contains C and Cl, their sum is 29. But how would that fit into the reaction?

Wait, perhaps X is COCl2 (phosgene). But that's a gas, and I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like CH3Cl. Reacting with water might produce HCl and CH4. Hmm, but earlier analysis doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is ClO2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. I'm really stuck here.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. The most plausible option based on the sum of elements' atomic masses is option D)29 (12+17). So I'll go with that.


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and a final product B. The key points of analysis are as follows:

1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include CO (14 protons, 14 neutrons) or O2 (16 protons, 16 neutrons). CO is more plausible given the reaction context.

2. **Precipitate G and Product B**: G forms when X reacts with Y and releases B upon heating. B has a melting point close to 277 K (4°C). This suggests B could be a hydrated compound or a residue from the decomposition of G. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point near 277 K.

3. **Reaction with a Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests X could be a metal like sodium (Na), which reacts with a keto acid to form a salt (e.g., acetate ion, CH3COO−Na+), where the acetate ion has two oxygen atoms.

4. **Isotopes in X**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. If X is sodium (Na), its isotopes include Na-23 (lightest), Na-24, and Na-25 (heaviest). The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest isotopes would be 23 + 25 = 48, which is not an option. This suggests X might be a compound containing multiple elements.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The question asks for the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Analyzing the options:
   - **A) 35**: Could correspond to elements like Cl (35.5) and another element with negligible mass, but this is unlikely.
   - **B) 25**: Could correspond to C (12) and Al (13), but this does not fit the reaction context.
   - **C) 31**: Could correspond to P (15) and O (16), but this also does not align with the reaction.
   - **D) 29**: Could correspond to C (12) and Cl (17), which adds up to 29. This is plausible if X contains these elements.

Given the analysis, the most plausible cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are **29**, corresponding to C (12) and Cl (17).
