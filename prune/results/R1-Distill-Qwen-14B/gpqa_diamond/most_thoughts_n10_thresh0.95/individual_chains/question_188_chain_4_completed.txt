Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember from my solid state physics class that interplanar distances are related to the crystal structure and Miller indices. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, I need to clarify: interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice, right? So that's the lattice parameter 'a' maybe? Because in a rhombohedral structure, all edges are equal, so a = b = c, and all angles α, β, γ are equal too. Here, all angles are 30 degrees. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron with a = 10 Angstroms and angles of 30 degrees each.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, the interplanar distance, d_hkl, is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor. The formula is 1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) multiplied by some factor that accounts for the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, wait, the exact formula... I think it's something like this: d^2 = [ (a²)(h² + k² + l²) ] / [ (h + k + l)^2 - ( (h)(sin α)^2 + (k)(sin β)^2 + (l)(sin γ)^2 ) ] or something along those lines. No, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, since it's a rhombohedral system, perhaps there's a simpler formula because all the a, b, c are equal and the angles are the same.

Wait, another approach: I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the structure factors. Or maybe using the Miller indices and the unit cell parameters.

Wait, I recall that the general formula is: 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h k (cos γ) )/(a² sin² α) )? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should look up the exact formula for rhombohedral systems.

Wait, no, I can't look it up right now, so I need to think. Another approach: the interplanar distance d for a plane (hkl) is given by the formula from Bragg's law, but more importantly, using the lattice parameters.

In a cubic system, the formula is straightforward: d = a / √(h² + k² + l²). But here it's rhombohedral, so it's not cubic.

Wait, the general formula for the interplanar distance (d_{hkl}) in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (a^2 b^2 c^2) / [ (a^2 (k^2 + l^2 - m^2 cos^2 α) + ... ) ]^(1/2) ) 

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the formula specific to rhombohedral systems. Since a = b = c, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees, maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, another formula I remember is:

d² = (a²)/(h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(k l cos α)) )

Wait, but in rhombohedral, all angles are the same, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees. So substituting that in, we get:

d² = a² / [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos 30° - 2hl cos 30° - 2kl cos 30° ) ]

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because the general formula for d² in a triclinic system is:

1/d² = ( (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) ) - ( 2hk cos α )/(a b) - ( 2hl cos β )/(a c) - ( 2 kl cos γ )/(b c) )

But in rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α = β = γ, so substituting:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2 hk cos α)/(a²) - (2 hl cos α)/(a²) - (2 kl cos α)/(a²)

Which simplifies to:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) ] / a²

So, d² = a² / [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) )

In our case, the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. The angle α is 30 degrees, and a=10 Angstrom.

Let me plug these values in.

First, compute the numerator: h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then compute the denominator part: 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl).

cos(30°) is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 2 * cos(30) = 2 * (√3/2) = √3 ≈ 1.732.

Now, the sum (hk + hl + kl) = (1*1) + (1*1) + (1*1) = 3.

So denominator part is 1.732 * 3 ≈ 5.196.

So the denominator becomes 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative. Wait, that can't be right because d² can't be negative. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, wait, let me go back. The formula I had was:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) ] / a².

Wait, so the denominator is [sum of squares] minus 2 cos α (sum of products). Let me compute that again.

h² + k² + l² = 3.

2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) = 2*(√3/2)*3 = (√3)*3 ≈ 5.196.

So 3 - 5.196 ≈ -2.196.

So putting this into 1/d²: ( -2.196 ) / (10² ) = (-2.196)/100 ≈ -0.02196.

Wait, that gives 1/d² as negative, which is impossible because d² can't be negative. That must mean I made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is 1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) ) ] / a² ?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because if the angle is 30 degrees, the cos is positive, but in some other cases, perhaps the formula uses the sum differently.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

d² = (a²) / [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I had the sign wrong before. Let me check again. Another approach: I think the correct formula is d² = a²/(h² +k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)).

Wait, that would make more sense. So let me plug in the numbers again.

h=1, k=1, l=1.

h² +k² + l² = 3.

Then, 2[ hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ ]

= 2 [ (1)(1) cos 30 + (1)(1) cos 30 + (1)(1) cos 30 ]

= 2 [ (3 * (√3/2) ) ]

Because each cos 30 is √3/2, so 3 terms each contributing (√3/2) gives 3*(√3/2) = (3√3)/2.

Multiply by 2: 2 * (3√3/2) = 3√3 ≈ 5.196.

So denominator is 3 - 5.196 = -2.196. Again negative, which can't be right. So something is wrong here.

Wait a second, perhaps the formula is different. Another thought: maybe the formula is written as:

d² = a² [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ]^{-1}

Wait, but that would give the same result. So if the denominator is negative, that's impossible. Therefore, I must have the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl}^2 = (a^2 b^2 c^2) / [ (a^2 (k^2 + l^2 - m^2 cos^2 α)) + ... ] 

No, that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe another approach.

Wait, another formula I found in some notes is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - 2(hk cos α)/(a b) - 2(hl cos β)/(a c) - 2(k l cos γ)/(b c) } }

But for rhombohedral, a=b=c, and α=β=γ, so substituting:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( [ (h² + k² + l²)/a² ] - 2 [ (hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α ) ] / a² )

So,

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Ah, that's better. So the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, that makes sense because if the angles are 90 degrees (like in cubic), then cos 90 is zero, so it reduces to the cubic formula. So let's use this.

So plugging in the numbers:

h=1, k=1, l=1; a=10 Angstrom; α=30 degrees.

Compute numerator: a=10.

Denominator: sqrt( (1+1+1) - 2*(1*1 + 1*1 +1*1)*cos(30) )

Compute inside the sqrt:

Sum of squares: 3.

Sum of cross terms: (1*1 +1*1 +1*1) = 3.

Multiply by 2: 6.

Multiply by cos(30): 6*(√3/2) = 3√3 ≈5.196.

So, denominator inside sqrt is 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, again negative. That's impossible. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula's structure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but that would make cos positive, but cos(30) is positive, so the denominator would be larger, leading to a smaller d, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's compute that.

Denominator inside sqrt would be 3 + 2*(3)* (√3/2) = 3 + 3√3 ≈ 3 +5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)≈ 2.864.

So d =10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom. But none of the options are close to that. The options are around 9-10 Angstrom.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again. Maybe it's the other way around: it's 2*(hk + ... ) * cos(180 - α), since in some conventions, the angles are taken as the supplementary angles. Wait, no, in crystallography, the angles are the smallest angles between the axes.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula uses the angle between the vectors in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric tensor for a rhombohedral lattice is:

(a²   a² cos γ   a² cos β )

(a² cos γ   a²    a² cos α )

(a² cos β   a² cos α    a² )

But for rhombohedral, α=β=γ=30 degrees.

The reciprocal of the metric tensor will have elements which can be used to compute d_{hkl}.

The formula for d² is 1/(h² +k² + l² - 2 hk cos γ - 2 hl cos β - 2 kl cos α )

Wait, but in rhombohedral, all cosines are the same, so:

d² = 1/(h² +k² + l² - 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) )

So for (111), this would be:

d² = 1/(3 - 2*(1)(1)cos30 *3) [Wait, 3 comes from (hk + hl + kl) = 3*1=3.]

So,

d² = 1/(3 - 2 *3* (√3/2) )

Simplify denominator:

3 - (6*(√3/2)) = 3 - 3√3 ≈ 3 -5.196 ≈ -2.196.

Again, negative denominator. Hmm, that can't be right. Negative d squared? That's impossible.

Wait, maybe I have the formula inverted. Because I know that in the cubic case, d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²), which is correct. So in that case, the formula for d² is a²/(h² +k² + l²). So perhaps the general formula is:

d² = (a²)/(h² +k² + l² - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But that brings us back to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Miller indices. Did I get h, k, l right? The question is about the (111) plane. Yes, h=1, k=1, l=1.

Wait, perhaps the angle in the formula is not the same as the angle in the crystal but 180 - alpha. Because sometimes the angle between the lattice vectors is defined as the angle between the vectors, but in some cases, the angle used in the formula is the angle between the vectors when they form the rhombohedral structure.

Wait, perhaps the angle in the formula is actually 180 - alpha. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the angle between the vectors is acute (30 degrees), but maybe the formula uses the obtuse angle, which is 150 degrees. Because the vectors form a sort of 'V' shape when viewed in 3D.

Wait, let me think: for a rhombohedral structure, the angle between the a and b vectors is alpha, which is 30 degrees. So if I'm using the angle between a and b in the formula, it's 30 degrees. But if the formula actually expects the angle between the vectors when they are in their conventional positions, sometimes the angle used is 180 - alpha.

Wait, let's see what happens if I use cos(150 degrees) instead of cos(30 degrees). Because 150 is 180-30.

So cos(150) = -√3/2 ≈ -0.866.

Let me try that.

So, denominator: 3 - 2 * [3 * (-√3/2) ]

Wait, 3 is h² +k² +l², and 2 * [3 * cos(150)] = 2 *3*(-√3/2) )= 3*(-√3) ≈ -5.196.

So denominator becomes 3 - ( -5.196 ) = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864.

So d = a / denominator^0.5 = 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom.

But again, that's too small, and the options are all around 9-10. So that can't be right. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, maybe I should be using the reciprocal formula in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let's see if I can find another way.

Wait, maybe the given interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter 'a' but the distance between two nearest neighboring atoms. Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a, because each atom is at a corner of the rhombohedron. So a would be the interatomic distance. So a=10 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think of the general case.

Another idea: the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * sqrt(3) )

Wait, why sqrt(3)? Because for a rhombohedral angle of 30 degrees, perhaps the cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2, so 2 cos 30 = sqrt(3). Hmm, that might be a possible substitution.

So substituting, denominator becomes:

3 - sqrt(3) * 3.

Because:

(hk + hl + kl) =3, and sqrt(3) is 2 cos30°, because 2 * (sqrt(3)/2)=sqrt(3).

So,

Denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 -5.196 ≈-2.196.

Again negative. That's not possible.

Hmm, I'm clearly missing something here. Maybe I should think of another approach. Like, perhaps using the volume of the unit cell and the area of the (111) plane.

Wait, another thing: the interplanar distance d is related to the volume V of the unit cell and the area A of the lattice plane. The formula is d = V/(A * n), where n is the number of unit cells in the plane. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the volume of the unit cell and the Miller indices to find d.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 β - cos^2 γ + 2 cos α cos β cos gamma) )

Wait, but for a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so:

V= a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α )

Because cos α = cos beta = cos gamma.

With alpha=30 degrees, cos alpha=√3/2 ≈0.866.

So,

V=10^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )

Compute each term:

(0.866)^2 ≈0.75.

(0.866)^3 ≈0.866 *0.75 ≈0.6495.

So,

1 -3*0.75 = 1 -2.25 = -1.25.

+2*0.6495 = +1.299.

So inside sqrt: -1.25 +1.299 ≈0.049.

sqrt(0.049)≈0.221.

So V≈1000 * 0.221 ≈221 Angstrom^3.

But how does that help with the interplanar distance?

Wait, the volume can also be written as V= a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 β - cos^2 γ + 2 cos α cos beta cos gamma ). So for rhombohedral, it's V= a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α )

But I'm not sure how to connect this to the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, the area of the (111) plane can be computed using the area formula.

Wait, the plane (111) in a rhombohedral lattice. The area A of the plane can be found using the formula involving the metric tensor.

Wait, the area of the lattice plane (hkl) is given by A = (a b c) / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + ... )) ) ... Not sure.

Alternatively, the area of the (111) plane is given by:

A = (a^2) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but for (111), that would be:

A = a^2 / sqrt(3 - 2*(3) cos30 )

Which again gives the same denominator as before, leading to a negative inside the sqrt. That approach isn't working.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the given interatomic distance is 'a', which is 10 Angstrom, and I'm to find d_{111}.

Wait, I found a formula elsewhere in my notes: For a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = (a^2) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + (some terms involving cos of angles) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula in terms of the volume.

Another thought: The volume V of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α ), which we computed as approximately 221 Ang^3.

The volume can also be expressed as V = (a b c) sqrt(1 - cos² α - cos² β - cos² γ + 2 cos α cos beta cos gamma )

But for our case, it's V = a^3 sqrt(1 -3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α )

But perhaps another formula for interplanar distance is d = V / (h^2 +k^2 + l^2)^(1/2) * something. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g is given by:

g = [ [ a², a² cosγ, a² cosβ ],
       [a² cosγ, a², a² cosα ],
       [a² cosβ, a² cosα, a² ] ]

In rhombohedral, a=b=c, and α=β=γ=30°, so:

g = [
[ a², a² cos30, a² cos30 ],
[a² cos30, a², a² cos30 ],
[a² cos30, a² cos30, a² ]
]

Then, the reciprocal metric tensor, g^{-1}, has elements:

g^{-1} = (1/(a²)) * [
[ 1, -cos30, -cos30 ],
[-cos30, 1, -cos30 ],
[-cos30, -cos30, 1 ]
] / [ 1 - 3 cos²30 ]

Because the determinant of g in rhombohedral is a^6 (1 -3 cos²30 + 2 cos^3 30 ), which we calculated earlier to be a^6 * 0.049, so sqrt of that is ~0.221 a^3, so 1/sqrt det g is about 2.25 a^-3.

Wait, perhaps the reciprocal tensor is:

g^{-1} = (1/(a²)) * [ [1, -cos30, -cos30], [-cos30, 1, -cos30], [-cos30, -cos30, 1] ] / (1 - 3 cos²30 + 2 cos^3 30 )

So, for a=10, cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

The denominator (1 -3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495)) ≈1 -2.25 +1.299 = -0.951? Wait, wait, let me compute:

Wait, 3 cos²30 = 3*(3/4) )= 9/4=2.25.

2 cos^3 30 = 2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 ) =2*( (3*sqrt(3))/8 )= (3*sqrt(3))/4 ≈1.299.

So denominator is 1 -2.25 +1.299 = (1 +1.299) -2.25 ≈2.299 -2.25 = 0.049.

So, g^{-1} elements are:

(1/(10²)) * [1, -0.866, -0.866; 
              -0.866, 1, -0.866;
              -0.866, -0.866, 1 ] 
divided by 0.049.

So each element in the matrix is (1/100) * value / 0.049.

So, 1/100 / 0.049 ≈ 1/(4.9) ≈0.204.

So, the diagonal elements are 0.204 * (1) ≈0.204.

The off-diagonal elements are 0.204 * (-0.866) ≈-0.177.

So the metric tensor inverse is approximately:

[0.204, -0.177, -0.177;
 -0.177, 0.204, -0.177;
 -0.177, -0.177, 0.204 ]

Now, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( h² g11 + k² g22 + l² g33 + 2 hk g12 + 2 hl g13 + 2 kl g23 )

For (111), h=k=l=1.

So,

d_{111} = 1 / sqrt( (1)^2 g11 + (1)^2 g22 + (1)^2 g33 + 2*(1)(1) g12 + 2*(1)(1) g13 + 2*(1)(1) g23 )

Plugging in the g^{-1} values:

= 1 / sqrt( 0.204 + 0.204 + 0.204 + 2*(-0.177) + 2*(-0.177) + 2*(-0.177) )

Compute:

Sum of squares: 0.204 *3 =0.612.

Sum of cross terms: 2*(-0.177) *3 = -3 *0.354 = -1.062.

So total inside sqrt is: 0.612 -1.062= -0.45.

Wait, that's negative again. So, that can't be right. What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Because the metric tensor is used to compute the reciprocal vectors, but perhaps the formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( h^2 g11 + k^2 g22 + l^2 g33 + 2 h k g12 + 2 h l g13 + 2 k l g23 )

But since all the g_ij are positive and negative, the sum could be negative. But that's impossible because the square root can't take negative values.

Wait, but in our case, it's negative. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when I calculated the reciprocal metric tensor.

Wait, let me recheck the reciprocal metric tensor calculation. The formula for the inverse metric tensor in rhombohedral is:

g^{-1} = (1/(a² (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α))) * [ [1, -cosα, -cosα], [-cosα, 1, -cosα], [-cosα, -cosα, 1] ]

In our case, 1 -3 cos² alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha is 1 -3*(3/4) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Which is 1 - 9/4 + 2*(3 sqrt(3)/8 )

= (4/4 -9/4) + (6 sqrt(3))/8

= (-5/4) + (3 sqrt(3))/4

Hmm, wait, sqrt(3) ≈1.732, so 3*1.732 ≈5.196.

So 5.196/4 ≈1.299.

So 1 -3*(3/4) +2*(3 sqrt(3)/8 ) = (-5/4) + (5.196)/4 ≈ (-5 +5.196)/4 ≈0.196/4≈0.049.

So, 1 -3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha ≈0.049.

So, the denominator is 0.049, and it's positive.

So the reciprocal tensor is positive.

Hmm, but when I plug in the values for g^{-1}, I get negative terms in the sum, leading to a negative inside the sqrt. That's impossible, so I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for d_{hkl} uses the absolute value. But that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up h, k, l.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the reciprocal of the metric tensor in a different way. Another formula I remember is:

d_{hkl} = sqrt( (g11 h² + g22 k² + g33 l² + 2 g12 hk + 2 g13 hl + 2 g23 kl ) )^{-1}

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( h² g11 + k² g22 + l² g33 + 2 hk g12 + 2 hl g13 + 2 kl g23 )

So in our case:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So,

sum = g11 + g22 + g33 + 2(g12 + g13 + g23 )

But in our g inverse, g11=0.204, g22=0.204, g33=0.204.

g12= g13= g23= -0.177.

So,

sum = 3*0.204 + 2*(3*(-0.177)) = 0.612 - 1.062= -0.45.

Hmm, so sqrt of negative is impossible. This suggests that the (111) plane is not allowed, but that can't be right.

Wait, but in reality, (111) is a valid plane in a rhombohedral structure. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should not have used the reciprocal metric tensor elements as negative. Let me recheck the calculation of the inverse metric tensor.

The metric tensor g for rhombohedral is:

g = [ a²    a² cosα   a² cosα ]
    [a² cosα   a²    a² cosα ]
    [a² cosα   a² cosα   a² ]

The determinant of g is a^6 (1 - 3 cos²α + 2 cos^3 α )

The inverse of g is (1/det(g)) * adjugate(g).

Wait, perhaps the elements of g^{-1} are:

g^{-1}_11 = (g22 g33 - g23 g32) / det(g)

Similarly for others.

But for a symmetric matrix, the inverse can be found using the formula for the inverse of a 3x3 matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the inverse using known formula for rhombohedral.

Wait, from a crystallography textbook, the inverse metric tensor for rhombohedral is:

g^{-1} = (1/a²) * [
[ 1, -cosα, -cosα ],
[-cosα, 1, -cosα ],
[-cosα, -cosα, 1 ]
] / (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos^3 α )

So, in our case, with cosα = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866,

g^{-1}_11 = [1 -3 cos² alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha ]^{-1} * (1/a²) * (1 )

g^{-1}_12 = [ same denominator ] * ( - cos alpha ) / a².

So, let me compute each element:

Denominator D = 1 -3 cos² alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha.

With cos alpha = sqrt(3)/2,

cos² alpha = 3/4,

cos^3 alpha = (3 * sqrt(3) ) / 8 ≈0.6495.

So,

D = 1 -3*(3/4) + 2*(3 sqrt(3)/8 )

= 1 -9/4 + (3 sqrt(3))/4.

Convert to decimal:

1 =4/4, 9/4=2.25, 3√3/4≈1.299.

So,

D= (4/4 -9/4) +1.299 = (-5/4) +1.299 ≈-1.25 +1.299 ≈0.049.

So D≈0.049.

Now, g^{-1}_11 = (1/a²) * (1) / D.

a=10, a²=100.

So,

g^{-1}_11 ≈ (1/100) * (1/0.049) ≈ (1/100) *20.408 ≈0.20408.

Similarly, g^{-1}_12 = (1/a²) * (- cos alpha ) / D.

So,

g^{-1}_12 ≈ (1/100) * (-0.866) / 0.049 ≈ (1/100) * (-17.673) ≈-0.17673.

So, the reciprocal metric tensor is correct.

So, going back, the sum is:

sum = 3*(0.20408) + 3*(2)*( -0.17673 )

Wait, no. Let me re-express the sum correctly.

The sum is h² g11 +k² g22 + l² g33 + 2 hk g12 + 2 hl g13 + 2 kl g23.

With h=k=l=1,

sum = (1^2)(0.20408) + (1^2)(0.20408) + (1^2)(0.20408) + 2*(1)(1)(-0.17673) + 2*(1)(1)(-0.17673) + 2*(1)(1)(-0.17673).

So,

sum = 3 * 0.20408 + 3 * 2 * (-0.17673).

Wait, wait, 2*(1)(1) * (-0.17673) for each of the three cross terms (hk, hl, kl), so 3 terms each multiplied by 2*1*1.

So,

sum = (3 *0.20408) + (3 * 2 * (-0.17673)/2 ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should break it down: each cross term is 2 * product.

Wait, no: each cross term is 2 * (h *k * g12 ), etc.

So for (111):

sum = 1*1*0.20408 + 1*1*0.20408 +1*1*0.20408 
+ 2*(1*1*(-0.17673)) + 2*(1*1*(-0.17673)) + 2*(1*1*(-0.17673)).

So,

sum = 3 * 0.20408 + 3 * (2*(-0.17673)).

Wait, no. Because each cross term is 2*(h k g12), but h and k are 1 each. So for each pair (hk, hl, kl), we have 2*(1*1 * g12), etc.

So,

sum = 3*(0.20408) + 3*(2*(-0.17673)).

But wait, there are three cross terms, each contributing 2*(-0.17673).

So,

sum = 0.61224 + 3*(-0.35346) = 0.61224 -1.06038 ≈-0.44814.

So, sum is negative, which is impossible. That must mean that the (111) plane is not allowed, but I know that (111) is a valid plane in rhombohedral systems. So perhaps the formula is incorrect or I'm missing something.

Wait another thought: maybe I'm confusing the angles in the formula. Because the angle α is the angle between the a and b axes, but perhaps I should be using the angle between the reciprocal lattice vectors, which might be 180- alpha.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the supplement angle, 180-30=150 degrees. Let's recompute using cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So, for the inverse metric tensor, g^{-1}_12 would be (1/a²) * ( - cos(150) ) / D.

Wait, wait no, because the formula uses the actual angle alpha, not its supplement. Unless the formula uses 180 - alpha.

Hmm, perhaps the formula should use cos(180 - alpha) instead of cos(alpha). Let me try that.

So, cos(180 -30) = -cos(30) = -0.866.

In that case, the metric tensor inverse would have:

g^{-1}_12 = (1/a²) * (- cos (180-alpha) ) / D.

Which is (1/100) * (0.866) / 0.049 ≈ 0.866/(4.9) ≈0.1767.

So, the g^{-1} matrix elements would have positive 0.1767 for the off-diagonal terms.

Then, recalculating the sum:

sum = 3*(0.20408) + 3*(2 *0.1767 )

= 0.61224 + 3*(0.3534) = 0.61224 +1.0602 ≈1.67244.

So, sum ≈1.67244.

Then, d_{111} = 1 / sqrt(1.67244) ≈1/1.293 ≈0.774 Angstrom.

But that's even smaller than before and none of the options match. So that can't be right.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses (hkl) as (1,1,1) but the actual reciprocal is (1,1,1) in the reciprocal space. So perhaps it's better to use the formula for d involving the reciprocal vectors.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to compute the volume another way and see if that helps.

The volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 -3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha ) =1000 * sqrt(0.049)≈1000*0.221≈221 Ang^3.

Now, the interplanar distance d is related to the volume and the area of the (111) plane. The area A of the (111) plane can be found from the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The area A is given by:

A = (a^2) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l² ) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But that's the same formula that leads to a negative denominator. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Wait, let's try that.

h=k=l=1.

So,

d =10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*0.866 )

=10 / sqrt( 3 + 5.196 )

=10 / sqrt(8.196 ) ≈10 /2.864≈3.49 Angstrom.

Again, that's way below the options given. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral system can be found using the formula d = a / (sqrt(3) ) * sqrt(3 - 2 cos 30° )

Wait, wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt(3 - 2 *3 cos30° )

But that gives the same negative denominator.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt(3 + 2 *3 cos30° )

Which would be 10 / sqrt(3 +5.196 )=10/sqrt(8.196 )≈3.49 Ang. No, that's same as before.

Hmm. None of these approaches are giving an answer near the options provided.

Wait a minute; perhaps the question is referring to a hexagonal close-packed structure? No, the question clearly states it's a rhombohedral crystal. 

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, but in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is not a, but a/√3.

Because in a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corners of a rhombohedron. So the nearest neighbor distance is along the edge, which is 'a'. So the interatomic distance is 'a', so a=10.

Wait, but then why the answer options are around 9-10 Angstrom, which is close to 'a' itself.

Let me think: for a cubic system, the (111) plane has d = a / sqrt(3) ≈5.77 Angstrom for a=10. So much smaller than the options. But here, the structure is not cubic, it's rhombohedral, so the distance would be larger or smaller depending on the angles.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system with angles less than 90 degrees, the interplanar distance for (111) would be smaller than in a cubic system. But the answer options are higher than 10 Ang, which is the lattice parameter. So that doesn't make sense. Unless...

Wait, perhaps the lattice parameter a is not the interatomic distance, but something else. Wait, wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the corners, so the distance from one corner to another along the edge is a, which is the interatomic distance. So a=10 Angstrom.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is not using the rhombohedral formula but the hexagonal formula. Wait, but the question states it's rhombohedral.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm to use the formula for the interplanar distance in a hexagonal system, but that doesn't fit the question.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach. Let me think about the volume of the unit cell and the interplanar distance.

The volume V of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 -3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha ) ≈221 Ang^3.

The area A of the (111) plane can be found using the formula A = (V ) / (d * (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) )

Wait, no, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between the volume and the interplanar distance.

Wait, another formula: the volume can be expressed as V = d * (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) * A, where A is the area of the plane. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of unit cells per plane is n = h^2 +k^2 + l^2.

But I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another way. Let's think about the unit vectors in the rhombohedral system.

The vectors a, b, c each have length 'a', and the angles between them are 30 degrees.

The (111) plane is defined by the plane intercepts at a, a, a.

The normal vector to the (111) plane is (1,1,1) in reciprocal space.

The interplanar distance d is the magnitude of the projection of the unit vectors onto the direction normal to the plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the dot product of the normal vector with the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) (1, 1/(a sin α), 1/(a sin alpha) )

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Another approach: the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined as:

b1 = ( 2π/a ) (1, 0, 0 )

b2 = ( 2π/a ) ( cos alpha, sin alpha, 0 )

b3 = ( 2π/a ) ( cos beta, (cos gamma - cos alpha cos beta)/(sin alpha), sin alpha sin beta )

But this seems complicated, especially since alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

Hmm, perhaps I can compute the reciprocal lattice vectors and find the plane (111).

Wait, the normal vector to the (111) plane is (1,1,1). The distance d is related to the reciprocal vectors.

Wait, perhaps another formula: d = 2π / | (h b1 +k b2 +l b3) |, where h,k,l are the Miller indices.

But I'm not sure about this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

d = (a) / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ) + 2 hk cos(180 - alpha) + 2 hl cos(180 - alpha) + 2 kl cos(180 - alpha) ) )

Wait, but that would imply using angles of 150 degrees, which have cos(150) =-0.866.

So,

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*(-0.866) )

=10 / sqrt(3 -5.196 )=10 / sqrt( -2.196 )

Again, impossible.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. I can't seem to find an approach that gives a positive denominator. But the options are all positive and around 9-10 Angstrom. So perhaps I'm missing a key insight here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l^2 ), as in cubic, but adjusted for the angles.

In cubic, for (111), d= a/sqrt(3) ≈5.77 Ang. But the options are higher than a=10. So that can't be.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is actually about a hexagonal crystal, not rhombohedral. But the question clearly states rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given angles are 30 degrees, but the formula uses the angles in a different way. Like, perhaps the reciprocal of the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d in rhombohedral is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - hk - hl - kl )

Wait, let's try that.

For (111), denominator inside sqrt: 3 - (3) = 0.

So d would be infinite. Which is impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d^2 = a^2 (h² +k² + l^2 - hk - hl - kl )^{-1}

So,

d^2 = 100 / (3 -3 ) = infinity. Again, impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * 2 cos alpha )

So,

d =10 / sqrt( 3 -3 * 2 * cos30 )

=10 / sqrt(3 - 3* 1.732 )

=10 / sqrt(3 -5.196 )=10/sqrt(-2.196 )

Which is again impossible.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option A, 9.08 Angstrom, but I can't see how to reach it.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )) )

So,

d =10 * sqrt(3) / sqrt( 3 - 6 * (√3/2 ) )

=10 * 1.732 / sqrt(3 -5.196 )

=17.32 / sqrt(-2.196 )

No, again impossible.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should give up and pick the option that's closest to a, which is 10. So the options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

But why would the interplanar distance be close to a?

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm thinking of is incorrect, and the correct formula actually gives a distance close to a.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for d is a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + ( ... ) )

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cos(180 - alpha) )

Let me compute that.

cos(180-30)=cos150= -0.866.

So,

denominator inside sqrt:3 + 2*(3)*(-0.866 )=3 -5.196 =-2.196.

Again, impossible.

Hmm. I'm clearly missing something here. Maybe I should re-express everything in terms of vectors.

Let me model the unit cell vectors as a, b, c.

a = a沿x轴，b = a (cos30, sin30, 0 ), c = a (cos30, 0, sin30 ), but in 3D it's more complicated.

Wait, no, in a rhombohedral system, all vectors a, b, c have the same length and similar angles.

But perhaps I can model the vectors as:

a = (a, 0, 0 )

b = (a cosα, a sinα, 0 )

c = (a cosα, 0, a sinα )

With alpha=30 degrees.

Wait, but this is a simplified model, perhaps.

Then, the (111) plane is defined by the plane passing through (a, a, a), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be used to find the interplanar distance.

The reciprocal vectors are:

b1 = ( 2π/a ) (1, 0, 0 )

b2 = ( 2π/a ) ( -cosα, sinα, 0 )

b3 = ( 2π/a ) ( -cosα, 0, sinα )

Then, the plane (hkl) is given by h b1 + k b2 + l b3.

The magnitude of this vector is:

| h b1 +k b2 + l b3 | = 2π/d

So,

d = 2π / | h b1 +k b2 + l b3 |

Let's compute this for (111).

So,

h=1, k=1, l=1.

Compute the components:

h b1 = (2π/10) (1, 0, 0 )

k b2 = (2π/10) ( -cos30, sin30, 0 )

l b3 = (2π/10) ( -cos30, 0, sin30 )

So, adding these:

x-component: (2π/10) [1 - cos30 - cos30 ] = (2π/10) [1 - 2*0.866 ] ≈ (2π/10)(1 -1.732 )≈(2π/10)(-0.732 )≈-0.1464 π.

y-component: (2π/10) sin30 = (2π/10)(0.5 )=0.1 π.

z-component: (2π/10) sin30 ≈0.1 π.

So, the vector sum is approximately:

(-0.1464 π, 0.1 π, 0.1 π )

The magnitude squared is:

(0.1464^2 + 0.1^2 + 0.1^2 ) * π^2.

Compute:

0.1464^2 ≈0.02144,

0.1^2=0.01.

So sum: 0.02144 +0.01 +0.01=0.04144.

Magnitude is sqrt(0.04144 ) * π ≈0.2035 *π.

So,

d = 2π / (0.2035 π ) = 2 / 0.2035 ≈9.826 Ang.

Hmm, that's close to option D (10.05) and option C (9.54). Let me compute more accurately.

Let's compute each component with more precise numbers.

cos30=√3/2≈0.8660254,

sin30=0.5.

So,

x-component: (2π/10) [1 - 2*0.8660254 ] = (0.2 π) [1 -1.7320508 ]=0.2 π (-0.7320508 )= -0.14641016 π.

y-component: (2π/10)*0.5=0.1 π.

z-component: same as y: 0.1 π.

So,

magnitude squared:

( (-0.14641016)^2 + (0.1)^2 + (0.1)^2 ) * π^2.

Compute each term:

(-0.14641016)^2 = (0.02144) 

0.1^2 = 0.01.

So sum inside: 0.02144 +0.01 +0.01=0.04144.

sqrt(0.04144 )=0.20356.

So,

d= 2π/(0.20356 π ) = 2 / 0.20356 ≈9.826 Ang.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (9.08), but 9.826 isn't exactly matching any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 2/0.20356 is approximately 9.826, which is about 9.83. The options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

None of these match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, but the calculation using reciprocal vectors gives approximately 9.83 Ang, which is close to option D (10.05) but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reciprocal vectors' components.

Wait, the reciprocal vectors are given by:

b1 = 2π/a (1, 0, 0 )

b2 = 2π/a ( -cosα, sinα, 0 )

b3 = 2π/a ( -cosα, 0, sinα )

So,

h b1 +k b2 +l b3 = 2π/a [ h, 0, 0 ] + 2π/a [ -k cosα, k sinα, 0 ] + 2π/a [ -l cosα, 0, l sinα ]

So,

= 2π/a [ h -k cosα -l cosα, k sinα, l sinα ]

So,

x-component: h -k cosα -l cosα.

y-component: k sinα.

z-component: l sinα.

So, for (111):

x =1 - cos30 - cos30 =1 - 2*(√3/2 )=1 -√3 ≈1 -1.732 ≈-0.732.

y=1 * 0.5=0.5.

z=1 *0.5=0.5.

So the vector sum is ( -0.732, 0.5, 0.5 ) * (2π/a )

The magnitude squared is:

( (-0.732)^2 + (0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 ) * (2π/a )^2.

= (0.536 +0.25 +0.25 ) * (4π² /a² )

= (1.036 ) * (4π² / a² )

= (1.036 *4 ) π² /a²

=4.144 π² /a².

So,

| sum | = sqrt(4.144) π /a ≈2.035 π /a.

Thus,

d= 2π / (2.035 π /a ) = 2π a / (2.035 π ) = (2a )/(2.035 ) ≈ (20 )/2.035 ≈9.826 Ang.

So same result as before.

Thus, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.83 Angstrom.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C (9.54) and option D (10.05). But 9.83 is closer to option D.

Wait, but option D is 10.05, which is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which is 9.08, but that's not close.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reciprocal vector approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I can't see how.

Wait, let me think: perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt(3 - 2*3 cos30 ) but that would be imaginary.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the (111) plane in this rhombohedral structure is actually a (100) plane of a cubic structure, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with the supplement angle.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute using the formula for a hexagonal system.

But the question states it's rhombohedral, so I shouldn't do that.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 9.08 Ang, but I can't see how to get there.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l^2 - 2*(hk +hl + kl)*cos(α) )

But with α=30, and the sum as 3 terms.

Wait, that gives denominator 3-5.196= negative.

Hmm.

I think the correct approach is the reciprocal vectors method, which gives d≈9.83, which is close to option D (10.05), but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the given options have a typo.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the reciprocal vectors method.

Let me recompute the reciprocal vectors' sum.

x-component: 1 - cos30 - cos30 =1 - 2*(√3/2 )=1 -√3≈-0.732.

y= sin30=0.5.

z= sin30=0.5.

sum vector: (-0.732, 0.5, 0.5 )

magnitude squared: (0.732)^2 +0.5^2 +0.5^2 =0.536 +0.25 +0.25 =1.036.

magnitude= sqrt(1.036)=1.0177.

So, |sum|=1.0177 * 2π/a.

Thus,

d=2π/(1.0177 * 2π/a )= a/(1.0177 )=10 /1.0177≈9.826 Ang.

Which is same as before.

So, the closest option is D)10.05, but it's 9.83, which is not exactly any option. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest is option A or C.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake in the reciprocal vectors approach, because the formula for the reciprocal vectors is more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:9.08 Ang. But I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But that gives a negative denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( ... ) but the ... is (h² +k² +l^2 - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(180 - alpha) )

Which would be,

3 - 2*(3)* (-0.866 )=3 +5.196=8.196.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(8.196 )≈10/2.864≈3.49 Ang.

Which doesn't match any option.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck, but the reciprocal vector method gives approximately 9.83, which is close to option D (10.05), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08, but I can't see how to reach it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute with more precise numbers.

Let me compute the reciprocal vector sum again.

x-component: 1 - 2 * cos30 =1 - 2*(√3/2 )=1 -√3=1 -1.73205080757≈-0.73205080757.

y-component: 1 * sin30=0.5.

z-component: same as y:0.5.

So, the vector's components are (-0.73205, 0.5, 0.5).

Magnitude squared: (-0.73205)^2 + (0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2.

= (0.53606) + 0.25 +0.25 = 1.03606.

sqrt(1.03606)=1.01782.

So, magnitude is 1.01782.

So,

d=2π/(1.01782 *(2π/10 ))= (2π *10 )/(2π *1.01782 )=10 /1.01782≈9.826 Ang.

So, about 9.83 Ang. Looking at the options, the closest is option D:10.05, but that's 0.22 higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the process is correct, but the options don't have the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I can't see why.

Another thought: perhaps the angles in the formula are in degrees, and I should use exact trigonometric values.

Wait, cos(30)= (√3)/2≈0.86602540378.

Let me compute the reciprocal vector sum with more precise numbers.

x-component:1 - 2*(√3/2 )=1 -√3= -0.7320508075688772.

y=0.5.

z=0.5.

Magnitude squared: ( (-0.7320508075688772 )^2 ) + (0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 = (0.5360689956 ) +0.25 +0.25=1.0360689956.

sqrt(1.0360689956 )=1.017820568.

So, magnitude=1.017820568 * (2π/10 )= (2.035641136 * π )/10.

So,

d=2π / ( (2.035641136 * π ) /10 ) = (20 ) / 2.035641136 ≈9.826 Ang.

Which is approximately 9.83.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option A:9.08, which is further away, or option C:9.54, which is 0.28 less, or option D:10.05, which is 0.22 higher.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reciprocal vector approach. Maybe the formula for the reciprocal vectors is different.

Wait, perhaps the magnitude calculation is incorrect. Let me recompute:

The vector from reciprocal vectors is ( -0.73205, 0.5, 0.5 ), scaled by (2π/a ), where a=10.

So, the vector is:

( -0.73205*(2π/10 ), 0.5*(2π/10 ), 0.5*(2π/10 ) )

Which is:

( -0.14641π, 0.1π, 0.1π )

The magnitude squared is:

(0.14641π )^2 + (0.1π )^2 + (0.1π )^2 

= (0.02144 π^2 ) + (0.01 π^2 ) + (0.01 π^2 )

= (0.04144 π^2 )

So, magnitude= sqrt(0.04144 ) π ≈0.20356 π.

So,

d= 2π / (0.20356 π ) = 2 / 0.20356 ≈9.826.

Same result.

Hmm. So I think the correct answer is approximately 9.83 Ang, but the closest option is not present. So perhaps the intended answer is option A)9.08, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct answer is option A)9.08, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for d is a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180 - alpha) )

Which would be:

d=10 / sqrt(3 +5.196 )=10/sqrt(8.196 )≈3.49.

Doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should give up and select option A)9.08.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}
\]

### Step 1: Substituting the given values
For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these into the formula:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 - 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866)}}
\]

### Step 2: Simplifying the denominator
The numerator of the denominator is:

\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
\]

The second term involves the cross products:

\[
2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma) = 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866) = 2(3 \cdot 0.866) = 5.196
\]

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
3 - 5.196 = -2.196
\]

### Step 3: Analyzing the result
The denominator inside the square root is negative, which is physically impossible for \( d_{111} \). This suggests that the (111) plane is not allowed in this rhombohedral crystal structure under the given conditions.

### Step 4: Reciprocal vector approach
An alternative approach using reciprocal vectors was attempted. The reciprocal vectors for a rhombohedral system are defined as:

\[
\mathbf{b}_1 = \frac{2\pi}{a}(1, 0, 0), \quad \mathbf{b}_2 = \frac{2\pi}{a}(-\cos \alpha, \sin \alpha, 0), \quad \mathbf{b}_3 = \frac{2\pi}{a}(-\cos \alpha, 0, \sin \alpha)
\]

For the (111) plane, the vector sum is:

\[
\mathbf{G} = h\mathbf{b}_1 + k\mathbf{b}_2 + l\mathbf{b}_3
\]

Substituting \( h = k = l = 1 \), the components of \( \mathbf{G} \) were computed, and its magnitude was found to be approximately \( 9.83 \, \text{Å} \). This result is close to option D (\( 10.05 \, \text{Å} \)) but not exact.

### Step 5: Final evaluation
The reciprocal vector method suggests an interplanar distance of approximately \( 9.83 \, \text{Å} \). Among the given options, the closest match is **option D (\( 10.05 \, \text{Å} \))**, though it is slightly higher than the computed value. None of the other options are as close.
