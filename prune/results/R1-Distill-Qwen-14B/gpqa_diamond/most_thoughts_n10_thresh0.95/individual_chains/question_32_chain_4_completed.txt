Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. It's about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm not super familiar with the exact details.

The question says that the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, how many protons and neutrons does it have? Oh right, lithium has an atomic number of 3, so it has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes the isotope Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

I need to find the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. So, relativistic effects must be considered here. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it includes rest mass energy as well. Oh wait, but sometimes people talk about kinetic energy and total energy. I need to be careful about what the question is asking for.

The question asks for the energy of the nucleus, so I think it's referring to the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). 

So first, I should calculate gamma. Let's see, v is 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². Then, 1 minus v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, actually, 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1, right? Because 0.28 * 3 = 0.84, 0.28 * 0.5714 ≈ 0.16. So together, 0.84 + 0.16 = 1. So yeah, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute the square root of 0.0784 first. Let me think: 0.28 squared is 0.0784. Oh right, because 0.28^2 = (28/100)^2 = 784/10000 = 0.0784. So the square root is exactly 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. So the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is needed. Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c². Wait, no, actually, I should use the exact mass. Wait, but I'm not sure of the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the mass can be calculated using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about... I think it's approximately 6.013 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So converting that.

So the rest mass energy E_rest is m * c², which is 6.013 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Let me compute that. 6.013 multiplied by 931.5. Let me see, 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.013 * 931.5 ≈ 12.11 MeV. So total is approximately 5589 + 12.11 = 5601.11 MeV, which is about 5.601 GeV. 

Wait, but I'm not sure about the precise mass. Maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton and neutron. The mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Calculating the total rest mass: 3*(938.272 +939.565) MeV. Let me compute that. The sum of proton and neutron is 938.272 + 939.565 = 1877.837 MeV. Multiply by 3: 3 * 1877.837 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

Wait, but the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is a bit less than that because when you form a nucleus, some mass is lost as binding energy. But wait, no, because the rest mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of its nucleons minus the binding energy, but in this case, when I'm considering the rest mass of the nucleus, I should use the exact atomic mass. So perhaps I should find the exact value.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as m = 6 * m_p, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, maybe I should use the mass of a deuteron or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass as m = 6 * (average nucleon mass). But let's see. Let me think again.

Wait, the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 6.013 atomic mass units. Because, for example, the atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but the specific isotopes have different masses. For Li-6, the atomic mass is about 6.013 u. So let's proceed with that.

So E_rest = 6.013 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.013 * 931.5 ≈ let me calculate:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.013 * 931.5 = 12.11 MeV.

So total is 5589 + 12.11 = 5601.11 MeV, which is 5.60111 GeV. So E_rest ≈5.601 GeV.

Then the total energy E is gamma multiplied by E_rest. So gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.601 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.601.

Breaking it down: 3 *5.601=16.803, 0.5714 *5.601.

0.5 *5.601=2.8005.

0.0714 *5.601 ≈0.401.

So 0.5714 *5.601= 2.8005 + 0.401 ≈3.2015.

So total E= 16.803 +3.2015=20.0045 GeV.

Hmm, so approximately 20.005 GeV. Looking at the options: A) 18.475 GeV, B) 23.069 GeV, C)20.132 GeV, D)21.419.

Wait, my calculation gives about 20.0045, which is close to option C)20.132 GeV, but a bit lower. Hmm. But perhaps my approximation of gamma is a bit off. Let me recalculate gamma more accurately.

Wait, let me compute gamma again. v=0.96c. So beta = v/c = 0.96.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute 0.96^2: 0.96 *0.96 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

Wait, that's exact, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857. So that's correct.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m c^2.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the mass. Let me check the mass of Li-6.

Looking up, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01322344 u. So 6.01322344 u.

So E_rest = 6.01322344 * 931.5 MeV/u.

Calculating that:

6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.01322344 *931.5 ≈ let me compute: 0.01 *931.5 =9.315; 0.00322344 *931.5 ≈ 3.004.

So total for 0.01322344: 9.315+3.004=12.319.

So E_rest =5589 +12.319=5601.319 MeV =5.601319 GeV.

So gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.601319 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.601319.

Let me write it as 3 + 0.57142857.

3 *5.601319 =16.803957.

0.57142857 *5.601319.

Compute 5.601319 * 0.5 =2.8006595.

5.601319 *0.07142857 ≈ Let me compute: 5.601319 * (1/14) ≈ 0.4001.

So 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14, so 5.6 * (1/14) ≈ 0.4. So 5.601319 *0.07142857 ≈0.4001.

So 0.57142857 *5.601319 ≈2.8006595 +0.4001=3.20076 GeV.

So total E=16.803957 +3.20076 =20.004717 GeV.

Hmm, about 20.0047 GeV. So approximately 20.005 GeV.

Looking at the options, C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma is 3.57142857, but perhaps the mass of the Li-6 is a bit higher. Let me double-check the mass.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01322344 u. So 6.01322344 *931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, let me compute 6.01322344 *931.5.

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.01322344 *931.5: Let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.00322344 *931.5 = ?

0.003 *931.5=2.7945.

0.00022344 *931.5≈0.2072.

So 0.00322344 *931.5=2.7945 +0.2072=3.0017.

So 0.01322344 *931.5=9.315 +3.0017=12.3167.

So E_rest =5589 +12.3167=5601.3167 MeV =5.6013167 GeV.

Then gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6013167.

Let me compute this more precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6013167.

I'll break it into 3.5 *5.6013167 and 0.07142857 *5.6013167.

3.5 *5.6013167 =3 *5.6013167=16.80395 +0.5 *5.6013167=2.800658, so total 19.604608.

Wait, no, wait. 3.5 is 3 +0.5.

Wait, 3 *5.6013167 =16.80395.

0.5 *5.6013167=2.80065835.

So 3.5 *5.6013167=16.80395 +2.80065835=19.60460835.

Now, 0.07142857 *5.6013167.

Wait, 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14.

So 5.6013167 /14 =0.4001 (approx). So 0.07142857 *5.6013167≈0.4001.

So the total is 19.60460835 +0.4001=20.004708 GeV.

So approximately 20.0047 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest one is C)20.132 GeV. Hmm, but that's about 127 MeV higher. Did I make a mistake in the mass?

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is actually a bit higher. Let me check another source. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the proton mass and neutron mass, adding them up, instead of the atomic mass of the isotope.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass m =3*(m_p + m_n).

m_p is about 938.272 MeV/c², and m_n is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So m =3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So E_rest =5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511 ≈ Let's compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.033511 ≈0.1198.

So approximately 2.14285714 +0.1198=2.26265714.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.26265714=20.1198 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.12 GeV. So the answer would be approximately 20.12, which is close to option C)20.132 GeV.

So why is there a discrepancy? Because when I used the exact atomic mass of Li-6, I got around 20.0047 GeV, but when I used the sum of protons and neutrons (without considering binding energy), I get about 20.12 GeV.

But wait, the actual mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleon masses because of binding energy. So the rest mass should be lower when considering the nucleus, not higher. So using the sum of protons and neutrons would give a higher rest mass than the actual nucleus.

So perhaps the correct approach is to use the atomic mass of Li-6, which is 6.01322344 u. So E_rest is about 5.6013 GeV. So E=3.5714 *5.6013=20.0047 GeV.

But the options do not have 20.0047. The closest is option C, which is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma precisely.

Beta is 0.96. So beta squared is 0.96^2=0.9216.

1-beta^2=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784: Well, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, that's correct. So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy instead of total energy? Because sometimes people confuse the two. The question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

In particle accelerators, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. Or does it refer to the total energy? Hmm. I'm a bit confused now. Let me think.

The total energy is gamma mc^2, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc^2.

So if the question is asking for the energy delivered by the collider, which is the kinetic energy, then the calculation would be (gamma-1)*m c².

In that case, gamma is 3.5714, so gamma-1=2.5714.

E_kinetic = 2.5714 *5.6013 GeV.

Calculating that: 2 *5.6013=11.2026, 0.5714 *5.6013 ≈3.199.

So total E_kin≈11.2026 +3.199=14.4016 GeV.

But none of the options are around 14.4 GeV. So I think the question must be referring to the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the exact calculation would get closer to that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more precisely the E_rest. Let me compute 6.01322344 u *931.5 MeV/u.

So,

6.01322344 *931.5 = ?

Let's compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.01322344 *931.5.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.00322344 *931.5.

Calculate 0.003 *931.5=2.7945.

0.00022344 *931.5=?

0.0002 *931.5=0.1863.

0.00002344*931.5≈0.02185.

So 0.00022344 *931.5=0.1863 +0.02185=0.20815.

So 0.00322344 *931.5=2.7945 +0.20815=3.00265.

So 0.01322344 *931.5=9.315 +3.00265=12.31765 MeV.

So total E_rest =5589 +12.31765=5601.31765 MeV =5.60131765 GeV.

So E_rest=5.60131765 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.60131765.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.60131765.

I'll break it down:

5.60131765 = 5 + 0.60131765.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60131765.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.00131765.

Let's compute 3.57142857 *0.001=0.00357142857.

3.57142857 *0.00031765 ≈ approximately 0.0011328.

So 3.57142857 *0.00131765 ≈0.00357142857 +0.0011328≈0.0047042.

So 3.57142857 *0.60131765≈2.142857142 +0.0047042≈2.1475613.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.1475613≈20.00470415 GeV.

So approximately 20.0047 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is C)20.132 GeV. Hmm, but that's about 0.127 GeV higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Or perhaps the question expects the mass to be calculated as sum of individual nucleons.

Wait, when I used the sum of protons and neutrons (without considering binding energy), I got E=20.1198 GeV, which is about 20.12 GeV, very close to option C (20.132). So perhaps the question expects me to ignore binding energy and just use the sum of the individual masses.

So why would that be? Because for heavy ions, the binding energy is much smaller compared to their rest mass, but perhaps in this problem, they expect us to ignore binding energy and just compute using the number of nucleons multiplied by the average mass.

Let's recompute with that assumption.

Number of nucleons is 6 (3 protons +3 neutrons).

Assuming each nucleon has an average mass of (938.272 +939.565)/2 ≈ 938.9185 MeV.

Wait, no, perhaps just taking the mass of a proton and neutron as 938.272 and 939.565 respectively, and adding each.

So m =3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV.

So E_rest =5.633511 GeV.

Then E =3.57142857 *5.633511 ≈?

3.5 *5.633511=19.71729.

0.07142857 *5.633511≈0.404.

So total E≈19.71729 +0.404=20.1213 GeV.

Which is very close to option C)20.132 GeV. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the rest mass as the sum of individual nucleons, not considering binding energy.

But why would the problem do that? Because in reality, the binding energy would make the nucleus lighter. So using the sum of nucleon masses would give a higher E_rest, leading to a higher total energy.

So maybe the intended approach is this. So then the answer would be approximately 20.12 GeV, which matches option C (20.132 GeV).

But wait, why did my earlier calculation using the exact mass of Li-6 give about 20.005 GeV, which is close to 20 GeV, but that option is not present. The closest is option C, which is 20.132.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, calculated with the sum of nucleon masses.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the exact mass of Li-6. Let me check another source. Alternatively, perhaps the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.013 u, and I used that correctly. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus as m =6 * m_p, which would be significantly higher. Wait, m_p is 938 MeV, so 6*938=5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. Then E=3.5714 *5.628=?

3.5714 *5=17.857.

3.5714 *0.628= let's compute: 3.5714 *0.6=2.1428, 3.5714 *0.028=0.1000. So total 2.1428 +0.1000=2.2428.

So E=17.857 +2.2428=20.0998 GeV ≈20.1 GeV. Still close to option C.

Wait, but m_p is 938.272 MeV, so 6*938.272=5629.632 MeV=5.629632 GeV.

E=3.5714 *5.629632 =?

3 *5.629632=16.8889.

0.5714 *5.629632.

0.5 *5.629632=2.8148.

0.0714 *5.629632≈0.4035.

So 0.5714 *5.629632≈2.8148 +0.4035=3.2183.

So total E=16.8889 +3.2183=20.1072 GeV.

Hmm, 20.107 GeV, which is very close to option C of 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of proton masses, even though in reality that's higher than the actual mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of a lithium nucleus as approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, which is 6 *938 MeV/c².

Wait, 6 *938=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV. Then E=3.5714 *5.628=?

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.5714 *5.628= approximately 3.206.

So E=16.884 +3.206=20.09 GeV, which is about 20.09, still close to C)20.132.

But why is the option C higher than 20.1?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more precisely.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.629632 GeV.

5.629632 *3.57142857.

Let me compute it as:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.629632 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 0.629632 *3=1.888896.

0.629632 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.629632 *0.5=0.314816.

0.629632 *0.07142857 ≈0.04485.

So 0.314816 +0.04485≈0.359666.

So 0.629632 *3.57142857≈1.888896 +0.359666=2.248562.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.248562≈20.1057 GeV.

Which is very close to 20.106 GeV. So why is option C 20.132?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact value of gamma. Let me compute gamma with more precision.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta squared is 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the mass is taken as 6.013 GeV?

Wait, 6.013 u *931.5 MeV/u= let me compute.

6.013 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5=5589.

0.013 *931.5=12.1095.

So total =5589 +12.1095=5601.1095 MeV=5.6011095 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.6011095.

Compute:

5.6011095 *3.57142857.

Again, perhaps using a calculator would help, but I can try to compute.

5.6011095 *3 =16.8033285.

5.6011095 *0.57142857.

Compute 5.6011095 *0.5=2.80055475.

5.6011095 *0.07142857≈0.4002935.

So 0.57142857 *5.6011095≈2.80055475 +0.4002935=3.20084825.

So total E=16.8033285 +3.20084825=20.00417675 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.004 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.128 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the relativistic energy equation with the rest energy as the sum of the individual particles, not the nucleus.

Wait another thought: The RHIC accelerates heavy ions like gold nuclei, but in this case, it's Li-6. So the energy would be per nucleus, and each nucleus has a certain charge and mass.

But perhaps the mass used is the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus, which is 6.013 u.

So no, I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me compute that.

E_kinetic = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

So E_kin=2.57142857 *5.6011095 GeV.

Compute:

2 *5.6011095=11.202219.

0.57142857 *5.6011095 ≈3.199.

So E_kin≈11.202219 +3.199=14.401219 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So I think the question is asking for total energy. So why am I getting 20.004 GeV when the options have 20.132 as the closest?

Wait, perhaps the mass is taken as 6.015 GeV?

Let me compute E_rest=6.015 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.015 *931.5=13.9725.

So E_rest=5589 +13.9725=5602.9725 MeV=5.6029725 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Compute:

5.6029725 *3.57142857.

3 *5.6029725=16.8089175.

0.57142857 *5.6029725.

0.5 *5.6029725=2.80148625.

0.07142857 *5.6029725≈0.4004.

So total ≈2.80148625 +0.4004=3.20188625.

Total E=16.8089175 +3.20188625=20.01080375 GeV.

Still around 20.01 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mass is 6.0132 GeV. Let me compute 6.0132 *931.5.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.0132 *931.5=12.254.

So E_rest=5589 +12.254=5601.254 MeV=5.601254 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.601254.

3 *5.601254=16.803762.

0.57142857 *5.601254.

0.5 *5.601254=2.800627.

0.07142857 *5.601254≈0.4003.

So total≈2.800627 +0.4003=3.200927.

E=16.803762 +3.200927≈20.004689 GeV.

Hmm. So I'm consistently getting around 20.005 GeV, which doesn't match any of the options except perhaps option C if the calculation were done with a slightly higher mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for m_p and m_n.

Wait, let's get more precise values for m_p and m_n.

m_p (proton) = 938.272 MeV/c².

m_n (neutron) =939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6: 3*(m_p + m_n)=3*(938.272 +939.565)=3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So E_rest=5.633511 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.633511.

3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511 ≈3.213.

So E≈16.900533 +3.213=20.1135 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.114 GeV, very close to option C)20.132 GeV.

The slight discrepancy could be due to rounding in the gamma calculation or more precise values in the problem's setup.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 (Li-6) nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the total relativistic energy of the nucleus. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is defined as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of Li-6
Li-6 consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate rest masses of a proton (\( m_p \approx 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)) and a neutron (\( m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)):

\[
m = 3(m_p + m_n) = 3(938.272 + 939.565) = 3(1877.837) = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV}
\]
\[
m = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = \gamma m
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 3.5714 \) and \( m = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into components:

\[
3 \times 5.633511 = 16.900533 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
0.5714 \times 5.633511 \approx 3.213 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
E \approx 16.900533 + 3.213 = 20.1135 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.1135 \, \text{GeV} \), which is very close to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding or slight differences in the input values.

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c is approximately **20.132 GeV**.

**Answer: C**
