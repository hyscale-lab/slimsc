Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let's try to think through this. I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

The question says both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, which probably means their velocities are uniform.

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, what does the shift tell us?

I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for the Doppler shift is something like delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c, but I might be mixing up the formula. Oh wait, the exact relation is delta lambda / lambda = v/c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us. So if the spectral line shifts by more, the velocity must be higher.

Wait, but how does that relate to the planet's orbital period? Oh right, the period is how long it takes the planet to orbit the star. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass, but since the star's mass is much larger (same as Sun), the star's velocity would be much smaller than the planet's. But the RV method measures the star's velocity.

So if the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is higher for Planet #2 (7 mA vs 5 mA), that means Planet #2's star is moving faster in its orbit. But how does that affect the period?

I remember that the RV method relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But wait, since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. Also, the periods are the same in the denominator? Or wait, the formula might be a bit different.

Alternatively, I think the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the formula again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so this simplifies things.

But perhaps there's a simpler way. Because both stars are identical in mass, and the planets have similar masses, maybe we can relate their velocities and periods.

The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, because K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( sin i / sqrt(1-e²) )

Assuming circular orbits (e=0), and sin i is 1 (edge-on, so maximum effect), and M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so this reduces to K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) / (M_*^(1/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

But both planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune), and the stars have the same mass. So M_p and M_* are the same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), which implies that P^(1/3) ∝ 1/K.

Which leads to P ∝ (1/K)^3.

Wait, if K is higher, then 1/K is smaller, so P is smaller. So if Planet #2 has a larger K (7 mA vs 5 mA), then its period is shorter than Planet #1's.

Wait, but wait, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So we're to compute P2 / P1.

From the relation P ∝ 1/K³, so P2 / P1 = (P2) / (P1) = (K1 / K2 )^3.

Because P is inversely proportional to K^3. Because if K increases, the period decreases.

So let me write the proportionality:

K ∝ 1 / (P)^(1/3)

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Because K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const.

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, let's see:

K1 = (const) / P1^(1/3)
K2 = (const) / P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So if I cube both sides, (K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1.

Wait no, let's re-examine.

(K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → so to get P2/P1, cube both sides.

So (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, K1 is 5 mA, K2 is 7 mA.

So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

So (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Therefore, P2/P1 ≈ 0.364. So the period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is ~36% of planet #1's.

Wait, but the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1? So P2 = 0.36 * P1 → meaning P2 is shorter than P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? The answer would be 0.36 times, which is about 0.36. So the ratio is P2/P1 = 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, let's make sure. Because if K is larger, the period is smaller, so P2 is smaller than P1, meaning P2/P1 is less than 1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter, making it that the period is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1, so the answer is approximately 0.36 times longer. So the correct option is A) ~0.36.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The question involves two planets with masses similar to Neptune orbiting identical stars. The spectral line shifts caused by the planets are 5 milliangstroms for Planet #1 and 7 milliangstroms for Planet #2, indicating that Planet #2's star moves faster due to the planet's gravitational influence.

The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

Since the stars and planets are identical except for the observed shifts, the ratio of the periods \( P_2 / P_1 \) can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{mA} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{mA} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
