Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it.

The question says a light beam is going through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the lab. They're asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. So the glass is moving, but the beam is going through it. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, right? But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. So does the motion of the glass affect the speed of light inside it?

I'm thinking about relativity here. I mean, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly because of the speed limit c. But wait, the glass is moving at a constant velocity v, so maybe it's in an inertial frame. But how does that affect the light's speed?

Wait, but light's speed is always c in a vacuum, according to relativity. But this is in glass, so it's moving at c/n. But the situation is a bit more complex because the glass is moving.

Let me think about the reference frames. The lab frame is where the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is moving at speed v_light in the glass. So what's v_light in the lab frame?

Wait, the light is inside the moving glass. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light is moving at v_light relative to the glass. So the total speed would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass, but wait, velocities don't add like that in relativity. Oh wait, but the velocities are in the same direction here.

Wait, when velocities are in the same direction, you can't just add them linearly. For example, if the glass is moving at v, and the light is moving at u relative to the glass, then in the lab frame, the speed is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, in this case, the light in the glass has speed v_light, which is c/n. Wait, but no—because in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. So in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, what's the speed?

Wait, but that depends on the direction. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion, then the light's speed in the lab frame would be (v_light + v)/(1 + (v_light * v)/c²). But wait, I'm not sure about this. Let me clarify the setup.

The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement. So, from the lab's point of view, the glass is moving towards them, and the light inside is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

In the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. So to find the light's speed in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, I can use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the lab is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. So the velocity of light in the lab frame would be (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of light in the glass's frame, which is c/n.

So plugging in u = c/n, then the speed is ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c), because (c/n)*v = v/(n) * c, and divided by c² is v/(n c).

So the denominator is 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c)

The numerator is (c + n v)/n

So the entire expression is [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ (n c)/(n c + v) ) ]

Simplify: The n cancels, and c remains.

So we have [c (c + n v)] / [n (n c + v)] ?

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the multiplication. Let me recompute.

The numerator is (c + n v)/n, and the denominator is (n c + v)/(n c). So when you divide (a/b) by (c/d), it's a*d/(b*c).

So (c + n v)/n * (n c)/(n c + v)

The n in the numerator and denominator will cancel. So:

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Which is c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) (1 + n v)/(n + v) → but in that case, it's (1+nv)/(n+v), which would be 1 + something.

B) 1 → No, because it's in glass.

C) (1 +n v)/(n - v) → same numerator as A but denominator is (n - v)

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v) → No, because that's negative.

Wait, but I think I messed up the initial setup. Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass—so that in the glass's frame, light is moving at c/n towards the observer.

Wait, wait, is that correct? Because if the glass is moving towards the observer, then from the lab's perspective, the light's speed is faster than c/n. But in reality, nothing can exceed c.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the direction. Let me make it clear. Let's say in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, meaning towards the observer as well.

In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n towards the observer. So from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving towards the lab at v), the lab sees the light moving at some speed.

Wait, I'm getting confused with the relative velocities. Let me think about the velocity addition formula again.

The correct formula is:

u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² )

Where u is the velocity in the original frame (glass frame), and u' is the velocity in the lab frame.

So u = c/n (since in glass, speed is c/n towards the observer), and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. Wait, but in which direction?

Wait, the lab is at rest. The glass is moving towards the observer (lab) at velocity v. So in the lab's frame, the glass is moving in the negative direction? Hmm, maybe I should define the direction properly.

Alternatively, perhaps the lab is the rest frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.

Wait, the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So both are moving towards the observer.

Wait, no. The beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving toward the observer. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

So in the glass's frame, the speed of light is c/n towards the observer.

The lab is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. Wait, no. The glass is moving at v towards the lab. So the lab is moving at -v relative to the glass.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the lab as the rest frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer (so the direction is towards the lab), and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, so towards the observer.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n towards the observer.

We need to find u' which is the speed of the light in the lab frame (since the lab is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, but in the opposite direction).

Wait, what's the velocity of the lab relative to the glass? The glass is moving at v towards the lab. So from the glass's frame, the lab is moving at -v. But we want to find the speed of the light as seen from the lab.

So using the velocity addition formula:

u' = (u + v_glass) / (1 + (u * v_glass)/c² )

But wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, so the glass's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So when you're in the lab, the glass is moving at v, and the light in the glass is moving at u = c/n in the same direction as the glass.

So, the velocity of the light in the lab frame would be u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u * v)/c² )

But wait, u is the speed of light in the glass's frame. So u = c/n. And v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab (v).

So this gives u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c) → because (c/n) * v = v/(n) * c, divided by c² is v/(n c).

Wait, no: (c/n)*v = (v c)/n. Then divided by c² is (v c)/(n c²) )= v/(n c).

So denominator is 1 + (v)/(n c) = ( n c + v )/(n c )

Numerator is (c + n v )/n.

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which equals [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ (n c)/(n c + v) ) ]

Simplify: The n cancels.

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

= c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

But wait, looking at the options, none have c in them. Oh wait, the speed of light is given as c=1 in the problem statement.

So let's substitute c=1.

Then u' becomes [ 1*(1 + n v) ] / (n *1 + v )

Which is (1 + n v)/(n + v )

So that's option A.

Wait, but that's the same as option A. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but let me think again. Because if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, then the relative speed should be higher than c/n. But according to option A, when v is positive, the numerator and denominator both increase, so the result is larger than 1/(n) *c? Wait, no, because when v is small compared to 1/n, the formula approximates to (1 + n v)/(n) ) / (n + v)/(n) ) → (1 +n v)/(n) * (n)/(n + v) ) → (1 +n v)/(n + v) → approximately 1/n when v is small. Which makes sense because if the glass isn't moving, the light speed is 1/n.

So, in the case where v is small compared to 1/(n), the velocity should approach 1/n.

Wait, another test: if n=1 (vacuum), then the light in vacuum should be moving at speed 1, regardless of the glass's velocity. But wait, if n=1, substituting into option A: (1 + v)/(1 + v) =1, which is correct because in vacuum, the light speed is c=1 regardless of the frame.

So that makes sense.

Another test, when v is zero: the speed should be 1/n, which option A gives (1 +0)/(n+0)=1/n. Correct.

So yeah, seems like option A is correct.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The light beam is propagating through a glass medium with an index of refraction \( n \), and the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. The speed of light in a medium is \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) in the glass's rest frame, where \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.

In the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity \( v \), and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) (the speed of light in the glass's frame) and \( c = 1 \), we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} \cdot v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n} = \frac{n + v}{n}
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

The \( n \) in the numerator and denominator cancels, leaving:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. To verify, consider special cases:

1. If \( v = 0 \), the glass is stationary, and the speed of light in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \), which matches \( \frac{1 + 0}{n + 0} = \frac{1}{n} \).
2. If \( n = 1 \) (vacuum), the speed of light should always be \( c = 1 \), and substituting \( n = 1 \) into option A gives \( \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), which is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
