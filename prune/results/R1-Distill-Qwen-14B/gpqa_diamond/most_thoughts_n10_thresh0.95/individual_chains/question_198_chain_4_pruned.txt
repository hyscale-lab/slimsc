Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read it again. The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate ions, along with some stability constants. Hmm.

Wait, stability constants, beta values. Those are the formation constants for complexes. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So, for each complex, the beta value tells me how much the complex will form.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached to Co(II). So that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, right? Because each SCN- is a ligand, and Co is +2, so two SCN- would give a neutral charge... Wait, no, wait. Co is +2, SCN- each is -1. So two SCN- would contribute -2, so overall charge would be 0? Or wait, no, wait. Co^2+ plus two SCN^- would be Co(SCN)_2^0. So that's a neutral complex. So the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2] would be what we're looking for.

But wait, the options are about all cobalt-containing species. So the total includes all possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ions.

The given beta values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So let's think about the complexes. Beta1 is probably for the first complex, which would be Co(SCN). So β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)^+ (since Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+; charge is 2+ + (-1) = +1). So β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9.

Then β2 would be the formation constant for the next complex. That would be Co(SCN)_2^0. So β2 is the constant for adding another SCN^- to the CoSCN^+ to make Co(SCN)_2. Wait, no. Actually, each beta is the cumulative constant for the complex up to that point. So β1 is the constant for the first complex, β2 is the constant for the second, which includes the first and second ligands.

Wait, let me think. Stability constants are generally given as the cumulative formation constants. So Co^2+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n+} and the beta is the product of the stepwise formation constants.

So for the first complex, Co(SCN), the formation would be:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN^+; beta1 is the formation constant for this step, 9.

For the second complex, which is Co(SCN)_2: it's formed from CoSCN^+ plus another SCN^-.

So the second formation constant is beta2_step = [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-]).

But wait, the given beta2 is the cumulative constant for the second complex. So that would be beta2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) =40. Similarly, beta3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3)=63, and beta4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^2- / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4)=16.

Wait, but the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each beta is the cumulative constant up to that number of ligands.

So the species present are: Co^2+, CoSCN^+, Co(SCN)_2^0, Co(SCN)_3^- , Co(SCN)_4^{2-}.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^0. So we need to find [Co(SCN)_2^0] divided by the sum of all [Co species] ×100.

To find this, I think we'll need to calculate the fraction of each species. The distribution depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN^-.

Given that [Co^2+] is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Wait, but the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. That includes all the species: free Co^2+ and all the complexes. So the sum of [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = 1e-2 M.

But to find the distribution, I can model this using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand.

So the general approach is to compute the fraction of each complex. The fraction of each species is given by (beta_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum of [beta_i [SCN^-]^i] for i=0 to 4).

Wait, because for each complex, the concentration is beta_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n, but the total [Co] is the sum of all species. Alternatively, we can write the fraction of each species as (beta_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum for all m of beta_m [SCN^-]^m) ), where m is from 0 to 4. But wait, no, because for each m, the species is [Co(SCN)_m]^{2-m} and the expression is beta_m [Co^2+][SCN^-]^m.

But since [Co^2+] is part of each term, perhaps it's better to factor that out. Let me think.

Let me denote the total concentration as c = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4] = 1e-2 M.

But [Co^2+] = (1/c) * [something?]. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to let the fraction of each species be the relative contribution.

Wait, another approach is to use the given [Co] total and [SCN^-], and the stability constants to compute the fraction of each species.

Let me consider that the concentrations of the complexes are given by:

[Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n

But [Co^2+] = c - sum_{n=1}^4 [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}

This seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to express all species in terms of [Co^2+], and then sum up to get the total c.

Alternatively, perhaps the distribution can be found by considering the fractions relative to the free Co^2+.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think of the species distribution as a function of the ligand concentration and the stability constants.

The general formula for the fraction of a particular complex is (beta_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 beta_m [SCN^-]^m), where beta_0 is 1 (since [Co^2+] is just itself, with no ligand).

Wait, that's probably the way to go. Because the fraction of each species is (beta_n [L]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 beta_m [L]^m ), where L is the ligand (SCN^-), and n is the number of ligands.

Wait, but in this formula, [Co^2+] is represented by the term with m=0, so beta_0 is 1. So the denominator is the sum from m=0 to 4 of beta_m [L]^m.

So, the fraction for each species is (beta_m [L]^m) / denominator.

So, let's compute the denominator first. [L] is 0.1 M.

So let's compute each term:

For m=0: beta_0 [L]^0 =1 *1=1.

m=1: beta1 [L]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2: beta2 [L]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

m=3: beta3 [L]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

m=4: beta4 [L]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Now sum all these: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

The fraction for m=2 (dithiocyanato) is (beta2 [L]^2)/denominator = 0.4 /2.3646.

Let me compute that: 0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169, so about 16.9%.

Wait, but wait. The denominator is sum from m=0 to 4, which is 2.3646. The fraction for m=2 is 0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169, so 16.9%. But wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. But wait, wait a second. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is the m=2 species. So according to this calculation, the fraction is 0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, I should double-check the steps.

First, confirm each term:

m=0: 1 → 1.

m=1: 9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

m=3:63*(0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

m=4:16*(0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Sum:1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

So for m=2, fraction is 0.4 /2.3646 = approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%, which would be option D.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So the answer should be D.

But wait, why isn't the answer higher? Because the stability constant for m=2 is 40, which is higher than m=1 (9), but the ligand concentration is 0.1 M. Let me think about the effect of the ligand concentration on the fraction.

Wait, the higher the ligand concentration, the more higher-order complexes are favored. But here, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which may not be very high. So perhaps the dithiocyanato (m=2) is the most populated beyond the free ion?

Wait, let's see, the fractions:

m=0:1/2.3646 ≈0.423 →42.3%.

m=1:0.9/2.3646≈0.381 →38.1%.

m=2:0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

m=3:0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 →2.66%.

m=4:0.0016/2.3646≈0.000677 →0.0677%.

So the highest fraction is m=0 (free Co^2+), then m=1, then m=2, then m=3, and m=4 the least.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is m=2. So that's about 16.9%, option D.

But wait, the problem states that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check. Another approach could be to calculate the concentration of each species and then find the percentage.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is not D because I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute the fractions.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is the sum of all the beta_n * [SCN^-]^n, and then each species is (beta_n [SCN^-]^n) / denominator.

So let me compute each term again:

m=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 =1.

m=1:9 *0.1 =0.9.

m=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4
