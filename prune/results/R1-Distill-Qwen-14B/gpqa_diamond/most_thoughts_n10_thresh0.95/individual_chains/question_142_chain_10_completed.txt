Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubits space. Hmm.

The density matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. Pure states have a density matrix that's a projection operator, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but mixed states are combinations of these.

So, the given ρ looks like it's an equal mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩. Because each term is |n⟩⟨n|, which is a projection, and they're added together and scaled by 1/2. That makes sense for a mixed state with equal probabilities for each basis state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Qubits can be represented as points on a unit sphere in 3D space, known as the Bloch sphere. For a single qubit, any state can be written as (|0⟩ + e^{iθ} cos(φ/2) |1⟩)(⟨0| + e^{-iθ} cos(φ/2) ⟨1|), which simplifies to a vector (x, y, z) on the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but ρ is a density matrix, not a state vector. How does that work? Oh right, for a mixed state, if it's a convex combination of pure states, the density matrix can be represented by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So, if I can express ρ in that form, then r would give the coordinates on the Bloch sphere. Let's compute this. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Hmm, let's expand each term.

|0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in (1,1) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 in (2,2) position. Adding them gives a diagonal matrix with [1, 0; 0, 1], which is the identity matrix. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, ρ is (1/2) times the identity matrix, so ρ = (I)/2.

Okay, so now I can compare this with the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let me subtract I/2 from both sides: ρ - I/2 = (r·σ)/2. So, (r·σ)/2 must be zero. Because ρ is I/2. That implies that r·σ = 0. But σ is the vector of Pauli matrices (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z). So, the only way their sum is zero is if r is zero. Because if r has any component, then r·σ would contribute to the matrix.

Wait, let me think again. The identity matrix is (2x2) I. So, in the expression (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, each σ is a matrix. So for ρ to be I/2, the terms involving r must be zero. So, r must be (0, 0, 0). Because if r is zero, then the entire second part is zero, and we get ρ = I/2.

So the Bloch vector r is at the origin. That would correspond to the completely mixed state. Because in the Bloch sphere, the point at the origin represents the maximally mixed state, which has no coherence and equal probabilities for |0⟩ and |1⟩, which this ρ is. Because each of the diagonal terms is 1/2, but the off-diagonal terms are zero, indicating no coherence.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would correspond to the origin. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So, in terms of expectation values, what does that look like?

The expectation value for a Pauli matrix σ_x is Tr(ρ σ_x). Let's compute that. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ρ is (I)/2. So ρ σ_x is (I/2) * σ_x = (σ_x)/2. The trace is the sum of the diagonals. Diagonals are 0 and 0, so Tr(ρ σ_x) = 0. Similarly for σ_y and σ_z.

Wait, σ_z is diagonal. ρ is (1/2) I, and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So ρ σ_z is [[1/2, 0],[0, -1/2]]. The trace is 0.

So all the expectation values are zero. That would imply that the Bloch vector is (0, 0, 0), meaning the point is at the origin. Oh, right, that's correct. So the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the qubit space, which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state with equal probabilities for the basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) in the density matrix.

The general form of a density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector is:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that the terms involving \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) must vanish. This is only possible if \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

Thus, the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin on the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state along the \(z\)-axis.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.

Answer: C
