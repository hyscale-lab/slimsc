--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I should probably draw the structures to visualize the problem. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me parse that.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a substituent that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the substituent is a CH2 group connected to a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. Additionally, the ring has a formyl group (CHO) attached. So, the molecule is like a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a formyl group, and the other is a CH2-OH with a cyclohexyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the synthesis steps. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane. I think we're probably going to perform some kind of alkyne functionalization.

Ethyynylcyclohexane is CH2C≡CH linked to a cyclohexane. So maybe we can perform a hydroboration or some kind of addition to the triple bond. But looking at the options, some reagents like NaNH2 and methyl chloride are present. Oh wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methyl chloride is a methylating agent. Maybe a Grignard-like reaction?

Wait, another thought: ethynylcyclohexane could undergo a hydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution. Or maybe an alkylation.

Wait, the target molecule has a hydroxyl group attached as part of a CH2 group. So perhaps we need to introduce an OH group somewhere.

Looking at the options, they involve several reagents. Let me list the steps for each option.

Option A:
1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That sounds like maybe deprotonation followed by alkylation, introducing a methyl group.
2. H2/Pd: That's hydrogenation, probably reducing a triple bond to a single bond. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane with a methylene group (CH2).
3. Ba(OH)2: That's a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxidation. Wait, but in which step?
Wait, wait, the target has an aldehyde group. So how do we get that?

Option B:
1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So maybe deprotonation and ethylation.
2. Li/liq. NH3: That's a strong base, perhaps for elimination or forming a Grignard. 
3. O3 and H2O: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Then treatment with NH4OH (a reductive workup?), which would give aldehydes or ketones.

Option C:
1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: Alkylation.
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: Hydrogenation, maybe to reduce a triple bond to a single bond, but with CaCO3 as a catalyst? Or perhaps a different type of hydrogenation.
3. O3 and (CH3)2S: Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (like with dimethyl sulfide) which would give aldehydes instead of breaking into smaller fragments.
4. Ba(OH)2: Maybe for epoxidation or elimination again.

Option D:
1. NaNH2 and methanol: Maybe deprotonation and alkylation with methanol, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps deprotonation to form a strong base which reacts with something else.
2. Li and liq. NH3: Maybe elimination, forming an alkene.
3. O3 and (CH3)2S: Ozonolysis and reductive workup to form carbonyls.
4. NH4OH: Not sure, perhaps acid workup.

Hmm. Let's think about the synthesis pathway.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's imagine the target has a formyl group on the cyclohexane ring. So maybe we need to introduce a carbonyl group. How do you get a carbonyl from a triple bond?

One common method is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a triple bond would typically break it into carbonyl groups. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. Ozonolysis of an internal alkyne gives two carbonyl groups, but a terminal alkyne would give a ketone and a carboxylic acid, unless it's worked up differently.

Wait, but in the options, some steps involve O3 and then specific workups. For example, option B does O3 followed by H2O and NH4OH. Option C uses O3 and (CH3)2S.

Wait, if I perform ozonolysis on ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne, the ozonolysis would break the triple bond into a carbonyl group. But wait, the structure is -C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Ozonolysis would cleave this into a ketone and a formyl group. Wait, no, because ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne (like HC≡C-R) would produce R-CO and HCOOH (formic acid). But perhaps in a workup with (CH3)2S (which is a reductive workup), the formic acid would be reduced to formaldehyde. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, using H2O and Zn/H2O would give different products.

But in the target molecule, we have a formyl group on the cyclohexane. So maybe we need to form a carbonyl from the triple bond.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps we can functionalize the triple bond to add a substituent and then perform some kind of oxidation or hydrogenation.

Wait, let's think about each option's steps.

Option A: Step 1 - NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, probably deprotonates something. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. Maybe it's an alkylation. So if we have ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne, perhaps deprotonating the acidic proton adjacent to the triple bond, making it a strong base, then methyl chloride would methylate it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has protons alpha to the triple bond. The acidity of those protons is higher because of the sp-hybridized carbon. So NaNH2 would deprotonate it, generating a cyclohexenide with a triple bond. Then methyl chloride would provide a methyl group, perhaps alkylating the deprotonated site, making a di-substituted alkyne.

So after step 1, we might have something like CH2CH2C≡CMe attached to cyclohexane? Not sure.

Step 2: H2/Pd. This would hydrogenate the triple bond. So the alkyne becomes CH2-CH2 (but I'm not sure exactly what structure that would lead to). But then, after hydrogenation, we have a single bond. Maybe that creates a cyclohexane ring with a CH2CH2 group, but that seems a bit off.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a single bond, leading to a cyclohexane ring with a CH2CH2 group. Hmm, but that doesn't directly lead to the aldehyde.

Then step 3: Ba(OH)2. Maybe it's used for elimination or for epoxidation. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this pathway isn't correct.

Option B's steps: Step 1, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So maybe the same as before but adding an ethyl group. Then step 2 is Li and liquid NH3, which is a strong base, often used for eliminations or to form Grignard-like reagents. Step 3 is O3 followed by H2O and NH4OH. Ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups.

Wait, maybe the initial steps are for alkyne functionalization. Let me think. Ethynylcyclohexane, after step 1 (NaNH2 and ethyl chloride), would have an ethyl group added. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a deprotonation and alkylation, making a longer chain.

Then step 2: Li and NH3. That's a Birch reduction? Or perhaps it's for elimination. If we have a longer chain alkyne, perhaps it becomes an alkene upon elimination.

Wait, maybe after step 1, the alkyne is now longer, and step 2 converts it into an alkene via dehydrohalogenation or similar. Then ozonolysis would break the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

But the target has only one aldehyde group, so perhaps we need to have a single carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide? No, I don't think Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation.

Wait, maybe I should think about the target. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group. So perhaps we need to perform an oxidation or a carbonyl formation on the ring.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me re-express the target molecule.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane has two substituents: a formyl group (CHO) and a CH2OH substituent which is attached to another cyclohexyl group.

Wait, so the substituent is -CH2-OH with a cyclohexyl group attached. So that would be a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2-OH group to the main cyclohexane.

How do we get that structure from ethynylcyclohexane?

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a triple bond? No, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is -C≡CH.

So, the starting material is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne group.

So, perhaps the plan is to add some substituents to the alkyne, then functionalize it.

One approach could be:

1. Alkyne functionalization to add a substituent (like a methyl or ethyl group) via deprotonation and alkylation.

2. Convert the alkyne into a diol, perhaps via hydroboration. But the options don't have hydroboration steps.

Wait, looking at the options, the reagents involve hydrogenation, ozonolysis, etc.

Another approach: Perhaps first perform a hydration of the alkyne to form a ketone, but that's not directly possible. Alternatively, perhaps convert the alkyne into a cis-diol via some addition, but that's not among the steps.

Wait, perhaps the plan is:

- Functionalize the alkyne to add a substituent, then hydrogenate it, then introduce the OH group.

Wait, but the target has both a formyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to the same carbon (the CH2OH group).

Wait, no, the CH2OH is attached to the main ring, and the OH is on the CH2. So the structure is main cyclohexane ring with a CH2OH group (which is connected to another cyclohexyl group) and a formyl group.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Introducing a substituent on the alkyne.

2. Converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group.

3. Introducing the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a longer chain, which is then cleaved to form the aldehyde.

Wait, let's think about ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a triple bond? Ozonolysis is typically for alkenes. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe ozonolysis of the alkyne would form a diketone or other carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then undergoes ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

Wait, but the initial starting material is an alkyne, not an alkene. So I'm a bit confused about that.

Another thought: NaNH2 is used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Maybe in the first step, we're adding a substituent to the alkyne. For example, using NaNH2 as a base to deprotonate the alkyne (since the alpha protons are acidic), then methyl chloride would methylate it, adding a methyl group.

So ethynylcyclohexane after step 1 (NaNH2, MeCl) would become CH2-C≡C-R, where R is a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane? Or perhaps the alkyne becomes longer.

Wait, perhaps step 1 is an alkylation. Deprotonate the alkyne, which is acidic because of the sp-hybridization, then methyl chloride would add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.

So the alkyne becomes CH2C≡CMe attached to cyclohexane. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2CH2CH2Me attached to cyclohexane. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd would typically reduce it to a cis alkene if the hydrogenation is partial, but if it's complete hydrogenation (maybe under higher pressure), it would become a single bond (CH2-CH2-CH2Me). Wait, but that's a single bond, which would be an alkane.

Hmm. Then step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base, used in elimination reactions. So if we have a structure where hydrogenation leads to a structure that can eliminate, perhaps we form a double bond.

Wait, but after hydrogenation, it's a single bond. Ba(OH)2 might cause elimination, but you need adjacent H's for that. So maybe in step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene, and then Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is an oxidation. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is not typically used for oxidation. It's more for elimination or saponification.

Option B: Step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So maybe we're adding an ethyl group to the alkyne.

Then step 2 is Li and liquid NH3. That's a strong base, possibly for elimination. So maybe after adding an ethyl group, we eliminate to form an alkene.

Step 3 is O3 and H2O followed by NH4OH. Ozonolysis of an alkene would break it into carbonyl groups.

If after step 2, we have an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it. The target has a formyl group, so maybe the ozonolysis produces a formyl group on the cyclohexane.

But then, what about the hydroxyl group? The target has a CH2OH substituent.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

Add a substituent, hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene, then ozonolyse it to form carbonyl groups. Then, somehow introduce the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing the exact pathway.

Looking at option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So perhaps deprotonation and alkylation with a methyl group from methanol? Or maybe it's a substitution, but I'm not certain.

Step 2 is Li and liq. NH3. Again, strong base, perhaps elimination.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. That's a reductive workup, so ozonolysis would give aldehydes or ketones without further oxidation.

Step 4: NH4OH. Maybe an acid workup.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct pathway is to first add a substituent (like methyl) to the alkyne, then hydrogenate to an alkane, then form a double bond, then ozonolyse to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach. The target has a formyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to a CH2 group on the cyclohexane. Maybe the formyl group comes from ozonolysis of a triple bond, and the hydroxyl comes from some kind of hydroxylation.

Wait, but ozonolysis of ethynylcyclohexane would give formic acid and another group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a hydroxyl group after forming the formyl group.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a trans-diol, but that's not part of the reagents listed.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is epoxidized, but I don't think that's common.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

3. Then perform some elimination to form a double bond.

4. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but where would the OH come from?

Alternatively, maybe the hydroxyl group is introduced via an epoxide opening. But I don't see any epoxidation steps in the options.

Hmm. Let's try to think about each option.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: add methyl group.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the alkyne.

3. O3, (CH3)2S: ozonolysis with reductive workup.

4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, after step 1, the alkyne becomes longer (e.g., CH2-C≡C-Me). Then step 2 hydrogenates the alkyne to CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

Then step 3, O3 would do nothing, since it's an alkane. So that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternative approach: The target molecule: cyclohexane with a substituent that is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl and a formyl group.

So, perhaps the formyl group comes from the alkyne being oxidized to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about the reagents for that.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a cyclohexenone via some oxidation. But I don't recall a direct way to do that.

Alternatively, perhaps we can perform a hydrohalogenation to add a substituent, then eliminate to form a double bond, which can then undergo ozonolysis.

Wait, but the options don't include hydrohalogenation steps. Let me check the options again.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol, Li and NH3, then O3 and (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

After step 1, maybe the alkyne is deprotonated and then reacts with methanol, introducing an OMe group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, NaNH2 and methanol could lead to a substitution, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The target has a formyl group. How can that form? Ozonolysis of a di-substituted alkyne would give two carbonyl groups. But ethynylcyclohexane is a monosubstituted alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone. But I don't see any oxidation steps in the options except for Ba(OH)2, which is a base.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the correct pathway is to perform a coupling reaction. But the options don't have typical coupling reagents.

Ok, perhaps it's time to think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option B:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: So, deprotonate the alkyne, then ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group. So the alkyne becomes longer.

2. Li and liquid NH3: This is a strong base, perhaps causing elimination. So the longer alkyne might eliminate to form an alkene.

3. O3, H2O, NH4OH: Ozonolysis of the alkene would form carbonyl groups.

So, let's imagine:

After step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane becomes ethyl-ethynylcyclohexane (maybe), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step is adding a substituent to the alkyne. Ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to the ring. Deprotonation and alkylation would make CH2-C≡C-R, where R is the substituent.

So, after step 1, R is ethyl. Then step 2: Li and NH3. Li in NH3 is a strong base, used for eliminations. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but we don't have any halogen here. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination of a proton to form a triple bond into a longer chain, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into an alkene. Wait, alkyne to alkene via elimination? Hmm, perhaps via deprotonation and elimination.

Wait, the alkyne after step 1 is CH2-C≡C-Et (if R is ethyl). Step 2 with Li/NH3 might deprotonate and eliminate, forming an alkene. So CH2-C≡C-Et would become CH2-CH2-CH2-Et? No, because elimination would require removing two protons. Maybe it becomes CH2=CH-CH2-Et?

Hmm, not sure. Then step 3: Ozonolysis of the alkene would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if we have CH2-CH2-CH2-Et, perhaps ozonolysis would form two aldehydes. But I'm not sure about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a trans-alkene, which upon ozonolysis would form a ketone and an aldehyde.

Wait, the target has one aldehyde. So perhaps the ozonolysis is cutting the molecule into two parts, one of which has the aldehyde group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think about the hydroxyl group. How does the hydroxyl group get introduced?

Looking at the target, the hydroxyl is on a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane. So perhaps that's introduced via an epoxide ring-opening, or via some kind of addition.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into an alkene, then hydroboration is done to add an OH group. But the options don't have hydroboration steps.

Wait, looking at the options, the reagents include Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. It can cause elimination or saponification. Alternatively, it can be used in the Birch reduction, but that usually involves other reagents.

Wait, in option D, step 4 is NH4OH. That's ammonium hydroxide, perhaps used in a workup after ozonolysis.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of the target as a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a formyl group and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group.

So, perhaps the formyl comes from ozonolysis of a triple bond, and the hydroxyl comes from a substitution or addition.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the alkyne is subjected to hydroboration to form a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis is as follows:

1. Alkyne alkylation (step 1 in options) to add a substituent.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

3. Introduce a double bond via elimination (using a base like Ba(OH)2).

4. Ozonolyse the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is synthesized via a Heck reaction or similar, but the options don't include such reagents.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add a substituent to the alkyne, then hydrogenate, then introduce a double bond, then ozonolyse to form the aldehyde.

Looking at option C:

After step 1, the alkyne is longer (with a methyl group). Step 2 hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond. Step 3 ozonolysis would do nothing since it's a single bond. So perhaps that's not the right path.

Option B's step 3 is O3 and H2O, which would form carbonyl groups if an alkene is present. So, after step 2, which forms an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

So, for the target to have a formyl group, perhaps one end becomes a formyl group, and the other becomes another substituent, which is then modified.

But I'm still not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group on the same cyclohexane as the formyl group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a substituent (like a methyl group) to the alkyne, then hydrogenating the alkyne to a CH2 group, then introducing an oxygen-containing group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alcohol, then oxidized to a carbonyl. But the reagents don't include oxidizing agents except perhaps for ozonolysis.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is subjected to a hydration reaction to form a ketone, but I don't think that's one of the reagents.

Wait, another thought: The target's substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. That suggests perhaps a substitution, where the OH group replaces the alkyne's hydrogen.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is added via a Grignard reaction. But the options don't include Mg-based reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reagents involve adding a methyl group, then hydrogenating, then introducing an OH via oxidation.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think step by step.

Option D: Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol.

NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol could act as an electrophile. So perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, and methanol provides a methyl group via alkylation. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2-C≡C-OCH3 (but that seems like an ether formation, which I'm not sure about).

Wait, no, NaNH2 and MeCl would be alkylation. But with methanol, perhaps it's a methoxy group.

Step 2: Li and NH3. That's a strong base, used for eliminations. So perhaps it's eliminating to form an alkene.

So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Not sure.

Then step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup would form aldehydes or ketones.

Step 4: NH4OH. Acid workup perhaps.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target.

Another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the main cyclohexane via a CH2-OH group. So perhaps the CH2-OH is introduced via a substitution reaction, where the alkyne's proton is replaced by an OH group.

But I'm not sure how that would happen with the given reagents.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:

Reagents:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: alkylate the alkyne.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S: ozonolysis of a double bond, but wait, after hydrogenation, it's a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

So perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, could the order be different? Maybe after adding a methyl group, the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonolysis is done on that alkene.

Wait, that would require step 2 to be partial hydrogenation, not full. So perhaps step 2 uses a poisoned catalyst to hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.

Wait, but option C says H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd on CaCO3 is typically used for hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds, not double bonds.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation (NaNH2, MeCl) to make a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene (using H2 and a different catalyst that stops at the alkene stage).

3. Ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

4. Introduce the hydroxyl group.

But the options don't exactly fit this.

Wait, another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the main ring via a CH2-OH. So perhaps the cyclohexyl group is added via a substitution or alkylation.

But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: alkylation.

2. Li/NH3: elimination to form an alkene.

3. O3, H2O, NH4OH: ozonolysis and workup.

So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes ethyl-ethynylcyclohexane after step 1. Then step 2 forms an alkene. Ozonolysis would break this into two carbonyl groups.

If the alkene is in the right position, one end becomes the formyl group, and the other becomes something else, which may be the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, option C's steps:

1. Alkylation with methyl chloride.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne.

3. Ozonolysis.

Wait, but after step 2, the alkyne is a single bond, so ozonolysis doesn't affect it.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagent sequence is:

1. Add a substituent (like ethyl) to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form a carbonyl.

But I don't see that in the options. Looking at option B, step 2 might form an alkene, which is then ozonolyzed.

So, assuming the alkyne becomes an alkene after step 2, then step 3 would form carbonyl groups.

The target has a formyl group, so that must come from one end of the ozonolysis.

Then, perhaps the other part is the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol: maybe deprotonate and form an alcohol.

2. Li and NH3: elimination to form an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis with reductive workup to form aldehydes.

4. NH4OH: neutralization.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D.

Let me imagine:

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane reacts with NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 deprotonates the alkyne, making a strong base. Methanol (CH3OH) could act as an electrophile. The deprotonated alkyne attacks the methyl group from methanol, leading to a substitution where the -C≡CH becomes -CH2-OCH3. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3. A strong base, perhaps causing elimination. So, if we have a structure like CH2-OCH3 attached to the cyclohexane, perhaps elimination would form an alkene.

So, after step 2, we have a cyclohexane with a CH2-OCH2- group and an adjacent CH2 group, forming an alkene.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Then step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

So, if the alkene is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would form two aldehydes.

Then step 4: NH4OH. Acid workup, perhaps.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target molecule.

Hmm.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for the correct answer by elimination.

The target has a formyl group, which suggests that ozonolysis is used somewhere. Also, the presence of an OH group suggests that an alcohol is formed, perhaps via epoxide opening or hydroboration.

Looking at the options, only options B, C, and D involve O3.

In option A, there's no ozonolysis, so it's less likely because the target has a formyl group, which is a carbonyl, likely from ozonolysis.

So, options B, C, D are possible.

In option B, after ozonolysis, the workup is with H2O and NH4OH. Ozonolysis with H2O workup usually gives carboxylic acids or ketones, depending on the structure.

In option C, ozonolysis is followed by (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes or ketones.

In option D, ozonolysis is followed by (CH3)2S as well.

So, the formyl group would come from ozonolysis, and the substituent would come from the alkylation step.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Add a substituent (ethyl) to the alkyne, then hydrogenate it to an alkene, then ozonolyse to form a formyl group and another group, which is then modified.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

In option B, after ozonolysis, the workup is with NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent. So, any carbonyls would be reduced to CH2OH groups? Or maybe not.

Wait, wait. Ozonolysis of an internal alkene typically gives carbonyl groups. For a terminal alkene, ozonolysis might give a formyl group and another carbonyl.

So, if we have an alkene like CH2=CH-R, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes if R is a methyl group, for example.

But I'm not exactly sure.

In the target, the cyclohexane has a formyl group and a CH2OH group attached to a cyclohexyl group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: alkylation.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond. So, CH2-C≡C-Me becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S: but this is a single bond, so ozonolysis doesn't act. So step 3 wouldn't change anything.

So, that can't be right.

Option D's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S.

So, going back to option D.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is for deprotonation and substitution, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH. How can that form?

Perhaps via a substitution, where a leaving group is replaced by an OH group. But I don't see any leaving groups in the initial structure.

Wait, perhaps the CH2-OH is formed via hydroboration of an alkene. But the options don't include BH3.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think I need to make an educated guess.

The correct sequence likely involves:

1. Alkyne alkylation (NaNH2, methyl or ethyl chloride).

2. Conversion to an alkene via elimination.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups (aldehydes).

4. Introduce the hydroxyl group via some means.

Looking at the options, option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, perhaps for epoxide formation or elimination. But I'm not sure how that would introduce the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, option D's step 4 is NH4OH, which could be for workup or introducing an OH group.

Wait, another thought: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH. That suggests that a cyclohexyl group is added via some kind of substitution or alkylation.

But I'm not seeing that.

Given all this, I'll have to choose the option that best fits the steps to form the formyl group and the hydroxymethyl group.

I think option C: after alkylation and hydrogenation, perhaps a double bond is formed, and ozonolysis breaks it into a formyl group and another group.

Wait, but after step 2 in option C, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, making it an alkane, so step 3 (ozone) wouldn't react.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

So, after adding an ethyl group, elimination forms an alkene, which on ozonolysis forms a formyl group and another carbonyl, and then the NH4OH workup gives the hydroxyl groups.

Putting it all together, I'll go with option B.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the correct sequence of reagents must achieve the following transformations:

1. **Functionalize the alkyne**: Introduce a substituent to the terminal alkyne group in ethynylcyclohexane. This can be achieved by deprotonating the alkyne (using NaNH₂) and performing alkylation with a reagent like ethyl chloride.

2. **Convert the alkyne to an alkene**: After alkylation, the alkyne is converted into an alkene. This can be done using a strong base like Li/NH₃, which facilitates elimination.

3. **Ozonolysis of the alkene**: Ozonolysis (O₃) followed by a reductive workup (e.g., with H₂O and NH₄OH) cleaves the alkene into two carbonyl groups. One end of the alkene forms a formyl group (CHO), which corresponds to the aldehyde in the target molecule.

4. **Introduce the hydroxyl group**: The hydroxyl group (OH) on the CH₂ group in the target molecule can be introduced during or after the ozonolysis step, depending on the specific reagents and conditions.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes H₂/Pd for hydrogenation, but this reduces the alkyne to a single bond, which does not align with the need to form an alkene for ozonolysis. This option is unlikely to yield the target molecule.
- **Option B**: 
  1. NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the alkyne.
  2. Li/NH₃ eliminates to form an alkene.
  3. Ozonolysis (O₃, H₂O, NH₄OH) cleaves the alkene into carbonyl groups, forming the aldehyde and another functional group.
  This sequence aligns well with the required transformations.
- **Option C**: After alkylation and hydrogenation, the alkyne is reduced to a single bond, making ozonolysis ineffective. This option does not produce the necessary alkene for ozonolysis.
- **Option D**: While it includes ozonolysis, the use of methanol in the first step does not clearly lead to the required alkylation and elimination sequence. The pathway is less straightforward compared to Option B.

### Conclusion:
Option B provides the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize the target molecule by alkylating the alkyne, converting it into an alkene, and performing ozonolysis to form the aldehyde and other functional groups.
