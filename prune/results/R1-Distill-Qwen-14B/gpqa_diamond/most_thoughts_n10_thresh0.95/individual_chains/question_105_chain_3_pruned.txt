Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area, and the spots are cooler—1000K less than the star's effective temperature of 6000K. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the brightness variations observed would look like those caused by an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star. They want the ratio Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm, so I think this involves figuring out the change in brightness (the signal) caused by the spots and then comparing it to the signal from a planet transit.

First, I should calculate the brightness variation due to the spots. When a star has spots, part of its surface is darker. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing dips in brightness. The amplitude of these dips depends on the area of the spots and how much darker they are compared to the rest of the star.

So, the star's radius is Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So if the spots are 20% coverage on that hemisphere, that's 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10% of the total surface area of the star. Or wait, maybe the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere. So the spot area is 20% of one hemisphere. Since a hemisphere is half the star, the total spot area is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) = 0.1 π Rstar². Wait, but maybe I don't need to get that detailed right now.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so T_spot = 5000 K.

The brightness variation would be the difference in flux when the spots are visible. The star's total flux without spots is F = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4. But when a spot is visible, part of that flux is replaced by the spot's flux. So the change in flux ΔF is (F_spot - F_unspotted) multiplied by the area fraction.

Alternatively, the fractional change in brightness is (ΔF)/F_total.

Let me think: The flux from a spot is F_spot = σ T_spot^4. The flux from the surrounding area (unspotted) is σ T_star^4. So the change in flux per unit area when the spot is present is (F_spot - F_unspotted) = σ(T_spot^4 - T_star^4).

The area of the spot is A_spot = 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) because 20% is the filling factor on a hemisphere. Wait, the star is a sphere, so total surface area is 4π Rstar². One hemisphere is 2π Rstar². So 20% coverage (filling factor) on a hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar². So the area of the spots is 0.4 π Rstar².

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so the area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2π Rstar²) = 0.4 π Rstar². So that's the area of spots.

The total flux when spots are visible (i.e., when the star is rotating such that spots are in view) is:

F_total = (Area_unspotted * F_unspotted) + (Area_spot * F_spotted)

But F_unspotted is per unit area, so for the whole star, F would be:

F = (4π Rstar² - A_spot) * σ Teff^4 + A_spot * σ T_spot^4

Then the fractional change is (F - F0) / F0, where F0 is the flux without spots.

So F0 = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4.

F = F0 - A_spot σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)

Wait, because F_spotted is σ T_spot^4, so F = F0 * [ (4π Rstar² - A_spot)/4π Rstar² * Teff^4 + (A_spot /4 π Rstar²) T_spot^4 ]

Alternatively, simplifying:

F = F0 [ (1 - A_spot/(4π Rstar²)) Teff^4 + (A_spot/(4π Rstar²)) T_spot^4 ]

Which can be written as F0 [ Teff^4 - (A_spot/(4π Rstar²))(Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ]

So the fractional change, (F - F0)/F0 = - (A_spot/(4π Rstar²)) (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

But since the spot is cooler, the flux is lower when the spot is on the visible side, so the fractional change is negative, but in terms of amplitude, we take the absolute value.

So the amplitude would be (A_spot/(4π Rstar^2)) (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

F0 = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4.

When the spot is visible, the flux is lower by A_spot σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4). So:

ΔF = - A_spot σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

So fractional change δ = ΔF / F0 = [ - A_spot σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 π Rstar² σ Teff^4 )

Simplify: δ = - (A_spot / (4 π Rstar² )) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4

Taking absolute value, |δ| = (A_spot / (4 π Rstar^2 )) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

Now, A_spot is the area covered by the spots. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20%, A_spot = 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

So A_spot = 0.4 π Rstar².

Plugging that into the equation:

δ = (0.4 π Rstar² ) / (4 π Rstar² ) * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4

Simplify denominator: 4 pi Rstar^2 / 4 pi Rstar^2 is 1/4.

So (0.4/4) = 0.1.

So δ = 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4.

Now, compute (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4.

I can factor this as 1 - (5000/6000)^4.

5000 /6000 = 5/6 ≈0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So δ = 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈0.051775, or about 5.18% decrease in brightness.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is about 5.18%.

Now, we need to find the radius of a planet that would produce the same amplitude when it transits the star. The transit method causes a dip in brightness equal to (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet passes directly in front of the star.

So (R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.051775.

Taking the square root: R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.051775).

Let me calculate that. sqrt(0.051775) = approx 0.2276.

Wait, wait, 0.2276 squared is 0.0518, which is correct.

But wait, wait—did I do that correctly? Because 0.2276^2 is:

0.2276 *0.2276 = let's compute:

0.2 *0.2 =0.04.

0.0276 *0.2 =0.00552.

Same for cross terms: (0.2 +0.0276)^2 = 0.04 + 2*(0.2*0.0276) + (0.0276)^2.

Which is 0.04 + 0.01104 + 0.00076176 ≈0.0518.

Yes, that's correct.

So R_p / R_star ≈0.2276, about 22.76% of the star's radius.

Looking at the options:

Option A is ~0.39, which is 39%—too big.

Option B is ~0.07, which is 7%—too small.

Option C is ~0.11, 11%—still smaller.

Option D is ~0.32, which is 32%—bigger than our 22.7%.

Wait, none of the options match 0.2276. Let me recheck my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the area of the spots.

Wait, the star's radius is Rstar, same as Sun. The filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 times the hemisphere area.

Hemisphere area is 2π Rstar².

So A_spot = 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

Yes, that's correct.

So (A_spot / (4π Rstar²)) = (0.4 π Rstar²) / (4 π Rstar²) )= 0.4 /4 = 0.1.

So that part is correct.

Then, (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4.

Wait, 6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 is (5e3)^4 = 625e12.

So (1296e12 - 625e12) = 671e12.

Divided by 1296e12 gives 671/1296 ≈ 0.5177.

So that's correct.

Thus, δ = 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177. So 5.177% dip.

So the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p / Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So R_p = Rstar * sqrt(0.05177) ≈ Rstar * 0.2276.

But looking at the options, none is 0.227.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, none of these match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the area. Let me recheck.

Wait, what is the area of the spots.

The star's surface area is 4π Rstar².

If a hemisphere is 2π Rstar², and the spots cover 20% of that, the area is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

So the ratio A_spot / (4π Rstar²) is 0.4 π Rstar² / (4 π Rstar²) ) = 0.1, which is correct.

So the calculation seems right.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about the maximum amplitude observed. Because when the spots are on the far side, there's no dip, and when they rotate into view, the dip is maximum.

Wait, but that's not the case. The star has spots on one hemisphere. So when it's viewed from Earth, as it rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. So the brightness variation would be a dip of about 5%, as calculated.

Wait, but the question states that the situation can 'closely resemble' an exoplanet transit. So perhaps the observed dip is similar to the dip from a planet.

But I'm supposed to find the planet radius that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So the dip from the planet is (R_p / Rstar)^2.

So our calculation suggests R_p is about 0.227 Rstar.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem.

Wait, thinking again: when the spots are on the hemisphere, say the front hemisphere, and the star rotates, the spot area visible from Earth changes. Wait, but in the question, the star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So when it's viewed edge-on, as it's rotating, the spots would come into view on one side and then disappear on the other.

Wait, but the exact way the spots affect the light curve depends on their position. But in any case, the maximum dip would be when the spot is fully visible.

Wait, but maybe I should model the brightness variation as a function of the spot coverage.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the entire spot area is facing us. Wait, the star is a sphere, and the spots are on a single hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view for half the rotation period. So maybe the average brightness variation is a sinusoidal variation with a certain amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation is modeled as the spot area being a fraction f of the star's surface, and the change in brightness would be f * (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted.

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach.

The fractional change would be f * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/Teff^4.

In our case, f is 0.2 (20% coverage), but wait, if the spots are on a hemisphere, but we can only see them when that hemisphere is facing us. So the fraction of the time that the spots are visible is 0.5 (half the rotation period), but the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 10% of the star's total surface.

Wait, no, because when the star is viewed face-on, the entire hemisphere is visible. Hmm, perhaps the maximum amplitude occurs when the spots are fully in view, but the average variation would involve the spots being in and out of view.

Wait, but I think the problem is considering the maximum dip when the spots are fully visible. Because spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star is rotating, the spots go from being fully visible (max dip) to not visible (no dip). So the amplitude would be the maximum dip when the spots are fully in view, which is when the entire spot area is covering part of the star's disk.

So perhaps my initial approach was correct: the maximum amplitude is 5.18%.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not just the hemisphere. Oh wait, that's a possibility. Because sometimes filling factor refers to the entire surface.

Wait, the question says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor of 20% is of the hemisphere.

So the area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2.

Which is 0.4 pi R^2. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/Teff
