--- Full Content ---
Okay, I need to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me take it step by step.

First, looking at the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but a broad peak could also be from an alcohol (like an -OH group) or maybe a carbonyl group with some hydrogen bonding, but I'm not sure. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 peak is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, maybe from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl group, maybe conjugated like in an ester or amide, or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds (like C=C in an aromatic ring, but that's usually around 1600 maybe). Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're on a double bond, like in an alkene or aromatic ring. So the compound likely has a double bond or aromatic structure.

Mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let's think about what has a mass of 45. Maybe (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Wait, acetone is (propan-2-one), formula C3H6O. The molecular ion for that would be 58 (C3H6O is 3*12 +6*1 +16=36+6+16=58). But wait, the fragment at 45 is 45. So perhaps it's (CH3)CO, which is 45? Wait, 45 would be (CH3)2CO? Wait, no, (CH3)2CO is (CH3)2-C=O. The molecular weight of that is (2*15) +12 +16 = 30 +28=58, which is the same as before. So maybe the fragment is an ethyl group loss or something else.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be the ketone group. Maybe it's a fragment where a CH3 group is lost, leaving something else. Alternatively, maybe the compound has an ester group. The ester functional group can break down in mass spec. For example, an ester R-O-CO-R' might lose the R-O- part as a fragment. Alternatively, maybe a cleavage occurs at the ester group.

Wait, let me think about the possible options. The options given are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.

Let me calculate the molecular formulas:

- C6H12O: molecular weight is 6*12 +12 +16 = 72+12+16=100.
- C6H10O: 6*12=72 +10=82 +16=98.
- C6H10O2: 6*12=72 +10=82 +32=104.
- C6H12O2: 72 +12=84 +32=116.

So the molecular ion would vary based on which is correct.

But wait, in the mass spec, the fragment is at m/z 45. Let me think about possible groups that would give a fragment of 45.

45 could be (CH3)2CO (molecular weight 58). But a fragment of 45 would perhaps be a part of that. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)CO-, which would be 45? Let me calculate that: (CH3)CO- is (15 + 29) = 44. Hmm, not 45. Wait, maybe it's a different structure. Another possibility: the fragment could be a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of C3H7O, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene group or something.

Wait, another approach: think about the functional groups. The FTIR has two strong peaks in the carbonyl region. So the compound probably has two carbonyl groups. Or maybe one carbonyl and another group causing the 1650. Wait, but 1650 is still in the carbonyl region, but lower than 1700. So perhaps one is a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester) and another is conjugated, like an aromatic ring (maybe C=C in an aromatic ring, which is around 1600, but 1650 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe an amide, but the options don't have N.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so maybe the molecule has an alkene or aromatic ring. So perhaps the structure is something like a substituted cyclohexene with a carbonyl group.

If there are two carbonyl groups, that would suggest either an anhydride, ester, ketone plus something else, or maybe a diketone. Alternatively, maybe one is a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

So, the possible structures could have a ketone and an ester, or perhaps two ketones. But looking at the options, I need to see which molecular formulas include multiple oxygen-containing groups.

The options with O2 are C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. So that might be esters, or maybe ketones and another group.

Now, the mass spec. If the molecule fragments to give a peak at 45, perhaps that's a key group. Let's think about common fragment ions. For example, in esters, the molecule might break into the acid part and the alcohol part. So an ester R-O-CO-R' might lose R-O- as a fragment. If the R is, say, methyl, then R-O would be 31 (CH3O), but 45 is bigger.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketone. For example, if the molecule breaks at the carbonyl, leaving a (CH3)2CO group, which is 58. But 45 is lower. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: a fragment at m/z 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Not matching. Or perhaps it's the acetyl group, which is (CH3)CO+. The molecular weight of that would be 43 (12*2 +3*1 +16 = 24 +3 +16=43). But the fragment is 45. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group or something else.

Wait, another approach: let me think about the possible functional groups. The presence of a broad IR peak suggests an O-H group. So maybe it's an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But the 1700 cm^-1 could be an ester or ketone.

If the compound is an ester, then the formula would be R-O-CO-R'. Esters have two oxygen atoms. So looking at the options, the options with O2 are C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. So the possible candidates are options C (C6H10O2) and A (C6H12O2).

Now, the alcohol group would imply an -OH, which would show up in the IR as a broad peak. So if the compound is an ester, it would have an O-H from an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if it's a ketone and an ester, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, another possibility: the compound could be a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which would still have an ester group and no free -OH, but the IR would show a broad peak because of the ester's hydrogen bonding. Hmm, not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diol ester, but that's probably beyond the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. A carboxylic acid would show a very broad peak around 2500-3300 cm^-1, which matches the given data's 3000 cm^-1. The 1700 cm^-1 would be the C=O stretch of the carboxylic acid, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring (if present) or another carbonyl group. Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak from O-H and a strong peak around 1700. But the presence of another peak at 1650 might suggest another functional group.

Wait, but the options don't have a formula with more than two oxygen atoms. So, maybe the compound is a substituted cyclohexene with a ketone group. Let me think: cyclohexene would have a double bond, which would explain the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR. If there's a ketone group, that would fit the 1700 cm^-1 IR peak. But where does the 1650 come from? Perhaps conjugation with the double bond. Wait, a conjugated dienone? So, maybe it's something like cyclohexenone.

Wait, cyclohexenone would have a carbonyl group (so 1700 cm^-1) and a conjugated double bond, which might cause the carbonyl peak to shift downfield a bit, but I'm not sure if that would bring it to 1650. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a ketone group. Like acetophenone derivatives.

Wait, looking at the options again. Let's see:

Option A: C6H12O2. So that's two oxygen atoms. Maybe an ester (like methyl cyclohexanoate) or a ketone plus an ester.

Option C: C6H10O2. So two oxygen, but less hydrogen. Maybe a di-substituted ester or a cyclic ester.

Wait, considering the mass spec fragment at 45. Let's think about possible structures. For example, if the compound is a di-substituted ester, like methyl propionate or something else. Wait, but methyl would be a small fragment. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone). Let's think about the structure. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage. The molecular formula would depend on the substituents. If it's a gamma or delta lactone, perhaps.

Wait, the molecular weight of the unknown compound would be either 100 (C6H12O), 98 (C6H10O), 104 (C6H10O2), or 116 (C6H12O2). So which of these would give a fragment at 45?

Hmm, another angle: the molecular formula. Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N.

For each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. (2*6+2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two rings or double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. (14-10)/2=2. So two rings or double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O. (14-12)/2=1. One ring or double bond.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which indicates at least one double bond. So each option must have at least one double bond, so degrees of unsaturation >=1.

Now, looking at the NMR, if there are vinyl hydrogens, it's either an alkene or an aromatic ring. Let's consider that. If the compound contains an aromatic ring, that would account for several degrees of unsaturation. For example, a benzene ring has three degrees of unsaturation (three double bonds). If the formula has, say, C6H10O2, which has two degrees of unsaturation, but a benzene ring would require three, so that may not fit. So perhaps the compound doesn't have an aromatic ring but an alkene.

Wait, but the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650. If the molecule has a conjugated system, like an enone (conjugated double bond and ketone), that could explain the 1650 cm^-1. Enones have conjugated C=C-C=O, which can cause shifts in the carbonyl peak. So perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexenone.

But cyclohexenone would be C6H10O. Let's see: cyclohexenone's formula is C6H10O. So that's option B. But the IR has another peak at 1650. Hmm, maybe another carbonyl group? Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring, but then the degrees of unsaturation would not match.

Wait, another thought: the IR has two strong peaks in the carbonyl region. So perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups. For that, the formula must have at least two oxygen atoms. So options with O2 are A (C6H12O2), C (C6H10O2), and D (O only, so no). So the possible options are A, B, C, D, but only A and C have O2.

Wait, so if the compound has two carbonyl groups, that would account for the two IR peaks. So perhaps it's an ester and a ketone, or two ester groups, or a ketone and another carbonyl group.

Wait, if it's an ester (O2), then the formula would be either A or C.

So, assuming the compound has two carbonyl groups, let's think about their structures.

Ester: R-O-CO-R'. So two oxygen atoms. If the compound is an ester, then the formula would be C6H10O2 or C6H12O2.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, meaning the ester might be part of a ring or have a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diketone, but that would require two ketone groups. Let's see: a cyclic diketone? For example, 1,2-cyclohexanedione. Its formula would be C6H10O2. So that's option C.

In that case, the IR would show two strong carbonyl peaks. The 1700 and 1650 might correspond to two slightly different carbonyl groups, perhaps due to conjugation or ring strain.

The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens from a double bond. Wait, but 1,2-cyclohexanedione doesn't have a double bond. So that's a problem. So maybe it's not that.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, methyl cyclohex-2-enoate.

Methyl cyclohex-2-enoate would have the formula C7H10O2. But our options are all C6, so that's out. Hmm.

Wait, another option: the compound has an ester group and an alkene. Like, maybe a substituted ester with a double bond. Let's think about the molecular formula.

For example, let's say the ester is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like methyl vinyl ester. But that's more like C4H6O2. Our options are C6, so maybe a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Another approach: looking at the mass spec. The fragment at 45. Let's think of possible structures that would lose a group and leave a 45 fragment. For example, if the compound is an ester, perhaps the ester oxygen breaks, and the RCO part remains. For example, if the ester is R-O-CO-R', then R'CO would be the fragment. If R' is CH2CH2... wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could be the result of a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in mass spectrometry of ketones or esters. A McLafferty rearrangement typically results in a fragment that is seven mass units less than the molecular ion. But I'm not exactly sure how that would apply here.

Wait, if the molecular ion is, say, 104 (like option C: C6H10O2), then 104 - 45 = 59. That doesn't seem directly relevant. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from breaking off a group that weighs 45. So if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the rest would be CxHyOz, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecular formula of the options. For example, option C is C6H10O2. If that's the case, perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond. For instance, methyl cyclohex-2-enoate would have the formula C7H10O2, which is one carbon more than option C. So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted ester with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a diketone with an alkene. For example, something like cyclohexenone with another ketone group. But that would require more oxygen, but our options don't have more than O2.

Wait, perhaps the compound is benzaldehyde derivative. But benzaldehyde would have a molecular formula of C7H6O, which doesn't match the options.

Hmm, maybe I should focus more on the IR and NMR data. The IR has a broad peak, which suggests an -OH group. So the compound is likely an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But then the 1700 cm^-1 would imply an ester or ketone.

Wait, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

If it's an alcohol with a carbonyl group, like a ketone, then that would fit the IR. The broad peak could be the hydroxyl group. So the formula would have O in the alcohol and another O in the carbonyl, making O2. So that would fit options A or C.

But then the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So the structure would have an alkene. So perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group and a double bond. Or maybe it's an allylic alcohol with a ketone. Wait, but the formula would then have to be C6H10O2.

Wait, another thought: the presence of two carbonyl groups may not necessarily mean two separate carbonyl groups. Maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So, for example, a conjugated system where the carbonyl is next to a double bond. This could cause the carbonyl peak to shift to a lower wavenumber, around 1700 and maybe another nearby. Wait, but there are two peaks, so maybe two separate carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester with a carbonyl group. So, for example, a structure like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2, but that's just a simple ester. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ester, like phenyl acetate, but that would have a benzene ring, which would mean more oxygen or a different formula.

Wait, considering the mass spec again. If the fragment is at 45, perhaps it's a (CH3)CO group, which is 45? Let me calculate: (CH3)CO is (12 + (3*1) ) + (12 + 16) ) = 15 + 28 = 43. No, that's 43. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a COOCH3 group. The molecular weight of COOCH3 is 12 + 16*2 +15 = 12 +32 +15=59. So that's not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a ketene group, which is O=C=O, but that's 44. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group attached to something. Wait, propyl is 3 carbons, so maybe a CH2CH2CH2O group, but that's 59 (12*3 + 8 +16=36+8+16=60). Hmm, no.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the acetyl group (CH3CO), which is 43. Still not 45.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2COO group, which would be 58. No, that's higher.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let's think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be an ester (like methyl cyclohexanoate), which would have a formula of C7H12O2. Oh, but that's more than six carbons. So perhaps a six-carbon ester, like methyl pentanoate. Methyl pentanoate is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOCH3. That's 8 carbons. So perhaps not matching.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a six-membered ring. But I'm not sure about the formula.

Option C: C6H10O2. So, molecular formula is C6H10O2. That's two degrees of unsaturation. So, perhaps one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds. Since the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, there's a double bond. So, maybe a ring with a double bond and an ester group.

Wait, what about a structure like cyclohexene with an ester substituent? For example, an ester group attached to a cyclohexene ring. That would give a formula of C6H10O2.

So, the structure could be something like cyclohexene with an ester group attached. Then, the IR would show the broad peak from the ester's O-H (if it's an alcohol, but wait, esters don't have O-H groups. Oh wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R', so the O-H is in the alcohol part. So maybe the compound is an ester and has an -OH group elsewhere, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recap:

- FTIR: broad peak at ~3000 cm^-1 (likely O-H, so either alcohol or carboxylic acid), strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 (probably two carbonyl groups or conjugated carbonyl).
- 1H NMR: vinyl protons (so double bond present).
- Mass spec: fragment at 45.

Looking at the options with two O's (A and C), and considering the possible structures.

If the compound has two carbonyl groups, perhaps it's an ester and a ketone. But then the formula would have O2. Let's think about possible structures.

Alternatively, the compound could be a diester, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters have two carbonyl groups: one from the ester and one from the ketone. So their structure is RCOCOR', which would have two carbonyls. The IR would show two strong peaks. The formula would include O2.

A beta-keto ester would have the formula RCO-COOR'. Let's see, if the main chain is four carbons, R could be CH2CH2, but let's get into specifics. For instance, ethyl acetoacetate is a beta-keto ester with the formula C5H8O2. But our options are six carbons. So perhaps something like pentyl something. Hmm.

But the options are C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. Let me see the molecular formula of a beta-keto ester. Suppose the structure is CH2CH2CO-COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C6H10O3, which isn't one of the options. So that's out.

Hmm, maybe the compound has a conjugated dienone system. Let's say a six-carbon chain with a conjugated double bond and a ketone. But then the formula would need to fit.

Let's say it's something like CH2=CH-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's 6 carbons. The formula would be C6H10O. That's option B. But option B has only one O. So no, that's not matching.

Wait, but if there are two carbonyl groups, like two ketones. For example, 1,3-cyclohexanedione, which would be C6H10O2. So that's option C. But does that structure have a double bond? No, it's a cyclohexane with two ketone groups. So it wouldn't have vinyl hydrogens in the NMR. That's a problem.

So maybe the structure is a diketone with an adjacent double bond, like 1,2-cyclohexanedione but with a double bond. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Another approach: the mass spec fragment. 45 is a common fragment for (CH3CO)OCH2CH3 (ethyl acetate would be C4H8O2, but the fragment would be different). Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from the ester group.

Wait, if the compound is a di-substituted ester, like ethyl propionate, but that's C5H10O2. No, not matching our options.

Alternatively, maybe it's a lactone. Suppose it's a gamma-lactone, which has a five-membered ring. The formula would be C5H8O2. Again, not matching the six carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a substituent. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

At this point, perhaps I should think about the most likely answer based on the data. The presence of a broad peak in IR suggests an O-H group, so the compound is likely an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The two carbonyl peaks suggest two carbonyl groups. The vinyl hydrogens suggest a double bond.

The options with two oxygen atoms are A and C. So, let's see which of these could have two carbonyl groups and a double bond.

Option C is C6H10O2. That's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and two oxygens. The degrees of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two rings or double bonds. If there's a double bond (from vinyl H), that accounts for one, so another ring or double bond. But if the compound has two carbonyl groups, each carbonyl is a double bond (each C=O is a double bond), so that would require two double bonds. Wait, that would give three degrees of unsaturation (two from C=O, one from the double bond from the vinyl). So the degrees of unsaturation would be 3. But option C has two degrees, so that's a problem.

Wait, that can't be. So if the structure has two carbonyl groups and a double bond, that would be three double bonds (from two C=O and one C=C), which would require three degrees of unsaturation. But the formula for option C (C6H10O2) has two degrees. So that's impossible.

So perhaps the structure doesn't have two carbonyl groups but instead one and another group like an aromatic ring. Wait, but the IR has two strong peaks in the carbonyl region. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the 1650 cm^-1 is not a carbonyl but an aromatic ring. But then, the 1700 is a carbonyl. So the structure would have a carbonyl and an aromatic ring. That would make sense. So, the structure could be an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group (like acetophenone derivatives) and an O-H group (from the broad peak).

Wait, acetophenone is C6H5COCH3, but that's C8H8O. Our options are C6, so perhaps it's a smaller structure. For example, maybe phenyl acetate, but that's C8 again.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group. For example, methyl benzoate is C6H5COOCH3, which is C8H8O2. Again, more carbons than our options.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a substituted cyclopentanone with an ester group. But that might not fit the formula either.

Wait, perhaps the structure has one carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. Let's think: benzene ring with a ketone group and an alcohol group. That would be a phenol ketone. But the formula would be C6H5CO-OH, which is C7H6O2. That's more than our options.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to summarise:

- Broad peak at 3000 cm^-1: O-H (alcohol or carboxylic acid)
- Strong peaks at 1700 and 1650: possible two carbonyls or one conjugated with another group (like an aromatic ring)
- Vinyl H: double bond or aromatic ring
- Mass spec fragment at 45: ?

Given that, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. Let's say, for example, an ester group attached to a cyclohexene ring. The formula would be C6H10O2 (option C), which has two degrees of unsaturation. The cyclohexene ring contributes one double bond, and the ester contributes another (the carbonyl). But wait, the ester has a carbonyl (one double bond) and the cyclohexene has another. So that's two double bonds, which accounts for two degrees of unsaturation. But the formula for option C is C6H10O2, which has two degrees of unsaturation. So that works.

So the structure would be something like cyclohexene with an ester group (like cyclohexene ring with an -O-CO-R group attached). That would fit the formula C6H10O2 (option C).

In that case, the IR would show the broad O-H peak (from the ester's alcohol part, but wait, no, esters don't have O-H groups. Oh wait, unless it's an alcohol and an ester. Hmm, perhaps the structure is a diol ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in this case, if the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group, that would give one carbonyl. But the IR shows two peaks. So maybe it's a cyclohexene ring with both a ketone and an ester group. But that would require more oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester group and another carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the 1650 cm^-1 peak could be from an aromatic ring. So the compound might be an aromatic ester with a carbonyl group. For example, if it's a substituted benzene with an ester group and a carbonyl group elsewhere. But that would require more carbons than our options.

I'm starting to think that the correct formula is C6H10O2 (option C). The reasons are:

- Two oxygen atoms, fitting the two carbonyl groups (as per IR) or an ester and an alcohol group.
- Vinyl hydrogens from an alkene (maybe a cyclohexene ring).
- The fragment in mass spec at 45 could correspond to a part of the molecule, perhaps an ester group fragment.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check the molecular weight of option C. C6H10O2: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total 114. So the molecular ion would be around 114. The fragment at 45 would be 45/114 ≈ 40% of the molecular ion. That seems plausible.

Another angle: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the structure must have a double bond. If it's a cyclohexene with an ester group, that could fit. The ester would have the two oxygens.

So putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.


The unknown compound is analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H group (likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid). Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of two carbonyl groups or a conjugated system involving a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum indicates the presence of vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond or aromatic ring. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which is consistent with certain functional groups or structural fragments.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **C₆H₁₂O (Option D)**: This formula has one oxygen atom and one degree of unsaturation. It cannot account for the two carbonyl groups indicated by the IR spectrum or the presence of vinyl hydrogens. This option is eliminated.

2. **C₆H₁₀O (Option B)**: This formula has one oxygen atom and two degrees of unsaturation. While it can account for a double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens), it cannot explain the two carbonyl groups observed in the IR spectrum. This option is eliminated.

3. **C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option C)**: This formula has two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. It can account for the two carbonyl groups (e.g., one from an ester and one from a ketone or conjugated system) and the double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens). The molecular weight of 114 aligns with the mass spectrometry data, and the fragment at m/z = 45 could correspond to a structural fragment of the molecule. This option is consistent with all the data.

4. **C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option A)**: This formula has two oxygen atoms and one degree of unsaturation. It cannot account for the two carbonyl groups or the presence of vinyl hydrogens, as it lacks sufficient degrees of unsaturation. This option is eliminated.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it explains the broad O-H peak, the two carbonyl peaks in the IR spectrum, the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR, and the fragment peak at m/z = 45 in the mass spectrum.
