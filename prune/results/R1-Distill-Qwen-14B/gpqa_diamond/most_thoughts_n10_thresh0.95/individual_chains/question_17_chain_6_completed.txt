Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant K tells us how strong that complex is.

Wait, but wait. What's the formation constant exactly? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-, and Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we're assuming that all the Ca and EDTA is tied up in this complex. Or wait, no, maybe some is free? Well, the solution is in a state where the complex is formed, and we can assume that the complex is at equilibrium.

Wait, but the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Stoichiometric means the molar ratio is 1:1, right? So each mole of complex has one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So the initial concentrations before considering dissociation would be [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] would be zero. But that's not possible because some of the complex will dissociate. So we have to find the equilibrium concentrations.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the dissociation of the complex. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the dissociation reaction would be: CaEDTA²- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

But the formation constant Kf is 5e10, which is a very large number, so the reverse reaction (dissociation) would have a very small K. Wait, no. Wait, Kf is formation, so Kd, the dissociation constant, would be 1/Kf. Let me compute that. Kd is 1/(5e10)=2e-11. So the dissociation constant Kd is 2e-11.

So the dissociation equation is CaEDTA²- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-; Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA²-] = 2e-11.

We can assume that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me call the change in concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since each mole of complex that dissociates produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-, the concentrations of both will be x at equilibrium. The concentration of the complex will be 0.02 - x.

But wait, because Kd is so small (2e-11), x will be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So the equation becomes x^2/(0.02) = 2e-11.

Solving for x: x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 → 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. So x is about 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate that more accurately. Let me compute it step by step.

x^2 = 2e-11 * 0.02 → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-11 * 2e-2 = 4e-13.

Taking square root: sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 10^−6.5 is 3.1623e-7. So 2 * 3.1623e-7 = 6.3246e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go back through the steps.

1. The formation constant Kf is 5e10, so the dissociation constant Kd is 1/(Kf) = 2e-11.

2. The initial concentration of complex is 0.02 M.

3. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ produced by dissociation. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [Complex] ≈ 0.02 (since x is so small compared to 0.02).

4. Kd = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11 → x² = (2e-11)*0.02 → 4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5= 6.32e-7.

Yes, that seems correct. So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the equilibrium concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \). The equilibrium concentrations are:

- \([CaEDTA^{2-}] \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since \( x \) is very small compared to 0.02 M),
- \([Ca^{2+}] = x\),
- \([EDTA^{4-}] = x\).

The dissociation constant expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[CaEDTA^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the equilibrium concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.

Answer: C
