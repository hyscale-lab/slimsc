Okay, I've got this question about the Pinacol rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Pinacol rearrangement is a reaction involving vicinal diols reacting under acidic conditions. Vicinal diols are diols where the two hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons. The reaction forms a carbocation intermediate, leading to a rearrangement, typically a hydride or alkyl shift, which results in the formation of a ketone.

So the question gives three different diols and asks what products A, B, and C would be after the reaction with H+.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

Starting with compound A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. The structure would have two adjacent diols on carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is like CH2-CH2-CHOH-CHOH-CH2-CH3, but with substituents. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw this out. Hexane is six carbons. The diols are on C3 and C4. So positions 3 and 4. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3, but with a methyl group on C3 and a phenyl on C4. So:

At C3: -CH(CH3)-OH

At C4: -C6H5-OH

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. So hexane has carbons 1-6. C3 has a methyl and a hydroxyl, and C4 has a phenyl and a hydroxyl.

So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(CH3)(OH)-C(Ph)(OH)-CH2-CH3.

When the Pinacol rearrangement occurs, the two OH groups will lose water to form a carbocation. The mechanism is that the diol loses two water molecules, leading to the formation of a carbocation. Then, there's a shift (like a hydride or alkyl shift) to form a more stable carbocation, followed by the attack of a base (like water) to form a ketone.

The process typically leads to the formation of a ketone where the adjacent groups from the diol have shifted. The carbocation forms between the two diols, and then a shift occurs.

So for A: the starting diol is 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. After losing water from both OHs, the adjacent carbons (3 and 4) will form a double bond or a carbocation. Wait, no, the process is that both diols lose a proton each, and the two oxygen atoms form a bridge, leading to the elimination of water and the formation of a carbocation. So the two adjacent carbons (3 and 4) become a bridged structure, leading to a carbocation on each adjacent carbon, or perhaps a conjugated system.

Wait, maybe more accurately, the two OH groups lose a proton each, and the two adjacent carbocations form a sort of bridge, which can then lead to a shift. Alternatively, the diol reacts to form an oxonium ion, which then breaks down.

Wait, maybe I should think about it step by step. The diols are on C3 and C4. When acid is added, each OH will lose a proton, becoming a good leaving group. Then, the two adjacent carbons (3 and 4) each form carbocations. But wait, that's not possible because two adjacent carbocations would be unstable. Alternatively, the two OH groups can deprotonate, and the two adjacent C-O bonds form a conjugated system, leading to the loss of water and the formation of a carbocation.

Alternatively, perhaps the two OH groups lose water as H2O, leading to the formation of a six-membered transition state, similar to the formation of a cyclic intermediate, which then breaks down. The key is that the two adjacent diols lose two water molecules, forming a carbocation on each adjacent carbon, which can then undergo a shift.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think that the diols form a carbocation in such a way that one of the groups (like a methyl or phenyl) can shift to the adjacent carbon to form a more stable carbocation.

In the case of A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. So the structure is:

Carbons 3 and 4 each have an OH group. Carbon 3 has a methyl group, and carbon 4 has a phenyl group.

When the rearrangement occurs, the diol will lose water, creating a carbocation. The carbocation can form on either C3 or C4, but the most stable would be where it can best stabilize the positive charge. Since C3 has a methyl and C4 has a phenyl, the phenyl group can stabilize a carbocation better than a methyl group. Wait, but in this case, the diol is on C3 and C4, which are adjacent. So when they lose water, perhaps the carbocation forms, and then a shift occurs.

Wait, maybe another approach: when the diol is protonated, each OH leaves, leading to the formation of a carbocation. But since the two adjacent carbons can each form a carbocation, perhaps the most stable is formed. But maybe a hydride or alkyl shift occurs to form a more stable carbocation.

Alternatively, the diol forms a cyclic intermediate, which then breaks down. The mechanism often involves the formation of a carbocation at one of the adjacent positions, leading to a shift of a substituent to form a more stable carbocation, leading to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, let me think of the general case. In the Pinacol rearrangement, the diol becomes a carbocation through loss of water. Then, a hydride or alkyl group shifts to the carbocation to form a more stable one. Then, a base (like water) attacks to form a ketone.

So for compound A: the structure is 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol.

The diol is on C3 and C4. So when acid is added, the diol loses two water molecules (or more accurately, each OH loses a proton and leaves as water), forming a carbocation. The adjacent carbons would each have positive charges, but that's not possible. So perhaps the diol forms a cyclic structure, leading to the formation of a single carbocation.

Wait, perhaps in the reaction, the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons, so when they lose water, the two carbons become carbocations. But that's unlikely because two adjacent carbocations are unstable.

An alternative is that the diol forms a bridged structure, leading to the formation of a single carbocation. For example, in the case of pinacol (which is 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol), the reaction forms a carbocation on one of the methyl-bearing carbons, which then undergoes a shift. The carbocation can be on either C2 or C3, but the more substituted one is more stable. So the shift leads to a more stable carbocation, such as moving a methyl group from one carbon to the other.

Wait, maybe in the case of compound A, the diol is 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. So when the acid is added, the OH groups lose protons, and the adjacent carbons form a carbocation.

The adjacent carbons are C3 and C4. C3 has a methyl group, and C4 has a phenyl group.

When the diol loses water, it forms a bridged structure. Let me think: the two OHs on C3 and C4 lose H2O, forming a double bond between C3 and C4, but with adjacent positive charges. Alternatively, the structure might form a carbocation on C3 and another on C4, but how would that work?

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is that the diol forms a cyclic transition state where both OH groups lose H+ and form a bridged structure, leading to the loss of a water molecule and the formation of a carbocation.

Alternatively, perhaps each OH loses a proton, and the adjacent C-O bonds form a bridged structure, leading to the formation of a single carbocation.

Wait, perhaps the diol structure leads to the formation of a carbocation on C3 and another on C4. But that's two adjacent carbocations, which is not very stable. So one of them would shift to form a more stable carbocation.

Alternatively, maybe the diol forms a bridged structure where one of the carbons becomes a carbocation, and the other becomes a neighboring group that can shift.

Wait, perhaps for compound A, the diol is 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. The structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(CH3)(OH)-C(Ph)(OH)-CH2-CH3.

When the diol loses water, the two adjacent carbons (C3 and C4) form a carbocation. But two adjacent carbocations are not favorable, so perhaps one of the substituents (like the methyl on C3 or the phenyl on C4) shifts to the other carbon.

Wait, maybe the phenyl group on C4 is a good candidate to shift to C3 to form a more stable carbocation. So the phenyl group from C4 would move to C3. But wait, phenyl is a big group; maybe a hydride or methyl shift is more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group on C3 can shift to C4, but that would leave a carbocation on C4, which is more substituted (since C4 has a phenyl group as well? Wait, C4 has a phenyl and a methyl perhaps.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. The product of the Pinacol rearrangement is typically a ketone. So in the product, one of the carbons from the original diol will have a carbonyl group.

In the case of compound A, the product would be a ketone, likely at either C3 or C4, but considering the shifts.

Wait, another approach: the Pinacol rearrangement typically leads to a ketone where the original diol's carbons become adjacent to the ketone.

Let me think of a specific example. For pinacol itself, 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol, the rearrangement leads to pinacolone, which is 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanone. So the diol's two adjacent carbons each lose a group (a methyl in this case) and form a ketone.

Wait, no. Wait, pinacol is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CH2(OH)(CH3)2? No, wait, pinacol is 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol: structure is HO-C(CH3)2-CH2-OH. No, wait, I think it's HO-C(CH3)CH2-CH(CH3)OH. So each of the two central carbons has a methyl group and an OH.

When the acid is added, the diol loses two water molecules, leading to the formation of a carbocation. The two adjacent carbons (each with a methyl group) form a carbocation, but that might not be the most stable. So a methyl group shifts from one carbon to the other.

Wait, in pinacol rearrangement, the two adjacent diols lose water, form a carbocation, and a methyl group (or hydride) shifts to the carbocation to form a more stable structure. The result is a ketone.

So in the case of pinacol, the product is pinacolone, which is 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone. So the ketone is formed at one of the original diol carbons.

So applying this to compound A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. Let's imagine that when the diol loses water, the two adjacent carbons form a carbocation. Then, a substituent (like the methyl from C3 or the phenyl from C4) shifts to stabilize the carbocation.

Wait, the substituent that moves would be the one that can best stabilize the carbocation. So if the carbocation is on C3, which already has a methyl, maybe the phenyl from C4 would shift to C3. But phenyl groups aren't great at stabilizing carbocations via hyperconjugation, but maybe the structure after the shift is more favorable.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl from C3 shifts to C4, which is already bearing a phenyl. That would leave a carbocation on C3, but since C3 has a methyl, perhaps that's a more stable position.

Wait, but the carbocation would form on whichever position allows for the most substitution. So if the carbocation is on C4, which already has a phenyl, perhaps it's more stable. So perhaps the methyl from C3 shifts to C4, and the carbocation forms on C3.

Wait, no. Let me try to draw this mentally. If the diol is on C3 and C4, and each loses an OH as H2O, then the adjacent carbons would each form a carbocation. But since two adjacent carbocations are not favorable, one of them would shift.

Wait, perhaps the methyl group from C3 could shift to C4, making the carbocation on C3, but C4 now has a methyl and a phenyl. Alternatively, the phenyl group from C4 could shift to C3, making a benzyl-type carbocation on C3.

Wait, a benzyl carbocation is more stable, so perhaps the phenyl group from C4 shifts to C3, making the carbocation on C3. But wait, that would require the phenyl group to move, which might not be as likely as a methyl shift.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group from C3 shifts to C4, forming a carbocation on C3, which then could form a ketone.

Wait, let's think about the product. The product A is a ketone. So which carbon would have the carbonyl group?

If the methyl group shifts from C3 to C4, then the carbocation would form on C3, which was originally bearing the methyl. But that carbon would then form a carbonyl group after the attack of a base (like water).

Wait, but if the carbocation is on C3, which is the same carbon as the methyl group, but after the shift, perhaps the structure becomes:

After the shift, C3 would have the carbocation, and the base (water) would attack, forming a ketone there.

Wait, but in compound A, the original structure is 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. After the shift, perhaps the structure becomes something where a methyl is on a different carbon, and the carbonyl is formed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the product options provided.

Looking at the options for product A:

Option A) A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

So that's a pentan-2-one with substituents on C3: ethyl and phenyl. The structure would be:

CH2-C(O)-C(Ph)(CH2CH2CH3) ?

Wait, no. Wait, pentan-2-one would be:

CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But substituted, so maybe it's something like (Ph)(Et)C-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(Ph)(Et)-C(O)-CH2-CH3, but that's for a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a five-carbon chain with a ketone on C2, and substituents on C3.

Alternatively, product A in option C is 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one. So the carbonyl is on C2, and the substituents are on C3.

Wait, the starting compound is a six-carbon diol. After rearrangement, the product should have fewer carbons? Or not necessarily. Wait, no, the Pinacol rearrangement doesn't change the number of carbons; it's a rearrangement, so the number of carbons remains the same.

Wait, compound A is a hexane diol (six carbons). The product should be a ketone with six carbons. But looking at the options, option A's product for A is 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, which is five carbons. That can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I miscounted the carbons. The product A in option C is 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, which is five carbons. The starting compound is hexane, so that would imply a loss of a carbon, which doesn't make sense for a Pinacol rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the product for compound A is a five-carbon ketone, implying a loss of one carbon. But the Pinacol rearrangement doesn't involve loss of a carbon; it's a rearrangement without breaking the carbon chain. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the diol is at the end of the chain, so when it rearranges, the chain shortens.

Wait, the starting compound is 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(CH3)(OH)-C(Ph)(OH)-CH2-CH3.

After rearrangement, perhaps the two central carbons (C3 and C4) lose some groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a pentanone, but that would require losing a carbon, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hexanone, but with the substituents moved.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the product A is 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one. That's five carbons. So perhaps the starting material, which is six carbons, loses a carbon, but that can't be right. So perhaps the product is a six-carbon ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure. The product for A in option C is 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one. So that's five carbons, but the starting material is six. That doesn't make sense, so perhaps option C is incorrect for product A.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a six-carbon ketone. Let me think of another option. Looking at the options:

Option B for product A is 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one.

That's a four-carbon ketone with substituents. But again, the starting material is six carbons, so that would imply a loss, which doesn't happen.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think of each compound and the possible product.

Compound A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol.

After the rearrangement, the diol would form a ketone. The carbocation would form on one of the adjacent carbons, and a group shifts to form a more stable carbocation.

So, the possible product would have a ketone group, and the substituents would be positioned based on the shift.

In the starting material, C3 has a methyl, and C4 has a phenyl. When the diol reacts, perhaps the phenyl group from C4 shifts to C3, leaving a carbocation on C4, which is already substituted with a phenyl. Alternatively, the methyl from C3 could shift to C4, leaving a carbocation on C3.

If the phenyl shifts, then the carbocation is on C3, which has the methyl. Then, water attacks to form a ketone on C3. But since C3 is already substituted with a methyl and phenyl, perhaps the product would have a ketone at C3.

Wait, but the product would have the ketone where the carbocation was. So if the phenyl shifts, the carbocation is on C3, leading to a ketone at C3.

So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(Ph)(O)CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would have the ketone at C2 or C4.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, as in option C. But I'm not sure how that structure arises from the starting material.

Wait, maybe I should think about the positions. The starting compound is 3 and 4 diol. After rearrangement, the ketone is at position 2 of a pentane, but that seems off.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, as in option B. But that would mean the chain has shortened, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck. Let me move on to compound B and see if that helps.

Compound B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol.

Structure: The diol is on C2 and C3. C2 has a phenyl and an OH, and C3 has a 4-hydroxyphenyl and an OH. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(OH)(Ph)-C(OH)(4-HPh)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, the formula is pentane-2,3-diol, so five carbons.

Wait, pentane-2,3-diol would have OH on C2 and C3. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

But with substituents: at C2, there's a phenyl (Ph) group, and at C3, a 4-hydroxyphenyl group.

So the structure is:

CH2-C(Ph)(OH)-C(4-HPh)(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but in the compound B, it's 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol. So:

Positions 2 and 3 have OH groups. Position 2 has a phenyl, and position 3 has a 4-hydroxyphenyl.

So structure:

CH2-C(Ph)(OH)-CH(4-HPh)(OH)-CH2-CH3.

When the Pinacol rearrangement occurs, the diol will lose water, form a carbocation, and a shift will occur.

In this case, the two adjacent carbons (C2 and C3) each have substituents. C2 has a phenyl, and C3 has a 4-hydroxyphenyl.

When the diol loses water, the two adjacent carbons form carbocations. Which substituent will shift?

The substituent that can best stabilize the carbocation will shift. So perhaps the phenyl group from C2 can shift to C3, or the 4-hydroxyphenyl from C3 can shift to C2.

Alternatively, perhaps a hydride shift occurs.

Wait, but the 4-hydroxyphenyl group is a bulky substituent. Maybe the phenyl group from C2 shifts to C3, leaving a carbocation on C2, which is already substituted with a phenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4-hydroxyphenyl group shifts to C2, leaving a carbocation on C3.

Wait, but the 4-hydroxyphenyl group is ortho to the OH, which might not be as favorable as a phenyl group, which is a better stabilizer.

Alternatively, perhaps the phenyl group from C2 shifts to C3, making the carbocation on C2 more stable.

Wait, but the 4-hydroxyphenyl group on C3 has a hydroxyl group attached. Maybe that can help stabilize the carbocation via conjugation.

Alternatively, perhaps the shift leads to the formation of a more stable carbocation on C3.

Wait, perhaps the 4-hydroxyphenyl group shifts to C2, but that would require the group to move from C3 to C2. Alternatively, maybe the phenyl from C2 shifts to C3.

Hmm. Let me think about the product options. For B, the options are:

Option A: B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

Option C: B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

So both options A and C have the same product for B. Therefore, perhaps B's product is 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

How does that form?

If the diol loses water, forms a carbocation on C2 and C3. Then, a substituent shifts to form a more stable carbocation.

If the phenyl group from C2 shifts to C3, then C2 has a carbocation, which is adjacent to the phenyl. But perhaps that would lead to a more stable carbocation on C3, which already has a 4-hydroxyphenyl group.

Wait, perhaps the phenyl group from C2 shifts to C3, making C3 have two substituents: its 4-hydroxyphenyl and the shifted phenyl. Then, the carbocation is on C2, but that's not as stable as perhaps having the carbocation on C3.

Alternatively, the 4-hydroxyphenyl group from C3 could shift to C2, leading to a carbocation on C3, which already has a phenyl substituent from the shift.

Wait, perhaps the phenyl group from C2 shifts to C3, making the carbocation on C2 have a phenyl substituent, but that may not be as stable as having the carbocation on C3. Alternatively, the 4-hydroxyphenyl group from C3 shifts to C2, making the carbocation on C3.

Wait, maybe the 4-hydroxyphenyl group is not a great candidate for a shift, but the phenyl group is. So the phenyl from C2 shifts to C3, leaving a carbocation on C2, which is more substituted.

Wait, but C2 already has a phenyl group. So after the shift, C3 would have two phenyl groups (the original 4-hydroxyphenyl and the shifted phenyl from C2), and the carbocation is on C2.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4-hydroxyphenyl group from C3 shifts to C2, leading to the carbocation on C3.

But the 4-hydroxyphenyl group is a larger substituent, but it can stabilize a carbocation through resonance if it's attached to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the 4-hydroxyphenyl group can't shift because it's attached to another hydroxyl group. Maybe the phenyl group from C2 is more likely to shift.

So the phenyl group (Ph) from C2 shifts to C3, which already has a 4-hydroxyphenyl group. So the structure after the shift would have C3 bearing both the 4-hydroxyphenyl and a phenyl group, and the carbocation on C2.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the shift leads to the phenyl group moving to C3, and the carbocation forms on C3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the product. The product B is supposed to be a ketone. So where would the carbonyl be?

If the carbocation is on C2, then the base (water) would attack C2, forming a ketone there. So the product would have a ketone on C2, with substituents from the shift.

If the phenyl group from C2 shifts to C3, then C3 would have both substituents, and the ketone would form on C2.

So the product would be something like:

CH2-C(O)-C(Ph)(4-HPh)-CH2-CH3.

But the formula is pentan-2-one, so five carbons. So the structure would be:

CH2-C(O)-C(Ph)(4-HPh)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons, but compound B is pentane-2,3-diol, which is five carbons. So the product would be a pentan-2-one with substituents on C3.

Which matches option A and C's product for B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

So the structure would be:

CH2-C(O)-C(Ph)(4-HPh)-CH2-CH3.

Which is 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one.

So that makes sense. So product B is as described in options A and C.

Now, moving to compound C: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol.

Structure: The diol is on C1 and C2. C1 has two 4-methoxyphenyl groups and a hydroxyl group. C2 has a phenyl group and a hydroxyl group.

The structure would be:

C1: OMePh-OH

C2: Ph-OH

But wait, the formula is 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol.

So ethane-1,2-diol, so two carbons.

C1 has two 4-methoxyphenyl groups and an OH.

C2 has one phenyl group and an OH.

So structure:

Ph-O-C-C-O-Ph-OmePh? Wait, no.

Wait, the structure would be:

C1: attached to two 4-methoxyphenyl groups and an OH.

C2: attached to one phenyl group and an OH.

So:

O

| 

HO-C(C6H4-OCH3)2 - C(Ph)(OH)

But wait, ethane-1,2-diol is HO-CH2-CH2-OH. But with substituents on each carbon.

So ethane-1,2-diol becomes:

HO-C(X)-C(Y)-OH

Where X and Y are substituents.

In this case:

C1 (left carbon): X is two 4-methoxyphenyl groups.

C2 (right carbon): Y is a phenyl group.

So the structure is:

C1: (4-MeO)Ph, (4-MeO)Ph, OH

C2: Ph, OH, and connected to C1.

When the Pinacol rearrangement occurs, the diol loses water, forming a carbocation. Then, a substituent shifts to form a more stable carbocation.

In this case, the diol is on C1 and C2. So when water is lost, the two adjacent carbons (C1 and C2) form carbocations. But again, two adjacent carbocations are not favorable, so a substituent must shift.

Which substituent will shift? The substituents are two 4-methoxyphenyl groups on C1 and a phenyl group on C2.

The 4-methoxyphenyl groups are bulky but can stabilize a carbocation via resonance if attached.

So perhaps one of the 4-methoxyphenyl groups from C1 shifts to C2. Alternatively, the phenyl from C2 could shift to C1.

But wait, the shift must lead to a more stable carbocation. The 4-methoxyphenyl group is a good stabilizer because of the electron-donating methoxy group. So when the carbocation forms on C1 (after losing water), the 4-methoxyphenyl group can shift to C2, making the carbocation on C2, which has a phenyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the phenyl group on C2 shifts to C1, making the carbocation on C2 more stable.

Wait, but the phenyl group is less able to stabilize a carbocation compared to a methoxy-substituted phenyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the phenyl group on C2 shifts to C1, leading to a carbocation on C2. But that might not be as favorable as having a 4-methoxyphenyl group on C2.

Wait, let's think: after losing water, the carbocation forms on C
