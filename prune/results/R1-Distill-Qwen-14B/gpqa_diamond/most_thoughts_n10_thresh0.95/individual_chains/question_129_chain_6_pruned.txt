Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. The steps involve several reactions, so I need to figure out each transformation.

First, the problem gives a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through compounds B, C, D, and E. Let's list them out:

1. A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided. Let me look at those first because they might give me some clues about the structure of A and E.

Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on ylides, but I remember that they are used in alkylation reactions, particularly in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts with aldehydes or ketones to form alkenes. So, if A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form an alkene, that suggests that A is either an aldehyde or a ketone.

So, if the product after the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, the starting material (A) must have had a carbonyl group where the double bond is formed. Wait, no. The Wittig adds an alkene adjacent to where the carbonyl was. Let me think. The structure of the product is a cyclopentane ring. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, right? So the structure would have a double bond there.

Alternatively, maybe the ylide adds a substituent. Let me imagine the structure. So the product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1,2, and 4. Positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups, and position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH2)2C=, but no, propan-2-ylidene would be CH(CH3)2 with a double bond. No, wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH2CH2C=). Wait, perhaps it's (CH2CH(CH3))=, but I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the product has a double bond at position 4. So the ring has a substituent that's a substituted double bond. Wait, the product's structure is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the propan-2-ylidene is a substituent at position 4 of the cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene group is (CH(CH3)2) attached via a double bond, right? Or is it a substituent that's a vinyl group? Hmm, perhaps I should draw this mentally. 

So, the product is a cyclopentane ring with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which would be a CH2CH(CH3) group attached via a double bond. Wait, no, maybe it's (CH2)CH(CH3) with a double bond. Alternatively, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent like CH(CH3)2 connected via a double bond, making it a vinylic substituent.

Wait, perhaps the ylide is adding a group to a carbonyl. So, if A is a ketone, say cyclopentanone with substituents, then the
