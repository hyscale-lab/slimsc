Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1. Lorentz, 2. Poincare, 3. CP, 4. CPT. The choices are A) 1,2; B) 3,4; C) 1,2,4; D) 1,3,4.

Wait, first, I need to remember what these symmetries mean and how they apply to the SMEFT framework.

Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance of physical laws under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. In the Standard Model, all terms respect Lorentz symmetry because they're constructed from fields that transform in specific ways. Since SMEFT is an effective theory built from the Standard Model fields, I think all operators in SMEFT should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So point 1 is a must.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's a larger symmetry group. Since Lorentz is already part of Poincare, if something respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But does the SMEFT necessarily respect Poincare? Well, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does it have to include translations? Wait, translations are part of the Poincare group, which includes the generators of momentum. Since the SM is Poincare-invariant, and SMEFT is an effective theory derived from it, I think SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So points 1 and 2 are both required. But wait, the question is about which must be respected by all operators. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Actually, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does it automatically respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. The SM and thus SMEFT includes Poincare symmetry. So if all operators in SMEFT are part of a Poincare-invariant theory, then they must respect Poincare. So points 1 and 2 are both correct. So that would imply that any operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but wait. Do all operators in SMEFT necessarily respect Poincare symmetry? Because operators are written in a way that the theory is Lorentz invariant, but are they also Poincare invariant? I think yes because the theory as a whole must respect Poincare. So operators can't violate that. So 2 is correct.

Next, what about CP symmetry (option 3)? CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM doesn't have CP symmetry overall because of processes like CP violation in the CKM matrix. But the operators in SMEFT are organized in terms of their CP properties. I think that operators in SMEFT are typically classified by their CP quantum numbers. But does that mean that the operators themselves must be CP-symmetric? No. Because SMEFT includes higher-dimensional operators which can include terms that violate CP. For example, terms like (S U(1) symmetry breaking) could have CP-violating terms. So operators in SMEFT don't all have to respect CP symmetry. So point 3 is not a must. So option 3 is not a correct answer.

Then there's option 4, CPT symmetry. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT as an effective theory derived from the SM should also respect CPT. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So point 4 is correct.

Putting it together: All operators must respect Lorentz (1) and CPT (4), and Poincare (2) as well. Wait, but the options are a bit tricky. Let me check which options are present.

The options are:
A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

So the correct points are 1, 2, and 4. That would be option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that point 3 (CP) isn't required. So the inclusion of 1,2,4 is correct. So option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait again. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. Are all operators in SMEFT required to respect translations? Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but do the individual operators necessarily have to respect translations on their own, or is it the whole theory that is invariant?

Hmm, translation invariance is part of Poincare, and the action must be invariant under translations, which means the Lagrangian is divergence-free, right? So the individual terms in the Lagrangian must combine to have a divergence that's zero. So each operator doesn't necessarily have to be translationally invariant on its own; it's the sum that matters. So perhaps the operators don't have to individually respect Poincare symmetry, but the theory as a whole does. So maybe the operators don't have to each be Poincare invariant.

Wait, but the question says "must be respected by all operators". So if the operator itself doesn't have to be Poincare invariant, but the theory does, then the operators don't individually have to respect Poincare. Hmm, so maybe points 2 is not required for each operator.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think about how the SMEFT is constructed. The operators are built in a way that the theory is Lorentz invariant, which is a requirement. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. But for Poincare, which includes translations, each operator must be a scalar under Poincare as well.

Wait, but translation invariance for a term in the Lagrangian would mean that the term is a scalar, but each term in the Lagrangian doesn't necessarily have to be separately translationally invariant. Instead, the entire sum must be invariant under translations. So perhaps the operators themselves don't individually have to be Poincare invariant; it's the sum that does. Therefore, maybe option 2 isn't something each operator must respect.

But then, the question is about what each operator must respect. So if the operator doesn't have to have Poincare symmetry on its own, only the sum does, then the answer would not include Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT". So each operator must respect those symmetries. So if an operator doesn't have to be Poincare invariant on its own, only the sum, then Poincare isn't a symmetry that each operator must respect. Therefore, the answer would not include point 2.

But wait, Lorentz symmetry is a condition on the operators. Each operator must be a Lorentz scalar because the theory is Lorentz invariant. So point 1 is correct.

Poincare is a bigger symmetry, but each operator doesn't have to be Poincare invariant, but the Lagrangian must be. So for the question, which asks about each operator, the answer would not require point 2. Therefore, the only required symmetries for each operator are Lorentz (1) and CPT (4), and possibly CP?

Wait, because the question is about what must be respected by all operators. So if the operator is part of the Lagrangian, which respects Poincare, but each operator doesn't have to individually, then the operators don't have to each respect Poincare.

So perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz (1) and CPT (4). But wait, how does that fit with the options?

Looking again at the options, option D is 1,3,4. Option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, maybe my initial thought about point 2 was wrong. Maybe the operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare. Because the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but more than that, the Poincare symmetry includes translation. So each operator is part of a Lagrangian that's translationally invariant, but the individual terms may not be. But the way operators are written, perhaps each operator is a scalar under Poincare.

Wait, no. For example, consider a term like (∂μ φ)^2. That term is a Lorentz scalar and also a scalar under translations because shifting x doesn't affect the term. But if the operator is something like φ^2, then it's a Lorentz scalar, but would it be a scalar under translations? I think all operators in the SMEFT are scalars under translations as well as Lorentz. Because the effective theory must have a translation-invariant Lagrangian. So each operator must be a scalar under both Lorentz and translation, meaning they are Poincare scalars.

Wait, but in that case, each operator would have to respect Poincare. So then 2 is correct, and all operators must respect 1,2,4.

So the correct answer would be option C: 1,2,4.

But earlier I was thinking that point 3, CP, is not required, so 3 is not correct. So the correct points are 1,2,4. So the answer is C.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries 'must be respected by all operators'. Now, if the operators are part of a Poincare-invariant theory, but do each operator have to be individually Poincare-invariant? Or is it the sum that matters?

In the Standard Model, the individual terms in the Lagrangian don't necessarily have to be Poincare-invariant, but the entire Lagrangian must be. So for example, each term could have a different transformation but combine to a total invariant. But in the SMEFT, the operators are organized with specific quantum numbers, including being Lorentz scalars.

Wait a moment. For the operators in SMEFT, each operator is a Lorentz scalar. That's a requirement because the theory is Lorentz-invariant. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. Now, what about Poincare? Since each operator is part of a Lagrangian that must be translation invariant, which is part of Poincare.

But for a term to be part of a translation-invariant Lagrangian, the term itself must be a scalar under translations. Because if you translate the coordinates, the term's form must not change. So, for example, a term like (∂μ φ)φ would not be a scalar under translations because ∂μ has a shift when you translate x. But wait, no—translating x doesn't affect the term itself. Wait, no, the term is built from fields which are local. Translating the coordinates would change the fields, but the term's structure remains the same.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about how the SMEFT is constructed. The operators are built from the SM fields, and they are required to be Lorentz scalars. Additionally, the SMEFT is a renormalizable theory but at higher dimensions, so each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. But for translation invariance, each operator must be a scalar under translations as well. Because the Lagrangian density must be a scalar, which includes being a Lorentz scalar and a scalar under translations.

Wait, but all operators in the SMEFT are scalars under translations automatically because they're written as local operators in the field theory. So each operator is a scalar under both Lorentz and translation, hence a Poincare scalar. Therefore, each operator must respect Poincare symmetry. So option 2 is correct.

So to recap, all operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetry. So the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.

But wait, what about CP symmetry (3)? The operators in SMEFT can include terms that violate CP, right? Because the SMEFT allows for higher-dimension operators that can have CP-violating terms, such as those involving phases in the CKM matrix. So CP symmetry isn't a requirement for all operators. So point 3 is not required.

So the correct answer must include 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, that's option C.


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To determine the correct answer, we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and all operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz scalars. This means Lorentz symmetry must be respected by all operators. Therefore, point 1 is correct.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. While individual operators in the Lagrangian do not necessarily have to be translationally invariant on their own, the entire Lagrangian must be translation-invariant to respect Poincaré symmetry. Since SMEFT is a Poincaré-invariant theory, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, point 2 is correct.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves charge conjugation and parity. The Standard Model (SM) already includes CP-violating terms (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT, being an effective theory derived from the SM, allows for operators that violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT. Point 3 is incorrect.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, as an effective theory derived from the SM, must also respect CPT symmetry. Hence, point 4 is correct.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is:

**C) 1, 2, 4**

Answer: C
