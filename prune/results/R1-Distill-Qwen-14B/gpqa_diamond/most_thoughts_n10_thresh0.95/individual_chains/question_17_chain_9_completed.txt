Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. It says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, assuming ideal pH and T is 25 °C. The K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So, when they say the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that's the concentration of the complex itself. I think the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- or something like that.

The formula for the formation constant, K, is K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formation constant is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. So K = ([CaEDTA²−])/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Wait, but wait, that might not be right. Let me think. The formation constant is usually given as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2−, Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh, right, that's correct.

But wait, the problem gives K as 5x10^10. So K is the formation constant, Kf = 5e10.

But the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, some of it breaks down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So if the complex dissociates, the concentration of Ca²+ will be x, and the concentration of EDTA^4- will also be x, assuming that the dissociation is x.

Wait, no. Wait, because the reaction is 1:1. So at equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. But wait, if the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex, and it dissociates by x amount, then the concentrations would be: [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. But wait, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so in solution, it's usually in various protonated forms, but the problem states the pH is ideal, so maybe we can assume that almost all EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So that's convenient.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the initial assumption. The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So, without any dissociation, the concentration would be 0.02. But when it dissociates, the [Ca²+] is x, [EDTA^4-] is x, and [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 - x.

So Kf equation is Kf = ([CaEDTA²−])/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02 - x)/(x^2).

But wait, Kf is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal, so x will be very small compared to 0.02.

So we can approximate that 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Therefore, Kf ≈ 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10.

So solving for x:

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 / 5e10? Wait, wait, no: 0.02 is 2e-2, right? So 0.02 = 2e-2.

So 2e-2 / (5e10) = (2 /5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5 is that right? Wait, sqrt(4)=2; sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So x=2e-6.5 is same as approx 6.32e-7.

Wait, let me calculate that correctly. Let me compute x = sqrt( (2e-2) / (5e10) ) → (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7.

So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other factors? Oh wait, the formation constant K is given as 5e10, and we used that correctly in the equation.

Wait, but sometimes people define the formation constant differently. Oh, wait, sometimes it's written as the reciprocal. Wait, if K is the formation constant, then it's Kf as I used. But sometimes, the dissociation constant is given as Kd = 1/(Kf). Hmm. Wait, the problem says K is 5e10. So does that mean Kf is 5e10 or Kd is 5e10?

Wait, the problem states KCa-EDTA =5e10. I think that's the formation constant, Kf. Because EDTA forms a very stable complex with Ca²+, so Kf should be high, which makes sense.

So with Kf =5e10, the approach is correct.

So the [Ca²+] is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). Initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so at equilibrium:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting these into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}
\]

Since \(K_f\) is very large (\(5 \times 10^{10}\)), the dissociation \(x\) is negligible compared to 0.02. Thus, we approximate \(0.02 - x \approx 0.02\), simplifying the equation to:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7}\) M. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7}\) M**

Answer: C
