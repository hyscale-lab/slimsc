Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, so local thermal equilibrium applies. I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in energy states is given by the Boltzmann distribution.

Right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of populations in two energy levels. The formula is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower) / (k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So, the ratio of excited states in star_1 to star_2 is given as 2. Or wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, for the same energy level, the population in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But wait, in each star, the photosphere is in LTE, so each has its own temperature.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. For each star, their respective populations at that energy level are governed by their own temperatures. So, for star 1, the population is n1, and for star 2 it's n2. The problem states n1 = 2 * n2. 

But wait, no, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, for the same energy level, n1 = 2 n2. Or is it the ratio of the excited state to the ground state? Hmm, the problem says "specific energy level", so perhaps it's the same level in both stars. So, each star has its own n for that level.

Wait, but the Boltzmann factor is for the ratio of populations in two states, but here we're comparing the same state across two different stars. So, each star has its own T, so I think the ratio of their populations in the same state would be governed by their temperatures.

Wait, but the same energy level in each star. For each star, n_i depends on the star's temperature. So, n1 = (g / g) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) and n2 = (g / g) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ), assuming g_upper = g_lower, which isn't stated, but perhaps we can assume it's the same ratio, so the g's may cancel out.

Wait, the problem says the energy difference is the same for both stars, so ΔE is same, 1.38e-23 J for both. So, for each star, n = something with their own T.

Wait, but how do n1 and n2 relate? The problem says n1 = 2 n2. Or wait, no, the problem states that the number of excited atoms is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2 for the same level. So, n1 = 2 n2.

Wait, but each star's population is determined by their own T. So, n1 = (g) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), n2 = (g) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). So the ratio n1/n2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ).

But according to the problem, n1 = 2 n2, so n1/n2 = 2. So:

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln 2 = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, that's the equation. Let's rearrange it.

ln 2 = (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Wait, wait. Let's compute 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So,

ln 2 = (ΔE/k) * ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

But looking at the options, I don't see an option with that exact form. Let me look at the options again.

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So if I factor out the ΔE/k part, that's not present in the option. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. The question asks for the equation relating T1 and T2. Wait, the options don't include the ΔE term, so perhaps the equation is derived in terms of T1 and T2, assuming that ΔE is the same and we can eliminate it.

Wait, but the options don't have any constants like ΔE or k in them. So the equation must be written as ln(2) equals an expression involving T1 and T2, but without any other constants. So perhaps the given equation is the one without the ΔE/k factor.

Wait, maybe in the problem, the ratio is actually the ratio of the excitation levels for each star. So n1 (for star_1's energy level) = 2 n2 (star_2's same energy level). But wait, each star's n depends on their own T. So n1/n2 = [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

And n1/n2 = 2, so:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Let me see. 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But the options don't have ΔE or k. So perhaps I'm missing something. Or maybe the question is giving the energy difference in a way that when multiplied by some factors, cancels out. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the ratio is based on the excitation temperature or something else.

Wait, but the equation I have is ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So perhaps we can write this as ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But the options don't have any constants. So perhaps the only way this equation would match the options is if (ΔE/(k)) equals 1. But wait, what is ΔE/(k)?

ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE/(k) would be (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Oh! So ΔE/(k) equals 1 K.

So substituting that into the equation:

ln(2) = 1 * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which is option D.

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves two stars in local thermal equilibrium (LTE), where the excitation of iron atoms in a specific energy level is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations in the same energy level across the two stars is governed by their respective temperatures, T₁ and T₂.

The Boltzmann factor gives the ratio of populations as:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
\]

Since \( n_1 = 2n_2 \), we have:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) gives:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Substituting this back, the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Notably, \( \Delta E / k \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) divided by \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), which simplifies to \( 1 \, \text{K} \). Thus, the equation reduces to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation or the physical principles involved.

Answer: D
