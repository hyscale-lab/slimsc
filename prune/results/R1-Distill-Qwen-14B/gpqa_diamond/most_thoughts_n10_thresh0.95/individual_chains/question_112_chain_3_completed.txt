Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I need to find the probabilities and the average value of a certain operator. Let me read the question again.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think |up> and |down> are the standard basis states for spin-½ particles, like |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij is ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because we have two states. So, let me write it out. The diagonal elements are zero because when i=j, A_ij is zero. The off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

That's a 2x2 matrix. I think this is a spin operator in the x or y direction, but maybe another direction. Wait, the Pauli matrices usually have specific forms. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is diagonal. So if I multiply each Pauli matrix by ħ/2, then X would be [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2,0]], which matches A. So operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, right? So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So, the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of σ_x. Which are the eigenstates of the X operator. The eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively when multiplied by σ_x. But since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues would be ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but the question is about measuring the operator A. So when they ask for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, it's the same as finding the probabilities of getting +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 when measuring A.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, since A is proportional to σ_x, maybe I can find the expectation value and the probabilities using the components.

But first, let me normalize the state |alpha>. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha> = c [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ], where c is a normalization constant. The normalization requires that <alpha|alpha> = 1.

Compute the inner product:

c² [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2 -i) ] = 1.

Wait, wait, no: Let me compute each term.

First, (1+i) times its conjugate is (1-i)(1+i) = 1 + i -i -i² = 1 + 0 + 1 (since i²=-1) → 2.

Second term is (2 -i) times its conjugate: (2 + i)(2 -i) = 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So c² *7 =1 → c=1/√7.

So |alpha> = (1/√7) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck:

Wait, the state is given as proportional, so c is the normalization factor. So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] multiplied by 1/sqrt(7), because the norm of the vector [ (1+i), (2-i) ] is sqrt( (1^2 +1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) )? Wait, no, actually the norm is sqrt( |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2 ).

|1+i| is sqrt(1^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(2), so squared is 2.

|2 -i| is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(4 +1)= sqrt(5), squared is 5.

So sum is 2 +5=7, so normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you compute the inner product <alpha|alpha>, you take the conjugate transpose of the coefficients and multiply. So it's:

( (1-i) (1+i) + (2+i)(2 -i) ) /7. Because the state is c[ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ], so the inner product is c² [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ].

Which is c² [ (1 +1) + (4 + (1)) ] = c²*(2 +5) =7 c². So c²=1/7, c=1/sqrt(7). Correct.

Now, the operator A has matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. As I thought, it's (ħ/2) σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (|up> +|down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. Therefore, the eigenstates of A would be the same, but with eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

So to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, I need to expand |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value and then find the probabilities.

Wait, but for probabilities, we need the expansion of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A. So let's find the coefficients.

Let me denote |+x> = (|up> +|down>)/√2 and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

Express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

So,

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>,

where a and b are coefficients to be determined.

Expressing |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Let me write |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |−x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |−x> ) / sqrt(2),
|down> = (|+x> - |−x> ) / sqrt(2).

Substituting into |alpha>:

= [ (1+i) (|+x> + |−x> ) / sqrt(2) ) + (2 -i) ( |+x> - |−x> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7):

= [ (1+i + 2 -i) |+x> + (1+i - (2 -i)) |−x> ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))

Simplify coefficients:

Coefficient for |+x>:
(1+i +2 -i) = 3.

Coefficient for |−x>:
(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So,

|alpha> = [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |−x> ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

The denominator is sqrt(14). So:

|alpha> = [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|−x> ] / sqrt(14).

Now, the probability of measuring |+x> is |a|², where a is the coefficient for |+x>.

Compute |3|² / |sqrt(14)|² → 9 /14.

Similarly, the coefficient for |−x> is (-1 + 2i). Its magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 )= 1 +4=5. So |5|/14 =5/14.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the entire coefficient is [3 and (-1+2i)] divided by sqrt(14). So the probabilities are |a|² and |b|².

So |a|² is (3/sqrt(14))^2 =9/14.

|b|² is | (-1 +2i ) / sqrt(14) |^2 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute (-1 + 2i) * (-1 -2i): that gives 1 +2i -2i - (2i)^2 → 1 +0i +4=5. So the magnitude squared is 5. So the probability for |−x> is 5/14.

Wait, but 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, so that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. But looking at the options, let's see. The options are A) 0.64, 0.36, etc. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. 5/14 is about 0.357, which is about 0.36. So option A's first two values are 0.64 and 0.36. So that would match the probabilities. But wait, the third part is the average value.

Wait, the average value of the operator A is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (ħ/2) <sigma_x>, which is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x.

The expectation value of σ_x can be found as the difference between the probabilities.

Wait, expectation value <sigma_x> is ( probability of +1 ) - ( probability of -1 ).

In the eigenbasis, the expectation value is p_+ (1) + p_- (-1) )= p_+ - p_-.

So in our case, p_+ is 9/14, p_- is 5/14. So expectation value of sigma_x is (9/14 -5/14 )=4/14=2/7.

So <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) = ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A's third value is ħ/7. So option A would have probabilities ~0.64 and 0.36, and expectation value ħ/7.

But wait, looking back, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that fits. So the probabilities are 0.64 (9/14≈0.642857) and 0.36 (5/14≈0.357), and average is ħ/7.

But wait, let me double-check the average value another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value directly from the matrix elements.

The state |alpha> is in the up and down basis. Maybe it's easier to compute <A> using the matrix representation.

The matrix of A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is (1+i, 2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute it as (1/sqrt(7)) (1-i, 2 +i) * A * (1+i, 2 -i)^T / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, wait. The state vector is [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T, and its conjugate transpose is [ (1-i), (2 +i) ].

So compute (1-i, 2+i) * A * (1+i, 2 -i) all divided by 7.

Compute A * (1+i, 2 -i):

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], so

A * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T = [ (0*(1+i) + ħ/2*(2 -i) ), ( ħ/2*(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ) ]^T = [ ( ħ/2 (2 -i) ), ( ħ/2 (1+i) ) ].

Now, the conjugate transpose (1-i, 2+i) multiplied by this vector:

(1-i) * ( ħ/2 (2 -i) ) + (2 +i) * ( ħ/2 (1+i) )

Let's compute each term:

First term: (1-i)(2 -i) * ħ/2.

(1-i)(2-i) = 2 -i -2i +i² = 2 -3i -1 = (1) -3i.

So first term: (1-3i) * ħ/2.

Second term: (2+i)(1+i) * ħ/2.

(2+i)(1+i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So second term: (1 +3i) * ħ/2.

Adding the two terms together:

(1-3i +1 +3i) * ħ/2 = (2) * ħ/2 = ħ.

So the expectation value is ħ / 7, since we divided by 7 earlier.

Wait, because the initial state was divided by sqrt(7), so when we take the inner product, it's (1/7) * (the calculation I did), which gives ħ/7.

So that's correct. So the average value is ħ/7, which matches option A.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and average is ħ/7. So the correct option is A.


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, scaled by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \). These eigenstates are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle),
\]

with corresponding eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \).

The given state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle) \), we rewrite \( |\alpha\rangle \) as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ 3|+x\rangle + (-1+2i)|-x\rangle \right].
\]

The coefficients of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are \( 3 \) and \( -1+2i \), respectively. The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients divided by \( 14 \):

\[
P(+x) = \frac{|3|^2}{14} = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = \frac{|-1+2i|^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Next, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), the expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

From the given options, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**
