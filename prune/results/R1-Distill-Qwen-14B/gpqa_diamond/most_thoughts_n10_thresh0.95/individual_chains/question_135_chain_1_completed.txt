Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X, given its mass is 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is provided, but I'm not sure how that factors in yet. Hmm.

First, I remember that bosons can decay into pairs of fermions. The possible decays depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions it can decay into. The key here is the term "kinematically allowed," which means the decay must satisfy energy and conservation laws. So, for a decay X → f f̄, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion f, right? Because each fermion would take away some energy, and you need enough to create both.

The boson's mass is 6 GeV. So I need to list all fermions whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. Wait, but wait, particles like the top quark are way heavier than that, so they can't be produced here.

Let me think about the known fermion masses. I'll list them from memory:

- Electron (e⁻): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ⁻): around 0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ⁻): about 1.78 GeV
- Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t)
   Up and down are like 2-5 MeV each—so way under 3 GeV.
   Strange is around 100 MeV, so also way under.
   Charm quark is about 1.5 GeV.
   Bottom (beauty) quark is around 4.5 GeV. Oh wait, that's higher than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks because 4.5 * 2 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X → b b̄ is not allowed.
   Top quark is way heavier, like 173 GeV, so no way.

So possible quarks for decay are u, d, s, c. Wait, wait, c is about 1.2-1.5 GeV. So 2c would be about 3 GeV, which is within X's mass. So X can decay into c c̄? Wait, no, because the mass of the charm quark is about 1.5 GeV. So 2*1.5 is 3 GeV, and X is 6 GeV, so yes, that's allowed.

What about other leptons? The tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is about 3.56 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is more than that, so decay into tau pairs is allowed. 

Electrons and muons are even lighter, so their pairs are definitely allowed. 

So the possible decay products would be the pairs of e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, and the quark pairs c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄. Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, e pairs. But wait, we just saw b is too heavy. So A is out.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu pairs, e pairs. So this includes c, which is acceptable because 2*c is under 6 GeV. But wait, what about charm quarks? Is the X allowed to decay into c c̄? Well, the mass is 6 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so yes. So B includes all these.

Option C: Includes t quark, which is way too heavy. So C is out.

Option D: Includes b quark decay, which isn't allowed. So D is out.

Wait, but I thought that the possible fermions for decay are those with mass ≤ 3 GeV. So u, d, s, c, and leptons e, mu, tau. So the possible pairs are:

c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ−.

Which matches option B. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but why is option D there? Because D includes b quarks, but if X is 6 GeV, which is less than 2*m_b (which is about 9 GeV), so decay into b b̄ isn't allowed. So option D is incorrect.

Another thing: the Lagrangian given in the problem. Oh, wait! The interaction term is L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψf (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, I'm not sure if that's a typo or if I'm reading it wrong. Wait, maybe the term is written as -λ f ψ_fbar X ψ_f? Or maybe it's a Yukawa coupling term, where f is a fermion field, and X is the boson field. 

Wait, the way it's written, perhaps it's a term like λ X ψ_f ψ_f, implying that X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So any fermion that X can interact with can be a decay product, provided mass allows.

But unless the fermion isn't charged under the symmetry or something, but I think for the purposes of this problem, the interaction implies that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair it can, as long as kinematically allowed.

So the answer must be option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the possible fermion pairs \( f \bar{f} \) it can decay into. A decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) is allowed if the mass of \( X \) is at least twice the mass of the fermion \( f \), i.e., \( m_X \geq 2m_f \). Additionally, the interaction term in the Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) can couple to fermion-antifermion pairs, so the decay is also governed by the interaction strength.

### Fermion Masses and Decay Allowance:
1. **Electron (\( e^- \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
2. **Muon (\( \mu^- \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
3. **Tau (\( \tau^- \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed, as \( 3.56 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
4. **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 4-10 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
5. **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 3-6 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 6-12 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
6. **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 95-105 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 190-210 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
7. **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.4-3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed, as \( 3 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
8. **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
9. **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Rejected**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Accepted**.

- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Rejected**.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
