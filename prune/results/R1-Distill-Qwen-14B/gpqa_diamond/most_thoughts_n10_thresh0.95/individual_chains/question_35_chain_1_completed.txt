Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix. It's given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let's look at the options first.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts are ±h/(4π). That seems a bit off because eigenvalues for angular momentum usually relate to spin. Since the muon is a spin-1/2 particle, the possible eigenvalues for S_y (and hence A_y) should be ±ħ/2. Because for spin 1/2 systems, the eigenvalues are ±(ħ/2) for each component.

Wait, what's S here? Oh, S is a 2x2 matrix, so I think it's the spin operator. So the operator Ay is c multiplied by S. Let me compute c times S.

c is h/(4π), right? So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. The matrix S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So Ay would be [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]].

But wait, that's the matrix. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation: det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay - λ I would be [[-λ, -i h/(4π)], [i h/(4π), -λ]]. The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ].

Let me compute that: λ² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))² ].

Wait, (-i)(i) is -i², which is -( -1 ) = 1. So the determinant becomes λ² - ( (h/(4π))² * 1 ) = 0.

So λ² = (h²)/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ??? Wait, no. Wait, h/(4π) is c, so let me compute again.

Wait, wait, (h/(4π)) squared is h²/(16 π²). So sqrt of that is h/(4π) * (1/2) ? No, sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4π).

Wait, no, wait, the equation is λ² = (h²)/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2)? No, wait, that's not correct. Because sqrt( h²/(16 π²) ) is h/(4π) times sqrt(1/4) because 16 is 4 squared. Wait, wait, wait, sqrt(16 π²) is 4π. So sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4π), correct. So λ is ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ?

Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. The equation is λ² = (h/(4π))² * ( (i)(-i) ). Wait, wait, let me recheck the determinant calculation.

Wait, the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when you compute Ay, which is c*S, its elements are (0, -i c), (i c, 0).

The characteristic equation is:

det( Ay - λ I ) = 0 → determinant is λ² - ( (i c * (-i c) ) ) → because the off-diagonal elements are -i c and i c. So the product is (-i c)(i c) = (-i * i) * c² → (-i^2) * c². Since i^2 is -1, this becomes (- (-1)) * c² → 1 * c².

So determinant is λ² - c² = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ±c.

Ah, so the eigenvalues are ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right for spin-1/2. Because for spin, the eigenvalues should be ± ħ/2. Oh, wait, in this case, S is in units of ħ/2? Or perhaps S is in terms of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices for spin-1/2 systems are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S = (ħ/2) * σ, where σ is the Pauli matrix. So in this case, the given S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Y-component of the Pauli matrices multiplied by -i?

Wait, let me think. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. So perhaps S is σ_y, which is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So if S is σ_y, then Ay = c * σ_y. Since the spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ, so the Y-component is S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So if Ay is c * σ_y, and c is h/(4π), then Ay = (h/(4π)) * σ_y. Let's compute what c is in terms of ħ.

Planck's constant h is equal to 2π ħ. So h = 2π ħ → ħ = h/(2π).

So c = h/(4π) = (2π ħ) / (4 π) ) = ħ/(2).

So Ay = (ħ/2) * σ_y → which is exactly the S_y operator. So the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2.

So in this case, the eigenvalues of Ay should be ± ħ/2. Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, the eigenvalues are ± c, which is ± h/(4π). Since c is ħ/2, that would mean the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So that makes sense.

So looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: The eigenvalues would have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real for this operator. Because S is Hermitian? Let me check: the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is Hermitian because S† = S. So Ay is c * S, and since c is real, Ay is Hermitian. So eigenvalues should be real.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't make sense since the eigenvalues are real.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az. Well, A is the angular momentum, so A² eigenfunctions share the same eigenfunctions as the spherical harmonics. For spin-1/2, the eigenfunctions of A² would have eigenvalues (s(s+1)ħ²), which is (3/4) ħ². So for any state, if it's an eigenstate of A_y, it's also an eigenstate of A², because A² commutes with all components. Additionally, the eigenfunctions of A² and A_z would form a complete set. But would the eigenfunctions of A_y be eigenfunctions of A_z? No, because [A_y, A_z] = i ħ A_x, so they don't commute. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of A_z. But the statement in option C says they can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, because A² commutes with A_y. So this option is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Not sure what that means exactly. Any operator's eigenfunctions form a basis for the space they're acting on, which is 2D here. So yes, they form a basis. But I'm not sure if this is the correct statement. Maybe, but let's think again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the options are about which statement is correct when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So the question is which of the four options is correct.

So let's go back. The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is (h/(4π)) * (hbar = h/(2pi)), so ħ/2 = (h/(2pi)) / 2 = h/(4 pi). So actually, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 pi) * 2? No, wait, no. Let's compute:

Wait, c is h/(4 pi), and Ay = c * S. We found that the eigenvalues are ± c. So λ = ± c = ± h/(4 pi).

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the spin, I thought the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Let me compute that in terms of c.

c = h/(4 pi) → since h = 2 pi ħ, c = (2 pi ħ)/(4 pi) )= ħ/(2). So c is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± c → ± ħ/2, which is correct.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. But looking at the options:

Looking again, option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That's not right because the eigenvalues are real and ± ħ/2.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. So options A and B are out because they suggest the eigenvalues have imaginary parts.

So only options C and D are possible.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As I thought earlier, since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². So that part is correct. But can they be eigenstates of Az as well? Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenstates can't be the same. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of matrix Ay. Hmm, the eigenfunctions form an orthogonal basis, but the statement doesn't seem to add much. It's more about whether the basis is correct. But I'm not sure if this is a correct statement. The eigenfunctions form a basis, but that's always the case for any Hermitian operator in a finite-dimensional space.

So option C and D are both possible statements, but the question is about which is correct when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, another point: the eigenfunctions of Ay are the same as the eigenfunctions of S_y. For spin-1/2 systems, these are the eigenvectors of S_y, which are linear combinations of the up and down states in the z-direction. So, for example, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). So these are the eigenfunctions. So they are not eigenfunctions of Az because they are superpositions of the eigenstates of Az.

So option C says eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² (which is correct because A² commutes with Ay), but not of Az (which is correct). So option C is correct.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the matrix \( A_y - \lambda I \) becomes:

\[
A_y - \lambda I = \begin{pmatrix} 
-\lambda & -i c \\ 
i c & -\lambda 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - \lambda I) = \lambda^2 - (i c)(-i c) = \lambda^2 - c^2.
\]

Setting \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \), we find:

\[
\lambda^2 = c^2 \implies \lambda = \pm c.
\]

Since \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This corresponds to \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), as \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \).

### Step 2: Analysis of the Options
#### **Option A**:  
This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real, not complex.

#### **Option B**:  
This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

#### **Option C**:  
This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

#### **Option D**:  
This option claims that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While it is true that eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, this statement is less precise and does not directly address the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Thus, it is not the best choice.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately reflects the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
