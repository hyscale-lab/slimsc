Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

So the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

Wait, the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio when there are no spots divided by the ratio when there are spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So the ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Wait, let me make sure: the ratio of higher energy level to lower is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So if level 1 is lower than level 2, then n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ), so n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) )^{-1} ?

Wait, let me get this straight. The Boltzmann distribution tells us that the population of a higher energy level is less than a lower one if T is not infinite. So the ratio n_i/n_j is (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )^{-1} = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). Because:

n_i = g_i * N * exp( - E_i/(k T) )

So n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Since E2 > E1, E_i - E_j = E2 - E1. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no, because n1 is the lower level. So if E2 > E1, then E2 - E1 is positive. So n2/n1 is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which is a small number if the energy difference is large and T is small. So n1 is higher than n2.

But the problem states that the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). So the ratio is higher when T is higher because the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, making the ratio n1/n2 larger. Wait, but wait, the observed ratio decreases when T decreases. So when spots are present, T goes down, and ratio n1/n2 goes down as well. So that makes sense because lower T would lead to lower excitation, so more atoms in lower energy levels. So n1/n2 would be higher when T is higher. But wait, in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall T is lower. So the ratio n1/n2 would be lower, as observed. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots.

Wait, the question says "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_spots) ) ].

The g1/g2 terms cancel out. So the factor becomes exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_no_spots - 1/T_spots) )

Wait, because in the numerator, it's (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) and in the denominator, (E2-E1)/(k T_spots). So when you do the division, it's (E2-E1)/(k) * [ 1/T_no_spots - 1/T_spots ].

Wait, no. Let me think. The ratio is [exp(a)] / [exp(b)] = exp(a - b). So a = (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots), and b = (E2-E1)/(k T_spots). So a - b = (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/T_no_spots - 1/T_spots ].

But wait, T_no_spots is 6000 K, and T_spots is 5500 K. So 1/T_no is bigger than 1/T_spots. So (1/T_no - 1/T_spots) is positive.

So the factor is exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) [1/T_no - 1/T_spots] )

But I don't know E2-E1. Wait, but the transition wavelength is given as approximately 1448 Å. That's 1448 Angstroms, which is 1.448e-7 meters. The energy difference between the two levels can be found using the relation E = hc / λ.

So E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Angstroms = 1.448e-7 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) ) = let's calculate this.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But to get this into terms of energy per atom, we can compute it in Joules, but perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.373e-18 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait that seems high. Wait, wait, 1448 Angstroms is in the near UV, I think. Let me see: 1000 Angstroms is about 100 nm. 1448 Angstroms is about 144 nm, which is in the
