--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI acid cleavage reaction, which is used to break alkenes into diols or other products. Wait, no, more accurately, I think the reaction is about cleaving double bonds. Oh right, when alkenes react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to do a hydroboration or maybe it's a different reaction... Wait, no, I think red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrohalogenation, but maybe more specifically for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of alkenes. Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? No, Hofmann is with ammonia and heat. Let me think. Oh wait, I remember that when alkenes react with concentrated HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to effect the cleavage of the double bond, especially in dienes, but in this case, maybe it's a more straightforward addition.

But first, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data.

The IR data shows peaks around 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually suggests O-H or N-H stretches. But then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The peak at 1610 cm-1 could be an aromatic ring (C=C stretch), and 1450 cm-1 might be another aromatic peak or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Looking at the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2. Then a quartet at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – maybe a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Then a triplet/doublet at 2.9 ppm, 1H – that could be a CH next to two different groups, like in a -CH(CH2CH3)- structure. Wait, but more accurately, 2.9 ppm as a multiplet, perhaps a secondary alcohol or a CH next to an electronegative atom. 

Then, the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's very high, so it's likely an aldehyde proton. But wait, if there's a carbonyl group, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an aromatic aldehyde (like a benzaldehyde) would have a proton around 9-10 ppm. But wait, a carboxylic acid proton is usually broad because it's acidic and can exchange, but it's typically around 10-12 ppm. So 10.5 could be a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, that peak would be around 1700 cm-1, but sometimes a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, ketone, or aldehyde. Let's see.

Looking again at the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Could be a carboxylic acid OH, but wait, in D2O, the OH might be exchanged and the peak disappears. Alternatively, it's an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's a proton from something else.

Wait, but in the IR, 1720 is a carbonyl. So if it's a carboxylic acid, that would be around 1700, but maybe slightly higher. Alternatively, it's an ester or ketone.

Let me think about the NMR multiplets. The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 3H suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group? Wait, no, a triplet is usually from two neighboring groups. So for a tert-butyl group, perhaps? Or maybe a methyl group attached to a CH2. Let's look at the other signals:

At 1.4 ppm, a triplet of 3H. Wait, no, the 1.4 is a d (doublet) for 3H. That's more like a methyl group attached to a CH, like in CH(CH2CH3) or something. Hmm, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let me think of the structure. Let's try to piece it together.

The aromatic region in NMR:

8.0 ppm, d, 2H; 7.2 ppm, d, 2H. So two doublets, each integrating 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, maybe with two substituents in the para positions. For example, a benzene ring with substituents in positions 1 and 4. The downfield shift at 8.0 ppm (d) suggests electron-withdrawing groups. The 7.2 ppm is less downfield, so maybe an electron-donating group. Wait, but both are doublets, so maybe two substituents in para positions.

Wait, but actually, if it's a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents, each with a hydrogen adjacent. For example, if it's a meta-substituted, but wait, no, because in para, each substituent is opposite.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents at para positions, each being a group that causes the adjacent protons to split into doublets. For example, perhaps each substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, leading to the deshielded protons. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a methyl group and the other is an electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, but the integrals are 2H each, so each substituent is adjacent to two protons, making each a doublet. So perhaps the benzene ring has substituents in the para positions, and each substituent has two neighboring Hs. Hmm, that suggests that the substituents are in the para positions, each being a group with two Hs adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent at position 4 and another at position 1. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with a group that has two adjacent Hs. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the benzene ring is 4-substituted with a substituent that has a CH2 group. Or maybe it's a benzaldehyde group. Let me go back to the NMR.

The 10.5 ppm peak: If it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit the IR peak. But then, the aromatic signals are two doublets, which could be the protons adjacent to substituents.

Wait, let's consider the 1H NMR. Let's list all the signals:

- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H: Maybe a carboxylic acid proton.

- 8.0 ppm, d, 2H: Two Hs as a doublet.

- 7.2 ppm, d, 2H: Another two Hs as a doublet.

- 2.9 ppm, m, 1H: A methine (CH) group.

- 1.7 ppm, m, 2H: Two Hs, perhaps a CH2.

- 1.4 ppm, d, 3H: A methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm, t, 3H: A methyl group attached as a terminal (like CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, putting this together: The aromatic signals suggest a para-substituted benzene. The substituents are possibly a carbonyl group and another group. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group and an alkoxy group, but I don't see an O-H peak in the IR except the broad one, which could be a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, which could indicate either OH (like in a carboxylic acid) or maybe an amine. But the presence of a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1 suggests it's more like a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid.

If it's a carboxylic acid, the OH would show up in the IR as a broad peak around 2500-3000 cm-1, which it does. The 1720 cm-1 peak would then be the C=O of the carboxylic acid.

So, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent. Let's think about the other NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) suggests a CH group adjacent to two different groups, maybe. Then the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to another CH2. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is a terminal methyl, probably part of a longer chain.

Putting this together: Maybe the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group and a substituent like a sec-butyl group. Let me visualize the structure.

Wait, benzene ring with a substituent that's a sec-butyl group and a substituent that's a carboxylic acid? No, because the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1 which could be the carboxylic acid, but also the NMR has a 10.5 ppm proton, which would be the -COOH proton.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which is 1H. A carboxylic acid would have a proton, so that makes sense.

So, the structure might be a para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent. Let's think about the substituents.

Looking at the NMR, we have a 1.4 ppm d (3H), which is a methyl attached to a CH. Then there's a 2.9 ppm m (1H), which is a CH attached to that methyl and maybe another group. The 1.7 ppm m (2H) could be a CH2 connected to that CH.

Putting this together, the substituent could be a chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Or perhaps a branching.

Wait, let me try to draw this in my mind. The benzene ring has at position 1 a carboxylic acid group (COOH), and at position 4 a substituent which is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, but looking at the substituent's NMR:

The 1.4 ppm is a d (3H), which is a methyl group attached to a CH that is connected to another CH2. So the substituent would be something like CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene. Or more accurately, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH(CH2CH3)) group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's think: a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, the substituent would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3), attached to the benzene ring.

So, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 2.9 ppm m (1H), which would be the CH in the sec-butyl group. Because the sec-butyl group is like CH2CH(CH2CH3), the CH in the middle would show up as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm, split by neighboring protons.

So, putting it all together, the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Because the benzene ring has the carboxylic acid (COOH) in position 1, and the sec-butyl group in position 4.

Alternatively, wait, the substituents could be in positions 4 and 1, but I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Let me think: in the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, each adjacent to two equivalent protons.

Wait, for example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then each adjacent to two protons. So, on the benzene ring, the substituents are at 1 and 4, and the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those in 3 and 5 would be equivalent. But for that, the substituents would each be in a position that splits the adjacent protons into doublets.

Wait, but in that scenario, the two substituents would each have a neighboring group, but the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests that each substituent is adjacent to two equivalent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta situation, but I think para would make the NMR signals as two doublets with 2H each.

So, if the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the substituents are a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

Wait, now looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that's a possibility.

Now, the reaction part: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What's that reaction?

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroboration reaction, but I think more accurately, it's used in the cleavage of alkenes when there's an adjacent di-substitution. Alternatively, I might be mixing this up with other reactions.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the acid-catalyzed cleavage of alkenes, especially in dienes, but perhaps in this case, it's about the addition to an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation, but I think that's done with other reagents.

Wait, another possibility: Red phosphorus and HI can be used for the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, but in a way that follows anti-Markovnikov addition. Oh wait, no, the classic anti-Markovnikov addition is done with HX and a peroxide initiator, like in the case of HBr and ROOR for anti-Markovnikov addition.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI is a method for adding HI to alkenes. Let me think: When an alkene reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it results in the formation of a diiodide, but under specific conditions, it can lead to the cleavage of the double bond. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me recall. I think when HI is used with red phosphorus, it's for the cleavage of alkenes. For example, in the presence of a diene, it can lead to the formation of a diol upon hydrolysis. Or, more accurately, the reaction of an alkene with red phosphorus and HI leads to the cleavage of the double bond, adding HI across each carbon and then cleaving to form a diiodide, which can then be hydrolyzed.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: Red phosphorus reacts with HI to form phosphorus triiodide (PH3I3?), which can then add to the double bond. Then, the addition leads to the breaking of the double bond, and the formation of two iodides. But I'm not exactly sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, another possibility: The reaction is a hydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain.

But in this problem, the initial compound is a benzoic acid derivative, perhaps with a substituent that has an alkene. Wait, but the initial structure doesn't have an alkene, does it? Or does it?

Wait, no, the initial structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a single bond structure, no double bonds. So if X is that, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't do anything, which can't be right because the question says it reacts. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in deducing the structure of X. Let me re-examine the data.

Wait, the NMR has a 2.9 ppm m (1H) and a 1.7 ppm m (2H), which could be part of a CH2-CH2 group. But if X is undergoing a reaction that requires an alkene, perhaps X has an alkene. So maybe the substituent is a vinyl group or something.

Wait, but looking back, the IR doesn't show a peak for a C=C stretch. Wait, the IR given has a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So perhaps the structure has a benzene ring, which would explain that peak. Alternatively, if there's an alkene elsewhere, that peak could be around 1640-1680 cm-1, but 1610 might be more towards an aromatic ring.

Wait, another thought: The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl. The 1610 could be an aromatic ring, and the 1450 could be another aromatic peak.

So, if the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or carboxylic acid. Earlier I thought it's a carboxylic acid.

But if X has an alkene, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI (which I think is for cleavage) would lead to adding iodine and breaking the double bond. But in the structure I thought of, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, there's no alkene. So maybe I'm wrong.

Let me think again.

Looking at the signals in the NMR:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H). That looks like a chain: the 0.9 triplet is a CH2CH2CH3 group, attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH (the 2.9 ppm), which is attached to a methyl group (1.4 d, 3H). So the structure would be something like CH2CH2CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, but that doesn't make a lot of sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branching: like a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, another approach: The signals suggest a four-carbon chain. Let me count:

- 0.9 (t, 3H): that's a terminal CH3, so part of a longer chain.

- 1.7 (m, 2H): likely a CH2 group connected to something.

- 2.9 (m, 1H): a CH connected to two different groups.

- 1.4 (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH(CH2CH3)) group? Not sure.

Alternatively, think of a substituent like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a isobutyl group. Let me think: isobutyl is -(CH2)2CH(CH3), which would have a structure where the CH2 groups are adjacent.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. That would fit an isobutyl group, as the methyl group attached to the central CH would be a doublet.

So, maybe the substituent is an isobutyl group attached to the benzene ring. So the structure would be 4-isobutylbenzoic acid.

Wait, but how does that fit with the NMR?

The substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. So, the CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), the CH in the middle at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), and the methyl groups at 1.4 (d, 3H) and 0.9 (t, 3H).

Wait, but isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait no, no, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, isobutyl is actually -CH2CH(CH3)2, but I might be mixing terms. Wait, the structure of isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Hmm, perhaps not. Let me make sure.

Isobutyl group: The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. The isobutyl group has the structure -CH2-CH(CH2CH3), but wait, that's actually a sec-butyl group. Or wait, no. Let's clarify.

Butyl groups:

- n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-

Wait, no, I think iso-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, actually, iso-butyl is -CH2-C(CH3)2? No, that would be a tert-butyl group. Hmm, perhaps I should draw this.

Butyl group: four carbons.

n-butyl: straight chain: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, perhaps iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, iso-butyl is when the branching is on the second carbon. So, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, that can't be right because that would be longer than four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the NMR.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, then the NMR would have:

- The terminal methyl at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

- The adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

- The central CH at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is connected to another CH2 and a methyl.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would be the methyl attached to the central CH. So, in a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that would have the CH2CH2CH3 as the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. For example, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 3-pentyl group or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, the options suggest that X is either a benzoic acid derivative (options C and A) or a substituted benzene without a COOH group (options B and D).

But the IR data has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which would suggest a carbonyl, and the 10.5 ppm peak in NMR suggests a proton that's possibly from a COOH group.

So, the correct option would be either A or C.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would fit the IR and NMR data.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Hmm, that would have a propanoic acid group attached to a benzene ring in the 2-position, with an ethyl substituent in the 4-position. Let me think about the NMR.

In option A, the benzene ring would have substituents in the 2 and 4 positions. The propanoic acid would have a CH2CH2COOH group. But I'm not sure if that fits the NMR.

Wait, the NMR has a 1.4 ppm d, 3H, which would fit a methyl group attached to a CH. So, for a propanoic acid group, the structure would be CH2CH2COOH. The terminal CH3 would be at around 1.0 ppm as a triplet. But in the given NMR, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm, which fits a CH3 at the end of a chain. Then the CH2 next is at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which is a CH2 group. Then the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be part of the propanoic acid chain.

Wait, but if it's a propanoic acid group, the structure would be benzene-CH2CH2COOH. The NMR would have a triplet for the terminal CH3 (maybe at 0.9), then a quartet for the adjacent CH2, but in the given data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet integrating 2H, so that could be the CH2 next to the CH. Then the CH would be at 2.9 ppm, and the COOH proton at 10.5 ppm.

So, that could fit option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Wait, but 4-ethylphenyl would have an ethyl group in the para position of the benzene. So the structure would be:

Benzene ring with a substituent at position 2 which is a propanoic acid group (-CH2CH2COOH), and an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons would be different. Let's think: if the substituents are at positions 2 and 4, the adjacent protons would be more complex. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in the para position, but that complicates the NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propionoic acid group, which would be benzene-CH2CH2COOH.

In that case, the substituent is in the para position. The benzene would have two substituents: a propanoic acid group and another group, but the given NMR doesn't show that.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as a single group that includes the COOH. So, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propanoic acid attached via a carbon chain. For example, benzene-CH2CH2COOH. That would mean the substituent is at the para position, and the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, each integrating 2H, which matches the given data.

In that case, the substituent is a propanoic acid group attached via a two-carbon chain. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2CH2COOH. Let's see the NMR:

The aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H, para-substituted. The CH2CH2COOH would have a CH2 next to the benzene, then another CH2, then the COOH. The CH2 next to the benzene (CH2-) would have protons that are split into a triplet from the adjacent CH2. The next CH2 would be split into a quartet. But in the given NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet, maybe a triplet or a quartet. Hmm, but the given 1.7 is m (2H), so perhaps it's part of a chain.

But in the given data, the 1.4 ppm is a d (3H), which would be the methyl group attached to the CH, perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1? Or is it position 4? Wait, the name is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which suggests the COOH is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4.

The structure would be:

COOH attached to position 1, and a sec-butyl group attached to position 4. So the benzene ring would have substituents in positions 1 and 4.

The substituent at position 4 is a sec-butyl group: which is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the NMR of the substituent:

- The terminal methyl (CH2CH2CH3) would be at 0.9 ppm, triplet.

- The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm, multiplet.

- The central CH (from the sec-butyl) would be at 2.9 ppm, multiplet.

- The methyl attached to the central CH would be at 1.4 ppm, doublet.

That matches all the non-aromatic signals in the NMR.

Now, the aromatic NMR: two doublets, each 2H, at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.

In the structure of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the benzene ring has substituents in the 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl) positions. So the adjacent protons would be in positions 2 and 6 (for COOH), and positions 3 and 5 (for sec-butyl). Those would each be doublets, integrating to 2H each. That fits the NMR data.

So, the structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Now, the reaction part: X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What happens to a benzoic acid when treated with red phosphorus and HI? Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. If X is an acid, then under those conditions, maybe it's undergoing some reaction.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI is usually about alkenes. So if X has an alkene, then the reaction would cleave it. But according to my earlier analysis, X doesn't have an alkene. So perhaps I'm wrong about X's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps X has a conjugated double bond, but the IR doesn't show a peak in the typical alkene region (like around 1640 cm-1). The IR given has 1610 cm-1, which is more in line with aromatic C=C. So perhaps X doesn't have an alkene, making the reaction part confusing.

Wait, but if X is a benzoic acid derivative, then adding HI and red phosphorus wouldn't react. So perhaps I'm wrong about X's structure.

Alternative approach: Maybe X is an ester, which upon reaction with HI would undergo some cleavage.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI is typically used for the cleavage of alkenes. But if X doesn't have an alkene, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe X has a carbonyl group, and the reaction involves some kind of addition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative. Let me think. If X is benzaldehyde with a substituent, then the IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1 (the aldehyde's carbonyl is around 1720 cm-1), and the NMR would have a peak around 9-10 ppm for the aldehyde proton. But in the given NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid than an aldehyde. Aldehyde protons are usually sharp singlets around 9-10 ppm.

Hmm, so maybe X is a carboxylic acid, and the reaction is something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation. When a carboxylic acid is heated with certain reagents, it can lose CO2. But red phosphorus and HI don't usually induce decarboxylation, unless in specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, but if X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that has an alkyl chain, perhaps the reaction is adding HI to any double bonds present. But according to the earlier analysis, X doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, maybe X has a conjugated double bond, and the IR at 1610 cm-1 is the C=C stretch. So perhaps X is a cinnamic acid derivative.

Cinnamic acid has a structure like benzene-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the benzene and the CH2. So, the structure would be benzene-CH=CH-COOH.

Wait, but that would have a double bond. Let me check the NMR again.

If X were cinnamic acid, the NMR would have a triplet and quartet for the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond. Also, the IR would show a peak around 1640 cm-1 for the C=C.

In this case, the IR given has 1610 cm-1, which is a bit lower than typical for an isolated double bond. So maybe it's conjugated.

But let's think: If X is cinnamic acid (or a derivative), then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the double bond would undergo cleavage. The cleavage would add HI across the double bond, followed by cleavage to give a diiodide, which upon hydrolysis would give diols or other products.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction adds an iodine across the double bond.

But if X is a carboxylic acid with an alkene, then the reaction would cleave the alkene, but I'm not sure how that would affect the rest of the molecule.

Wait, but according to the options, the product isn't a benzoic acid anymore, so perhaps the COOH is transformed into something else.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Let's look for the reaction outcome.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Let's suppose that X has an alkene, and the reaction cleaves it.

So, after cleavage, the product would have additional functional groups, perhaps adding iodine.

But the options don't include any diiodides, so perhaps the product is a diol or something else.

Wait, but if the reaction is cleavage of a double bond, and the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative, perhaps the product would be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, adding HI to the alkene in a Markovnikov or anti-Markovnikov fashion.

But without knowing the structure of X, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). If that's the case, then there's no alkene to react with red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps the reaction does something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester. Let me think: if X is an ester, then the reaction with HI would perform an acid-catalyzed cleavage.

Wait, an ester like benzyl acetate would react with HI to form an acid and an alkyl iodide. But again, without the structure, it's hard.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a Benzoin condensation, but that requires something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition, but again, without an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl in X, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is this, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI (which is a strong acid and a good nucleophile), perhaps the reaction is a substitution. But I don't see a good leaving group in the structure besides the COOH, which is a poor leaving group. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative. Let me reevaluate.

Suppose X is benzaldehyde with a substituent that causes the IR and NMR to match. Let's see.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an aldehyde. The NMR has a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which would fit an aldehyde proton.

But in that case, the structure would be benzaldehyde with some substituent. Let me see the NMR:

The 1.4 and 0.9 ppm signals suggest a chain, possibly a propyl group.

So, perhaps X is 4-propylbenzaldehyde. But then, the substituent would be a propyl group, and the aldehyde would be in the para position.

The NMR would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (CH2CH2CH3), a quartet at 1.7 ppm (CH2), a triplet at 2.9 ppm (CH), and a singlet at 10.5 ppm (CHO).

But wait, the NMR given has a triplet at 0.9, then a multiplet at 1.7, a multiplet at 2.9, and a doublet at 1.4. So perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzaldehyde.

So, the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde. Then, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzaldehyde.

The NMR would have:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets, as before.

- Aldehyde proton: 10.5 ppm, singlet.

- Substituent: 0.9 (t, 3H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 2.9 (m, 1H), 1.4 (d, 3H).

That fits.

So, X could be 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde.

In that case, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would add HI across the double bond if there's one, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the structure as I thought doesn't have a double bond. So maybe I'm wrong again.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent has a double bond. For example, perhaps X is 4-(vinyl)benzoic acid or something similar.

Wait, but the IR doesn't show a strong peak in the alkene region. The given IR has 1610 cm-1, which could be an aromatic C=C, but if X has an isolated double bond, the peak would be higher, around 1640-1680 cm-1.

Hmm, perhaps X has a conjugated double bond, such as in a cinnamic acid derivative. So, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)cinnamic acid.

In that case, the structure would be benzene-CH=CH-COOH, with a sec-butyl substituent on the benzene.

The IR would have a peak around 1610 cm-1 for the conjugated double bond. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, and the CH=CH group would have specific signals, like a triplet and quartet.

But looking at the NMR data given, there's no indication of a triplet or quartet that would suggest a CH2 adjacent to a double bond.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to think of the reaction first.

Assuming that X has a double bond, and the reaction cleaves it with HI and red phosphorus, leading to the addition of iodine across the double bond, which upon hydrolysis would give a diol or similar.

But without knowing the exact structure, I can't be certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a diiodide, which then hydrolyzes to form two carboxylic acids or similar groups. But again, without more info, it's hard.

Wait, going back to the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its reaction with red phosphorus and HI may not do anything because there's no double bond. So perhaps the product would remain the same, but that's unlikely because the problem states a reaction occurs.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about X's structure. Perhaps X isn't a benzoic acid but a benzaldehyde.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would add HI across the aldehyde? Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, if X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that has a double bond, the reaction would cleave the double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydroboration, but with HI, it's more likely to be a hydrohalogenation. But without an alkene, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, maybe X is a benzoic acid with a vinyl group, and the reaction cleaves the double bond, but I don't see how that would fit the NMR data.

Another thought: Maybe the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but I don't think so, because that's a synthesis step, not a reaction with X.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that X is a ketone. Let me think again about the IR. The 1720 cm-1 could be a ketone. Then, the NMR would have a singlet or multiplet for the carbonyl. But the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which would be more like an -OH group, perhaps a ketone wouldn't have that.

Alternatively, the 10.5 ppm peak is from an aldehyde, but then the 1720 cm-1 would fit the aldehyde's carbonyl. So maybe X is a benzaldehyde derivative.

Wait, let's think: if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would do nothing because there's no double bond. So perhaps the reaction is something else, like a Grignard reaction, but that's not applicable here.

I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should make a decision based on the data.

Given all the NMR and IR data, the structure of X is most likely option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But then, the reaction part is puzzling. So, what would happen when benzoic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI? Hmm, maybe the reaction is a substitution, but I don't see a good leaving group.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group. Red phosphorus and HI could act as a nucleophile. But carboxylic acids are not usually reactive towards nucleophilic attack under such conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is decarboxylation, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI induce that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the benzoic acid into something else, but I can't think of a common reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is adding HI to the carboxylic acid, but that would form an acid iodide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not affecting the carboxylic acid but another part of the molecule. Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and it has a double bond elsewhere, perhaps in the substituent.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which has a CH2-CH(CH2CH3) structure. No double bonds there. So perhaps the reaction isn't applicable, but the question says it reacts.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is a Hofmann elimination, but that requires amines.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to proceed.

Assuming that X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction adds HI to any double bond present. But since X doesn't have a double bond, maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction cleaves the ester into a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But without more data, I can't be sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a Dieckmann condensation, but that requires esters and a base, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, but that requires HCl and Zn(Hg), not HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, but again, not applicable here.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the structure is option C, and the reaction doesn't change it, but that can't be right because the question states that a reaction occurs.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carboxylic acid is converted into an acid chloride, but with HI, that would require a chlorinating agent, which isn't present.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution, but that's more common with amines or alcohols.

Wait, another angle: Maybe X is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent that has a double bond, and the reaction cleaves the double bond to give a diol.

But without the structure, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration of an alkene, but again, without an alkene in X, I'm stuck.

Well, perhaps I should proceed with what I have, assuming that X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and that the reaction doesn't change it. But that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI can also be used to reduce carbonyl groups. For example, in the presence of a carbonyl, they can reduce it to an alcohol. But that would require a carbonyl, which X has as a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acids are generally not reduced under such conditions. They are usually difficult to reduce.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I can't think of any.

Well, I think I'm stuck on the reaction part. Maybe I should proceed with the structure and the reaction.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring. But I don't see a good leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires activating groups, which a carboxylic acid isn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction, but that requires a diene and a dienophile, which I don't see in X.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion.

The structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would... I'm not certain, but perhaps it's a cleavage of an internal double bond if present. But without an alkene, this is unclear.

But looking at the options for the product, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the structure, but the question says it reacts. So, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of X.

Alternatively, perhaps X has an ester group instead of a carboxylic acid, and the reaction cleaves it.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 could also be an ester carbonyl. Then, the NMR would have an ester group, which usually has a triplet for the OCOOR group. But the NMR given doesn't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to form a carboxylic acid, but that usually requires water and acid/base, not red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm.

Another angle: Perhaps the reaction is a Hoffman elimination, but that requires an amine.

I think I'm stuck. Given the initial data, the structure of X is most likely option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not sure about the reaction outcome.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could be introducing iodide into the molecule. Perhaps it's an SN2 reaction on the substituent.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. If there's a good leaving group, perhaps the hydrogen on the CH could be replaced by iodide. But I don't see a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding iodide to the benzene ring, but that's unlikely without a catalyst.

Well, I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the spectral data, X is most likely option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would add iodide across any double bond, but since there isn't one, perhaps the product remains the same. But since the question says a reaction occurs, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of an ester group, but without an ester in X, that can't be.

In any case, I'll proceed with the structure as option C.


The problem involves identifying Compound X based on its IR and NMR data and determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR data shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, a broad peak in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range (likely an O-H stretch), and peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹, consistent with an aromatic ring. The NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (likely a carboxylic acid proton), aromatic protons as two doublets (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H), and signals for a CH group (2.9 ppm, m, 1H), a CH₂ group (1.7 ppm, m, 2H), a methyl group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H), and a terminal methyl group (0.9 ppm, t, 3H). These signals suggest a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl substituent.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure would not match the NMR data, as it implies a more complex splitting pattern for the aromatic protons and additional signals for the propanoic acid chain that are not observed.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure lacks a carbonyl group, which is inconsistent with the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ and the broad singlet at 10.5 ppm in the NMR, both indicative of a carboxylic acid.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure fits the data well. The para-substituted benzene explains the two doublets in the aromatic region (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm). The sec-butyl group accounts for the signals at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). The carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ and the broad singlet at 10.5 ppm are consistent with a carboxylic acid group.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   Similar to Option B, this structure lacks a carbonyl group, making it inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are typically used for the cleavage of alkenes. However, based on the spectral data, Compound X does not contain an alkene. Instead, it is a benzoic acid derivative. Given this, the reaction likely does not involve cleavage of a double bond. The exact reaction pathway is unclear, but the structure of X is consistent with Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

### Conclusion:
Based on the IR and NMR data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not appear to alter the structure significantly, as no double bond is present in X.
