Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the key here is figuring out how the Doppler shift relates to the orbital period.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. Because the star moves toward and away from us due to the planet's orbit, the spectral lines shift. The shift amplitude (the maximum shift) is related to the star's velocity. So if Planet #2 causes a larger shift, that means the star is moving faster.

But how does the star's velocity relate to the planet's orbital period? I remember the formula for the RV method involves the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (P * (1 year in seconds) )^(1/3) )) ) )^(1/ (something? )). Wait, maybe I should think about it differently.

Another approach: the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for K is K = (v) = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ), where i is the inclination angle. But since the planets are detected, the inclination must be such that sin i is close to 1 (edge-on), so we can assume sin i ≈ 1 for both.

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like). So M_planet is the same for both. The stars have the same mass (solar masses). So for both planets, the only difference is the Doppler shift, which depends on K. 

So, K1 is 5 milliangstroms for Planet #1, K2 is 7 milliangstroms for Planet #2. But wait, wait—what's the unit here? Oh, wait, no, the shift is in wavelength, but K is a velocity. So I need to convert the wavelength shift to velocity.

The Doppler shift formula relates the velocity to the wavelength shift. The formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. So v = c * (Δλ/λ). But in the RV method, the velocity semi-amplitude K is what's measured. 

But wait, the shift given is in milliangstroms. Do I know the wavelength of the spectral line? The question doesn't specify the particular line, but perhaps it's a standard line like the H-alpha or something else. Hmm, but without knowing the exact wavelength, maybe I can relate the velocities proportionally.

Wait, but when the wavelength shift is larger, the velocity is larger. So K is proportional to the shift. So K2 = (7 /5) * K1. Because the shift is 7 vs 5 milliangstroms, so their velocities are in the same ratio.

But wait, the formula for K is K = ( ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ something) ) * ( ... ). Wait, maybe I can compare the two planets.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * π)^(1/3) ) * (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(-1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) c) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the relation between K and the orbital period P.

The formula I remember is:

K = (v) = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star (Neptune is about 1/7th Earth's mass, which is negligible compared to a star), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) c^(1/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps we can write this as K proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * 1/(P^(1/3)) )

But since both stars have the same mass (M_star same for both), and planets are same mass (M_p same for both), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Or, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait, let me think again. If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So P ∝ 1/K^(3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is shorter than P1? Or longer?

Wait, let me think. Let me write this more carefully.

Assuming same M_p and M_star for both planets, then K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)).

So, K = k / P^(1/3), where k is a proportionality constant.

So, K1 = k / P1^(1/3), K2 = k / P2^(1/3).

Divide K2 by K1: K2/K1 = [ (k / P2^(1/3)) ] / [ (k / P1^(1/3)) ] = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So, (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

We can rearrange this to find P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3.

Wait, let me double-check that algebra.

From K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3), cube both sides: (K2/K1)^3 = (P1/P2). So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, if (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3), then (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2. So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

So, the ratio P2/P1 would be (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, that makes sense because if K2 is larger, then P2 must be smaller. Because higher K implies higher velocity, which for the same star and planet mass, would imply a shorter period. Because the star has to orbit the center of mass more quickly.

So, given that K2 is larger than K1, P2 should be smaller than P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. So, how many times longer is P2 than P1? The question is P2 compared to P1.

Wait, the question is "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So P2 is longer than P1? No, wait, if K2>K1, then P2 is shorter, so the factor would be less than 1.

Wait, let me think again. Because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so as P increases, K decreases. So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1. So P2 is shorter, so the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1. So the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. That would be a factor less than 1.

But wait, let me plug the numbers. K1 is 5 mA, K2 is7 mA.

So, K2/K1=7/5=1.4.

So (K2/K1)^3 = (1.4)^3 = approximately 2.744.

So, from earlier, (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

5/7 is approximately 0.714. 0.714 cubed is about 0.364.

So P2 = P1 * 0.364 → P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? 0.36 times, which is shorter.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

The question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 is 0.36 times P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So P2 is shorter, hence it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. Let me go through it again.

We have K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)). So,

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, earlier I think I had K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3), but I must have messed up the algebra.

Wait, let's rederive:

We have K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K = A / P^(1/3), where A is a constant.

So, K1 = A / P
