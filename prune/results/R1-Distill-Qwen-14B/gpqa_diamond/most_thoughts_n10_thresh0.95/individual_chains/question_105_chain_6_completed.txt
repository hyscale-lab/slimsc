Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star with some dark spots on it and how that affects the observed brightness over time. Then it's comparing that to the brightness dip we'd see if a planet were blocking the star's light. The goal is to find out what the radius of such a planet would have to be to mimic the same brightness variation caused by the spots.

Alright, let's start by noting the given data. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K.

The situation says that photometric observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating, modulating the spots into and out of view. But from our perspective, this looks similar to a planet transiting the star. The question is, what planet radius would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do.

Wait, but the question says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So I think I'm comparing the relative brightness change due to a planet transit to the change due to the spots.

First, let me think about the brightness variation from the spots. Since the spots are cooler, when they are on the visible side (as the star rotates), the total brightness emitted will drop a bit. The same way a planet blocks some light, causing a dip.

So the key is to compute the fractional change in brightness for both cases and set them equal, then solve for the planet's radius.

But wait, the planet is causing a dip because it's blocking a part of the star. The spots are causing a dip because their cooler regions are facing us. So the two effects are a bit different. The planet blocks the light, so the brightness goes down by the area blocked. The spots contribute less light when they're in view because they're cooler.

Hmm, maybe I should model both scenarios and set their brightness variations equal.

Let me formalize this.

First, the star's total brightness without any spots is L = 4πRstar² σ Teff^4.

When spots are present, when the spots are on the visible side, the brightness L' will be less. The spots cover a certain area, and each spot is cooler.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere.

Wait, the star's surface is a sphere, so area is 4πR^2. One hemisphere is 2πR². The filling factor is 20%, so the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR^2 = 0.4πR².

Each spot is cooler: T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So when the star is rotating, and the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the emitted flux will be a mix of the normal star and the spots.

Wait, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into view, so the brightness variation is due to the spots being cooler. So the brightness is a combination of the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

So the total flux when the spots are visible would be: L_emitted = L_unspotted + L_spots.

L_unspotted: this is the part of the star that's normal. The area is (Area of hemisphere - area of spots). The area of the unspotted part is 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6πR².

So the flux from the unspotted part is (1.6πR²) * σ Teff^4.

The flux from the spots is (0.4πR²) * σ (T_spot)^4.

So total flux when spots are visible is (1.6 * Teff^4 + 0.4 * (T_spot)^4) * σ π R².

Wait, but wait: actually, the flux is per unit area, so the total flux would be the sum of the fluxes from each region.

Then, the normal star without any spots would have a flux L_total = 4π R² σ Teff^4. But when the spots are on the visible side, the flux is L' = (1.6π R²) * σ Teff^4 + (0.4π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, but when a hemisphere has spots, the other hemisphere is unspotted. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and the unspotted is not. So the brightness variation is between when the spotted hemisphere is visible and when it's not.

Wait, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to rotate into and out of view. So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no, because the star emits uniformly, but when part of it is cooler, when that part is on the near side, the total flux is less. So the brightness variation would be periodic as the star rotates.

So, the star's brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible is lower than when the unspotted is visible.

So the change in brightness is the difference between the two.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation, which is the difference between maximum and minimum brightness.

So when the star is showing the unspotted hemisphere, the flux is maximum; when it's showing the spotted, it's minimum.

So let's compute the maximum and minimum fluxes.

Maximum flux (F_max): all the unspotted area is visible. So the unspotted area is (the entire star minus the spots on one hemisphere). Wait, no: if the spots are only on one hemisphere, then when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire star's face is unspotted. When the spotted hemisphere is facing, the spots are on the side we see.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The star has spots covering 20% of one hemisphere. So the other hemisphere is completely unspotted.

So when the star is viewed such that the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire surface is at Teff. When the spotted hemisphere is facing, 80% (100% - 20%) of the visible hemisphere is at Teff, and 20% is at T_spot.

Wait, no, because the spotted hemisphere has spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is the one we see, the area of the spots is 0.2*(π R²) = 0.2 * area of a hemisphere.

The area of a hemisphere is 2π R², so the spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². But when the hemisphere is the one we're seeing, the total area visible is 2π R². So the unspotted part is 2π R² - 0.4π R² = 1.6π R².

So maximum flux occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The flux is F_max = (2π R²) * σ Teff^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_min = (1.6π R²) * σ Teff^4 + (0.4π R²) * σ (T_spot)^4.

So the difference in flux is ΔF = F_max - F_min.

The amplitude of variation is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Wait, but F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, which occurs once per rotation, and F_min is when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between F_max and F_min.

Now, the problem says this situation can resemble an exoplanet transiting the star. So the dip in brightness when a planet transits is (Area_planet / Area_star) * (L / L), but wait, more precisely, the dip is (Area_planet / Area_star) because the planet blocks that part of the star's light.

But wait, the star's luminosity is based on its area and temperature. So when a planet blocks part of the star, the dip in flux is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is π R_p^2, and the star's area is π R_star^2 (but I think in transit, the area is for the disk, which is a circle, so area is π R^2).

Wait, no, the star's cross-sectional area is π R_star^2. So the planet blocks a fraction (R_p / R_star)^2 of that area. So the dip in flux, ΔF_planet = (R_p / R_star)^2 * F_star.

In the case of the star with spots, the dip in flux is F_max - F_min.

The question is: to get the same amplitude (same dip) as the planet, what R_p is needed.

So we set the dip from the spots equal to the dip from the planet.

Let me compute ΔF_spot = F_max - F_min.

F_max = 2π R² σ T_eff^4.

F_min = (1.6π R² σ T_eff^4) + (0.4π R² σ (T_spot)^4)

So ΔF_spot = F_max - F_min = [2π R² σ Teff^4] - [1.6 π R² σ Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4]

Simplify:

2π R² σ Teff^4 - 1.6 π R² σ Teff^4 = 0.4 π R² σ Teff^4.

Then, subtract the spot contribution: 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 - Teff^4).

Wait, no, wait: Let me compute F_min again.

F_min = (1.6 π R² σ Teff^4) + (0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 )

So F_max = 2 π R² σ Teff^4.

Thus, ΔF_spot = F_max - F_min = (2 π R² σ Teff^4) - [1.6 π R² σ Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

= (2 - 1.6) π R² σ Teff^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4

= 0.4 π R² σ Teff^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4

Factor out 0.4 π R² σ:

= 0.4 π R² σ [Teff^4 - (5000)^4 ]

Now compute the ratio ΔF_spot / F_max.

Because F_max is 2 π R² σ Teff^4.

So ΔF_spot / F_max = [0.4 π R² σ (Teff^4 - 5000^4)] / [2 π R² σ Teff^4 ]

Simplify:

= (0.4 (Teff^4 - 5000^4 )) / (2 Teff^4 )

= (0.2 (Teff^4 - 5000^4 )) / Teff^4

= 0.2 (1 - (5000^4 / Teff^4))

Teff is 6000 K. Let me compute (5000/6000)^4.

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

0.8333^4 = (0.8333)^2 squared. Let's compute:

0.8333^2 ≈ 0.6944. Then square that: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So substituting:

= 0.2 (1 - 0.4823) = 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.10354.

So ΔF_spot / F_max ≈ 0.10354, which is about 10.35% dip.

Wait, but the dip from the planet is (R_p / R_star)^2, as that's the fraction of the star's area blocked.

Wait, no, because when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light, so the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2.

So for the same dip, (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.10354.

Wait, but let me double-check.

No, wait: the dip in brightness is (Area_blocked / Area_star) = (π R_p^2) / (π R_star^2) )= (R_p / R_star)^2.

So that's correct.

So solving for R_p / R_star:

(R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.10354

Take square root: R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.10354) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, that's about 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.32.

But wait! Let me think again. Because in the star's case, the dip is 10% of the star's maximum brightness. But wait, no: the number I got is 0.10354, which is about 10.35% dip. So that's the dip caused by the spots.

But the planet's dip is (R_p / R_star)^2. So to get a 10.35% dip, R_p / R_star would be sqrt(0.10354) ≈ 0.3218, or about 0.32.

So the answer would be D) ~0.32.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the way I calculated the dip. Because when the star shows its spotted hemisphere, the flux is F_min, and when it shows the unspotted, it's F_max. So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Wait, but I think I did that correctly. Let's recheck.

F_max = 2 π R² σ T^4.

F_min = (1.6 π R² σ T^4) + (0.4 π R² σ (T_spot)^4).

So F_max - F_min = 0.4 π R² σ (T^4 - (T_spot)^4).

Then (F_max - F_min)/F_max = [0.4 (T^4 - (T_spot)^4)] / (2 T^4) )

Which is 0.2 (1 - (T_spot^4 / T^4)).

Wait, no, because 0.4 / 2 is 0.2.

Yes, so I did it correctly.

So 0.2 * (1 - ( (5000)^4 / (6000)^4 )) ) = 0.2 * (1 - ( (5/6)^4 )) as I did earlier.

So that gives the fractional dip. So the exoplanet's dip is (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.10354, so R_p / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10354) ≈ 0.3218, so 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.32.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with dark spots, we analyze the brightness changes caused by both the spots and the planet.

### Key Data:
- **Star's radius**: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \)
- **Filling factor of spots**: 20% of one hemisphere.
- **Star's effective temperature**: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
- **Spot temperature**: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)

### Brightness Variation Due to Spots:
The star's total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (\( F_{\text{max}} \)) is:
\[
F_{\text{max}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
\]
When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux (\( F_{\text{min}} \)) is:
\[
F_{\text{min}} = (1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4) + (0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4)
\]
The brightness variation amplitude is:
\[
\Delta F_{\text{spot}} = F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}
\]
Substituting \( F_{\text{max}} \) and \( F_{\text{min}} \):
\[
\Delta F_{\text{spot}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 - \left( 1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right)
\]
\[
\Delta F_{\text{spot}} = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right)
\]
The fractional brightness variation is:
\[
\frac{\Delta F_{\text{spot}}}{F_{\text{max}}} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right)}{2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{\Delta F_{\text{spot}}}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.2 \left( 1 - \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} \right)
\]
Substitute \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
\[
\frac{\Delta F_{\text{spot}}}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
\]
\[
\frac{5000}{6000} = 0.8333, \quad \left( 0.8333 \right)^4 \approx 0.4823
\]
\[
\frac{\Delta F_{\text{spot}}}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.2 \left( 1 - 0.4823 \right) = 0.2 \times 0.5177 \approx 0.1035
\]
Thus, the fractional brightness variation due to the spots is approximately \( 10.35\% \).

### Brightness Variation Due to a Planet:
The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the area blocked:
\[
\frac{\Delta F_{\text{planet}}}{F_{\text{max}}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]
To match the brightness variation caused by the spots:
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
\]
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3218
\]
Thus, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \).

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet that produces the same brightness variation as the star's spots is closest to **0.32**.
