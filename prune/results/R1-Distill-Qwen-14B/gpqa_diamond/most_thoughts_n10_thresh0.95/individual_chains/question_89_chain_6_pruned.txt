Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

First, I need to figure out what each product is. Let's start with the first reaction.

1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, to form an alkene. So the bromines are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which would have two bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond between those two carbons. So product 1 would be adamantene with a double bond, perhaps 1,3-adamantadiene? Or more accurately, maybe it's 1,3-diene? Alternatively, maybe it's just a mono-alkene since KOH in excess would lead to elimination, not substitution. Oh wait, but in adamantane, the structure is highly branched, so when you eliminate two bromides, you form a bridge double bond. Hmm, I'm a bit shaky on the exact structure, but I think product 1 is an adamantane with a double bond, so an alkene.

The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, that's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which usually appears around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. But wait, if product 1 is an alkene from elimination, why would there be a carbonyl group? Hmm, perhaps I got the first reaction wrong. Alternatively, maybe the first step is not elimination but dehydrohalogenation forming a ketone? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. No, wait, wait, KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) to form an alkene, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Alternatively, maybe the first step is a substitution reaction. Oh wait, but KOH is a base, not a good nucleophile for substitution in such a structure. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when heated with KOH, it undergoes a double elimination, but wait, no, because two bromides are on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening reaction. Wait, perhaps it's a dielimination to form a ketone? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Or is there some kind of rearrangement?

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but that's unlikely because KOH isn't typically used for epoxidation. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldol condensation? But wait, that requires carbonyl groups, which the starting material doesn't have. I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think again.

Wait, another approach: the product 1's NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let's see what those could correspond to. The 4.79 ppm is probably an ether or an alcohol, or maybe an ester or a carbonyl group. Alternatively, a carbonyl adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ester or ketone. But the 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H, which makes me think of a CH₂ group attached to something deshielded, like an oxygen. Wait, maybe it's an epoxide? But the IR showed 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a C=O stretch. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a ketone. So maybe product 1 is a ketone, adamantanone. How?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) to form an alkene, but that wouldn't introduce a carbonyl. Wait, but wait, what if the base causes an elimination to form a carbonyl group via some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but that's less likely with KOH and a dihalide.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when heated with KOH, it undergoes a double elimination (like a double dehydrohalogenation), which would form an enol. Wait, but that doesn't directly lead to a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or some kind of elimination followed by oxidation, but I don't think KOH would oxidize it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but that's another can of worms.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR data. The 4.79 ppm peak is 2H, which is a singlet. Could that be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or a ketone? Or maybe a carbonyl group with adjacent CH₂. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal diol, but that's less likely. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl with two adjacent protons, such as in an acetone group. Wait, but acetone's protons are around 2.1 ppm, so that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an alcohol.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the IR. The 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So perhaps the product is an epoxide? No, epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. So, if product 1 is an adamantane ring with a ketone group, then the structure would be something like 1,3-diketone adamantane? But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would require two eliminations to form a diketone. Hmm, but that would require removing two HBr and forming two ketone groups, which may not be feasible from adjacent bromines.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, it undergoes a double elimination, but not forming a double bond but instead a ring contraction. For example, in adamantane, removing two HBr could lead to the formation of a bridgehead ketone. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a bridgehead double bond, but that wouldn't introduce a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution of the bromides with hydroxide. But since it's KOH, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. However, adamantane is a very rigid structure, and the bromides are in a bridgehead position, which is not favorable for substitution (since bridgehead substitutions are generally difficult due to the rigidity). So perhaps substitution isn't the main pathway here.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But epoxide formation usually requires a peracid, not KOH. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the possibility that product 1 is a diketone, and the reaction is a double elimination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the second reaction. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone (due to the IR peak), then heating with Al isopropoxide might lead to some kind of acylation, but that would require an acylium ion. Or perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but product 1 would need to be an aromatic ring, which adamantane isn't. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone with a bicyclic structure, and the Al isopropoxide is causing some rearrangement.

Wait, maybe product 1 is not a ketone. Let me reevaluate. If the first reaction is elimination, forming a double bond, then product 1 would be an alkene. So the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ would not be from a C=O. That doesn't make sense. So maybe the first reaction is not elimination but substitution.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 is a diol. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, not a good nucleophile for substitution in such a rigid structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a diepoxy structure, but I don't know.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR data. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ group next to an oxygen, perhaps an ether or an alcohol. The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) suggests several CH₂ groups in a more shielded environment, perhaps in a ring structure. The 1.94 (2H) might be another CH₂ group adjacent to something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a diol, where each OH is at a bridgehead, but diols are usually less stable. Alternatively, maybe it's a mono-hydroxy product, but with two OH groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, but then the NMR wouldn't have a singlet at 4.79 for 2H.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a carbonyl group adjacent to a CH₂, but that doesn't explain the singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal diol, but that's a stretch.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's consider product 2. It's formed by heating product 1 with excess Al isopropoxide. So if product 1 is a ketone, maybe product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of rearranged structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetylation product.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → upon two elimination steps, losing two HBr and forming a ketone. So each Br is on a bridgehead, and eliminating each would form a bridgehead ketone. But bridgehead carbonyls are possible in certain bicyclic structures. So the product would be 1,3-diketone adamantane. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would require substitution, which is less likely under KOH conditions.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. If that's a CH₂ adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps it's part of an epoxide ring. But the IR doesn't show the epoxide C-O-C stretch, which is around 1250-1050 cm⁻¹. The IR here shows a strong peak at 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. So, the 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, each elimination forming a ketone. So each Br is on adjacent carbons, and eliminating each would form a double bond, but wait, no, elimination of HBr forms an alkene. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Hmm, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Wait, perhaps I should move to the next step and see if that helps. So product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide.

If product 1 is a ketone (as suggested by the IR), then product 2 could be undergoing some kind of acylation. For example, if product 1 is a ketone with an alpha hydrogen, perhaps a Friedel-Crafts acylation occurs, but I don't think adamantane would undergo that since it's not aromatic. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is undergoing some kind of rearrangement with the Lewis acid.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is a diol formed by ring-opening, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, which would have an oxygen adjacent to a CH₂ group, explaining the NMR peak at 4.79 ppm. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So, possible structures include ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a lactone.

If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 could be an enol ether or some kind of enol form. Alternatively, perhaps it's undergoing a Claisen or aldol condensation, but that would require another carbonyl group in proximity.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an aldehyde. Then, the IR would show around 2820-2720 cm⁻¹ for the aldehyde C-H stretch, but the given IR only mentions 1720 cm⁻¹. So perhaps it's a ketone.

Let me think about the NMR again. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. If this is a CH₂ next to a carbonyl, maybe it's part of a ketone group. So perhaps the structure is something like (CH₂)₂CO, but with the CH₂ being adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, but in that case, the CH₂ would be split into a triplet or something else. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, so the two protons on that CH₂ must be equivalent and not split by neighboring protons. So maybe it's a geminal di-substitution, but that's not typical unless it's a carbonyl adjacent to a CH₂ group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone, but in this case, it's part of the adamantane structure. So, the 4.79 ppm could be two protons on a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl group. But in a regular ketone, the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would show up around 2.1 ppm, so 4.79 is higher, suggesting more deshielding. Hmm, maybe it's an ester or amide, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like in an ether or alcohol. For example, in an epoxide, the CH₂O would show up around 3-4 ppm. But 4.79 is a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group with adjacent oxygen, like an acetal or ketal.

Wait, another possibility: the 4.79 ppm could be a carbonyl group with two adjacent protons, but that's unlikely because the chemical shift for a carbonyl is much higher. Wait, the 4.79 is for the H, not the C.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen, like in a hemiacetal or acetal. For example, in a six-membered ring acetal, the CH₂ would be around 3-4 ppm. But 4.79 is a bit high.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is a CH₂ group adjacent to two oxygen atoms, like in a carbonate or something. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about product 2 and the reaction with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts, but I don't think it's involved in that here because adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, it could be used in acyloxylation or some kind of acylation of an alcohol.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is an alcohol, but with a carbonyl group elsewhere. So, perhaps the NMR's 4.79 is an alcohol OH, but that's usually a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should move to the third step and see if it can shed light on the earlier steps.

The third step is ozonolysis of product 2, followed by workup with dimethylsulfide to form product 3. Ozonolysis typically cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond. So, product 2 is an alkene.

So, product 2 is an alkene. Then, product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which are carbonyl compounds. So, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Looking at the options, the coupling patterns are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet. The most deshielded H would likely be near a carbonyl, so perhaps adjacent to a CH₂ group or part of a conjugated system.

Wait, but how does this relate back to the earlier steps?

Let me try to outline the possible structures again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1.

Assuming product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't explain the IR at 1720. Alternatively, product 1 is a ketone.

Step 2: product 1 (ketone) → product 2 (alkene) via treatment with Al isopropoxide. Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and Al isopropoxide is causing a rearrangement to form an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or an alkene formed via some elimination.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. For example, elimination of HBr twice could form a ketone. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, product 1 would have two ketone groups, which would explain the IR at 1720. But would that fit the NMR?

The NMR for product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet). If product 1 is a diketone, maybe the structure has a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like two ketones connected via a bridge, so a CH₂ group is next to a carbonyl. Then, the two protons on that CH₂ would be equivalent, giving a singlet. So, the 4.79 ppm peak would correspond to that CH₂.

Then, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, so perhaps it's causing the formation of an enol or a conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe it's causing a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement to form an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is an enol ether formed via an acid-catalyzed dehydration.

Wait, if product 1 is a diketone, then heating it with Al isopropoxide (a Lewis acid) might lead to the formation of an enol ether. Enol ethers are formed by the dehydration of ketones, especially under acidic conditions. So, perhaps each ketone group loses a water molecule to form an enol ether, which would have an adjacent double bond.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a single ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed via acid-catalyzed dehydration.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, the NMR of product 3 would show the protons adjacent to these carbonyl groups. The most deshielded would likely be the ones nearest to the carbonyls, so perhaps on the adjacent CH₂ groups.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each resulting fragment gains an O. For example, if the alkene is in the middle of a chain, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds. But in a cyclic structure like adamantane, the cleavage would form ketones or other carbonyl compounds depending on the substitution.

Let me think about the structure of product 2. If it's an alkene, where would it be in the adamantane structure? Perhaps it's a bridgehead double bond, which would make the structure highly strained, but adamantane is a very rigid structure, so maybe the double bond is in a less strained position.

When ozonolysis is performed, each end of the double bond would form a carbonyl. So, the product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

In product 3, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be deshielded and appear downfield. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

If the structure after ozonolysis is such that each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH₂ group, then the H on those CH₂ groups would couple with each other. For example, if each CH₂ is next to a carbonyl, and each H on the CH₂ is next to two other Hs on adjacent CH₂ groups, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps each original CH₂ adjacent to the double bond becomes a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl group after ozonolysis. So, each of these CH₂'s Hs would couple with two neighboring Hs on the same group and perhaps with Hs on adjacent groups.

But I'm not exactly sure about the structure. Let me try to outline a possible structure.

Suppose product 2 is an alkene in the adamantane structure, say, 1,3-adamantadiene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into two carbonyl groups. Wait, but product 2 is a single alkene, so ozone would cleave it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but in adamantane, the structure is highly branched. So, perhaps the double bond is between two bridgehead carbons. Ozonolysis would then cleave each double bond, but in reality, each bridgehead is connected to multiple CH₂ groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is in a more linear part of the structure, so ozonolysis would produce two ketone groups.

Assuming that, each CH₂ adjacent to the original double bond would now be next to a carbonyl group. So, each of these CH₂'s Hs would be split by their neighboring Hs.

Each CH₂ group has two Hs. The Hs on each CH₂ would be adjacent to another CH₂ group. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs (on the same CH₂) and perhaps another H on the adjacent CH₂.

Wait, more precisely, if the structure after ozonolysis is something like (CH₂)₂CO, then each CH₂ would be adjacent to another CH₂ group. So the Hs on each CH₂ would be adjacent to two Hs on the same group and perhaps two Hs on the neighboring group.

Wait, but in reality, the structure is more complex because it's part of the adamantane framework. So, let's imagine that each carbonyl is attached to a CH₂ group, which is connected to two other CH₂ groups.

Wait, perhaps the CH₂ next to the carbonyl is connected to two other CH₂ groups. So, each H on that CH₂ would have neighboring Hs from both the same CH₂ and the adjacent ones.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H in product 3 is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, which is itself adjacent to another CH₂ group. In that case, each H on the CH₂ would couple with two Hs on the same group (as a triplet) and also with Hs on the adjacent CH₂ group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, for example, if each H on the CH₂ is next to another H (same CH₂, so triplet), and also next to two Hs on an adjacent CH₂ (so a quartet), then the splitting would be a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but the NMR of product 3 is what we're looking at. The most deshielded H would be near the carbonyl, so let's say it's a CH₂ next to a carbonyl. Each H on that CH₂ would see the two Hs on the same CH₂ (so triplet) and perhaps also the two Hs on an adjacent CH₂ group (so another splitting into a triplet). So the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, if each H is only coupled to the two Hs on the same CH₂ and one H on the adjacent CH₂, that would result in a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, let's think about the structure. Suppose the CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl is connected to another CH₂ group. So each H on the first CH₂ would couple with the two Hs on the same CH₂ (giving a triplet) and with the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂ (giving another triplet). So each H would experience two triplets, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But in reality, coupling between two adjacent CH₂ groups would mean each H on the first CH₂ is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So each H would have a coupling constant with those two, which would split each peak into a triplet. So the first splitting is from the same CH₂ (a triplet), and the second splitting is from the adjacent CH₂ (another triplet), resulting in a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is through space, but that's less likely. It's more likely through bonds.

Wait, but perhaps the coupling is only to one neighboring H. Let me think of a simple example: if a CH₂ group is next to another CH₂ group, each H in the first CH₂ would couple with the two Hs in the adjacent CH₂. So each H would have a coupling with two Hs, each with the same J value, leading to a triplet for each. So the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

But wait, in reality, each H in the first CH₂ would couple to two Hs in the adjacent CH₂, but since those Hs are on the same group, perhaps it's a triplet. Alternatively, if the adjacent group is a CH₂, each H on the first group would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. So each H's peak would be a triplet, and the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but let's think about ethylene glycol dimethyl ether. The CH₂ groups are adjacent, and the Hs would couple as such. Each H on CH₂ would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So each H would be a triplet. So the overall pattern is a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps each H is a triplet due to coupling with two Hs on the same group, and a doublet due to coupling with one H on an adjacent group, leading to a triplet of doublets, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another approach: in a CH₂CH₂ group, each CH₂'s Hs are split by the adjacent CH₂. So each H in the first CH₂ is split by the two Hs in the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. Thus, the splitting would be a triplet for each H.

But in the case of product 3, perhaps the structure is such that each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂, leading to each H being a triplet. But the options given are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the coupling is to two adjacent Hs (same group) and two more (from another group), then the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled to three other Hs, leading to a quartet, but that's not an option here.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH₂ group that's next to a carbonyl and also next to another CH₂ group. So, each H on this CH₂ would be coupled to the two Hs on the same CH₂ (a triplet) and to the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂ group. So each H would be split into a triplet due to the same group and a triplet due to the adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, each H is coupled to two Hs (same group) and one H (adjacent group), which would make it a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, which would fit this scenario. However, option C is a doublet of triplets, which would imply coupling to two sets: one resulting in a triplet and another in a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled to two Hs on the same CH₂ (triplet)
