--- Full Content ---
Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. So the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me start by understanding what's given.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

First, I think I need to find the concentrations after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So total volume becomes 40 cm³.

The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, because 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters.

After dilution, the new concentration is moles divided by total volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh, wait, because 40 cm³ is 0.04 L. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So the reaction will convert some acetic acid into acetate ions.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Let's find out how much acetic acid is left and how much acetate is formed.

So, moles of acetic acid initially after dilution is 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, no, wait. Wait, after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M, but in 0.04 L, that's 0.025 × 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So the initial moles are 0.001.

At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles have reacted. So moles of acetic acid left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 moles.

But wait, what's the volume at this point? Because when you add NaOH, it's adding volume, but for dilute solutions, maybe we can assume it's negligible? Or perhaps we should calculate.

Wait, but when doing the initial dilution, we have 40 cm³. Then when titrating, adding 25% of the required NaOH volume would add some more volume. Hmm, but for a 25% point, maybe the volume added is 25% of the equivalence point volume. So first, what's the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001, so moles of NaOH needed is 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, or 10 cm³.

So at 25% titration, we add 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So the total volume at 25% is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, to find the pH, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, first pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = about 4.735 (because 1e-5 is 5, 1.85 is about 0.26, so 4.735).

So pH = 4.735 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's calculate that ratio.

0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.735 - 0.477 ≈ 4.258. So approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH value. But let me check other options.

Wait, also, maybe I should be precise with the calculations. Let me compute the ratio more accurately.

0.00025 / (0.00075) is 1/3. So the ratio is 1/3, so log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771.

So pKa is about 4.735, so pH = 4.735 - 0.4771 = 4.2579, which rounds to 4.26.

So the first pH is 4.26. Looking at the options, option A and D have this as the first value. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 4.26; 8.52
B) 3.17; 6.73  
C) 4.73; 7.00
D) 4.57; 6.92

So options A and D have 4.26 as the first value. Now, the equivalence point pH.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. The solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

So, moles of acetate are 0.001 moles, and the volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, the concentration is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak base:

OH- concentration = sqrt( (Kb * C) )

So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.977. pH is 14 - 4.977 ≈ 9.023.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH around 9.0 at equivalence. The options only go up to 8.52 (option A) and the others are lower.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I messed up the volume. Let me recalculate:

At equivalence point, the NaOH added is 10 cm³, so total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³=0.05 L.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

Using the formula for weak base:

[OH^-] = sqrt( (C × Kb) )

C × Kb = 0.02 × 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11.

sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.982. So pH is 14 - 4.982 ≈ 9.018.

But none of the options have a pH near 9.0. Wait, the options' equivalence points are 8.52 (A), 6.73 (B), 7.00 (C), 6.92 (D). So none match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another way: Maybe instead of using Kb, I should calculate the pH using the hydrolysis equation more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dilution.

Wait, another thought: Did I miscalculate the concentration of acetate? Let me check.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol.

Volume: 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

Concentration: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the acetate is a conjugate base and in solution with its conjugate acid, but wait, no, at equivalence point it's all acetate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

Kw = 1e-14.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9.

1 / 1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so Kb ≈ 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH is about 4.98, pH is 9.02. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dilution steps.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should consider that when you add NaOH to the diluted acetic acid, the solution isn't just acetate, but that the dilution is already considered. Wait, no, because the NaOH is 0.1 M, and we've added 10 cm³ to reach equivalence.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me recheck.

Original acetic acid: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M.

Diluted with 20 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

After dilution, concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

That's correct.

At equivalence, all of that 0.001 mol is converted to acetate.

Then, the volume is 40 +10=50 cm³.

So acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps when calculating the pH at equivalence, I should consider that the solution is a buffer, but no, all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact formula for a weak base instead of the approximation.

The hydrolysis equation is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let me set up the variables. Let x be [OH^-].

Initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, and CH3COOH is 0.

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (if x is small)

[CH3COOH] = x

[OH^-] = x

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02) = 5.405e-10.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH = 4.98, pH ≈9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02. What's the closest option? Option A is 8.52.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in using Kb. Maybe I should calculate using the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the acetate ion is a weak base and the solution is basic, but let me try using the exact method.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that at equivalence point, the solution concentration is not 0.02 M. Let me double-check.

Wait, moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm, so perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial reaction. Wait, no, the reaction is correct. CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should calculate the pH using the initial pH before any NaOH is added, and then see about the 25% titration.

Wait, but the question is about the pH during the titration, so that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that at 25% titration, the volume is not 42.5 cm³, but perhaps I need to calculate the exact volume added.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. The NaOH required to reach equivalence is 0.001 mol. So 0.001 mol NaOH at 0.1 M is 10 cm³.

25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So the total volume is 20+20 +2.5 =42.5 cm³. So 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are as I calculated before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH more accurately.

Calculating log(1/3) accurately: 1/3 is 0.3333333...

Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.4771.

pH = 4.735 -0.4771=4.2579, which is 4.26. So the first pH is 4.26.

Looking back at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52 and D is 4.57;6.92.

So if the first value is 4.26, the options are A and D. But then, option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, which is nowhere near my calculated 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps when I diluted the acetic acid, I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles =0.05 *0.02=0.001 mol.

Adding 20 cm³ of water: total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 =0.025 M. That's correct.

At 25% titration, I added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So the solution is 42.5 cm³.

In this solution:

moles of acetic acid: 0.00075 mol.

moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] =0.00025 /0.0425≈0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = 4.735.

log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = log(0.3333) = -0.477.

So pH =4.735 -0.477=4.258 ≈4.26.

Hmm, this matches option A's first pH.

But then the equivalence point pH is not matching any options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the solution at equivalence point isn't just the acetate. Wait, no, because all the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is 0.02 M acetate, but perhaps the solution is not just the acetate; perhaps it's a buffer, but no, at equivalence point, all the acid is converted to its conjugate base.

Wait, let me compute the pH using the exact formula.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. The Kb is 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

Let's set up the ICE table.

Initial:
[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M
[CH3COOH] = 0
[OH^-] = 0

Change:
- x
+ x
+ x

Equilibrium:
[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x
[CH3COOH] = x
[OH^-] = x

Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have pH near 9.0. Hmm.

Wait, the options have equivalence pH as 8.52 (A), 6.73 (B), 7.00 (C), 6.92 (D). So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the solution wasn't just the acetate, but perhaps the dilution of NaOH affects the concentration. Or perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact Kb without the approximation.

Wait, let's try without the approximation. Let's solve for x using the equation:

x² = Kb (0.02 -x).

So,

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

Let me write this as:

x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

This is a quadratic equation. Let's use the quadratic formula.

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*1*(-1.081e-11) = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D) ≈ 6.577e-6.

x = [-b ± sqrt(D)] / (2a) → [ -5.405e-10 ±6.577e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root: (6.577e-6 -5.405e-10) /2 ≈6.576e-6 /2 ≈3.288e-6.

So x ≈3.288e-6 M.

Wait, that's [OH^-] =3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514. Which rounds to 8.51.

Oh, that's close to option A's equivalence pH of 8.52.

Wait, but why did the previous approximation give a different result? Because in the initial approximation, [OH^-] was 1.04e-5, leading to pH≈9.02, but solving the quadratic gives a lower [OH^-], leading to pH≈8.51.

Ah, I see. So I should have used the exact quadratic solution because the approximation x<<0.02 isn't valid here. Because when I calculated x≈1e-5, which is about 5% of 0.02 (since 1e-5 is 0.00001, 0.02 is 0.02, so 5e-3 is 0.5%? Wait, perhaps I should recheck.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2.

x is 3.288e-6, which is 3.288e-6 compared to 2e-2. So x is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation should hold. But why the discrepancy?

Wait, no, when using the quadratic, the value of x is 3.288e-6, which is about 0.016% of 0.02. So the approximation x<<0.02 is valid, but why the exact solution gives a different x?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let's double-check.

The equation is x² = Kb * (0.02 - x). So Kb is 5.405e-10.

So x² =5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x).

Which is x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11=0. Correct.

Wait, when I solved using the quadratic formula, I got x≈3.288e-6.

Wait, but using x=3.288e-6 in the approximation: 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So the initial approximation holds. So why is the value of x lower than when I assumed x is small?

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error in the quadratic solution.

Wait, let me re-calculate the discriminant.

D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1.081e-11) → because c is negative, so it's +4ac.

So (5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4*1.081e-11 = 4.324e-11.

So D= 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11, since 2.9e-19 is negligible.

So sqrt(D) ≈sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Wait, no, the equation is x = [-b + sqrt(D)] / 2a.

Which is [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6 /2 =3.288e-6.

So x=3.288e-6.

Wait, but plugging this back into the Kb expression:

(3.288e-6)^2 / (0.02 -3.288e-6) = (1.081e-11) / (0.0199967) ≈5.405e-10. So that's correct.

So the [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514. Rounded to two decimal places is 8.51, which is very close to option A's 8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.51, which is option A's second value of 8.52.

So the pH at 25% is 4.26 and equivalence point is 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26;8.52.

Wait, but I thought earlier that option A's equivalence pH was 8.52, which matches our calculation.

But earlier when using the approximation, I got pH=9.02, but the exact solution gives 8.51.

So the correct answer should be option A: pH 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of diluted acetic acid with NaOH at two specific points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. The key steps and calculations are as follows:

---

### **Initial Setup**
- **Dilution of Acetic Acid**:  
  The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³.  
  Moles of acetic acid = \( 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Diluted concentration = \( \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \).

---

### **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.  
- Moles of acetic acid initially = \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Moles reacted = \( 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Remaining moles of acetic acid = \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Moles of acetate formed = \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).  

The total volume at this point is \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \).  
- Concentrations:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
  \]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]
where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.735 \).  
\[
\text{pH} = 4.735 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.735 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.735 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

---

### **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions.  
- Moles of acetate = \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total volume = \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L} \).  
- Concentration of acetate = \( \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M} \).

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:  
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]
The \( K_b \) for acetate is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10} \).

Using the approximation for weak bases:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] \approx \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.41 \times 10^{-10})(0.0200)} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, solving the quadratic equation for the exact hydrolysis equilibrium gives a slightly lower pH:  
\[
\text{pH} \approx 8.52.
\]

---

### **Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.  

**Answer: A**
