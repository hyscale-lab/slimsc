Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The question provides five stars, each with different characteristics, and I need to figure out which ones are observable by both instruments.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. That means any star with a V magnitude less than or equal to 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so the apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 for HIRES to detect them.

Wait, no, actually. Wait, the problem says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star's V magnitude is less than 17, it's brighter than 17 and can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, if the apparent V magnitude is less than 16, they can observe it.

So each star needs to have an apparent V magnitude that is ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. But wait, no, because the question is about stars that can be detected by both. So the star must be detectable by both, meaning its apparent magnitude must be ≤16 in V (since that's the stricter condition). Because if a star is brighter than 17 mag, ESPRESSO can see it, but if it's fainter than 16 mag, HIRES can't. So only stars that have apparent V magnitude ≤16 can be seen by both.

But wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Because each star has a certain absolute magnitude and distance, so their apparent magnitudes can be calculated. Oh wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes, others have apparent. Let me check each star.

Let me go through each star.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5 mag, located at 10 pc distance.

Wait, wait. Absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) if the star were at 10 parsecs away. So m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d/10), but wait, I think the formula is m = M + 5 log10 (d) -5. So for d in parsecs.

Star1 is at 10 pc, so d=10. So m= M +5*(log10(10)) -5 = 15.5 +5*1 -5=15.5+5-5=15.5. So apparent V magnitude is 15.5. So for ESPRESSO, can see it (since 15.5 <17), and HIRES can as well (15.5 <16). So Star1 is visible by both.

Wait no, Star1's absolute magnitude is 15.5, which at 10 pc gives m=15.5. So both spectrographs can detect it.

Star2: apparent V magnitude 16.5, located at 5 pc. So m=16.5. So for ESPRESSO, m=16.5 is brighter than 17 so can be observed. For HIRES, we need m ≤16, but 16.5 is larger than 16, so HIRES can't observe. So Star2 is visible only by ESPRESSO.

Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. The note says that the total absorption in V is 3.1 times the color excess. So the extinction A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Wait wait, wait, I think I got that backwards. Wait, when interstellar medium causes extinction, the observed magnitude is brighter when there's more extinction? No, wait, wait. Extinction makes stars appear fainter because the light is absorbed. So the apparent magnitude increases (since higher magnitudes are fainter).

Wait, no. Let me think. The formula is m_observed = m_true + A_V. Because extinction (A) adds to the magnitude, making the star appear fainter. So if a star's light is dimmed, it's magnitude increases. So for Star3, the apparent magnitude given is 15.5, but that is after extinction? Or is it the intrinsic apparent magnitude?

Wait, the question says: Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V=3.1 * 0.6=1.86. So I think the apparent magnitude is actually the observed one, but I'm not sure. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says, for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but there's extinction. So perhaps the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the intrinsic is different. Hmm, that seems a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m_true, and the extinction makes it appear as m_observed = m_true + A_V.

But wait, the question says for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag, and E(B-V)=0.6. So I think that the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, which includes the extinction. So to find the intrinsic apparent magnitude, m_true would be m_observed - A_V. But wait, that seems confusing because extinction makes the object appear fainter, so the observed magnitude is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should model it correctly. The formula is:

m_observed = m_true + A_V

So if a star's apparent magnitude without extinction is m_true, and extinction is A_V, then when extinction is present, the observed m is m_true + A_V.

In Star3's case, the observed m is 15.5, so m_true = 15.5 - A_V = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the star is at 15 pc. Let's compute its apparent magnitude without extinction.

Wait, Star3's absolute magnitude is not given. Wait, no, Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, which I think is the observed magnitude including extinction. So perhaps we should compute its intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) to find what the actual brightness is.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The star's apparent magnitude is affected by extinction. So if the star is behind a lot of dust, its observed magnitude is higher (fainter) than it truly is.

So the actual apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m_true = m_observed - A_V.

So for Star3, m_observed =15.5, A_V=1.86. So m_true=15.5 -1.86=13.64.

So this is m_true, the magnitude if there were no extinction. So for the purpose of the observatory's detection, since the observatory would see the star through extinction, their detection limit is based on the observed m.

Wait, no, the observatory detects the star as it appears, which is after extinction. So the apparent magnitude used for whether the star is bright enough is the observed m.

Wait, no, I think that's correct. Because the star's apparent magnitude as seen from Earth is m_observed. So the brightness we see is lower (fainter) because of extinction. So for a star with m_true=13.64, but with extinction, it appears as 15.5.

So when the observatory is looking, they would see m_observed=15.5, which is higher than 16. So for HIRES, which can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, which is m <16. But Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is brighter than 16. So HIRES can observe it. What about ESPRESSO? It can observe stars up to m=17. So 15.5 is within both, so both can observe Star3.

Wait, but wait. Star3's observed magnitude is 15.5, which is less than 16 (so acceptable for HIRES) and less than 17 (so acceptable for ESPRESSO). So Star3 is observable by both.

Wait, wait, but I'm confused. Because the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but that includes the extinction. Does that mean the telescope sees it as 15.5? Or is the extinction not considered in the star's apparent magnitude? Hmm. Let me re-read the problem.

The problem says, for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag and E(B-V)=0.6. The note says total absorption in V is 3.1 times E(B-V). So the extinction is A_V=3.1*0.6=1.86. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V. So if the intrinsic (without extinction) apparent magnitude is m_intrinsic, then m_obs= m_intrinsic +1.86. But the problem states that Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5. So if m_obs=15.5, then m_intrinsic=15.5-1.86=13.64.

Wait, that would mean the star is intrinsically brighter, but due to extinction, it's dimmed to 15.5. So when the spectrograph is observing, they see the star at 15.5 V mag.

So for the spectrograph, their detection limit is based on the apparent magnitude as observed. So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is within both ESPRESSO (<=17) and HIRES (<=16). So Star3 can be detected by both.

Star4: absolute V magnitude 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4. Distance is 10 pc.

So first, calculate its apparent magnitude without extinction. Since M=15.5, distance=10 pc. So m = M + 5 log10 (d) -5 = 15.5 +5*1 -5=15.5. So m_true =15.5. Then, compute A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed m_obs= m_true + A_V=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So observed m is 16.74. So for ESPRESSO, that's fine (<=17), but HIRES requires m <=16. So Star4's observed m is 16.74, which is above 16. So HIRES can't detect it, but ESPRESSO can. So Star4 is detectable only by ESPRESSO.

Star5: absolute V magnitude 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Compute its apparent magnitude without extinction. m = M +5 log10(d) -5. d=5 pc.

5 log10(5)=5*(0.69897)=3.4949. So m =16.5 +3.4949 -5=16.5 + (-1.5051)=14.9949, approximately 15.0.

So the apparent magnitude is 15.0. No extinction is mentioned for Star5, so E(B-V)=0? Or is it zero? The problem doesn't mention extinction, so I think it's zero. So observed m is 15.0, which is less than 16 and 17, so both spectrographs can detect it.

Wait, what's the situation for Star5? The absolute magnitude is 16.5, distance 5 pc. So m = M +5 log10(5) -5.

Wait, 5 log10(5) = 5 * 0.69897 ≈3.4949. So 16.5 +3.4949=19.9949, minus 5 is 14.9949, about 15.0. So apparent magnitude is 15.0. Since no extinction is mentioned, that's the observed m. So m=15.0. So both can see it.

Putting it all together:

Let me list each star's apparent V magnitude (considering extinction if applicable):

Star1: m=15.5 (observed, no extinction)
Star2: m=16.5 (observed, no extinction)
Star3: m=15.5 (observed)
Star4: m_obs=16.74 (after extinction)
Star5: m=15.0 (observed)

Now, which stars have m ≤16 and ≤17?

Star1: m=15.5 → both can see.

Star2: m=16.5 → ESPRESSO can see (m≤17), but HIRES can't (m>16). So only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=15.5 → both can see.

Star4: m=16.74 → ESPRESSO can (<=17), HIRES can't (16.74>16).

Star5: m=15.0 → both can see.

So which stars can be detected by both spectrographs:

Star1, Star3, Star5.

Wait, but let's look at the options.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, I thought Star1,3,5 can be seen by both. So the options don't have a choice with all three. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck each star.

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star3: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can detect.

So which options include any two of these?

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be seen by both. So this is a correct pair.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1 can be seen by both, Star4 can't.

So the correct stars that can be detected by both are Star1,3,5. But the options don't include all three. So which options have two such stars.

Looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5. Both of these can be detected by both.

Option D is Star1 and Star4. Star1 can, but Star4 can't.

Option A: Star4 and Star5. Star4 can't.

Option C: Star2 and Star3. Star2 can't.

So the correct answer would include Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait. Wait, Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5 at 5 pc. So m=15.0. So both can see.

Star3 has m_observed=15.5, which is within both.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait. Another thing: the location of the observatories. Oh wait, the question says to disregard the pointing limits and altitude, so I don't need to worry about whether the stars are observable from the locations (like declination). So I don't have to check if the stars are visible from Paranal or Keck.

So the only thing I need to check is whether their apparent magnitudes are within the limits.

So the correct stars are Star1,3,5. But the options don't match. So the options are A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options, the only option that includes two stars that can be detected by both is option B: Star3 and Star5. Because both have m <=16.

So the answer is option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering their distances, absolute magnitudes, and extinction (if applicable). The detection limits are as follows:

- **ESPRESSO**: Stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤ 17 mag can be observed.
- **HIRES**: Stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤ 16 mag can be observed.
