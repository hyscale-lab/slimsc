Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the area of a pseudosphere using the given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on differential geometry, but let's think this through.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric because it only has dx and dy terms. That makes me think it's describing a surface, probably in some higher-dimensional space because of the denominator. 

I remember that the area of a surface can be found using the metric tensor. Specifically, the area element dA is the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. So first, I need to write this metric in matrix form. The metric tensor g has components g_xx, g_yy, and the off-diagonal terms g_xy and g_yx. 

Looking at the given metric, it's diagonal because there are no cross terms like dxdy. So the matrix looks like this:
[ g_xx  0    ]
[ 0     g_yy ]

Where g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and same for g_yy since the coefficients of dx² and dy² are the same. So the determinant of g would be g_xx * g_yy - 0, which is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. 

Wait, but since it's diagonal, it's just the product of the diagonal elements. So determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². The square root of this determinant multiplied by dx dy gives the area element dA. 

So sqrt(det g) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). Therefore, dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. 

Now, to find the total area, I need to integrate this over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator 4 - x² - y² must not be zero, so 4 - x² - y² > 0. That means x² + y² < 4. So the region is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. 

So the area A is the double integral over x and y where x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. Hmm, integrating this might be tricky, but maybe I can switch to polar coordinates since the region is a circle. Let me try that.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so x² + y² = r². The Jacobian determinant for the change of variables is r. So dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator 4 - r². 

So the integral becomes:
A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ

Let me separate the integrals since the integrand doesn't depend on θ. So it's [∫0 to 2π dθ] multiplied by [∫0 to 2 (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr ].

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So now, the radial integral is 32 ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr. Let me compute this integral. 

Hmm, substitution perhaps. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r, so -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (-du/2) / u ] 

Wait, let's see. Let me rewrite the substitution. Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2. 

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (from r=0 to r=2) [r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [ (-du/2) / u ] 

Which is 32 * [ (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du ] 

Wait, flipping the limits, ∫ from 4 to 0 is the same as -∫ from 0 to4. So:

32 * [ (-1/2) * (-∫0^4 (1/u) du) ) ] = 32 * [ (1/2) ∫0^4 (1/u) du ]

The integral of 1/u is ln u, so:

= 32 * (1/2) [ ln u ] from 0 to4.

Wait, but ln u as u approaches 0 from the positive side goes to negative infinity. So [ln4 - ln0] = ln4 - (-infty) = +infty. So the integral diverges. 

Wait a minute, but that's the area. So the area is 32*(1/2) * (infinite) = infinite? So the area is infinite. 

Wait, but that's the area of the pseudosphere? Or is the question asking about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2? Hmm, pseudospheres are surfaces with constant negative curvature. I remember that the area of a pseudosphere is infinite because its curvature is negative, leading to infinite area when you try to tile it like a horn.

Wait, but in this problem, perhaps the metric is that of a pseudosphere, but the area might have an infinite value. So looking back at the options, option D is +infty. So the area is infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. The integral ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr. Let me compute it step by step.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So substituting:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 * ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [ (1/u) * (-du/2) ]

Change the limits, so the integral becomes:

32 * (1/2) ∫ (u=0 to4) (1/u) du 

Which is 16 ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

But ∫ (1/u) du is ln u, evaluated from 0 to4.

So ln4 - ln0. ln0 is -infinity, so the integral is ln4 - (-infty) = +infty.

So the area A = 2π * (16 * infty) → +infty. So the area is infinite. 

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the correct answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we compute the area element \(dA\) using the metric. The metric tensor \(g\) is diagonal, with components:

\[
g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}.
\]

The determinant of \(g\) is:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2,
\]

and the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The total area is obtained by integrating \(dA\) over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\) implies that \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), which corresponds to a circle of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The \(\theta\)-integral is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
32 \int_4^0 \frac{-1}{2u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du\) diverges because \(\ln u\) approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\). Thus, the area is infinite.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D) \(+\infty\)**.
