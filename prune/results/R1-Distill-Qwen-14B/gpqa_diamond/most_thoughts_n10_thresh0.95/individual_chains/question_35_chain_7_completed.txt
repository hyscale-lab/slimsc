Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can work through it step by step. 

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. They're giving me a matrix representation of A_y, denoted as Ay, which is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the question isn't directly asking for those; instead, it's asking which statement among the options is correct regarding the process of calculating them.

So, let me break this down. First, I should probably write out the matrix Ay explicitly. Since Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π), I can substitute that in. 

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So multiplying each element by c gives me Ay as:
Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Which is:
[ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:
Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So, the matrix elements are:
Ay[1,1] = 0,
Ay[1,2] = -i*(h/(4π)),
Ay[2,1] = i*(h/(4π)),
Ay[2,2] = 0.

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

The characteristic equation is:

| Ay - a I | = 0

Which becomes the determinant of:
[ -a    (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ (i h/(4π))   -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h/(4π))^2 ]

Wait, let me compute (-i) * (i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So, that term becomes 1 * (h^2)/(16π²). 

So the determinant equation is:

a² - (h²/(16π²)) = 0

Which simplifies to a² = h²/(16π²)
Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π) 

Wait, but wait—hold on. Because the determinant calculation: I think I might have made a mistake. Because the product is [(-i)(i)]*(h/(4π))^2. Let me compute that again.

(-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -( -1 ) = 1. So yes, the product is 1. So the determinant is a² - (h/(4π) )^2 =0. So a = ± (h/(4π)). 

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). These are real numbers. 

Wait, but wait another thing. The matrix S has the form of a Pauli matrix, I think. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches our S. So, given that, the eigenvalues of S should be ±1 because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Because for the Pauli matrices, their squares are identity matrices, so eigenvalues squared are 1, hence eigenvalues are ±1.

So for S, eigenvalues are ±1. Then, when we multiply by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues become c*(±1) = ±h/(4π). That's what I found earlier.

Wait, so the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π). So that's a real number. So the eigenvalues are real. So any option talking about eigenvalues with imaginary parts must be incorrect. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh or something. Wait, that can't be, because our eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect because it's talking about imaginary parts, but the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Also mentions imaginary parts, which is incorrect. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Hmm.

Well, the operator A is the angular momentum operator, which in quantum mechanics, for spin systems, the components commute with each other only in certain ways. The square of the angular momentum operator, A², commutes with each component. Because [A², Ax] = 0, [A², Ay] = 0, [A², Az] =0. So an eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So for option C, the first part is correct.

But the second part says they aren't eigenfunctions of Az. Well, that depends. In quantum mechanics, for spin systems, the different components (like Ax, Ay, Az) don't share eigenfunctions except in some specific cases. For example, if you have an eigenstate of Ay, it's not an eigenstate of Az (unless perhaps in a trivial case). So the statement in option C is correct.

Wait, but the option says "can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az". So C is correct. But I need to check the other options too.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given. Hmm. Well, the basis functions of a 2x2 matrix would be the standard basis vectors, like |0> and |1>, perhaps. But the eigenfunctions of Ay are the eigenvectors of Ay. So they form a basis for the space. So D's statement is correct as well. Because the eigenvectors are the basis functions for the operator. Wait, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, the question is about whether during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct. So let me think.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the basis functions for the operator are the standard basis vectors, but the eigenvectors themselves form a basis for the space. So for a 2x2 matrix, the two eigenvectors (assuming they're linearly independent) would form a basis. So D's statement is correct if the eigenvectors are indeed the basis functions. But I'm not sure. Wait, the matrix representation is given in the standard basis, so the basis functions are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvectors might form another basis, but that's orthogonal or some other basis. So perhaps D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should rethink. The matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so the eigenfunctions are vectors in a two-dimensional space. The standard basis is e1 and e2. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) would form a basis if they're linearly independent. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it has two eigenvalues (each with their eigenvectors), so they form a basis. So in that sense, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the matrix. So D would be correct.

Wait, but how is the operator represented? The matrix is given in the standard basis. So the eigenvectors are expressed in the same basis. So the eigenvectors are the basis functions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the question is about whether the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So I think D is correct.

So now, looking back at the options. The correct statements are either C or D, and perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, but let's re-examine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So that part is correct. As for Az, the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az (since the components don't commute). So option C is correct.

But wait, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not necessarily eigenfunctions of A². Wait, no. Because A² is a Casimir operator, which commutes with any component, so an eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So the statement in C is correct.

So both C and D could be correct, but let me read the options again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. So the basis functions are the standard basis vectors, but the eigenvectors may not necessarily align with them. So perhaps the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the operator. Therefore, D is incorrect.

Wait, the problem says "the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the matrix operator is represented in a certain basis. The basis functions are the standard basis vectors (e1, e2). The eigenvectors are functions in that same basis. So if the eigenvectors form a basis, then perhaps they are the basis functions. But wait, the standard basis is the one in which the matrix is represented. So the operator's matrix is given in the standard basis. So the eigenfunctions are expressed in that basis; they're just vectors in the same space. So the statement D is saying that the eigenvectors are the basis functions of the operator. That would be correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space the operator acts on.

Wait, perhaps. Because for a 2x2 matrix, the two eigenvectors (if distinct) would form a basis. So the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions for the operator's matrix. So D is correct.

But now I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, the eigenvalues are real and are ±h/(4π). So options A and B can be eliminated because they talk about imaginary parts. So the correct options are either C or D.

Let me look at the options again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, yes, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So that's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is represented in a certain basis, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form another basis. So yes, they are the basis functions for the operator, which is 2x2. So D would be correct.

Wait, but in reality, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the vector space, but not necessarily the standard basis in which the operator is represented. So, for example, if the operator is represented in the standard basis, the eigenvectors might not be aligned with the standard basis vectors. So, in that case, the basis functions of the operator are the standard basis vectors, not the eigenvectors. So D's statement would be incorrect.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about D. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space, meaning that any vector can be expressed as a combination of these eigenvectors. So in that sense, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are a basis, but not necessarily the standard one.

So, if the question is whether during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the options again. The question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the basis functions are the standard basis vectors. The eigenfunctions are vectors that are eigenvectors of Ay, which are probably not the standard basis vectors, unless the operator is diagonal. Since S is not diagonal, the eigenvectors are not the standard basis vectors. So, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the same as the basis functions (standard basis vectors) of the operator. So D's statement is incorrect.

So, that leaves option C as the correct statement.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to summarize:

Eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π), which are real. So options A and B are wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, yes, any eigenfunction of Ay is eigenfunction of A². As for Az, since [Ay, Az] = iħ (I think), so they don't commute, so the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: Eigenfunctions are basis functions of the operator. So the operator is 2x2, so its basis is e1 and e2. The eigenvectors of Ay are different vectors, unless they are aligned with the standard basis. In this case, since the operator isn't diagonal in the standard basis, the eigenvectors are not the standard basis vectors. So the eigenvectors are not the basis functions of the operator, so D is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct option is C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the first row \((0, -i)\) and the second row \((i, 0)\). The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are calculated by solving the characteristic equation \(\det(A_y - aI) = 0\). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( S \) are found to be \(\pm 1\), and thus the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \(\pm \frac{h}{4\pi}\), which are real.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: This option states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \(\pm 2\pi h\) and the real parts are \(\pm \frac{h}{4\pi}\). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\(\pm \frac{h}{4\pi}\)), and there are no imaginary components.

2. **Option B**: This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \(\pm \frac{1}{2}\) and the real parts are \(\pm 1\). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \(\pm \frac{h}{4\pi}\), which are real and do not match the values stated in this option.

3. **Option C**: This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

4. **Option D**: This option claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the eigenvectors of the operator, which form a basis for the vector space. However, the basis functions of the operator are the standard basis vectors (e.g., \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\)), which are not the same as the eigenvectors unless the operator is diagonal in the standard basis. Since \( A_y \) is not diagonal in the standard basis, this statement is false.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and the operators \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
