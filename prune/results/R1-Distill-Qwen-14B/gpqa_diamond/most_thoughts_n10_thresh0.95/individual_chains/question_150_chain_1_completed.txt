--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. The question is about identifying the final product from the given options.

First, I'll try to figure out what the original compound looks like based on the NMR data. Let's list the NMR signals:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let me think about each signal.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating to 1H. That seems like an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm and are deshielded. But in this case, it's a triplet. Another possibility is an acidic proton, maybe from a phenol, but that's typically broader. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde, but how does that fit with the triplet? Or perhaps it's a ketone? No, ketones don't have protons. Maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde? Or maybe it's an amide? No, that's probably higher.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl group. The triplet might be because it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton. Wait, no, vinyl protons are usually in the 5-7 ppm range. So maybe it's an aldehyde. Let's tentatively say it's an aldehyde proton.

Next, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm signals are doublets each integrating to 2H. This looks like a para-substituted aromatic system. For example, two sets of protons in a di-substituted benzene ring. Let me think: if it's a para-substituted benzene, each pair of protons would be equivalent and split into a doublet. Wait, but in para substitution, you usually get a singlet for the protons because they are all equivalent, unless there's another substituent causing splitting. Hmm, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions, but the coupling comes from another source. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pair of protons from an ortho substitution on another benzene ring. Wait, maybe the compound has two aromatic rings attached.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad usually suggests exchange or possibly being part of a conjugated system. Maybe these are protons adjacent to an oxygen, like an enol or something. Alternatively, they could be protons on a benzene ring adjacent to an -OH group, but that might be a stretch.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet of 2H. That's probably a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe it's part of an ether or an ester, but more likely an OCH2 group. Alternatively, it could be adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, in a structure like R-O-CH2-CHO. Or maybe it's part of a benzalacetone structure.

Putting this all together, let's imagine the structure. The peak at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde group. The two aromatic regions (6.98 and 6.51) could be two para-substituted phenyl groups attached somewhere. The 6.27 ppm could be protons on a conjugated double bond, perhaps between the aldehyde and another group. The 3.66 ppm is a CH2 group attached to oxygen, maybe between two aromatic rings or part of a chain.

Wait, another approach: maybe the compound is a diaryl aldehyde. But then, how to account for the NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like cinnamaldehyde, but with substituents. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So: (2*8 + 2 - 9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -10)/2= 8/2=4 degrees. That means 4 rings or double bonds. So perhaps one ring (from benzene) and the rest from other double bonds.

Wait, benzene is a ring with three double bonds, so that's 4 degrees right there. Then, maybe another double bond in the structure, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe a benzene and a conjugated system.

Wait, but perhaps the compound has two benzene rings and an aldehyde group. Let me think: a diaryl aldehyde. The molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's see: two benzene rings would account for C12H10, which is more than our compound. So that's not possible. Hmm, so maybe it's a single benzene ring.

Wait, another thought. Let's think about the NMR. The triplet at 9.72 ppm suggests coupling with two protons. That could be an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group. So maybe the structure is something like RCH2CHO.

Wait, but if the aldehyde is at the end, the H would only couple with the adjacent CH2, which has two protons. So the aldehyde proton would be a triplet. That fits the 9.72 ppm signal. So perhaps R is a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, the structure could be something like Ph-CH2-CHO. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count. Ph is C6H5, so CH2CHO is C3H4O. So total would be C9H9O. But our formula is C8H9NO. So there's an N and an O. Wait, that doesn't add up. So perhaps the structure has an amino group or something else.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count again. Two benzene rings would be 12 C, but that's too much. So maybe one benzene ring and some other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Let's think: maybe a benzaldehyde with an additional substituent that includes an N and another O.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzyl group attached to a nitro group or something. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows 6.98 and 6.51, each 2H as doublets. This could be a 1,4-disubstituted benzene (para-substituted). Let's imagine the benzene has two substituents at para positions. Perhaps one is an -OCH2CHO group and another substituent.

Wait, let me try to sketch this. Let's say the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an -O-CH2-CHO group, and the other is a hydroxyl group (since the options have some with hydroxyphenyl groups). Wait, but the O is already in the formula as part of the nitro? No, wait, the formula has N and O. So maybe thereâ€™s an -NH-O- group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a di-phenyl compound with an aldehyde and some other substituents. But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the reactions.

The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat

These are common conditions for diazotization followed by hydrolysis. So the first step is usually the formation of a diazonium salt, then in water (acidic conditions?), and then with KOH and heat, which is a typical condition for the Sandmeyer reaction or hydrolysis of diazonium salts to form phenols or other products.

Wait, but the initial compound has an N in the formula. So perhaps it's an aniline derivative. The reaction sequence is diazotization, followed by hydrolysis. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions, like hydrolysis to phenols or coupling reactions. But since the second step is just water, and then KOH and heat, it might be a hydrolysis to a phenol.

Wait, let me think: if the original compound has an -NH2 group, after diazotization, it forms a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis (with water and maybe acid), would form a phenol. But wait, the first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which is acidic. Then, the second step is water, perhaps under acidic conditions. Then, the third step is KOH (a strong base) and heat, which could be another hydrolysis step or perhaps a different reaction.

But I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. Let me first try to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

Another approach: Let's look at the options given. The options are all aldehydes with substituents. So the final product is an aldehyde.

Wait, the first reaction is with NaNO2 and HCl, which suggests that the starting compound might have an amine group. Because diazotization is typically done on aromatic amines (like aniline derivatives). So the original compound has an -NH2 group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If it's an aniline derivative, the structure would be something like Ph-NH-R, where R is some group.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks indicative of NH protons because they're broad or not present. Alternatively, if the -NH2 is in a para position, maybe it's a substituted aniline.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an acetanilide derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the starting NMR has a triplet at 9.72 ppm. If that's an aldehyde, and the compound has an -NH2 group, perhaps the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but that's only 8 carbons if Ph is a benzene ring (6 carbons) plus CH2CHO (3 carbons, but 6+3=9, which doesn't fit C8). Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with an amino group attached elsewhere.

Alternatively, let's think that the starting compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde. The structure would be Ph-CHO with an NH2 group para to the CHO. But the NMR would have peaks for the aromatic protons. Let's see: the aromatic protons in para-substituted benzaldehyde would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That fits the 6.98 and 6.51 signals. Wait, in para-substituted benzaldehyde, the protons adjacent to the substituents would be deshielded. For example, if the substituents are CHO and NH2 in para positions, then the aromatic protons would be at around 6.9-7 ppm as doublets.

Wait, but the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm signals could be the two sets of aromatic protons adjacent to the substituents. So perhaps the starting compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde. But then, let's check the molecular formula: C7H7NO. Wait, that's not matching the given C8H9NO. Hmm, so maybe it's a more complex structure.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the starting compound is a diaryl aldehyde, but with an amino group elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzyl group attached to a nitro group or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting compound is something like 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. But then the NMR would have a peak around 5 ppm for the -OH, but it's not appearing in the data provided. Wait, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Could that be the protons adjacent to an -OH group? Like in a dihydroxybenzene structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Let me think: the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like Ph-CH2-CHO, which is benzyl aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: The NMR shows a triplet at 9.72 ppm, which I think is an aldehyde. Then, the 3.66 ppm doublet is a CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. So maybe the structure is R-CH2-CHO. The R group would then be attached to the CH2.

Looking at the other signals: the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets of 2H each. Maybe the R group is a benzene ring with substituents. So R could be a substituted phenyl group. The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H, which could be another CH2 group or some protons adjacent to an oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like Ph-O-CH2-CHO. But that would make the OCH2CHO group. Let me count the carbons: Ph (6C) + O + CH2CHO (3C) = 9C, but the formula is C8. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propenyl group. The 6.27 ppm could be a double bond. So maybe the structure has a double bond between the aromatic group and the aldehyde.

Wait, for example, Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. But the NMR doesn't show peaks for a CH2-CH2 group. Alternatively, perhaps there's a double bond between the benzene and the aldehyde. So something like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO would have protons on the CH2-CH2, but maybe that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a styryl group, like Ph-CH=CH-CHO. But that would require more protons in the NMR around 6-7 ppm for the double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(3-oxobutenyl)phenol. Let me think. So that would be a phenol group with a substituent that's a butenyl with a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diaryl ketone, but that doesn't fit the aldehyde proton.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the options given and see what the starting material might be.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal
B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal
C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal
D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal

These are all aldehydes with aromatic substituents. Let me think about the reactions.

The reaction steps are: diazotization (NaNO2, HCl), followed by H2O, then KOH and heat.

So, step 1: diazotization of an aromatic amine to form a diazonium salt.

Step 2: hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. Under acidic conditions, this typically forms a phenol. For example, if we have an aryl diazonium chloride and treat it with water, especially with heat, it might undergo hydrolysis to form a phenol.

Wait, but the second step is just water. Then the third step is aqueous KOH and heat, so perhaps that's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe the diazonium salt is treated with water in the presence of base. Diazonium salts can also undergo other reactions, like the Gattermann-Koch reaction, but that's for formylation. Alternatively, the Hofmann degradation, but that's for amines.

Wait, perhaps after diazotization, the diazonium salt is treated with water and then KOH and heat to form a hydroxyl group. Let's think: if the starting compound has an -NH2 group, then after diazotization and hydrolysis, it would replace the -NH2 with -OH.

So, perhaps the starting compound has an -NH2 group attached to a benzene ring, which upon reaction becomes a -OH group.

But I'm getting stuck on the initial structure. Let me think again. The NMR data for the starting compound:

- 9.72 ppm triplet (1H): likely an aldehyde.
- 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H): para-substituted aromatic protons.
- 6.27 (bs, 2H): maybe another aromatic group or conjugated protons.
- 3.66 (d, 2H): OCH2 group.

Hmm. Maybe the starting compound is 4-hydroxy-3-butenal benzaldehyde or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where the aldehyde is attached to a benzene ring via a chain, and another substituent is present.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)benzaldehyde. Let me draw this structure. That would be Ph-CH2-C(=O)-CHO. No, that's not right. Alternatively, Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that doesn't include the N.

Wait, the molecular formula includes an N, so the starting compound must have an N. Earlier I thought it's an aromatic amine, but let me confirm.

If the starting compound has an -NH2 group, then after diazotization and hydrolysis, it would become a phenol group.

So the initial structure would have an -NH2 group attached to the benzene ring. Let me think about the NMR again.

If the starting compound is, say, 4-aminobenzaldehyde, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H. The aldehyde proton would be around 9.72 ppm, possibly as a triplet if adjacent to a CH2 group. But wait, 4-aminobenzaldehyde doesn't have a CH2 group between the NH2 and the aldehyde. So the triplet in the NMR might not come from that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like benzaldehyde with an NH2 group attached elsewhere, but that doesn't explain the CH2 group.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 9.72 ppm could be an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group, which itself is attached to another group. Let me imagine a structure like R-CH2-CHO, where R is a benzene ring with substituents.

So if R is a benzene ring with an -NH2 group, then upon diazotization and hydrolysis, the -NH2 would become -OH.

But wait, how does that fit with the NMR?

Let me try to imagine the structure as Ph-CH2-CHO, where Ph is a benzene ring with substituents. But the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count:

Ph (6 C) + CH2 (2 C) + CHO (1 C) = 9 C. But the formula is C8. So that's one too many. Hmm, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. That would be 6 + 2 + 1 =9 C, but formula is C8. So that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe the benzene ring has a substituent that includes the N. So perhaps the structure is Ph-NH-CH2-CHO. But that would be 6 +1 + 2 +1 =10 C. Not matching.

Another angle: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible functional groups. An aldehyde (CHO), an amine (NH2), and an oxygen in the structure. Alternatively, perhaps an ether or an ester.

Wait, another possibility: the starting compound is a beta-amino aldehyde. Structure would be R-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like 4-aminophenyl acetaldehyde. That would be Ph-CH2-CHO with NH2 on the benzene. But let me count: Ph (6C) + CH2 (2C) + CHO (1C) = 9C. But the formula is C8, so that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is a substituted cinnamaldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO, but with a double bond. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH=CH-CHO. So that's 3 double bonds: benzene and the alkenyl group. The molecular formula would be C9H8O. But the given formula is C8H9NO, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a nitro group instead of an amino group. But then the reaction with NaNO2 and HCl wouldn't apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a nitrile, but that's unlikely given the reaction steps.

Wait, maybe the starting compound is an anilide, like Ph-NH-CO-R. But I'm not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should look at the reaction sequence more carefully.

Step 1: NaNO2 and HCl â†’ forms a diazonium salt if it's an aromatic amine.

Step 2: H2O â†’ hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. So, the -NH2 group would be replaced by -OH.

But then, the third step is aq. KOH and heat. What reaction occurs here? Diazonium salts can also undergo other reactions. For example, with KOH, perhaps it's a hydrolysis to a phenol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the third step is a different reaction, like a coupling reaction or elimination.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound has an -NH2 group attached to a benzene ring. After diazotization, it becomes a diazonium salt. Then, hydrolysis in step 2 (with H2O) replaces the diazonium group with -OH, forming a phenol. But then step 3 is KOH and heat. What could that do? Maybe it's a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's usually under different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the third step is an elimination reaction. Wait, but the starting material after step 2 is a phenol. How does KOH and heat affect that?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure has another functional group, like a ketone or ester, that would react under the given conditions.

Wait, another thought: maybe the initial compound is a benzylamine derivative. For example, benzylamine with an aldehyde group elsewhere. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound has an amino group and an aldehyde group in conjugation. Let me think: maybe it's something like Ph-CH(NH2)-CHO. But that would require specific splitting in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2 with an aldehyde group attached elsewhere. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group in the NMR is part of an ethyl group between two aromatic rings. For example, diphenylethane with an aldehyde group.

Wait, diphenylethane would have the structure Ph-CH2-CH2-Ph. But that doesn't fit the aldehyde. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzalacetophenone or similar, but again, not matching the formula.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Structure would be: 

Ph-OH attached to the but-3-enal.

The structure would be CH2=CH-CH(OH)-Ph-CHO?

Wait, no. The but-3-enal is CH2CH2CH=CHCHO? Wait, not exactly. Let me think: but-3-enal is CH2CH2CH=CHO. Wait, but that's not possible. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CHO, but with a phenyl group attached.

Alternatively, it's:

Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO

But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the product after reaction steps is an aldehyde. So the starting material must have an amino group which is replaced by a hydroxyl group.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 4-(4-aminophenyl)but-3-enal. Structure: Ph-NH2 attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2 group, then a double bond, then CHO.

But let me think about the NMR.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm would be the aldehyde proton, which is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, in the structure, the aldehyde is at the end, connected via a CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2 group, then a double bond, and then a benzene ring.

Wait, that may not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with an NH2 group somewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. That way, the aldehyde is at the end, the NH2 is on the CH, and the CH2 groups are in between. But let me think about the NMR.

The aldehyde proton would be a triplet because it's next to a CH group (but that's only one CH, so the coupling would be with one proton, making a doublet, not a triplet). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is 4-(4-aminophenyl)but-3-enal. Structure would be Ph-NH2 connected via CH2-CH2-CHO. But then, the aldehyde is at the end. The CH2 groups would have protons, but the NMR doesn't show peaks in the 3-4 ppm region except for the 3.66 ppm doublet of 2H.

Wait, maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO, with an NH2 group attached elsewhere. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has an ethyl group between the benzene and the aldehyde. So, Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. But then, the aldehyde would be a triplet if adjacent to a CH2 group. Let me think: the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 which has two protons. So the aldehyde H would be a triplet, which matches the 9.72 ppm signal.

Then, the CH2 groups: the CH2 next to the aldehyde would split into a quartet, and the next CH2 would be a triplet. But in the NMR data, the only CH2 is at 3.66 ppm as a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the structure has a double bond, so Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO becomes Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with a double bond between the CH2 groups. So Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO would have a CH2-CH2 group. But with a double bond, it becomes Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO â†’ no, that's not right. Alternatively, Ph-CH=CH-CHO, which is cinnamaldehyde. But then, the molecular formula would be C9H8O, which doesn't match the given formula.

Wait, another thought: the starting material has an amino group, which upon treatment with NaNO2 and HCl becomes a diazonium salt. Then, treatment with H2O would replace the amino group with a hydroxyl group. Then, treatment with KOH and heatâ€”what's that for?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenyl acetaldehyde. Structure: Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. But that's not correct; the correct structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-OH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde. Structure: Ph-CHO with NH2 in para position. Then, the NMR would show aromatic protons as two doublets (6.98 and 6.51 ppm), the aldehyde as a triplet if adjacent to a CH2 group. But in 4-aminobenzaldehyde, the NH2 is directly attached to the benzene, and the aldehyde is also directly attached. So the aldehyde would be a singlet around 9.8 ppm, but in the NMR data, it's a triplet. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is not directly attached to the benzene but via a CH2 group. So, Ph-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 group would have protons that are split by the aldehyde's proton. The aldehyde would be a triplet because it's adjacent to two protons on the CH2.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- Aldehyde H: triplet at ~9.72 ppm.
- CH2 protons: quartet around 3.66 ppm (split by the aldehyde H and possibly by adjacent groups).
- Aromatic protons: two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 ppm.

And what about the peak at 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet of 2H? That's puzzling.

Wait, perhaps there's another substituent on the benzene ring. For example, a hydroxyl group. So the structure would be 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with a CH2-CHO group attached. But that would make the molecular formula C8H8O2, which doesn't match C8H9NO. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenyl propenal. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with NH2 group. But again, the formula might not match.

Wait, let me try to count again. For the starting material, C8H9NO.

If it's Ph-CH2-CHO, with Ph being C6H5, that would be C8H8O. But the formula is C8H9NO, which has one more N and one more H. So perhaps there's an NH2 group somewhere. So Ph-CH2-CHO with NH2 as a substituent.

So, Ph-CH2-CHO with an NH2 on the benzene in the para position. That would make the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's see: benzene (6 C) + CH2 (1 C) + CHO (1 C) + NH2 (1 N) â†’ C8H9NO. Yes, that fits.

So, the structure would be 4-aminophenyl acetaldehyde, but wait, that's not correct. The correct structure would be benzaldehyde with a CH2 group and an NH2 on the para position.

Wait, structure: Ph-CH2-CHO, where Ph is 4-aminophenyl. So, the benzene ring has an NH2 group in the para position relative to the CH2-CHO group.

Then, the NMR would show:

- Aldehyde proton at 9.72 ppm as a triplet because it's adjacent to the CH2 group (two H).
- The CH2 group's protons would be a quartet around 3.66 ppm, but in the NMR it's a doublet. Hmm, perhaps in this structure, the CH2 is split by the aldehyde, which is a triplet, but maybe the coupling is such that it's a doublet. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to another group causing a doublet.

Wait, no, the CH2 next to aldehyde would have protons that are split by the aldehyde's H. So each H on the CH2 would couple with the aldehyde's 1H, making them a quartet. But in the NMR data, the CH2 is a doublet. So perhaps this structure isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is not adjacent to the aldehyde but to another group. For example, the structure could be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, with NH2 on the benzene. Then, the aldehyde is at the end, the CH2 next to aldehyde would be a triplet, and the CH2 next to that would be a quartet.

But the NMR shows only one CH2 peak at 3.66 ppm as a doublet. So perhaps it's a single CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde, which would make the aldehyde a triplet and the CH2 a quartet.

But the NMR has the CH2 as a doublet. So perhaps this isn't the right structure.

Another approach: think about the reaction steps.

The starting material has an -NH2 group. After diazotization (step 1), it becomes a diazonium salt. Step 2 is H2O, which would hydrolyze the diazonium salt to a phenol (-OH group). Then step 3 is KOH and heat. What does that do? Perhaps it's a hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amide, but I don't see a nitrile here.

Wait, perhaps the third step is a dehydration reaction. If the starting material has a hydroxyl group (from step 2) and a carbonyl group, perhaps it undergoes dehydration to form an aldehyde or ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the initial compound has an amino group and a Î²-keto group. Upon diazotization and hydrolysis, the amino becomes a hydroxyl, and then under basic conditions, it could undergo elimination to form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is a Î²-amino aldehyde, which upon treatment forms a double bond.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to re-examine the options.

Looking at option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Structure would be: CH2=CHCH2-CHO attached to a 4-hydroxyphenyl group. So, the structure would be Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO.

Wait, not exactly. Let me write it correctly. It's but-3-enal, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CHO, but with a phenyl group attached to the first carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO.

But in any case, the product after reaction steps would have a hydroxyl group where the amino group was.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenyl but-3-enal. Structure: Ph-NH2-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is something like Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. Then, after diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 becomes OH, giving Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, perhaps the -CHOH-CHO undergoes elimination to form a double bond, leading to an Î±,Î²-unsaturated aldehyde.

That would fit with option D, which is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Wait, let me outline this:

Starting structure: Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO.

Reaction steps:
1. Diazotization â†’ Ph-CH2-CH(NH+ diazonium)-CHO.
2. Hydrolysis â†’ Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CHO.
3. KOH and heat â†’ elimination to form double bond, resulting in Ph-CH2-CH=CHO.

But wait, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO, which is but-3-enal.

Wait, but in this case, the phenyl group would be para to the substituent. So the final product would be 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal, which matches option D.

That makes sense. Let me think about the NMR of the starting material.

The starting material would have:

- Aldehyde proton as triplet (adjacent to CH2)
- Aromatic protons as two doublets (from para-substituted benzene)
- The CH2 group next to the aldehyde as a quartet, but maybe in the starting material, it's a doublet due to coupling with another CH group. Or perhaps in the starting material, the CH is split by the NH2 group.

Wait, but the starting material's NMR shows:

- 9.72 (t, 1H): aldehyde proton.
- 6.98 and 6.51 (each d, 2H): para-substituted benzene.
- 6.27 (bs, 2H): perhaps the CH group with NH2.
- 3.66 (d, 2H): the CH2 adjacent to the aldehyde.

So, in the starting material, the CH2 adjacent to aldehyde is a doublet, which would be if it's split by a neighboring group. If the CH2 is next to a CH group (which is attached to NH2), then the CH2 would be a triplet, but in the NMR it's a doublet. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to another CH2, making it a quartet, but the NMR shows it as a doublet. So maybe the structure is different.

But given the reaction steps and the options, option D seems plausible. The starting material is 4-aminophenyl but-3-enal, which upon hydrolysis of the amino group becomes 4-hydroxyphenyl but-3-enal.

Wait, but in that case, the initial compound would have an amino group on the benzene and a but-3-enal group. After hydrolysis, the amino becomes hydroxy, and the structure remains as but-3-enal.

So the final product would be 4-hydroxyphenyl but-3-enal, which is option D.


The compound has the molecular formula **C8H9NO** and the provided 1H-NMR data. The reaction sequence involves three steps: diazotization with NaNO2 and HCl, hydrolysis with H2O, and treatment with aqueous KOH and heat. The goal is to identify the final product from the given options.

### Analysis of the Starting Compound
The NMR data provides the following key information:
- **9.72 ppm (t, 1H)**: Likely an aldehyde proton, which is a triplet due to coupling with two protons on an adjacent CH2 group.
- **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring.
- **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, possibly from a CH group adjacent to an -NH2 group.
- **3.66 ppm (d, 2H)**: A doublet integrating to 2H, likely from a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen or nitrogen).

The molecular formula **C8H9NO** suggests the presence of an aromatic ring, an aldehyde group, and an amino group (-NH2). Based on the NMR data and the reaction sequence, the starting compound is likely **4-aminophenyl but-3-enal**. This structure consists of a para-aminophenyl group attached to a but-3-enal chain.

### Reaction Sequence
1. **Diazotization (NaNO2 + HCl)**: The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt.
2. **Hydrolysis (H2O)**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to replace the -NH2 group with a -OH group, forming **4-hydroxyphenyl but-3-enal**.
3. **Treatment with KOH and Heat**: This step likely facilitates the elimination of water, forming a double bond in the aldehyde chain, resulting in the final product **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal**.

### Final Product
The final product, **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal**, matches the description in **Option D**. This structure includes a para-hydroxyphenyl group and an Î±,Î²-unsaturated aldehyde, consistent with the reaction sequence and the molecular formula.
