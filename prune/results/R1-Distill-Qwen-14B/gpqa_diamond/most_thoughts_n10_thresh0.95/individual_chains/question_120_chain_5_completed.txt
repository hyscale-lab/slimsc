Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's see. The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh right, uniform distribution implies that the number density of stars is the same throughout space, right? So, there's no clustering or anything; it's spread out evenly.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. So, a larger parallax means the star is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

Wait, the formula for distance in terms of parallax is distance d = 1 / plx, where plx is in parsecs. So d is inversely proportional to plx. Got it.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Let's think about how many stars you'd expect to find in a small range of parallax values. So, if I consider a small change in plx, say dplx, how many stars are there in that interval?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (stars per cubic parsec) is constant. Let's denote this number density as n. So, in any volume, the number of stars would be n multiplied by that volume.

But wait, considering parallax, I need to relate this to the volume. Parallax is related to distance, so let's think in terms of spheres. For a given parallax plx, the distance d is 1/plx. So, to find the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume would be the surface area of the sphere times the thickness. The surface area is 4πd², so the volume is 4πd² dd.

But wait, since d = 1/plx, let's substitute that in. So, d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx instead of d.

So, the volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. But I want to express this in terms of plx. Let's see, since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1)/(plx²) dplx. Wait, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, maybe I can ignore the sign for now.

So substituting d = 1/plx and dd = - (1)/(plx²) dplx into the volume:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/(plx²)) dplx )

Wait, that would be 4π (1/plx²) * ( -1/plx² ) dplx ) → 4π (-1)/(plx^4) dplx. But that seems a bit off. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the number of stars in a given range of parallax (dplx) depends on that range and the distribution. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume element dV is n dV.

But dV in terms of distance (d) is the volume of a spherical shell: 4πd² dr, where dr is the thickness. But we want to express this in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² dplx )

Wait, that gives 4π (1/plx^4) (-dplx). Hmm, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But when considering counts, we can perhaps take the absolute value, so dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in the volume element dV is n dV. So, N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, per unit plx, like dplx = 1 parsec in plx. So, the number per unit plx would be proportional to 1/plx^4 times dV, but as dV is (1/plx^4) dplx, and for dplx = 1, it's 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a second, number per unit plx is (n * 4π) / plx^4. So the number decreases as 1/plx^4. But the options don't have 1/plx^4 as D is 1/plx^3. Wait, what's going on here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try again.

Wait, let's think in terms of volume as a function of distance. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4πd² dr * n, where n is the number density.

But since d = 1/plx, then plx = 1/d. So, plx increases as d decreases. Let's express the number of stars in terms of plx. Let me compute the number of stars as a function of plx.

So, number of stars in a thin shell is N = 4π d² dr * n.

But dr can be expressed in terms of dplx. Since plx = 1/d, then dplx = - (1/d²) dr → dr = - d² dplx.

Substituting into N:

N = 4π d² * (- d² dplx) * n

Which is 4π n (-d^4 dplx )

But d = 1/plx → d^4 = (1/plx)^4 = 1/plx^4.

So N = 4π n (1/plx^4) (-dplx )

But since the number can't be negative, we take the absolute value, so N = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx = 1) is proportional to 1/plx^4. Therefore, the number decreases as plx increases, and the dependence is 1/plx^4. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. Option D is 1/plx^3. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but wait a moment. I think I might have confused the variables. Let me think again. Another approach: The number density of stars is uniform, n stars per cubic parsec. The volume of a sphere with radius d is (4/3) π d^3. So the number of stars within distance d is N = n (4/3 π d^3).

But we want the number of stars between d and d + dd. So, that's approximately n * 4 π d^2 dd.

But since d = 1/plx, then dd = (dplx) * (d^2) [Wait, no. Because if d = 1/plx, then dd = (dplx) * (d^2). Because d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d. So plx = d^-1 → dplx = - d^-2 dd → dd = - d^2 dplx. So, substituting into the number:

N = n * 4 π d^2 * (-d^2 dplx) ) → n * 4 π (-d^4 dplx )

Again, d = 1/plx → d^4 = 1/plx^4.

So N = n * 4 π (-1/plx^4) dplx → since dplx is positive, the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Thus, the number of stars per unit parallax (dplx=1) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that's the answer.

But wait, the question asks how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So, if plx increases, the number per unit plx decreases as 1/plx^4.

So the answer should be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars, \( n \), is constant. The parallax of a star is inversely related to its distance: \( d = 1/\text{plx} \).

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = 1/\text{plx} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the volume gives:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is \( N = n \, dV \), so:

\[
N = n \left(-\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Taking the absolute value (since the number of stars cannot be negative), the number of stars per unit range of parallax (e.g., \( d\text{plx} = 1 \)) is proportional to \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \). As parallax increases, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
