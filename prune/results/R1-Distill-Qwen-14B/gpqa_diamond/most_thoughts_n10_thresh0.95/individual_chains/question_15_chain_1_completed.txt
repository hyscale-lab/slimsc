Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transits. Hmm, let me try to think through it. So the researchers have two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they want the best chance of detecting it with their limited time.

From what I remember, the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Oh wait, wait, the probability is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis) to the star's radius, divided by something else? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability formula is: P ≈ (R_star / a) * something else. Or wait, more accurately, the probability of a transit is given by (R_star / a) * (something else, maybe the inclination or so). Wait, I think the formula is P = (R*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1-e²))) ), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that term goes away. So the probability is just P = (R*/a), but that can't be right because the actual formula I recall is (R* + R_p)^2 / (a^2), but wait no. Let me get this right.

Oh, right! The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk that the planet can cover. So the probability depends on the ratio of (R*/a), because if the planet's orbital distance is much larger than the star, the chance it passes in front is smaller. So P = (R*/a) * (something else? No, I think it's P = (R*/a) * (some function of angles) but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital radius, multiplied by something else. Oh wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is P ≈ (R*/a) * (1/(1-e²)^0.5). Since both have circular orbits, e is zero, so that term is 1. So P is approximately R*/a.

Wait, no, that can't be right because R* is much smaller than a for most planets. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, intersects with the line of sight to the star. So it's a geometric probability which depends on the size of the star compared to the size of the orbit.

Wait, the probability is given by (R* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R*, we can approximate it as R* / a. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is (R*/a)^2 * (something), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is higher when a is smaller, because the planet is more likely to pass in front. So if a planet is closer to its star, it's more likely to transit. But in this problem, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star. So Planet_1 has a smaller a, which would imply a higher probability.

But wait, the host stars also matter. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but same radius. So R* is same for both, right? Because both host stars have the same radii.

So let me list the given data:

- Both planets have the same mass. (But mass doesn't affect transit probability directly, since it's more about the orbital distance and star size.)

- Planet_1's orbital period (P1) is 3 times shorter than Planet_2's (P2). So P1 = P2 /3.

- Host stars: Star1 (Planet_1) has mass M1 = 2 * M2 (M2 is the mass of Star2's host). But R1 = R2, because both stars have same radii.

We need to find the transit probability for each planet. P_transit is proportional to (R* / a). So let's compute (R*/a) for each.

But since a is the semi-major axis, and using Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) a³. Since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, we can ignore m in M + m. So a^3 = (G M P²)/(4 π²). Taking cube roots, a = [(G M P²)/(4 π²)]^(1/3).

So a is proportional to P^(2/3) * (M)^(1/3). Because G, π are constants.

So a1 = (M1)^(1/3) * (P1)^(2/3)

a2 = (M2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3)

Given that M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 /3.

So a1 / a2 = [ (2 M2)^(1/3) * (P2/3)^(2/3) ] / [ (M2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3) ) ]

Simplify numerator: (2)^(1/3) * (M2)^(1/3) * (P2)^{2/3} * (1/3)^{2/3} ) / denominator.

Denominator is (M2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3).

So a1/a2 = (2^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) ) / 1.

Because (2^(1/3)) = cube root of 2 ≈ 1.26, and (1/3)^(2/3) is 3^(-2/3) ≈ 0.48. So 1.26 * 0.48 ≈ 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Wait, so a1 is smaller than a2. Planet_1 is closer to its star.

Now, transit probability is proportional to R* / a. But R* is same for both (since both stars have same radius). So P1_transit / P2_transit = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2/a1 = 1/(a1/a2) ≈ 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability than Planet_2 by a factor of ~1.65.

Wait, so the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2. So the researchers should observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to 1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times higher. So the correct choice would be C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) corresponds to a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M \) is the mass of the host star, we can express \( a \) as:

\[
a \propto P^{2/3} M^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) and a host star mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \).
- Planet_2 has an orbital period \( P_2 \) and a host star mass \( M_2 \).

The ratio of their semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{(2M_2)^{1/3} \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^{2/3}}{(M_2)^{1/3} P_2^{2/3}} = \frac{2^{1/3}}{3^{2/3}}.
\]

Numerically:
- \( 2^{1/3} \approx 1.26 \),
- \( 3^{2/3} \approx 2.08 \),
- So, \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx \frac{1.26}{2.08} \approx 0.606 \).

This means \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \), so Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_{\text{transit,1}}}{P_{\text{transit,2}}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Based on this, the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.
