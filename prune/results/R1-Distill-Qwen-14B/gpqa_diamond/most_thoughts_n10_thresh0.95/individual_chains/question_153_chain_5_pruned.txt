Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember is a 1,4-conjugate addition between a nucleophile and an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The question has three separate reactions, and I need to determine the major products for each, then match them with the given options.

Let's start by breaking down each part of the question.

The first reaction is between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I think this is a Michael addition because dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, acting as the enolate donor. The other compound is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is the acceptor.

So, the structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. It's a diester, and when deprotonated, it can act as a nucleophile. The acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that. The acrylate group is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Or is it CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? Wait, no, the numbering is important. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Acrylate is propenoate, which is CH2=CHCOOR. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have a substituent on the third carbon, which is the same as the carbonyl carbon. Wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the substituent is on the beta carbon. So structure would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? No, perhaps it's more accurately drawn as CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. Wait, that would make the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent on carbon 3. Hmm, but that can't be right because the carbonyl is on carbon 3. Oh wait, wait. Let me clarify.

The correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)prop-2-enoate. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, with the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group on carbon 2 (which is the beta position relative to the carbonyl). That makes more sense because the Michael addition typically occurs at the beta position of the enone.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So in this case, the dimethyl malonate would deprotonate to form an enolate, which would attack the beta carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl) of the acrylate.

So the acrylate has the structure CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? Wait, I think I need to correct this. The structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is more accurately CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the actual structure.

Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent (p-tolyl) on the third carbon of acrylate. Since acrylate is propenoate, which is CH2=CHCOO-. So, the third carbon is the carbonyl carbon. Wait, that doesn't make sense because substituents on the third carbon would be the same as the carbonyl group. So perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, the p-tolyl is on carbon 2, and the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but with a double bond, so it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Oh wait, no. Acrylate (propenoate) is CH2=CHCOO-. So the substituent (p-tolyl) would be on the middle carbon (carbon 2), making it CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. But the (E) configuration would mean the groups on either side of the double bond are opposite. Wait, but in this case, the p-tolyl is on the same carbon as the double bond, so maybe the structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)=COOCH3. No, that doesn't look right. I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed regardless.

In any case, dimethyl malonate is (CH2(CO2Me)2). When it reacts with the acrylate, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl) of the acrylate. The acrylate has the structure CH2=CHCO-O-CH3, but with the p-tolyl substituent on the middle carbon. Wait, perhaps the actual structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the Michael acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which would be the acrylate.

So the Michael addition would add the enolate of dimethyl malonate to the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the product would be a new carbon-carbon bond between the malonate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Wait, no. The enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl) of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate). So the product would have the malonate's alpha carbon connected to the acrylate's beta carbon.

So the product would be a new molecule where the malonate has added across the double bond of the acrylate. Let me try to imagine this. The acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. The enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(CO2Me)2) would attack the beta carbon (the CH2 group in CH2=C(p-tolyl)).

Wait, no, the enolate is at the alpha position of the malonate. So the enolate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the malonate's alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl) would add to the beta carbon of the acrylate (the one adjacent to the carbonyl of the acrylate).

So the product would form a new carbon chain where the malonate's alpha carbon is attached to the acrylate's beta carbon. The acrylate's carbonyl would then become a ketone or ester, depending on the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the product. So after the addition, the product would have a structure like CH2(CO2Me)2 attached to the acrylate's beta carbon. So the product would be more like CH2(CO2Me)2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the product would be a new ester where the malonate has added across the double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a trimethyl ester. Let me think about the possibilities. If the acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3 and the malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2, then the addition would form a new molecule where the malonate's CH2 adds to the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the product would have a structure like CH2(CO2Me)2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, but that seems a bit long. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ester with multiple substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product is trimethyl something. Looking at the options, option A for product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. That structure would be OMe groups on carbons 1 and 3, and a p-tolyl group on carbon 2. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
  |
CH2-C(p-tolyl)-CH2-CO-OCH3

Wait, perhaps it's:

COOCH3
|
CH2-C(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOCH3
|
COOCH3

Wait, no. Propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have three ester groups: at positions 1 and 3, and another at position 1 again. Hmm, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C(p-tolyl)-CH2-CO-OCH3
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, that would be a symmetric structure. So the product is an addition of the malonate to the acrylate, leading to a tricarboxylate ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So propane has three carbons. The first and third carbons each have two ester groups (since it's trimethyl), and the middle carbon has the p-tolyl group.

Wait, that makes sense. So the product would be a tricarboxylate, where the middle carbon (position 2) has the p-tolyl group, and positions 1 and 3 each have two ester groups. So the structure is OMe-COO-CH2-C(p-tolyl)-CH2-COO-OMe. So each end is a dimethyl ester (from the malonate), and the middle is connected to the p-tolyl from the acrylate.

So for reaction (A), the product would be trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, which matches options A and B.

Moving on to reaction (B): 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of MeOH and H3O+.

Wait, I think but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-C≡N. But the (E) configuration would be CH2=CH-CN. Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2-CN? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-CN. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2-CN? No, I think but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? Wait, no. Butene has four carbons. But-2-enenitrile would be CH2-CH2-CN, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, but the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN, right? Because butenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no, butenitrile would be CH2CH2CN, but with a double bond between 1 and 2? Hmm, perhaps I should write it as CH2=CHCH2CN? No, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2CH2-CN with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C≡N, which is but-2-enenitrile. So (E) configuration would imply the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. But in this case, the substituents are CH2 and CN. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, but that would be pent-4-enenitrile. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, but maybe it's better to proceed.

The other reactant is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. That's a piperidine ring (six-membered amine) with a cyclohexene substituent attached to the nitrogen. So the structure is a piperidine where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a cyclohexene attached to the nitrogen. So the molecule has a conjugated diene system? Or perhaps it's a cyclic amine with a cyclohexene substituent.

In the presence of MeOH and H3O+, perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition as well, but since the nucleophile is from the piperidine, which is a secondary amine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is acting as a base, deprotonating the nitrile to form an enamine or something else.

Wait, nitriles can be nucleophiles under certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine acts as the nucleophile. Wait, but piperidine is a weak base and a good nucleophile. But in this case, it's in the presence of MeOH and H3O+, which is acidic. So perhaps the conditions are for a conjugate addition.

Wait, but the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile, which can act as a Michael acceptor. So the piperidine would act as a nucleophile (enolate equivalent) attacking the beta position.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are MeOH and H3O+, which are acidic, so maybe the piperidine is protonated, making it a better leaving group or perhaps acting as a base. Alternatively, the MeOH could be a solvent, and H3O+ could be a catalyst.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) would attack the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl or other acceptor. Here, the acceptor is the nitrile, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile (but-2-enenitrile). So the piperidine (or perhaps a deprotonated form) would attack the beta carbon of the nitrile.

Wait, but piperidine is a secondary amine. Under acidic conditions, it would get protonated, making it a weaker base, but perhaps it can still act as a nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's conjugated base is formed, but under acidic conditions, that's less likely. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the piperidine is not the nucleophile. What if the nitrile is the nucleophile? No, in the Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. So the piperidine should be the nucleophile.

Wait, the structure of 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is a bicyclic system where the piperidine ring is attached to a cyclohexene. So the nitrogen has a cyclohexene substituent, making it part of a conjugated system. So perhaps this compound can act as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction, but in this case, it's reacting in a Michael addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine isn't the nucleophile, but the nitrile is. But that doesn't fit the typical Michael reaction mechanism. Alternatively, maybe the piperidine is acting as a base, deprotonating the nitrile to form a conjugate base which then acts as a nucleophile.

Wait, nitriles can be Michael acceptors because the alpha position is electron-deficient. So in this case, perhaps the but-2-enenitrile is the acceptor, and the piperidine is the nucleophile. The piperidine would have its enamine-like structure, but perhaps under acidic conditions, it's deprotonated at the alpha position to form an enamine, making it a good nucleophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is providing a conjugate base. Wait, but the reaction conditions are acidic (H3O+), so the piperidine would be protonated, which would make it less nucleophilic. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is acting as a base, deprotonating the nitrile to form a stronger nucleophile. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the product possibilities.

The product is given as (B), and the options have various possibilities. Looking at the options, for product (B):

Option A: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Option B: same as A.

Option C: 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Option D: same as C.

Wait, but the product is formed from the piperidine and the nitrile. So perhaps the piperidine's nitrogen is attacking the beta carbon of the nitrile.

So but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-C≡N. The beta carbon is the CH2 next to the nitrile. So the attack would be on that CH2, forming a new bond between the piperidine's nitrogen and the CH2.

Wait, but in a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon. So the piperidine's enolate would attack the CH2 of the nitrile. But wait, nitriles are less reactive than ketones or esters because the nitrile group is a weaker electron-withdrawing group compared to, say, a ketone. So perhaps the reaction isn't a typical Michael addition but another type of conjugate addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition to the nitrile's alpha position. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the piperidine is adding to the nitrile in a way that forms a new carbon-nitrogen bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ring-opening of the piperidine. But that doesn't seem likely. Alternatively, the piperidine might donate a hydrogen, leading to a conjugate addition.

Wait, perhaps the conditions are such that the piperidine is acting as a base, deprotonating the nitrile to form an enamine, which then attacks the alpha position. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is acting as a nucleophile, attacking the alpha carbon of the nitrile. But that would be a 1,2-addition, not a 1,4-conjugate addition.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that when a nucleophile attacks the beta position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. So the attack is on the beta carbon, leading to a conjugate addition (Michael addition).

So but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-C≡N. The beta carbon is the CH2 group next to the nitrile. So the nucleophile (from the piperidine) would attack that CH2.

The piperidine is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. So the structure is a piperidine ring with a cyclohexene substituent attached to the nitrogen. So the nitrogen is connected to a cyclohexene group. When it attacks the beta carbon of the nitrile, the product would have the piperidine's cyclohexene group connected to the nitrile's CH2.

Wait, perhaps the product would have a structure where the piperidine's cyclohexene is attached to the CH2 group from the nitrile. So the product would be something like:

CH2-CH2-C≡N connected to the piperidine's cyclohexene group.

But that's a bit vague. Looking at the options, option B for product (B) is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit because the piperidine would bring a cyclohexene group. Wait, no, the product is butanenitrile, which has four carbons. So perhaps the product is CH2-CH2-C≡N attached to a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The product (B) is formed from 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile.

So the piperidine is acting as the nucleophile, attacking the beta carbon of the nitrile. So but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-C≡N. The beta carbon is the CH2 next to the nitrile.

So the attack would form a bond between the piperidine's nitrogen and the CH2 group. So the product would have a structure like:

CH2-CH2-C≡N connected to the piperidine.

Wait, but the piperidine's structure is a six-membered ring with a cyclohexene substituent on the nitrogen. So the product would be a new molecule where the piperidine's nitrogen is bonded to the CH2 group from the nitrile.

But that would make it a secondary amine attached to a nitrile. However, the product options don't seem to match that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A for product (B) is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. That would imply a cyclohexanone group attached to a butanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-C≡N connected to a cyclohexanone group. But where would that come from?

Wait, perhaps the piperidine's cyclohexene group is involved in a cycloaddition. Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is undergoing a ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene in the piperidine acts as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction with the nitrile's double bond. But that's a different reaction, and the conditions don't seem to suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's enamine form is reacting. Enamines are typically formed under basic conditions, but here the conditions are acidic (H3O+), which doesn't favor enamine formation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is acting as a base, deprotonating the alpha position of the nitrile, making it more nucleophilic. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product structure. Suppose the piperidine's nitrogen attacks the beta carbon of the nitrile. Then the product would have a structure where the nitrile is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to the piperidine's nitrogen. But considering that, the product would have a chain longer than butanenitrile. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a substitution where the nitrile is attached to the cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexene from the piperidine is involved in a conjugate addition. So the piperidine's cyclohexene could act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction with the nitrile's double bond. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's enamine is formed, which can attack the nitrile's alpha position. But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should move on to the third reaction and come back.

The third reaction is between compound C and but-3-en-2-one in the presence of KOH and H2O, producing 2-(3-ox
