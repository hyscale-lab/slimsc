Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a' in the wave function. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait, wave functions usually have both real and imaginary parts, right? But in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like being square-integrable and normalizable. Oh, right, and the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1.

The problem states that when they measured the position, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Oh wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. Hmm, that seems a bit odd because if the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3, then maybe it's zero there. But wait, the current expression is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Maybe I'm misunderstanding this.

Wait, no, perhaps the wave function is written as a function that's non-zero only in the region x between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only in that interval. But the wave function they provide is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, maybe the wave function is written as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) e^{-iθ} or something, but the problem simplifies it to (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Or perhaps it's a complex function, but the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is given in a simplified form, but perhaps the form is such that when integrated, the probability is normalized. So the modulus squared of the wave function should be integrated over the interval from x=1 to x=3, and that integral should equal 1.

Wait, let's clarify. The wave function ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function. The modulus squared is |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, since the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Oh wait, no, because the imaginary part is multiplied by i, so the actual ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5i). So the modulus squared would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary part squared is (0.5)^2.

Wait, no. The modulus squared is (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))². So Re(ψ) is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and Im(ψ) is (-0.5). So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25). But wait, that can't be right because the wave function should be such that when you integrate |ψ|^2 over all space, it equals 1. But in this problem, the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3? Or is this the form within that interval?

Wait, the problem says that when measuring the positions, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So perhaps ψ(x) is zero outside of x between 1 and 3, and the given expression is the form within that interval. So maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So the integral for normalization is from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

But wait, the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So is this valid only between x=1 and x=3? Otherwise, the wave function would be zero elsewhere. Hmm, that makes sense because the measurements never find the particle outside that interval. So the wave function is non-zero only from x=1 to x=3.

So, the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Calculating |ψ(x)|²: [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated because the integral would involve both terms. Let me compute each term separately.

First term: integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So the first integral becomes a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Second term: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding both terms: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking the square root, a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the answer.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). This means the wave function is zero outside this interval, and the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

We split this into two integrals:

1. The first term is \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \). The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \), so:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

2. The second term is \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \). This evaluates to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
\]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
