Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about a star with dark spots and how it relates to a planet's effect on brightness. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star = R_sun. The star's hemisphere (half of it) is covered in dark spots. These spots have a filling factor of 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. Wait, no, wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered. Oh right, so if the star is observed from the side, when a hemisphere is covered, each hemisphere is half the star's surface. Wait, no, the entire star has surface area 4πR². So each hemisphere is 2πR². So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Hmm, but wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered, so the entire spotted area is 20% of the hemisphere's area. So that's 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². Wait, no, wait, the hemisphere's area is 2πR², so 20% of that is 0.4πR². So the total area covered by spots is 0.4πR².

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K.

The question is about the brightness variation. When the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, causing brightness variations. The same effect as a planet transiting the star. But the problem says that if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the change in flux.

So, let's model this. When the star is unspotted, the flux is F = σTeff^4 * (Area)/4π? Wait, no, the total flux from the star is σTeff^4 multiplied by the surface area (4πR²) divided by 4π (because flux is per unit area at a distance). So F = σTeff^4 * (4πR²) / (4π) ) = σTeff^4 R².

Wait, no. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the power (luminosity) of a star is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. So the flux we receive (at a distance D) is F = L / (4π D²) = (4π R² σ Teff^4) / (4π D²) )= R² σ Teff^4 / D². But in our case, the star is the same, so the distance D is the same, so when considering relative changes, D cancels out.

But in this problem, we're considering the relative change in brightness when spots are present. So the total flux when spots are present is less than when they're not.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower because the spots are cooler. The change in brightness is the difference between the normal star and the star with spots.

Wait, but when the star is not covered by spots, the flux is F0 = σ Teff^4 R² / D². But when spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (fraction of spots) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * (R² / D²) ?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the area of spots and the temperature difference.

The flux from the star without spots is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (4π R^2) / (4π) )= σ T_eff^4 R².

When a portion of the star is covered by spots, the flux is F = F0 - (area of spots) * (σ (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4)) / (4π D²) )? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think: each spot is a region with temperature T_spot. So the flux from the spot is σ T_spot^4 multiplied by the area of the spot, and divided by 4π D². So the total flux from the star without spots is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (4π R²) / (4π D²) ) = σ T_eff^4 R² / D².

With spots, the flux is F = F0 - (sum of all spots' flux at T_spot) + (sum of all spots' flux at T_eff) ? Wait, no, I think it's F = F0 - (fraction of the surface covered by spots) * (σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ) * (4π R² / 4π D²) ) ? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the change in flux as the difference between the star without spots and the star with spots.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4π R²) / (4π D²) ) = (σ Teff^4 R²) / D².

With spots, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - f ( (T_spot^4)/(Teff^4) )) ), where f is the area of spots as a fraction of the star's surface.

Wait, no, not quite. Because the spots are cooler, the total flux is F = F0 * (1 - f * ( (T_spot^4) / Teff^4 )) ). Wait, no. Because the spots contribute less flux than the surrounding.

Wait, perhaps the total flux is F = F0 - (f * (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 )) * (σ R²) / D².

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The flux from the spotted regions is lower. So the total flux is F = (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * T_spot^4, all multiplied by σ R² / D².

Wait, that would make sense. Because each point on the star's surface contributes σ T^4, so the average T is a weighted average based on the area.

So F = [ (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * T_spot^4 ] * (σ R^2) / D^2.

So the relative change in flux when the spots are present is (F - F0)/F0 = [ ( (1-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) - Teff^4 ] / Teff^4.

Simplify numerator: (1-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 - Teff^4 = -f Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 = f ( T_spot^4 - Teff^4 )

Wait, but since T_spot is lower, T_spot^4 < Teff^4, so the numerator is negative. So (F - F0)/F0 = f ( T_spot^4 - Teff^4 ) / Teff^4 = f ( (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) - 1 )

Wait, but that would give a negative relative change. So the flux is lower when spots are present.

Wait, but in our problem, the star's brightness variation is due to rotation, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower than when it's on the far side. So the amplitude of the variation would be the difference between the maximum (all spots on the far side) and minimum (all spots visible) flux.

Wait, no. Because when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere might come into view. So the flux is (F when half spotted) minus (F when not spotted). Wait, no, the star is only covering one hemisphere with spots. So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower. When it's not, the flux is higher.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. The star's surface is such that one hemisphere is spotted. So when we look at the star, the fraction of the spotted area that is visible depends on the rotation. When the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere can rotate into and out of view. So the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible (all unspotted area is visible), and the minimum when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but the star is a sphere. During rotation, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. When it's on the far side, we don't. So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, but in our problem, the star is rotating, so the spots are on one hemisphere. So, the brightness variation (amplitude) would be the difference between the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible (minimum flux) and when it's not (maximum flux).

Wait, but no
