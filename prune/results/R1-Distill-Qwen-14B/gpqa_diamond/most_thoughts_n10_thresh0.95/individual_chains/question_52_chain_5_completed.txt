Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Now, the main part of the question involves the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. They also mention that the photosphere is in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies.

Hmm. So I think this has to do with the Saha equation and the Boltzmann equation because they deal with ionization and excitation states in stellar atmospheres.

Wait, the problem is about the ratio of two energy levels for neutral Ti. So the ratio is the number of atoms in level 2 divided by level 1. The ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning it's lower when the temperature is lower (since Teff went down when spots are present). 

In LTE, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength λ ≈1448 Å. Let me calculate the energy difference between the two levels. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. 

So h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. Let's compute that. 

Wait, I remember that hc is about 12400 eV·Å. So E = 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.56 eV. So the energy difference is about 8.56 eV. Wait, that's a pretty large energy difference. So the transition is between two levels separated by about 8.56 eV.

But wait, the ionization potential of Ti is about 7.1 eV for neutral Ti. So I'm not sure, but maybe this transition is across the ionization? No, because the question is about neutral Ti, so it's within the same ionization state. So maybe the energy difference is about 8.56 eV between the two levels.

Wait, but in atoms, the energy levels are quantized, and the differences can be large, but for a star's photosphere, the thermal energy (k*T) is much smaller compared to such a large energy difference. Let me think about the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(k T)). For a star with Teff = 6000 K when spotless and 5500 K when spotted.

So for the spotless case: T1 = 6000 K.

For the spotted case: T2 = 5500 K.

Wait, but the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered. So the average flux is lower, implying that the effective temperature is lower. But wait, how does that affect the photosphere?

Wait, but the star's photosphere is in LTE. So each point in the photosphere is at a certain temperature. But when spots are present, parts of the surface are cooler (the spots) and the rest are at higher temperature? Or does the overall photosphere temperature decrease?

Wait, the question says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. Hmm. So the average T is lower. But for LTE, each region is in its own T. But when considering the ratio of Ti levels, perhaps we can model it as an average over the entire surface.

Wait, but the problem says when examining the ratio in the stellar photosphere, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So perhaps they're considering the average of the ratio over the entire surface.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the spots are cooler regions, so the Ti atoms in those regions are in lower energy levels, which could affect the overall ratio.

Alternatively, maybe the star's overall temperature has decreased, so the average T in the photosphere is lower, leading to a lower ratio.

Wait, regardless, I need to model the ratio as a function of temperature.

The ratio R = (n2 / n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming that g2/g1 is a constant, the ratio R depends exponentially on T.

Wait, but wait, in the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases, R decreases.

Let me compute R1 (no spots) and R2 (with spots), then find the factor R1/R2.

So R1/R2 = [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] 

The (g2/g1) terms cancel out.

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

ΔE is 8.56 eV. Wait, but I need to convert this into Joules because k is in J/(K·mol).

Wait, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So ΔE = 8.56 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 1.37e-18 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

Compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) )= (500)/(3.3e7) )= approx 1.515e-5 1/K.

So the exponent becomes (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

ΔE/(k) = (1.37e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ 1.37e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ approx 1e5 or 100,000 K.

Wait, 1.37e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.37 / 1.38 ) * 1e5 ≈ roughly 1e5.

So (ΔE / k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Multiply that by (1.515e-5 1/K) gives:

1e5 * 1.515e-5 = approx 1.515.

So the exponent is about 1.515.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.515) ≈ e^1.515.

What's e^1.5? e^1 is ~2.718, e^0.5 is ~1.648; so 2.718 *1.648 is about 4.48. So e^1.515 would be a little higher.

Let me compute it more accurately:

e^1.515: let's split it as e^1.5 * e^0.015.

e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817.

e^0.015 is approximately 1.0151.

So 4.4817 * 1.0151 ≈ 4.55.

So the factor is approximately 4.55. So looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, ΔE = 8.56 eV. So 8.56 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.37e-18 J.

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = 1.37e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.37/1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 1e5 (since 1.37/1.38 is ~0.993).

Then, 1/T2 = 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1.

1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 1.667e-4 K^-1.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1.818e-4 - 1.667e-4) = 0.151e-4 = 1.51e-5 K^-1.

Multiply (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 -1/T1) = 1e5 * 1.51e-5 = 1.51.

Wait, that's 1.51, not 1.515. So exponent is 1.51.

e^1.51 is approximately e^1.5 is 4.48, and e^0.01 is about 1.01005, so 1.51 is 1.5 + 0.01.

Wait, perhaps I should compute e^1.51 more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute e^1.51:

1.51 ln is 1.51.

e^1.51 = e^(1 + 0.51) = e * e^0.51.

e is approx 2.71828.

e^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.51 is a bit more. Let me calculate it:

At x=0.51:

e^x = 1 + 0.51 + (0.51^2)/2 + (0.51^3)/6 + (0.51^4)/24.

0.51^2 = 0.2601; 0.2601/2 = 0.13005.

0.51^3 = 0.51 * 0.2601 = approx 0.132651; /6 = ~0.0221.

0.51^4 = 0.132651 * 0.51 ≈ 0.06765; /24 = ~0.002819.

Adding up: 1 + 0.51 = 1.51 + 0.13005 = 1.64005 + 0.0221 ≈ 1.66215 + 0.002819 ≈ 1.665.

So e^0.51 ≈ 1.665. So e^1.51 = e * 1.665 ≈ 2.718 * 1.665 ≈ 4.52.

So the factor R1/R2 is about 4.52, which is about 4.5, matching option C.

Wait a minute, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R2 is less than R1. So R1/R2 is the factor by which the ratio increases. So since the factor is ~4.5, the correct option is C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from being spotless (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K). The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\), which is calculated as:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{12400 \, \text{eV·Å}}{1448 \, \text{Å}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting \(\Delta E\) to joules:

\[
\Delta E = 8.56 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} \approx 1.37 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels depends on the temperature \(T\). For the two cases (spotless and spotted), the temperatures are \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\), respectively. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{3.3 \times 10^7} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

The term \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\) is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.37 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}} \approx 1.0 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 1.0 \times 10^5 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.515.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.515).
\]

Approximating \(\exp(1.515)\), we find:

\[
\exp(1.515) \approx 4.5.
\]

Thus, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star transitions from being spotless to having spots. This corresponds to option **C**.
