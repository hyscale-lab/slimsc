Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question gives the density matrix rho as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. So, I need to figure out where this particular rho is located in the qubit space.

Wait, qubit space... Oh right, a qubit can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of a qubit state. For a pure state, it's a point on the surface of the sphere, and for a mixed state, it's inside the sphere.

But wait, this rho is a density matrix. How do I convert that into the Bloch vector representation? I think the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So, expanding that, rho would be (I + rx σx + ry σy + rz σz)/2. Each component of r corresponds to the expectation values of the respective Pauli matrices.

Looking back at the given rho: (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write out |0><0| and |1><1| in terms of the computational basis. |0><0| is [[1, 0], [0, 0]], and |1><1| is [[0, 0], [0, 1]]. Adding them and multiplying by 1/2 gives [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So rho is a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal.

Now, comparing this to the general form (I + r·σ)/2. I know that I is the identity matrix, which is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]] when multiplied by 1/2. Wait, so if rho equals [(I + r·σ)]/2, then in this case rho is (I)/2 plus (r·σ)/2.

But wait, in my rho, when I expand it, it's 0.5 I. Because |0><0| + |1><1| equals I. So rho = (I)/2. So, that would imply that r·σ must be zero. Because (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 only if r·σ is zero.

So, the terms with rx, ry, and rz must all be zero. That means rx=0, ry=0, rz=0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Which is the origin. But wait, the origin in the Bloch sphere represents the completely mixed state. Because when r is zero, rho is I/2, which is a maximally mixed state.

Now, looking at the options: option C is (0,0,0), which would be the origin. But wait, the options are A: (1,1,0), B: (0,0,1), C: (0,0,0), D: (1,1,1).

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait a second, but another approach: sometimes the density matrix can be written as rho = [I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z]/2. So, if my rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is (I)/2, then all the terms with Pauli matrices must be zero. So r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. So the vector r is indeed (0,0,0). So the geometrical position is at the origin.

Therefore, the correct option is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle\langle 0| + |1\rangle\langle 1|\right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
= \frac{1}{2}I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. Density matrices can also be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) and the Pauli matrices \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), it is clear that the terms involving the Pauli matrices must vanish, i.e., \(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), and \(r_z = 0\). This means the Bloch vector \(r\) is at the origin, \((0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the completely mixed state.

Among the options provided:
- **A)** \(r = (1, 1, 0)\): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different state.
- **B)** \(r = (0, 0, 1)\): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a state aligned along the \(z\)-axis.
- **C)** \(r = (0, 0, 0)\): Correct, as this matches the origin in Bloch sphere representation.
- **D)** \(r = (1, 1, 1)\): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different state.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin, \((0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
