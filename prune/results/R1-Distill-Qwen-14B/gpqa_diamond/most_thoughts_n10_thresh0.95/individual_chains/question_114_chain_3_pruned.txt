Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reagents for the given reactions. Let me think through this step by step.

First, looking at the reactions:

1. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in the presence of water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I need to select the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

Let's tackle the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with cyanide ion (CN-), I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition. The reaction is typically done under specific conditions. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions here. 

In the presence of a strong acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B), the ketone can undergo acid-catalyzed addition. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is a compound where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by -OH and -CN groups on adjacent carbons.

So for the first step, the reagent A is probably H3O+ because it's a strong acid that facilitates the addition of CN- to the ketone. Without the acid, maybe the reaction wouldn't proceed efficiently. So that narrows down the options for A. Looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ as A, while C and D have NaHSO3.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (I think that's the product of the first reaction). Wait, no, the second reaction's starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's a nitrile with a hydroxy group on the same carbon, perhaps? Or maybe it's a structure where the nitrile is attached to the same carbon as the hydroxy group and another substituent.

The product is a butanoic acid with the same substituents but now with a carboxylic acid group. So, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I think the conversion of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically involves hydrolysis. There are different conditions for this. One method is using a strong acid like HCl with water, which would be a hydrolysis under acidic conditions. Alternatively, another method is using a base, but the product in this case is a carboxylic acid, so I think it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, but the second reagent B is in the presence of H2O. So the reaction is probably hydrolysis of the nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. The conditions for this would involve strong acid, like HCl. Because under acidic conditions, the nitrile can undergo hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, sometimes you use a strong base, but that would give a carboxylate which would need to be acidified. Wait, but the product is already the acid, so maybe it's done under acidic conditions.

Wait, but another possibility is using H3O+ as the acid. But looking at the options, option B for reagent B is CH3COOH, and option A for B is HCl. So which is correct?

Wait, I think the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions. For example, treatment with HCl (concentrated) and water, sometimes under heat. Alternatively, another method is using H2SO4 as the acid. So if B
