Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Okay, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the spots are making the star cooler overall.

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels: level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And it's assumed that the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that each small region is in equilibrium, so Boltzmann equation applies.

Hmm, okay. So, I think the key here is to use the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels to temperature. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So, the ratio n1/n2 (I think the problem says the ratio decreases, but let me check: they observed that the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases. So n1/n2 is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Which makes sense—lower temperature would mean higher energy levels are less populated. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so n1/n2 is lower.

But wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the spots are present, the ratio is lower than when they aren't. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = ?

Wait, the problem says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2)"—so it's the ratio n1/n2. So, when the star has spots, this ratio is lower. So, the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present.

So, to find the factor by which the ratio changes, we need to compute (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me denote the temperatures: T1 = 6000 K (no spots), T2 = 5500 K (with spots).

So, the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So the ratio when no spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

The ratio when spots are present is R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

The factor is R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) - (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) )

Factor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] )

Wait, but wait—the term (E2-E1) is related to the wavelength of the transition. The energy difference can be found using the relation E = hc/λ. So E2 - E1 = hc/(λ).

So, substituting that into the exponent:

Factor = exp( (hc/(λ k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

So I can compute this exponent.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the constants:

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = speed of light = 3e8 m/s
k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K
λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m

Calculate hc/(λ k):

Compute hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
λ = 1448e-10 m
So hc/λ = 1.9878e-25 / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J

Now, divide by k (1.38e-23 J/K):

(1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 9.94e4 K

Wait, let me double-check that:

1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.372 / 1.38) * (1e-18 / 1e-23) ) ≈ 0.994 * 1e5 = 99,400 K.

So approximately 1e5 K.

So, (hc/(λ k)) ≈ 1e5 K.

Then, the exponent is (1e5 K) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4

1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4

So 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (1.6667e-4 - 1.8182e-4) = (-1.515e-5 )

Multiply by 1e5 K:

1e5 * (-1.515e-5) = -1.515

So the exponent is approximately -1.515.

So, the factor is exp(-1.515). Wait, wait, no, because when computing R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] )

Wait, let me recheck the sign.

We have:

E2 - E1 = hc/(λ)

So, the exponent in the factor is (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Which is [ (hc/(λ k) ) ] * ( 1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Which is 1e5 K * ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) )

Wait, 1/6000 is less than 1/5500, so their difference is negative. So the exponent is negative.

So the factor is exp( -1.515 )

What is exp(-1.515) approximately? Let's think. e^1.5 is about 4.48. So e^1.515 is a bit higher, say around 4.54. So 1/4.54 is approximately 0.22. So exp(-1.515) ≈ 0.22.

Wait wait, wait, but that's the factor R1/R2 = ~0.22. But that would mean that the ratio without spots is 0.22 times the ratio with spots. But that's the opposite of what the problem says. Because when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (spots). So R1/R2 should be greater than 1.

Wait, that's a contradiction. So I must have messed up the signs somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2. When the star is cooler, the ratio n1/n2 is smaller. So R1 (no spots) = (n1/n2) when T=6000 K, which is higher than R2 (T=5500 K), which is lower.

So R1/R2 should be greater than 1. But according to my calculation, the factor is exp(-1.515) ≈ 0.22, which is less than 1. So that can't be right.

Ah, I think I messed up the sign when I substituted the energies. Let me recheck.

In the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, wait, no. The correct form is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because E2 is higher than E1, assuming level 2 is higher. So, when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, so n2/n1 is smaller. So, when the star has spots (T=5500 K), n2/n1 is smaller than when T=6000 K.

But the problem says that when spots are present, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that's consistent because n1/n2 is (n2/n1)^{-1}, so if n2/n1 decreases, n1/n2 increases. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The ratio n1/n2 is the inverse of n2/n1.

So, if n2/n1 decreases when T decreases, then n1/n2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Let me make sure I have the ratio right.

Wait, let me re-examine:

The problem says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". So it's n1/n2. When spots are present, this ratio decreases.

So when T decreases (spots present), n1/n2 decreases.

From the Boltzmann equation: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases (since T is in denominator). So the exponential term becomes larger, making n1/n2 larger. But the problem states that when spots are present, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. That would mean that my understanding is wrong, which suggests I might have the energy levels backward.

Wait, perhaps level 1 is lower than level 2, so when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 should decrease because higher energy levels (level 2) are more populated. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So with higher T, (E2 - E1)/(k T) is smaller, so the exponential is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller. So when T increases, n1/n2 decreases. So when the star has spots, T decreases, so (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes larger, so the exponential increases, leading to a larger ratio n1/n2. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps I have the levels reversed in the ratio.

Ah, maybe the problem is considering the ratio as n2/n1 instead of n1/n2. Let me read the question again.

The problem says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". So that's n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases.

Wait, perhaps I have the sign wrong in the Boltzmann equation. Let me make sure. The Boltzmann equation is n_j/n_i = (g_j/g_i) exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

So, if j is level 2 and i is level 1, then n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so n2/n1 increases. So in the star without spots, T is higher, so n2/n1 is higher. When the star has spots, T is lower, so n2/n1 is lower.

So, the ratio n1/n2 would be 1/(n2/n1) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so n1/n2 increases. But according to the problem, when the star has spots, n1/n2 decreases. That's a contradiction.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the energy difference wrong. Let me think: the transition between the two levels corresponds to a photon emitted when an atom drops from level 2 to level 1. So E2 > E1. So E2 - E1 is positive.

So, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), which is exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, when T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so the exponential approaches 1. So n2/n1 approaches (g2/g1), which is a constant if the statistical weights are fixed.

Wait, but when T changes, the exponential changes. So, when T decreases, ΔE/(k T) increases, so the exponential decreases. So n2/n1 decreases, which means n1/n2 increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, n1/n2 decreases. So that suggests that when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. But according to my calculation, with T decreasing, n1/n2 increases. So there's a contradiction here, which must mean I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering an absorption line, so the ratio might be about the ionization or excitation state. Wait, the problem says it's about neutral Ti, so ionization isn't the issue. It's about the excitation between two energy levels.

Wait another thought: perhaps the transition is actually from level 1 to level 2, but not necessarily that level 2 is higher. Wait no, the transition is emission or absorption at a particular wavelength. The wavelength given is 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or far UV. Ti lines are typically in the UV or optical. For example, Ti I (neutral) has lines in the optical, but certain transitions would correspond to specific wavelengths.

But perhaps the energy difference is E1 - E2, with E1 higher than E2. Wait, but 1448 Å is about 145 nm, which is UV. E = hc/λ. So higher wavelength corresponds to lower energy. So if the transition is from level 2 to level 1, and the photon emitted is 1448 Å, then E2 > E1. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So, the previous setup is correct.

Hmm. So perhaps I messed up the ratio. Let me think again.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature is lower, and the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So, when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

With E2 > E1, so (E2-E1) is positive.

So, when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp( that ) increases, making n1/n2 increase. But the problem says n1/n2 decreases when spots are present. So this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the problem is the inverse. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2.

If the ratio is n2/n1, then when T decreases, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Which would decrease as T decreases, because the exponent becomes more negative. So n2/n1 decreases, which would mean that the ratio n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that the ratio n1/n2 decreases when spots are present. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the ratio backward. Let me read the problem again.

"Astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So the ratio is n1/n2, and it's lower when the star has spots. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which, when T is lower, the exponent is larger, so exp is larger, so n1/n2 is larger.

But the problem says it's lower. So the only way this makes sense is if the ratio is actually n2/n1. So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's ratio.

Let me re-express the problem. Suppose the ratio they are considering is n2/n1. Then, when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases. So the ratio decreases, which matches the problem statement.

Ah, that must be the case. So, perhaps the problem's ratio is n2/n1, and when the star has spots, T is lower, so n2/n1 is lower.

So, the factor we're looking for is (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_with_spots.

Let me compute that.

So,

(n2/n1)_T1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) )

(n2/n1)_T2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So the factor is [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2) ) ] 

The (g2/g1) cancels out.

So factor = exp( [ (-ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is the same as exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because ΔE is E2-E1.

So, that becomes exp( (ΔE)/(k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) )

Which is the same as exp( (ΔE)/(k) ( - (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )

So, factor = exp( - (ΔE)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is the same as exp( (ΔE)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So, let me compute this.

Earlier, I found that (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (approx) (0.0001818 - 0.00016667) = 0.00001515

Multiply by (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 1e5 K:

1e5 * 0.00001515 = 1.515

So, the exponent is 1.515.

So factor = exp(1.515).

What's exp(1.515) approximately?

We know that ln(4) ≈ 1.386, and ln(5)≈1.609. So 1.515 is between ln(4.5) and ln(4.6).

Alternatively, e^1.5 is about 4.48, e^1.515 is about 4.54 perhaps.

So, the factor is approximately 4.54.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which fits.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5. So when the star has no spots, the ratio (n2/n1) is about 4.5 times higher than when it has spots.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two energy levels. So, if the ratio is n2/n1, and when spots are present, the ratio decreases, then the factor (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots is about 4.5.

So the answer should be option C, which is ~4.5.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) under the given conditions. The Boltzmann equation governs the population of energy levels in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of levels 2 and 1, \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are their statistical weights, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Observations:
1. The problem specifies that the ratio of \(n_1/n_2\) decreases when the star has spots. This implies that the ratio being analyzed is \(n_2/n_1\), as \(n_2/n_1\) decreases when the temperature decreases.
2. When the star has no spots, \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), and when it has spots, \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\).
3. The energy difference \(E_2 - E_1\) is related to the wavelength \(\lambda\) of the transition by \(E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light.

### Calculation:
1. Compute the energy difference:
   \[
   E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Convert this to terms of \(kT\):
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. Compute the factor by which the ratio changes:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]
   Substitute the values:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.00001515.
   \]
   Multiply by \(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \approx 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}\):
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) \approx 1.515.
   \]
   The factor becomes:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(1.515) \approx 4.54.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio \(n_2/n_1\) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately 4.5. This matches option **C**.
