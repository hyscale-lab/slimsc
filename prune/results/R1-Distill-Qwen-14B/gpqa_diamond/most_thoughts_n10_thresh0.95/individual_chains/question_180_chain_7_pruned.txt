--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's read it again carefully.

The question says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. They mention that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with the energy of a system of charges, the electric potential energy comes into play. But wait, since the system is isolated, I think we're considering only the electrostatic potential energy between the charges. Also, the problem refers to the minimum energy, which makes me think about how the charges are arranged to minimize their potential energy.

Wait, but all the charges are the same sign because each has a charge of 2e. Since like charges repel, the potential energy would be positive because you have to do work against their repulsion to bring them together. Or wait, no—wait, when charges are brought closer, if they repel, their potential energy increases. So the system's potential energy is positive, and the minimum energy might refer to the configuration with the least possible energy, which could be when they are as far apart as possible, right?

Wait, no, because the charges are fixed in a certain way. Let me think: 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So all the 12 charges are located on a sphere of radius 2 meters around point P, which has the 13th charge.

So the setup is that there's a central charge at P (charge 2e) and 12 charges each at 2 meters away. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P.

I think the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, because they're identical and all the same, we can calculate the energy contributed by each pair and then sum them all up.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 charges around it are each at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges will interact with the central one, and they will also interact with each other.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed at that radius, but how are they arranged? Are they placed symmetrically, like on the surface of a sphere? Because the problem doesn't specify, but I think for the minimal energy, we can assume the most symmetric arrangement, which would be a spherical configuration. That way, the potential energy between the 12 charges would be minimized, perhaps?

Wait, no. Wait, when you have multiple charges on a sphere, their potential energy due to each other depends on their mutual distances. For minimal potential energy, maybe arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize repulsion, but since they can't move closer (they're constrained), perhaps the potential energy between them is fixed.

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is at a radius of 2m from P. So each of the 12 is at (r=2m) from P. So to find the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, that's straightforward. But the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges is more complicated because each pair is separated by some distance.

Wait, but if the 12 are placed on a sphere, what's the distance between any two of them? For a regular dodecahedron or something, but perhaps the average distance can be considered. Or perhaps, the problem assumes that the mutual interactions are negligible, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the surrounding 12, and not the energy between the 12 themselves. But that doesn't make sense because the system's total potential energy includes all pairs.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. Maybe the potential energy between the 12 charges is considered, but perhaps the problem is designed in a way that we can compute the total potential energy without knowing their exact arrangement. Or maybe the question is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the others, not the mutual potential energies among the 12.

Wait, no, because the system's total potential energy is the sum of all pairwise interactions. So the system includes the central charge (13th) and the 12 others. Each of the 12 is at 2m from the central charge, so the potential energy between each of them and the central charge is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m), because each of the 12 has charge 2e, and the central charge is also 2e.

But wait, no. The central charge is fixed, so maybe the potential energy due to bringing each of the 12 charges into place is considered. Let me think about how to calculate the potential energy of the entire system.

Potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions, considering the potential due to all the other charges already in place.

But in this setup, the central charge is fixed, so when we bring each of the 12 charges into place, the only existing charge is the central one. Or wait, no: the 12 charges are all identical and placed symmetrically, perhaps. So bringing each charge one by one, each time the central charge is present, and the other charges being added around.

Wait, but it's getting complicated, and perhaps the problem is intended to calculate only the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding ones, not the energy among the 12 themselves. Because if that's the case, then the calculation becomes easier.

Wait, but the problem says it's the minimum energy of the system. In the case of like charges, the minimal potential energy would be when each charge is as far as possible from the others. But in this setup, the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, so their positions are fixed, so the mutual potential energies among them can't be changed. So that part of the potential energy is fixed, and perhaps is part of the calculation.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any options that are extremely large. Let me think about the possible approach.

Each charge is 2e. So each of the 12 charges experiences a potential due to the central charge, and also due to the other 11 charges.

But calculating the exact potential energy between all pairs might be complicated because the 12 charges are arranged in some way, but perhaps the problem assumes that they are all at the same distance from each other. But that's not possible unless they are on a regular polyhedron, but even then, the distance between any two is fixed.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between the central charge and each of the 12.

Wait, but that would ignore the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the other 12, as the minimal energy scenario, but that doesn't make much sense because the 12 charges would have their own mutual repulsion, which contributes to the total potential energy.

But perhaps the problem is designed to only include the energy due to the central charge and the 12 others. Let me read the options: the options are A) 5.645e-26, B) 2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

So all of the options except D are very small numbers, in the order of 1e-26 J. D is about 122, which is way bigger. So perhaps the energy is dominated by the central charge and the 12 others, because each interaction is k*(2e)^2/(2m), and there are 12 such interactions.

Let me compute that.

Each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy with the central charge of U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m), where m is 2 meters.

Wait, but wait: the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * q1 * q2 / r.

In this case, q1 is 2e and q2 is 2e, and r is 2 meters.

So each pair (central and surrounding) contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / (2m).

But since there are 12 such surrounding charges, the total energy for these interactions is 12 * U.

But wait, wait. No, because each of the 12 charges is interacting with the central one. So the number of such pairs is 12.

So the total potential energy for these interactions is 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)].

But wait, I think this is correct. Now let's compute this.

Constants:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C

m = 2 meters.

Calculating 2e: 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

So each surrounding charge is 3.204e-19 C.

So U per pair is k * (3.204e-19)^2 / (2m).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, (2e)^2 is (3.204e-19 C)^2? Or wait: (2e)^2 is (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2.

So (3.204e-19)^2 is about 1.026e-37 C².

So U per pair is (8.988e9) * (1.026e-37) / (2*2) ?

Wait, no, because the denominator is r, which is 2 meters, and the calculation is for each of the 12 pairs.

Wait, let's compute it step by step.

First, calculate each term:

(2e) = 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

So each pair contributes:

U = k * q1 * q2 / r = 8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 / (2)

Wait, no, because the distance is 2 meters, so:

U = 8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2

So let's compute (3.204e-19)^2:

3.204e-19 * 3.204e-19 = (3.204)^2 * 1e-38 = approx 10.265 * 1e-38 = 1.0265e-37 C².

So U = 8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37 / 2 = (8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37) / 2.

Compute 8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37:

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

1.0265e-37 = 1.0265 * 1e-37.

Multiplying: 8.988 * 1.0265 ≈ 9.233. Then 1e9 * 1e-37 = 1e-28.

So 8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37 = approximately 9.233e-28.

Divide by 2: 9.233e-28 / 2 = 4.6165e-28 J.

That's the potential energy for one pair. There are 12 such pairs (each of the 12 charges with the central one).

So total U1 = 12 * 4.6165e-28 = let's compute.

12 * 4.6165e-28 = 55.398e-28 = 5.5398e-27 J.

Wait, but wait. That's only considering the interactions between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges. However, we also have the interactions between the 12 surrounding charges themselves. Since all 12 are at the same radius, the distance between any two surrounding charges depends on their positions, but perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can ignore that.

Wait, but why would the problem ignore it? Because the options don't account for that, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge and the 12 others, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others. Because if you include the mutual energies between the 12 charges, the total energy would be much higher, and the options don't seem to account for that.

Wait, but let's think about what's being asked: the minimum energy of the system. The system includes all the charges. So the mutual potential energies between the surrounding charges have to be considered.

But without knowing their exact arrangement, it's hard to compute the exact mutual potential energy. So perhaps the question is intending to assume that the mutual potential energies are zero, which is impossible because like charges repel, but perhaps the problem is designed to ignore that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's unlikely unless they are arranged in a neutral configuration, which is not the case here.

Wait, but maybe the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is considered as zero because they're fixed and not interacting. But that doesn't make sense because they do repel each other.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges, considering only the central charge's interactions. Let's proceed with that assumption for now, and see if the answer matches one of the options.

So U1 is 5.5398e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 7.056e-27 J.

Wait, but that's higher than 5.54e-27. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Each surrounding charge is 2e, and the central charge is 2e. So U for each pair is k*(2e)^2 / r.

Wait, but r is 2 meters.

So U per pair: (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2:

3.204^2 = about 10.265. So 10.265e-38 C².

So 8.988e9 * 10.265e-38 = 8.988 * 10.265 = approx 92.33e-29?

Wait, wait: 8.988e9 * 1e-38 is 8.988e-29.

Wait, no. 8.988e9 * 10.265e-38 = 8.988 * 10.265 * 1e9 * 1e-38 = (92.33) * 1e-29 = 9.233e-28.

Wait, no: because 10.265e-38 = 1.0265e-37. Then 8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37 = 8.988 * 1.0265 * 1e-28 ≈ 9.233e-28.

Divide by 2: 9.233e-28 / 2 = 4.6165e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 4.6165e-28 = 55.398e-28 = 5.5398e-27 J.

Wait, but the options don't have 5.54e-27. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, another approach: calculate each step precisely.

Compute (2e)^2 = (2 * 1.602e-19 C)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = 10.2657 * 1e-38 = 1.02657e-37 C².

Now, k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Each U is (8.988e9) * (1.02657e-37) / (2 m).

So U = 8.988e9 * 1.02657e-37 / 2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 1.02657e-37 = 8.988 * 1.02657 ≈ 9.2333e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.61665e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 4.61665e-28 = 55.3998e-28 = 5.53998e-27 J.

So approximately 5.54e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is about ten times larger. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is also larger. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times higher than our calculated 5.54e-27.

Hmm, so our calculation gives 5.54e-27 J, but none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I'm missing something. Did I forget to account for the mutual potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges?

Wait, that's a possibility. Maybe the problem expects us to include the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

But how can we calculate that without knowing their exact positions? Well, perhaps the problem is simplifying, assuming that each pair of the 12 surrounding charges is at a distance of 2m from each other, which is obviously not possible, but perhaps it's an approximation.

Wait, no, because arranging 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2m, the average distance between any two adjacent charges would be less than 2m. Wait, no, because if you have a sphere of radius R, the chord length (distance between two points on the sphere) is 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the angular separation. For closely packed points, theta is about 30 degrees (for 12 points, it's like a tetrahedral arrangement or something else?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energies are negligible compared to the energy from the central charge. That could be possible if the number of pairs is small, but 12C2 is 66 pairs, each with a charge product of (2e)^2, so their contribution could be significant.

Wait, let's calculate the mutual potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges.

Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between two surrounding charges.

But without knowing r_ij, we can't compute it exactly. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore this part, or perhaps a simplifying assumption is made.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem takes a different approach, considering the system's energy as the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the central one, as well as the potential energy each pair of the 12 contributes.

But without knowing r_ij, I'm stuck. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energies of the 12 charges, and only consider their interaction with the central charge.

If that's the case, then our initial calculation of 5.54e-27 J would be the total potential energy, but the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem refers to the potential energy per charge, and I'm miscalculating the number of pairs.

Wait, the 12 surrounding charges each interact with the central charge once, so 12 pairs.

But each of the 12 also interacts with the other 11 charges, so 12C2 = 66 pairs. But without knowing the distances, this part is tricky.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the central charge as fixed, so the only potential energy is that from the 12 charges being placed around it. So perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the sum of each charge's potential due to the central charge plus the potential due to all other surrounding charges.

But without knowing the exact distances, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energies between the 12 surrounding charges, making the total potential energy only due to the central charge and the 12 surrounding ones.

So, if that's the case, then our calculation of ~5.54e-27 J would be the answer. But looking back at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is higher than this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is referring to the potential energy as the work done in assembling the charges, considering all the interactions.

So, the potential energy U is the sum over all pairs of q_i q_j / (4πε_0 r_ij).

But the exact arrangement affects this sum.

But if the surrounding 12 charges are equally spaced on a sphere, the potential energy between any two is the same. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula for a point charge in a spherical shell. Because the 12 charges are arranged symmetrically on a sphere, each at r = 2m from the center, the potential at the center due to each charge is k*(2e)/(2m) = k*(2e)/r.

Wait, but the potential at the center due to each charge is the same, so the total potential at the center is 12 * (k*(2e)/r).

Wait, but the potential energy is the work done to assemble all the charges. But the 13th charge is fixed at P, so perhaps the potential energy is calculated as bringing each of the 12 charges into position, each time considering the potential due to the fixed charge at P and all the previously placed charges.

But that's complicated.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, in this case, the system has 13 charges: 1 fixed at P, and 12 at 2m from P.

The total number of pairs is C(13,2) = 78.

Each pair can be either the central charge with one of the 12, or a pair of the 12.

So, the total potential energy is U = U_central + U_surrounding.

Where U_central is the sum of the potential energies between the central charge and each of the 12.

And U_surrounding is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of the 12 surrounding charges.

So, U_central = 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = 12 * (k*(4e²))/(2m) = 12 * [ (8.988e9) * (4*(1.602e-19)^2) ) / (2*2) ].

Wait, let me compute U_central.

Each surrounding charge is 2e, so q_i = q_j = 2e.

r = 2m.

So U_central for each pair is (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / (2) = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 2.

Wait, e² is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So, U_central per pair:

(8.988e9) * (4 * 2.566e-38) / 2.

Compute 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = 9.23e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.615e-28 J per pair.

So U_central = 12 * 4.615e-28 = 5.538e-27 J.

Now, compute U_surrounding, which is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of the 12 surrounding charges.

Each pair of surrounding charges is at a distance r_ij from each other. If the 12 charges are equally spaced on the surface of a sphere, then the distance between any two adjacent charges can be calculated.

The formula for the distance between two points on a sphere of radius R separated by an angle θ is r_ij = 2R sin(θ/2).

For 12 equally spaced points on a sphere, the angle between adjacent points can be approximated. But I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps each pair of adjacent charges is separated by a certain angle.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to model the 12 charges as being arranged in a regular icosahedron or something, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all the 12 surrounding charges are at a distance of 2m from each other, but that's impossible on a sphere of radius 2m because the maximum distance between two points on the sphere is 4m (diametrically opposite), but the minimum is closer.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is making an approximation, assuming that the average distance between any two surrounding charges is 2m, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each surrounding charge is not interacting with the others, which is impossible because they are all at the same radius, so their mutual distances would vary but not be zero.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, and not the mutual energies between the 12. In that case, the total energy is 5.539e-27 J.

But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 1.27 times higher than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 2e. Let me check: 2e is 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C. So (2e)^2 is (3.204e-19)^2 = 1.02657e-37 C². Correct.

So U per pair is (8.988e9) * (1.02657e-37) / (2 * 2) = 8.988e9 * 1.02657e-37 /4.

Wait, no! Wait, no, r is 2m, so the denominator is 2m.

Wait, no, in the formula for each pair with the central charge, r is 2m, so U per pair is (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m).

Wait, therefore, U per pair is (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2 * 2) ?

Wait, let me correct that: (2e)^2 is (2 * e)^2 = 4e². So (8.988e9) * 4e² / r.

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 C, so e² is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So 4e² is 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37 C².

So U per pair is (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) / (2) = 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = 9.23e-28, then divided by 2 gives 4.615e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 55.38e-28 = 5.538e-27 J.

So the calculation seems correct. But none of the options match this.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5.1 times larger than our calculated U_central. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units somewhere. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy, but the central charge is fixed, so perhaps the potential energy is only the sum of each surrounding charge's potential due to the central charge.

Wait, but that's what I calculated: 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the work done to bring the 12 charges into place, considering the potential due to the central charge and all the other surrounding charges.

But this is getting complicated, and without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to compute.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's potential, and not the mutual ones. So the answer is approximately 5.54e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again: option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 1.27 times our calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K's value.

Wait, perhaps I used k = 8.988e9, but sometimes it's written as 8.99e9. Let me check.

Wait, 8.988e9 is correct. Oh, wait! Wait, in the formula, U = k q1 q2 / r. So for each pair with the central charge, that's (2e)(2e)/(2m).

So U = (k * (2e)^2) / (2m) per pair.

Wait, 2e is 3.204e-19 C, so (2e)^2 is 1.02657e-37 C².

So each pair contributes (8.988e9) * (1.02657e-37) / (2) = 8.988e9 * 1.02657e-37 / 2.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 1.02657e-37 = 9.23e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.615e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12: 55.38e-28 = 5.538e-27 J.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the 12 surrounding charges as being the same as the central charge, so each pair between the central and surrounding is 12 pairs, and the mutual pairs are 66, but without knowing the distances, perhaps the problem is making a different assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the electric potential energy only between the central charge and the 12 others, which is 5.538e-27 J, but none of the options match exactly.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using k = 9e9 N·m²/C² as an approximation.

Let me recalculate with k = 9e9.

Each U would be (9e9) * (1.02657e-37) / 2 = 9e9 * 1.0
