Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember resonances in particle physics are particles that don't live very long—meaning they decay quickly. The problem gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance.

Wait, mean decay distance... Right, that's the average distance the particle travels before decaying. I think the formula for mean lifetime is related to the particle's width. Oh yeah, the mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the total decay width Γ. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, in particle physics, they often use units where ħ is set to 1 in certain contexts, but maybe I should look it up.

Wait, the mean proper lifetime τ (the lifetime in the rest frame) is given by τ = ħ / Γ. But I think in natural units where ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s, so I can use that. Because the width Γ is given in GeV, I can compute τ in seconds.

Once I have the lifetime, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Because the decay distance is velocity multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, the meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, and its mass is m_X=1.2 GeV. So I can find its velocity using relativistic equations.

Hmm, the energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c². So γ is E/(m c²), but since we're dealing with units where c=1 (as in GeV and mass in GeV/c²), maybe the calculations are easier.

Wait, let's think about the velocity. For a particle with energy E and mass m, the velocity β is approximately (E² - m² c⁴)^(1/2) / (E) * c, but wait, in natural units where c=1, it's (E² - m²)^(1/2)/(E). Alternatively, for high energies, β is approximately E/m, but only when E>>m. In this case, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E is much larger than m. So β is roughly (E)/m, so 8/1.2 = approx 6.6667, but wait, that can't be right because β can't exceed 1. Oh wait, no, that's not the right approach.

Wait, let's do it properly. The energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum by E² = p² c^4 + m² c^4. So p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/(c²), but since we're using natural units (c=1), it's p = sqrt(E² - m²). Then, the velocity β is p c / E, but again, with c=1, β = p / E. So substituting p, β = sqrt(E² - m²)/(E). Let me compute that.

So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E² is 64 (GeV)^2, m² is 1.44 (GeV)^2. So E² - m² is 62.56. The square root of that is sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV. Then, β = p/E = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875. So about 0.9888c. That's a high speed, which makes sense since E>>m.

So the velocity v is β c. Now, the mean decay distance is L = v * τ. But I need to be careful with units. Let's compute τ first.

Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. Using ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. Let me calculate that.

Dividing 6.582 by 0.32: 6.582 / 0.32 = approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds. That's 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. So 6.582 /0.32 = approx 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s?

Wait wait, no. Wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. So 6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the velocity v is β c. Since β is about 0.98875 and c is 3e8 m/s, v = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s. Let me compute that.

0.98875 *3e8 ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

So the decay length L is v * τ. So L = (2.96625e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s). Let's compute that.

Multiply 2.96625e8 by 2.056875e-24.

Wait, 2.96625 *2.056875 = let's compute that. Let's see:

2.96625 * 2 = 5.9325.

2.96625 * 0.056875≈ let me compute that.

0.056875 is 5.6875e-2. So 2.96625 * 5.6875e-2.

2.96625 * 0.05 = 0.1483125.

2.96625 * 0.006875 = 2.96625 * (11/1600) ? Hmm, maybe better to calculate 0.006875 = 1/144 ≈ 0.006944? Wait, perhaps I should just compute 2.96625 *0.056875.

Alternatively, 2.96625 * 0.056875 = let's compute step by step.

0.056875 = 56875e-7.

So 2.96625 *56875e-7 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 2.96625 *56.875e-3 = 2.96625 * (56.875 / 1000) = (2.96625 *56.875) /1000.

Compute 2.96625 * 56.875.

Hmm, 2 *56.875=113.75, 0.96625*56.875.

0.96625 * 56.875 = ?

Wait, 56.875 *0.96625.

Let me compute 56.875 *0.9 = 51.1875,

56.875 *0.06625 = 56.875 * (0.06 + 0.00625) = 56.875 *0.06 = 3.4125, 56.875 *0.00625 = 0.35546875.

So total 3.4125 + 0.35546875 = 3.76796875.

So total 51.1875 + 3.76796875 = 54.95546875.

So 2.96625 *56.875 = 113.75 + 54.95546875 = 168.70546875.

So 168.70546875 /1000 = 0.16870546875.

So the 0.056875 part is about 0.168705.

So the total 2.96625 *2.056875 ≈ 5.9325 + 0.168705 ≈ 6.101205.

Wait, wait, wait. No, I think I messed up the decimal points. Let me try another approach. Let's compute 2.96625 × 2.056875.

Break it down:

= (3 - 0.03375) × (2 + 0.056875)
= 3×2 + 3×0.056875 - 0.03375×2 - 0.03375×0.056875
= 6 + 0.170625 - 0.0675 - 0.0018984375
= 6 + 0.170625 = 6.170625
6.170625 - 0.0675 = 6.103125
6.103125 - 0.0018984375 ≈ 6.1012265625.

So approximately 6.10122656.

So 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.96625 *2.056875) * 1e8 *1e-24.

Which is 6.10122656 * 1e-16 m. So 6.10122656e-16 meters.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m
B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m
C)5.0223 *10^-15 m
D)4.0655*10^-16 m.

Hmm, none of the options are around 6e-16 m. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the velocity. Because when E is much greater than m, the velocity approaches c, but perhaps I should use a more accurate calculation for β.

Wait, let me recalculate β more accurately.

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

So E² =64, m²=1.44.

E² - m² =64 - 1.44 =62.56.

p = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV/c (since in natural units, p is in GeV/c). Then, β = p c / E. But since E is in GeV and p in GeV/c, let's see.

Wait, E = γ m c². So in terms of units, perhaps I should ensure the units are handled correctly.

Alternatively, β = (E² - m² c^4 )^(1/2) / (E c) * (c²) ?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of units.

E (energy) = γ m c².

p (momentum) = γ m v.

So, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2).

Then, p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2)/(c).

But in the earlier calculation, I used E in GeV, m in GeV/c², so perhaps I should recompute in terms of units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute β as (p c²) / (E c) )

Wait, let me think again.

β = v/c.

E = γ m c².

p = γ m v.

So, β = v/c = (p c)/(γ m c²) ) = (p c^2) / (E).

Wait, so β = (p c²) / E.

Hmm. Let me express this in terms of E and m.

p c² = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) * c².

Wait, perhaps I should compute p c².

Wait, substituting E and m:

E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV.

So, p c² = sqrt( (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 ) = sqrt(64 -1.44) GeV = sqrt(62.56) GeV = 7.91 GeV.

So, β = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 0.98875. So that's correct. So v ≈ 0.98875 c.

Wait, so that part is correct. So perhaps I made an error in calculating the lifetime τ.

Earlier, I said τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is the decay width. The relation between Γ and τ is τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is in GeV, so ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = 6.582e-25 s·GeV / Γ (in GeV) = 6.582e-25 / Γ GeV * s?

Wait, units: GeV is energy, so 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and hbar has units of GeV·s when using appropriate constants.

So, yes, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 /0.32 ) s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that's correct. So then, the velocity is 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = v * τ = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Let me compute 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

2.966 * 2.056875 = Let me compute that. 2.966 *2 = 5.932. 2.966 *0.056875 is approximately 0.1687.

So 5.932 + 0.1687 = 6.1007.

So 6.1007e-16 meters.

But none of the options are close to that. Wait, the options are A:5.0223e-16, D:4.0655e-16.

Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me recheck.

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

E² =64, m²=1.44.

E² - m² =62.56.

So p = sqrt(62.56) =7.91 GeV/c.

So beta = p c² / E.

Wait, wait, beta = (p c) / E.

Because beta = v/c, and v = (p c²)/(E) * c?

Wait, p c = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v.

So, beta = v/c = (p c) / (gamma m c^2) ) = (p c) / (E).

So, p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ).

So beta = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / E.

Wait, but since E is in GeV, and m c² is also in GeV, the units would cancel, so beta is dimensionless. So plugging the numbers:

sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2 )=sqrt(64-1.44)=sqrt(62.56)=7.91.

So beta =7.91 /8 = 0.98875. So that's correct.

So, v=0.98875 c.

So, 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96625e8 m/s.

So, then τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply v and τ: 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Which is (2.96625 *2.056875) *1e-16.

So 2.96625 *2.056875:

Let me compute more accurately.

2.96625 * 2 =5.9325.

2.96625 *0.056875.

Well, 0.056875 is 56875e-7.

Wait, 2.96625 * 0.056875.

Let me compute 2.96625 × 0.05=0.1483125.

2.96625 ×0.006875=?

0.006875 = 11/1600.

Wait, 2.96625 *0.006875 = 0.0203765625.

So total 0.1483125 + 0.0203765625=0.1686890625.

So total 5.9325 + 0.1686890625=6.1011890625.

So 6.1011890625e-16 meters.

Hmm, that's approximately 6.101e-16 m, but the options are around 4e-16 or 5e-15. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of τ.

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 /0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, what's the speed again? 0.98875 c is 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.966e8 *2.0568e-24 = 6.101e-16 meters.

Hmm, but none of the options is close to that. The options are 5.02e-16 (A), 4.06e-15 (B), 5.02e-15 (C), 4.06e-16 (D).

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the velocity. Let's re-express E and m correctly.

Wait, E is the energy of the meson, which is 8 GeV. Its rest mass is 1.2 GeV/c². So, using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2.

So, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, (p c) = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 ) = sqrt(64 -1.44) GeV² = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈7.91 GeV.

So, p = (7.91 GeV) / c.

Then, beta = (p c^2 ) / E.

Wait, no, beta is v/c = p c / E.

So p c is (7.91 GeV) * c, divided by E in GeV.

So beta = (7.91 GeV c) / (8 GeV) ) = (7.91/8) c ≈ 0.98875 c.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between the decay width and the lifetime again. Γ is the total decay width, and τ is the mean lifetime.

The formula is τ = ħ / Γ.

But sometimes, in particle physics, Γ is in units of MeV, and ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So when Γ is in GeV, I have to convert it.

Wait, Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 /0.32) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32=20.56875.

So τ =20.56875e-25 s=2.056875e-24 s.

That seems correct. So, the calculation of τ is right.

So, the only remaining possibility is that the velocity is correct, so why is my result not matching any options?

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere. Let me think. Wait, the decay length is L=β c τ.

Wait, another approach: L = β c τ.

Because beta is v/c, so v=beta c.

So L= v tau = beta c tau.

Which is beta c tau = (beta c) * tau.

So, beta is 0.98875, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.98875 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.

Let me compute that.

0.98875 *3e8 = 2.96625e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.96625e8 *2.056875e-24 = 6.10119e-16 meters.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps I have to consider that the decay width is given in MeV, so maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, the decay width is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So the calculation of τ is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that the energy E is the total energy, and the correct formula for the velocity is (E² - m² c^4 )^(1/2)/(E) c.

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, that's (E^2 -m^2 )^(1/2)/ E.

Wait, in natural units, beta is (sqrt(E^2 -m^2))/E.

Which in this case is sqrt(64 -1.44)/8 = sqrt(62.56)/8≈7.91/8≈0.98875.

So correct.

Hmm. So why is there a discrepancy between my calculation and the options?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of 2.96625e8 *2.056875e-24.

Wait, 2.96625e8 =2.96625 x 1e8.

2.056875e-24=2.056875 x 1e-24.

So 2.96625 *2.056875 = 6.10119.

And 1e8 *1e-24 =1e-16.

So 6.10119e-16 m.

Hmm. But looking at the options, A is 5.0223e-16 m, D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, let's compute beta again, but using exact numbers.

E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

E² -m² =64 - (1.44) =62.56.

So sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.

So beta =7.91 /8=0.98875.

So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 7.91 /8.

7.91 divided by 8 is 0.98875.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. My calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The mean decay length is given by L= (cτ) * β.

But wait, τ is the proper lifetime. So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma factor. Because the particle is moving, so time dilation occurs.

Ah! That's it. I think I missed that. Because the mean lifetime I calculated was the proper lifetime (tau), but in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau.

So the mean decay length is not just v * tau, but v * (gamma tau).

Because the lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma tau.

So that's a crucial mistake I made. So I need to compute gamma and multiply it by tau.

So, gamma is E/(m c²) in natural units where c=1. So gamma = E/m =8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... So gamma ≈6.6667.

So, lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau =6.6667 *2.056875e-24 s =approx 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, the decay length is v * gamma tau = (0.98875 c) * (gamma tau).

Wait, no, v is already beta c. So, L= beta c * gamma tau.

Alternatively, L= beta gamma c tau.

Because tau_lab = gamma tau.

So, L = beta c * tau_lab = beta c gamma tau.

So let me compute that.

beta =0.98875, gamma=6.6667.

beta gamma =0.98875 *6.6667≈6.6 (exactly, 6.6667 *0.98875).

Compute 6.6667 *0.98875.

6.6667 *0.98875.

6 *0.98875=5.9325.

0.6667 *0.98875≈0.660.

So total ≈6.5925.

So beta gamma ≈6.5925.

So, L= beta gamma c tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L=6.5925 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.5925 *3e8 =1.97775e9.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24.

1.97775e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.97775 *2.056875) e-15.

1.97775 *2.056875 ≈4.0655.

So, L≈4.0655e-15 meters.

Wait, that's option C:5.0223 *10^-15 m, no. Option B is4.0655e-15. No, option B is 4.0655e-15.

Wait, wait, no:

Wait, options:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C)5.0223 *10^-15 m

D)4.0655 *10^-16 m.

So, my calculation gives ≈4.0655e-15, which matches option B.

Wait, but wait, in the earlier step, I calculated beta gamma as 6.5925. Let me compute exactly:

beta =7.91 /8 =0.98875.

gamma =8 /1.2 =6.666666...

So, beta gamma=0.98875 *6.666666...= Let's compute 0.98875 *6.666666.

6.666666 *0.98875.

Compute:

6 *0.98875=5.9325.

0.666666 *0.98875=0.660 (approx).

Total 5.9325 +0.6591665=6.5916665.

So, beta gamma=6.5916665.

So, 6.5916665 *3e8 m/s =1.9775e9 m/s.

Then, multiply by tau =2.056875e-24 s.

So, 1.9775e9 *2.056875e-24 = 

Multiply 1.9775 *2.056875 = approx.

1.9775 *2=3.955.

1.9775 *0.056875= approx 0.1127.

So total 3.955 +0.1127=4.0677.

So, exact calculation gives 4.0677e-15 m.

Which matches option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Ah, so the mistake was not considering the gamma factor for time dilation. The mean decay length is not just v*tau, but v*(gamma tau). So the correct answer is B, which is approximately 4.0655e-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we start by analyzing the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and decay width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The mean decay distance \( L \) is related to the velocity \( v \) of the particle and its lifetime \( \tau \) in the lab frame, which accounts for time dilation.

### Step 1: Proper Lifetime (\( \tau \))
The proper lifetime of the particle is given by:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X},
\]
where \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) is the reduced Planck constant. Substituting \( \Gamma_X = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Velocity (\( \beta c \))
The velocity of the particle is determined using the relativistic relation:
\[
\beta = \frac{\sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2}}{E_X}.
\]
Substituting \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\beta = \frac{\sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{64 - 1.44}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{62.56}}{8} \approx \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875.
\]
Thus, the velocity is:
\[
v = \beta c = 0.98875 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.96625 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 3: Lab Frame Lifetime (\( \tau_{\text{lab}} \))
Due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is:
\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau,
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} \). Substituting \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]
Thus:
\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 4: Mean Decay Distance (\( L \))
The mean decay distance is:
\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}.
\]
Substituting \( v = 2.96625 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 2.96625 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{m}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
L \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \) is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
