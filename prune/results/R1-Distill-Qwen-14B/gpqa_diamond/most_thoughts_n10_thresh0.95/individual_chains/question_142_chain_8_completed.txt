Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. In this case, it's a mixed state because it's a convex combination of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability (since it's multiplied by 1/2).

Wait, so each of these terms is a projection operator. |0⟩⟨0| is like a projector onto the |0⟩ state, and similarly for |1⟩⟨1|. Adding them together and halving gives a state that's a statistical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with 50% probability. So this is a completely mixed state for a single qubit. 

Now, what does this mean geometrically? I think in the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are represented as points on the surface of a unit sphere, while mixed states are inside. For a single qubit, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize the state space. The density matrix of a pure state would correspond to a vector from the origin to a point on the sphere's surface. But for a mixed state, like this one, it's like an average point, maybe at the center.

Wait, the completely mixed state for a single qubit is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Right, so that would correspond to the density matrix I have here. And I remember that the Bloch vector for such a state is the origin because the state is maximally mixed. The Bloch vector r is given by (x,y,z), and if the state is completely mixed, r would be (0,0,0). So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which must be the right answer.

Let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. For the completely mixed state, ρ is (I)/2, which would mean r is zero because there's no contribution from the Pauli terms. So yeah, that makes sense. The Bloch vector would be all zeros, so the answer is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state where the qubit is in a statistical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability (50%). In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside. For a single qubit, the completely mixed state corresponds to the density matrix \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right)\), which is maximally mixed. 

The Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) for a density matrix is related to the Pauli matrices. For the completely mixed state, there is no contribution from the Pauli terms, so the Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this represents a pure state, not the mixed state in question.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.  

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). 

Answer: C
