Okay, so I've got this question about planets and transits. Hmm, let me think. So, the researchers want to observe the planet that's more likely to transit. Both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different, and their host stars have different masses but same radii. 

Wait, transiting probability depends on the planet's orbital distance and the size of the star. Oh right, the probability is higher if the planet's orbit is more likely to pass in front of the star from our point of view. The formula for transit probability is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a_planet. Wait, no, that's the impact parameter, maybe. Or is it the other way around? 

Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Oh, wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet)^2. Or is it just (R_star/a_planet), since it's the area blocked? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. 

The transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet/(M_star))^(1/3))) ). Wait, or is that part about the mass? Wait no, the transit probability isn't directly dependent on the planet's mass. I think the formula is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a_planet. But wait, that's the size of the area blocked, but the probability is the chance that the planet's orbit intersects our line of sight. 

Wait, I remember that the probability is roughly (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (some factor). Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis (a_planet) times something else. Oh, wait, another way to think about it: the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Wait, that's not exactly right. 

Alternatively, the transit probability (P) is given by R_star/(a_planet) * (some function). Oh, right! The transit probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (1 / (1 + (m_p / M_star)^(1/3)) ), but wait, that's part of the Doppler method for planet occurrence. No, wait, maybe the transit probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by sqrt(1 - (R_star/a_planet)^2) times something else? I'm getting a bit tangled here. 

Alternatively, another approach: the probability of a transit is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet)^2. Because the area where the planet can transit is a circle with radius R_star, and the area of the orbit is π a_planet². So the probability is roughly (R_star²) / (a_planet²) * (something else). Wait, no, that's the area blocked divided by the area of the orbit. But the actual probability depends on the size of the star relative to the orbital distance. Because for a random orientation, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (1/(1 + ... ))? 

Wait, I think the correct formula for the probability of a transit is (R_star / a_planet) * (some factor). From what I remember, the transit probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), then it's just R_star/(a_planet). Wait, no, that can't be right because if the orbit is perfectly edge-on, the probability isn't just R_star/a_planet. Hmm. 

I think the correct formula is (R_star + R_planet) / (a_planet * (1 + cos i)), but this might be getting too detailed. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is simply proportional to (R_star / a_planet). Because if the orbital distance is larger, the chance of transiting is lower. 

Wait, another approach. The transit probability for a given planet is given by P = (R_star + R_planet) / (a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (m_p/(3 M_star))^(1/3)) ) )? Or is that for the Doppler method instead of transits? I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the semi-major axis. Since both planets have different orbital periods, and using Kepler's third law, a depends on the mass of the star and the period. 

Wait, Kepler's third law states that (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_star + m_p))/(4π²). But since m_p is much smaller than M_star, it's approximately (a^3)/(P^2) = G M_star/(4 π²). So a is proportional to (M_star * P²)^(1/3). 

In the problem, Planet_1 has a period P1, Planet_2 has P2 = 3 P1. The mass of Planet_1's star is M1=2 M2. So for Planet_1:

a1^3 / (P1^2) = G (2 M2) / (4 pi² )

For Planet_2:

a2^3 / (P2^2) = G M2 / (4 pi² )

Since P2 = 3 P1,

a1^3 = (G (2 M2) P1^2 ) / (4 pi² )

a2^3 = ( G M2 (3 P1)^2 ) / (4 pi² ) = ( G M2 9 P1² ) / (4 pi² )

So, take the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = [ 2 M2 * P1² ] / [9 M2 P1² ] = 2/9. 

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3, so a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute that. 

(2/9) is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.6, because 0.6^3 is 0.216. So a1 is about 0.6 a2. 

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately. 2/9 is (2)/(9) = ~0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.603, so a1 = a2 * 0.603. 

So a2 is larger than a1. Now, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet). Because the closer the planet is to the star (smaller a), the higher the probability of transit. Wait, no, higher a would mean lower probability because the planet's orbit is larger, so the chance of crossing our line of sight is smaller. 

Wait, transit probability is higher for planets with smaller semi-major axes because the star appears larger relative to the planet's orbit. So higher (R_star / a) ratio. 

So for each planet, compute (R_star / a_planet). 

But both stars have the same radius, R. So R_star for both is same, R. So the transit probability for each is proportional to (1/a_planet). Because R is same for both. 

Wait, that's a key point. So P1's transit probability is proportional to (1/a1), and P2's is proportional to (1/a2). 

From earlier, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.603. 

So a1 is smaller than a2. So 1/a1 is larger than 1/a2. So P1 has a higher transit probability. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher chance. 

Wait, but why? Because a1 is smaller, so (R_star / a_planet) is larger, so higher probability. 

So now, we have to compute the ratio of (R/a) for each. 

R is same for both stars. So (R/a) for Planet_1 is (1/a1), and for Planet_2 it's (1/a2). 

But since a1 = a2 * 0.603, so a1 is 0.603 a2. So, (R/a1) = (1)/(0.603 a2) = (1.657)/(a2). 

(R/a2) is 1/a2. 

So the ratio of (R/a1) to (R/a2) is (1.657 a2)/(a2) = 1.657. 

So Planet_1's transit probability is approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's. 

Wait, but wait, transit probability is proportional to (R/a) multiplied by something else? Because I thought it's (R/a) squared. Or is it (R/a), because it's the fraction of the orbit that's in the plane of the star. 

Wait, perhaps another formula: the transit probability (P) is given by P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_star/a_planet)^2 )) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've read that the probability is approximately (R_star / a_planet). Because when the orbital plane is edge-on, the planet will transit. The probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can transit (a circle of radius R_star) to the area of the orbit (a circle of radius a_planet). So the probability is (pi R_star^2) / (pi a_planet^2) ) = (R_star/a_planet)^2. 

Wait, that makes sense. Because the planet has to pass through the star for a transit. The area where that can happen is a circle of radius R_star around the star. The total area of the orbit is a circle of radius a_planet. The probability is the ratio of these areas, so (R_star / a_planet)^2. 

So if that's the case, then the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet)^2. 

But in our case, both stars have the same radius, R. So P1's probability is (R/a1)^2 and P2's is (R/a2)^2. 

So the ratio of probabilities is ( (R/a1)^2 ) / ( (R/a2)^2 ) ) = (a2^2)/(a1^2) ). 

Because a1 = 0.603 a2, so a2/a1 = 1/0.603 ≈ 1.657. 

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.657)^2 ≈ 2.75. 

So the ratio of probabilities is P1/P2 = 2.75. So P1 is about 2.75 times more probable to transit than P2. 

Wait, that's a bigger difference. So which planet has higher transit probability? 

Wait, that can't be right because earlier conclusion said higher a means lower probability. Wait, no, because if a is larger, (R/a) is smaller, so (R/a)^2 is smaller. 

Wait, let me get this right. If a is larger, the transit probability is lower. So for P1, a is smaller, so (R/a1)^2 is larger, so higher probability. 

So, per the squared formula, the probability for P1 is (R/a1)^2, and for P2, (R/a2)^2. 

Since a1 is 0.603 a2, the ratio (R/a1)/(R/a2) = a2/(a1) ≈ 1.657. So (R/a1)^2/(R/a2)^2 = (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.657)^2 ≈ 2.75. 

So P1's probability is 2.75 times higher than P2's. 

But wait, the options don't have that. Let me look at the options. 

Options: 

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher.

So according to this, the ratio is about 2.7, so Planet_1 is preferred by a factor of ~2.7. That's option D. 

Wait, but earlier I thought the transit probability was (R/a), not (R/a)^2. So which is it? Because that changes the ratio. 

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_star / a_planet) times some function. Let me think again. 

The transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits. The formula is given by: 

P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_star/(a_planet))^2 )) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, another source says the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / (a_planet) ) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_star/a_planet)^2 + ... )) ), but perhaps that's more complicated. 

Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. So, the star's diameter is 2 R, and the planet's orbit diameter is 2 a_planet. So the transit probability is (2 R)/(2 a_planet) ) = R / a_planet. But wait, that's the same as (R/a_planet). 

Hmm, so that would make it proportional to (R/a_planet), not squared. So then in this case, the ratio of the probabilities is (a2/a1) ≈1.657. So P1 has 1.657 times higher probability. 

But wait, in that case, the probability is (R/a), not (R/a)^2. So which is correct? 

I think I need to clarify. The transit probability is given by P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (m_p/(3 M_star))^(1/3)) ), but that's for occurrence rates, not detection probability. Alternatively, for detection, the probability is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (sqrt(1 - (R_star / a_planet)^2) ) ) / (something). Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the correct formula. 

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is given by (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (some factor based on the inclination). I think the correct formula is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (R_star / a_planet) )) ). Wait, no, that might not be right. 

Alternatively, in the case of a circular orbit, the probability is (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + sqrt(1 - (R_star/a_planet)^2 )) )) ) or something similar. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. 

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is the ratio of the star's angular radius as seen from Earth to the planet's orbital angular radius. The angular radius is R_star / a_planet. So the transit happens when the planet's position is within this angle. So the probability is (R_star / a_planet) * (something else). 

Alternatively, it's just R_star / a_planet. Because if the planet's orbit is such that the angle is larger than the star's apparent size, then the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a_planet. 

So, if that's the case, the probability is (R/a). 

Given that, in this problem, both stars have same R. So for each planet, P is proportional to (1/a). 

Now, a1 is 0.603 a2, so 1/a1 is 1.657/a2. So P1 is 1.657 times higher than P2. 

So the transit probability for P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1, as it has a higher probability. 

Looking at the options: 

Option C is Planet_1 preferred due to ~1.65 times higher. 

Option D is 2.7 times higher. 

So if the formula is (R/a), then it's option C. If it's (R/a)^2, then it's option D. 

But which formula is correct? 

Wait, I think the correct transit probability for a circular orbit, assuming random orientation, is roughly (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_star/a_planet)^2 )) ). Wait, because the planet's orbit is a circle, and the transit happens when the planet's position is within the star's disk. The cross-section is π R_star², and the area of the orbit is π a_planet². So the probability is (R_star/a_planet)^2. 

Wait, no, that's the case if the planet's position is anywhere within the star's disk. But in reality, the planet's orbit is a circle, and the transit only occurs when the planet is crossing the line of sight. So the cross-sectional area for a transit is the area of the star projected onto the planet's orbit. 

Wait, the probability that the planet transits is equal to the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. So (2 R_star) / (2 a_planet) ) = R_star / a_planet. 

Wait, that's just the ratio, not squared. So in that case, the probability is (R_star / a_planet). 

So, if that's the case, then the transit probability is proportional to (R/a). 

So, in our problem, since R is same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a. So Planet_1 has a1 = 0.603 a2. So the ratio P1/P2 is a2/(a1) = 1.657. 

So, P1's probability is about 1.65 times higher than P2's. 

So the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. 

But wait, another thought: the orbital period and the star's mass affect a_planet. Oh, but we already accounted for that in the a calculation. 

So, the conclusion is that Planet_1 is preferred because its transit probability is higher by a factor of approximately 1.65. 

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given parameters. The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a_{\text{planet}} \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius, the probability depends inversely on \( a_{\text{planet}} \).

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} P^2 \), we calculate the semi-major axes of the two planets. For Planet_1, the host star's mass is \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), and its orbital period is \( P_1 \). For Planet_2, the host star's mass is \( M_2 \), and its orbital period is \( P_2 = 3P_1 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2M_2 P_1^2}{M_2 (3P_1)^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.603.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.603a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2.

The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a_{\text{planet}} \), so the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.603} \approx 1.657.
\]

This indicates that Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
