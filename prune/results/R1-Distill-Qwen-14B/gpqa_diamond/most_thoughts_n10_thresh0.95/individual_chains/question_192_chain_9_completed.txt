Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the setup is a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the problem describes an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity of radius r. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and s is less than R because r is smaller. Now, they place a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor, which is at a distance L from the conductor's center. Additionally, the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s is θ. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is well outside.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and charges. When a conductor is neutral and you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's inner and outer surfaces respond. But wait, the conductor was uncharged initially. So when we put +q inside the cavity, it's like an induced charge situation.

Let me recall: charges in a conductor rearrange. Since the conductor was neutral, the inner surface of the cavity must have an induced charge -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, the inner surface gets -q, and to balance that, the outer surface has +q. So the net charge of the conductor is zero, but the inner and outer have induced charges.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface should be a uniformly distributed charge. Because any external charge distribution on a conducting sphere is spherically symmetric. So the outer surface has +q, and the inner surface has -q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field there is due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. Because, for points outside a conducting shell, the field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the field at P should be the same as if the +q were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the charge on the outer surface is +q, so the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Wait, but what about the position of the cavity? The cavity's center is shifted by s from the conductor's center, and the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center. Also, the angle θ is between l and s. Could this affect the calculation?

Wait, but when we consider the electric field outside the conductor, the conductor's charges arrange themselves on the outer surface as if the charge were at the center. So any asymmetry inside the conductor (like the cavity being off-center) doesn't affect the outer field. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface is symmetric, so the field outside depends only on the total charge of the outer surface, which is +q.

So the position of the cavity and the point P's position relative to the cavity's center (like the angle) shouldn't matter for the field outside. Because the conductor's outer shell is symmetric, the field at P is as if the +q were at the center of the conductor.

So the E at P should be (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, let me double-check. The inner induced charge is -q, but that's inside the conductor. For points outside the conductor, the field is due to the outer charge +q. So the field depends only on the outer charge and the distance from the conductor's center.

So the correct answer should be option B. The other options seem to involve the cavity's geometry, but for points outside the conductor, those shouldn't matter. So I think the answer is B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is offset by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor, where $s < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The point $P$ is also at a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$. Both $l$ and $L$ are greater than $R$, ensuring that $P$ is outside the conductor.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the cavity induces a charge of $-q$, and the outer surface of the conductor induces a charge of $+q$ to maintain the conductor's neutrality. For points outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, as the field inside the conductor cancels out due to symmetry. The outer surface of the conductor behaves as if all its charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor, making the electric field at $P$ dependent only on the total charge of the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

The geometry of the cavity and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the field at $P$ because the outer surface of the conductor is symmetric. Thus, the electric field at $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
