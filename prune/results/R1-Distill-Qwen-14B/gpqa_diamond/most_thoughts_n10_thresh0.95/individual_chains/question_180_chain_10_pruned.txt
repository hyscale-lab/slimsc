--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question asks for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, so I remember that the potential energy in a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since the system is isolated, I don't think we have to worry about external fields, just the interactions between the charges themselves.

Wait, each particle has a charge of 2e. Since e is the elementary charge, that's 2 times 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C. But how does that affect the potential energy?

The system has 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So I'm picturing point P with a fixed charge, and the other 12 arranged in a sphere around it, each at a radius of 2m.

Wait, but in terms of potential energy, I think we need to consider the interactions between all pairs of charges. Because each charge contributes to the potential energy of the others.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed. So when calculating the potential energy, the 13th charge's position is fixed, so perhaps the only work we need to do is bring the 12 charges from infinity to their positions around it. Because the 13th is fixed, we don't have to account for bringing it there because it's already in place.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait. Since the 12 charges are constrained at 2m from P, but how are they arranged? Are they all on the same point? Or are they arranged in a way that each is 2m away but not all at the same location? Hmm, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps they are all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m around P. But how many points on the sphere? 12 points, so maybe arranged in a way that each is equally spaced, like vertices of an icosahedron or something. But for potential energy, the exact positions might matter for the pairwise distances between the 12 charges. Wait, but the problem says each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but nothing about their distances from each other. So perhaps we're supposed to assume that all the 12 are equidistant from each other? Or maybe the problem is simplified where the 12 are all at the same point, but that seems unlikely because if they are all at the same point, their mutual repulsion would be huge, but maybe they are placed in a way that doesn't affect each other's distances. Hmm, but perhaps the problem is only considering the potential due to the fixed charge, and not the interactions among the 12 charges. Because if the 12 charges are in fixed positions, maybe their mutual interactions are considered negligible or maybe the problem is only considering the energy from each of them being placed around the fixed charge.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the potential energy of a system of charges includes all pairwise interactions. So if the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P, but perhaps in a configuration where each is equally spaced, but I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is assuming all the 12 charges are at the same point, but that would cause them to all be at zero distance from each other, which would lead to infinite potential energy. That can't be right. So perhaps the problem is only considering the energy due to each of the 12 charges interacting with the fixed charge at P, and not considering their interactions with each other. But wait, that might not be correct because the problem is about the minimum energy, which would imply considering all possible interactions.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the fixed charge at P, and the 12 charges around it. Each of the 12 is at 2m from P. So for each of them, the potential energy due to the fixed charge is U_i = (k * q_fixed * q_i) / r, where r is 2 m.

But since all 12 charges are identical, each has charge 2e. So the fixed charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is also 2e.

Wait, but the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. So each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2) ) per charge?

Wait, no. Wait, the fixed charge is at P, which is 2e. Each of the 12 charges is 2e. So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy due to the fixed charge is U_i = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m). That would be the energy per charge. Since there are 12 such charges, the total for this part is 12 * U_i.

But wait, wait. No, that's not correct. Because when you bring a charge from infinity to a point where another charge is present, the work done is the charge times the potential at that point due to the other charge. So for each of the 12 charges, as they are placed at 2m, the potential at that point due to the fixed charge at P is V = (k * 2e) / (2 m).

So the work done (which is the potential energy) for each of the 12 charges is (2e) * V = (2e) * (k * 2e) / (2 m).

So each contributes (2e) * (k * 2e)/(2m) = (k * (2e)^2) / (2m) ) * 12 charges.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this step by step.

First, calculate the potential at point P due to the fixed charge. Wait, no. The fixed charge is at P, so each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P. So when I bring each charge to that position, the potential at that position due to the fixed charge is V = k * (2e) / (2) because the fixed charge is 2e and the distance is 2 meters.

So for each charge, the potential energy added is q * V. So q is 2e, and V is (k * 2e) / 2.

So each charge contributes (2e) * (k * 2e)/(2) = (k * (2e)^2) / 2.

Wait, but wait, the fixed charge is 2e. So when you bring the first charge to 2m, you're doing work against the electric field created by the fixed charge. But when you bring the second charge, does the first charge contribute to the potential at the second charge's position? Because each charge creates a field. But since the problem is about the minimum energy, maybe we're only considering the potential due to the fixed charge, and not the mutual interactions between the 12 charges.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the total potential energy U would be the sum of each charge's contribution, which is 12 times (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). Let me compute that.

Wait, but wait, (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) is the U for each charge. So 12 times that would be U1 = 12 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)] = 12 * [ (k *4e²) / (2*2) ) ]? Wait, no, the denominator is 2m, so maybe I should write it as:

Each charge contributes (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) ) = (k*(4e²))/(2m) = (2 k e²)/(m).

Wait, no. Wait, (2e) is the charge, and it's at a distance of 2 meters. So each charge's interaction with the fixed charge contributes U = (k * 2e * 2e) / (2 m) = (k *4e²)/(2m) = (2 k e²)/m.

So 12 such charges would contribute 12 * (2 k e²)/m = (24 k e²)/m.

But then, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Since each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, but how far are they from each other? If they are all on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m, perhaps their mutual distances are greater than 2m, making their potential energy contributions smaller. But calculating all their mutual interactions would be complicated, as each pair contributes a term. Since the problem is about the minimum energy, perhaps the configuration that gives the minimum energy is when the mutual repulsion is as small as possible.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the interactions between the 12 charges, considering that the problem statement says they are "constrained to stay" at 2m. So maybe the mutual potential is not being considered, and only the potential from the fixed charge is considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would cause their mutual potential energy to be very high. So that doesn't seem right.

But let's proceed under the assumption that the problem is only considering the potential due to the fixed charge. So the total potential energy U is 12 * [ (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 m) ].

Alternatively, perhaps the fixed charge is 2e, and each of the 12 has 2e, so the potential each contributes is (2e) times the potential at their position due to the fixed charge.

So, V at 2m from fixed charge = k*(2e)/(2) = k e.

Each charge's potential energy is q * V = (2e) * (k e) = 2 k e².

So 12 charges: 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, that makes sense.

Wait, let me compute the numeric value.

First, k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

e is the elementary charge, 1.602 x 10^-19 C.

So substituting the values:

U = 24 * k * e².

Wait, so U = 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

Then, k * e² = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's calculate that.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 10^-38.

Multiply them: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's see, 9 * 2.566 is around 23.094, but since 8.988 is about 0.988 of 9, 23.094 * 0.988 ≈ 22.848. So 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 ≈ 22.848e-29 = 2.2848e-28 J.

Now multiply by 24: 24 *2.2848e-28 = 54.835e-28 = 5.4835e-27 J.

Wait, but none of the options match that. Let's check the options again.

Options are:

A) 5.645 x10^-26

B) 2.822 x10^-26

C) 7.056 x10^-27

D) 122.330

Wait, so 5.48e-27 J is close to option C, which is 7.056e-27. Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents somewhere. Let me recheck the calculation.

Let me recalculate e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C². That's correct.

k * e²: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) *1e9 *1e-38 = let's compute 8.988 *2.566.

Let me compute 8 *2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 *2.566 ≈ approx 2.530.

So total is 20.528 +2.530 = 23.058.

So 23.058e-29 = 2.3058e-28 J.

Wait, wait, because 1e9 *1e-38 = 1e-29. So 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = 23.058e-29 J.

So 23.058e-29 = 2.3058e-28 J.

Then, multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3058e-28.

24 *2.3058 is approx 55.34.

So 55.34e-28 J = 5.534e-27 J.

Wait, but option C is 7.056e-27. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I forgot that each of the 12 charges contributes energy, but the fixed charge also contributes when the others are placed. Wait, no, because the fixed charge is already there, so when we bring the first charge, the potential energy is (2e) * V(P), where V(P) is the potential due to the fixed charge.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum over all pairs. So in this case, the system consists of 13 charges: one fixed, and 12 others.

Each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge, and each of the 12 charges interacts with each other.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 and the fixed charge, plus the sum of the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges.

So, U = U_fixed_12 + U_12_pairs.

So, U_fixed_12 is the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 and the fixed charge.

Each such contribution is (k * q1 * q2) / r.

q1 = 2e, q2 = 2e, r = 2 m.

So each pair (fixed and a charge) contributes (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2).

There are 12 such pairs, so U_fixed_12 = 12 * (k *4e²)/(2) = 12 * (2 k e²) ) = 24 k e².

Now, the U_12_pairs is the sum of all pairs among the 12 charges. So there are C(12,2) = 66 pairs.

Each pair contributes (k * (2e)^2 ) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between two of the 12 charges.

But the problem is that we don't know the distances between the 12 charges. If they are arranged in a way that each is on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two charges depends on the angle between them. For a uniform distribution, the average distance would be something, but it's complicated to calculate, and the problem doesn't specify. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the U_12_pairs, or perhaps to assume that all 12 charges are at the same point, which would make r_ij = 0, which is impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the U_fixed_12 term.

But if that's the case, then our U would be 24 k e².

Wait, but earlier calculation gave us 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let me recalculate that accurately.

Compute e^2: (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

So, k * e^2 = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let me compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

First multiply the coefficients: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's calculate that.

8 * 2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's compute 2.566 * 1 = 2.566, so 0.988 is 2.566 - (0.012 *2.566) ≈ 2.566 - 0.030792 ≈ 2.5352.

So total is 20.528 + 2.5352 = approx 23.0632.

So 23.0632e9 * e-38 = 23.0632e-29 = 2.30632e-28 J.

Now, multiply by 24: 24 * 2.30632e-28 = let's compute 24 *2.30632.

24 * 2 =48.

24 * 0.30632 =7.35168.

Total:48+7.35168=55.35168.

So 55.35168e-28 =5.535168e-27 J.

Hmm, that's approximately 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is larger than this. So that suggests that perhaps this approach is missing something.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the potential energy between the 12 charges as well. Because if the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are the same, perhaps in a regular dodecagon or something, then each pair contributes a certain amount.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to calculate. However, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would make their mutual distance zero, leading to infinite potential energy, which is impossible. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at the same distance from each other as from the fixed charge. For example, all 12 charges are placed on a sphere of radius 2m, and each is at equal angles from each other. So, for a regular icosahedron, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem neglects the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, considering that each is at 2m from the fixed charge and the mutual distances are much larger, but no, 2m is the distance from the fixed charge, but for 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2m, their mutual distance would be something like 2m * sqrt(2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the minimum is achieved when the mutual potential energies are as small as possible. That would be when the charges are as far apart as possible. But given that they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m, each as far apart as possible, but without knowing their exact positions, it's impossible to calculate their mutual potential.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the fixed charge and the 12 charges, and not their mutual interactions.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "the 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So maybe the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but their mutual distances are not specified. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore their mutual potential, and only consider the potential between each and the fixed charge.

In that case, the total potential energy would be U = 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m) ) = 12 * (4 k e²)/(2 m) ) = 12 * (2 k e²/m) ) = 24 k e² / m.

Wait, no, because m is the distance, which is 2 m. So 24 k e² / (2 m) would be 12 k e² / m. Wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters, so 24 * (k *4e²)/(2 * 2) is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as U = sum over all pairs. Each pair consists of the fixed charge and one of the 12 charges. So each contributes (k q1 q2)/(r) = (k * 2e * 2e)/(2 m) = (k *4e²)/(2 m) = 2 k e²/m.

So 12 charges contribute 12 * 2 k e²/m = 24 k e²/m.

Wait, but m is given as 2 meters.

Wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters, not m. So r is 2 meters.

So the expression is (k *4e²) / (2) ) per charge.

So per charge, that's (4e² k) / 2 = 2 e² k.

So 12 charges: 12 * 2 e² k =24 e² k.

Wait, but wait, the formula is U = (k q1 q2) / r.

So each pair (fixed and a charge) contributes (k * 2e * 2e) / 2 m.

So each is (4e² k) / (2 m) = 2 e² k / m.

Wait, but m is 2, so 2 e² k /2 = e² k.

So each contributes e² k. 12 charges: 12 * e² k.

Ah, that's a different approach. Let me compute that.

So U_fixed_12 = 12 * (k (2e)^2) / (2 m) )

= 12 * (4 e² k) / (2 * 2) )

Wait, no, r is 2 m. So the denominator is 2.

So 12 * (4 e² k)/(2) ) = 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

Wait, 4/2 is 2, so 12 *2 e² k =24 e² k.

So U =24 e² k.

Now, let's compute that.

k =8.988e9 N m²/C².

e=1.602e-19 C.

e²= 2.566e-38 C².

So 24 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38).

Compute 24 *8.988e9 = let's compute 24 *8.988 = 215.712. So 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = (2.15712 *2.566) e (11 -38) = approx 5.537e-27 J.

That's about 5.537e-27 J.

Hmm, but looking back at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 and option B is 2.822e-26.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the charges are 2e each so each contributes (2e) twice, so perhaps I'm correct, but maybe I made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Wait, let's compute each step numerically:

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

First, 24 *8.988e9 = ?

24 *8.988 = let's compute:

24 *8 = 192.

24 *0.988 =23.712.

Total=192 +23.712=215.712.

So 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Now, multiply by 2.566e-38.

2.15712e11 *2.566e-38 = ?

2.15712 *2.566 ≈ let's compute:

2 *2.566=5.132.

0.15712 *2.566≈0.15712 *2=0.31424, 0.15712 *0.566≈0.08937. So total ≈0.4036.

Total ≈5.132 +0.4036=5.5356.

So 5.5356e(11-38) =5.5356e-27 J.

So U=5.5356e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher than my calculation. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, the problem says each charge is 2e. Did I correctly account for that in the charge terms?

Yes, because in the formula, I used (2e)^2, which is 4e².

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the potential energy between all pairs, including the 12 charges. So perhaps I should not have ignored the U_12_pairs.

But without knowing the exact configuration, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential is zero, which isn't possible, but perhaps it's intended to ignore that part.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents.

Wait, perhaps e is 1.602e-19 C, so e² is (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38 C². Correct.

k is 8.988e9 N m²/C².

So 24 * k * e² =24 *8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 first.

8.988e9 =8.988 *1e9.

2.566e-38 =2.566 *1e-38.

Multiply the coefficients:8.988 *2.566.

Let me compute this accurately:

8 * 2.566 =20.528.

0.988 *2.566: let's compute 2.566 *0.988.

2.566 * 0.988 = ?

Let me compute 2.566 * 0.988.

2.566 * 0.9 =2.3094.

2.566 *0.08=0.20528.

2.566 *0.008=0.020528.

Adding: 2.3094 +0.20528 =2.51468 +0.020528=2.535208.

So total 8.988 *2.566 =20.528 +2.535208=23.063208.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 =23.063208e-29 =2.3063208e-28 J.

Multiply by 24:24 *2.3063208e-28 =55.35170e-28 =5.53517e-27 J.

So that's approximately 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C, which is 7.056e-27. Hmm, not matching. Another thought: perhaps the problem expects the energy to be in a different unit or a miscalculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 13th charge is being considered in the potential energy calculation, but I'm not sure how. The 13th charge is fixed, so bringing it to P doesn't require any work, as it's already there.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the 12 charges are placed symmetrically, so each contributes to the potential of the others. For instance, each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential of the others, but since they are all identical and equally spaced, perhaps their mutual potential can be calculated as a single term.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mutual potential and only consider the fixed charge's contribution. In that case, the energy would be 5.535e-27 J. But none of the options match that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is approximately 5.535e-27 * 1.274. So perhaps I missed a factor of about 1.275. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should have 12 * (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 m) ) = 12 * (4e² k)/(2 m) ).

Wait, perhaps I should write all the steps again.

Each of the 12 charges has charge 2e, fixed charge is 2e.

Each of their contributions is (k * 2e * 2e) / (2 m) = (4e² k)/(2 m) ) = (2 e² k)/m.

Since m=2, it becomes (2 e² k)/2 = e² k.

So each of the 12 charges contributes e² k.

So total is 12 * e² k.

So 12 * e² * k.

With e=1.602e-19 C, e²=2.566e-38 C².

k=8.988e9 N m²/C².

So U=12 * (2.566e-38) * (8.988e9).

Compute 12 *8.988e9 = 12 *8.988e9 = 107.856e9 =1.07856e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 1.07856e11 *2.566e-38 = (1.07856 *2.566) e (11-38) = approx 2.767e-27 J.

Wait, 1.07856 *2.566 is approx 2.767.

So U=2.767e-27 J.

But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) *1e-29 = 23.063e-29 =2.3063e-28 J.

Then, 12 * 2.3063e-28 = 27.6756e-28 =2.76756e-27 J.

Wait, that's about 2.767e-27 J, which is option B: 2.822e-26? No, 2.767e-27 is 0.2767e-26. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about ten times larger. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 again.

8.988e9 =8.988 *1e9.

2.566e-38=2.566 *1e-38.

Multiply:8.988 *2.566 =23.063.

Exponents: 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29.

So 23.063e-29 =2.3063e-28 J.

Then, 12 *2.3063e-28 = 27.6756e-28=2.76756e-27 J.

Which is 2.767e-27 J.

But none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the fixed charge is part of the system, so when bringing in each charge, the potential energy also includes the charge's own contribution.

Wait, wait, another approach: the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done in assembling the system. Each charge is brought from infinity to its position, and the work done is the charge multiplied by the potential at that position due to all the other charges already present.

So for the 13th charge, it's fixed. So we bring the first of the 12 charges to 2m from P.

The potential at that point due to the fixed charge is V1 = k*(2e)/2 = k e.

So the work done (potential energy) for the first charge is (2e) * V1 = 2e * k e = 2 k e².

Now, when bringing the second charge, the potential at its position is V2 = k*(2e)/(2) (due to fixed charge) + k*(2e)/(r), where r is the distance between charge 1 and charge 2.

But without knowing r, it's hard to proceed. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions, considering only the fixed charge's contribution.

So the total potential energy would be 12 * (2 k e²) ) =24 k e².

Which, as previously calculated, is about 5.535e-27 J.

But again, this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Because in the pairwise potential energy, each pair is counted once, but maybe I'm double-counting? Or perhaps in the formula, it's (1/2) sum k q_i q_j / r_ij.

Wait, no, that's for the total potential energy of the system when considering all pairs. But since in this case, the fixed charge is one of them, perhaps the formula remains the same.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the system as having 13 charges, each with charge 2e. But the fixed charge is not being moved, so the work done is only in bringing the 12 charges into place, each contributing (2e) * V, where V is the potential at their position due to the fixed charge and any previously placed charges.

In this case, the first charge is brought in with potential V1 = k*(2e)/(2) =k e.

Work done: 2e *k e =2 k e².

The second charge is brought in, and the potential at its position is V2 =k*(2e)/(2) + k*(2e)/r_12, where r_12 is the distance from the first charge.

Without knowing r_12, it's impossible to compute. But perhaps the problem is intended to ignore these mutual terms, considering that they are negligible compared to the fixed charge's contribution.

If we do that, the total potential energy is 12 *2 k e² =24 k e².

Which gives U≈5.535e-27 J.

But the options don't have this value. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B) 2.822e-26 J.

That's about 2.8e-26, which is ten times larger than 2.76e-27.

So maybe I made a mistake in the exponent, perhaps missing a factor of 10.

Wait, wait, let's recheck the calculation:

k =8.988e9 N m²/C².

e=1.602e-19 C.

e²= (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38 C².

So 24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Let me compute this step by step.

Compute 24 *8.988e9: 24 *8.988e9 = 24 *8.988 *1e9.

24 *8.988= 24*(8 +0.988)=24*8=192 +24*0.988=23.712. Total=215.712.

So 215.712e9 =2.15712e11.

Now, 2.15712e11 *2.566e-38 = (2.15712 * 2.566) *1e(11-38) = approx 5.536e-27 J.

So that's correct. Wait, but option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times larger than this. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or something, leading to a specific mutual distance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, but the mutual distance between any two is 2m as well, which would make the configuration impossible, but perhaps the problem assumes that.

Wait, if each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P and also 2m from each other, then the system would form a regular icosahedron. But that's not possible in 3D space with 12 points all equidistant from each other. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider each of the 12 charges to be at a distance of 2m from P and each other, but that's not feasible. So perhaps the mutual potential is not considered, and the only contribution is from the fixed charge.

In that case, the potential energy is 5.535e-27 J. But none of the options match that. So perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at 2m from P, but in such a way that the mutual potential energy is zero. For example, if the charges are arranged symmetrically, perhaps their mutual field cancels out. But that's only possible if the number of charges is even and arranged in a certain way, like opposite charges, but all are identical, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is being considered, but since all the charges are identical, the potential between any two would be repulsive, and the total would add up.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the fixed charge's contribution to the potential energy.

But then, why the options don't include 5.5e-27 J?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge. The problem says each charge is 2e, but perhaps I should have used e instead of 2e. Let me check.

No, the problem says each charge is 2e. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is looking for the potential energy in a different way, such as when the charges are placed on a sphere of radius 2m, and the mutual potential is calculated based on that arrangement.

In that case, the mutual potential energy would be the sum for all pairs.

But without knowing the exact mutual distances, perhaps the problem is intended to compute the potential energy due to the fixed charge only.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the fixed charge, each contributing (k *2e *2e)/2, but I think that's what I did earlier.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the work done to bring each charge is (k *2e *2e)/(2 m), and since there are 12 charges, the total is 12 * (k *4e²)/(2 m) )=12 * (2 k e²/m ).

Wait, but m is 2, so 12 * (2 k e² / 2 )=12 *k e².

So U=12 k e².

So compute 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, 12 *8.988e9 =107.856e9=1.07856e11.

1.602e-19 squared is 2.566e-38.

So 1.07856e11 *2.566e-38= (1.07856 *2.566)= approx 2.767e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.767e-27 J, which is close to option C, but not exactly.

Wait, but option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 12 * (k *4e²)/(2 *2) ), because the denominator is 2 m (2 meters).

Wait, no, that would be 12 * (4e² k) / (2 *2) )=12 * (4e² k)/4=12 e² k.

So U=12 e² k.

Which is 12 * e² * k.

e² is (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 C².

k=8.988e9 N m²/C².

So 12 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 12 *8.988e9=107.856e9=1.07856e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38:

1.07856e11 *2.566e-38 = (1.07856 *2.566) *1e(11-38) = approx 2.767e-27 J.

Again, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the energy to be expressed differently, like in electronvolts. But the options are in joules, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential of the others, but that would require knowing their mutual distances.

Wait, another approach: since all 12 charges are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not given, perhaps the problem is intended to consider them as a single point, but that would make their mutual distance zero, leading to infinite potential energy, which isn't possible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy cancels out, but that's only possible in certain symmetric configurations, which isn't the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26.

Wait, but my calculation gives 5.535e-27 J, which is approximately 5.5e-27, which is not any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes (k * (2e)^2 )/(2) ), so each contributes (4e² k)/(2) )=2 e² k.

12 charges: 24 e² k.

Which gives 24 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

Compute 24 * (2.566e-38) *8.988e9.

24 *8.988e9=215.712e9=2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 2.15712e11 *2.566e-38=5.536e-27 J.

Still the same result.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge as part of the potential calculation for the 12 charges, but I don't think that changes anything because the fixed charge is already accounted for.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the fixed charge as part of the 13, so when bringing in each of the 12 charges, their potential is due to the fixed charge plus any previous charges. But without knowing the order, this is difficult.

But perhaps the problem is intended to have the minimum energy when the mutual potential is zero, which is not possible, but perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the fixed charge's contribution.

In that case, the energy is 5.535e-27 J, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, but I'm not sure how that would be calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of charges. Wait, the problem says 13 identical particles, 12 at 2 m from P, and the 13th fixed at P. So 12 charges being brought in.

Wait, perhaps the correct term is that each of the 12 charges contributes (k *2e *2e )/(2 m ), which is (4e² k)/(2 m )= 2 e² k/m.

But m is 2, so 2 e² k/(2) )=e² k.

So 12 charges contribute 12 e² k.

Which is 12 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

Which is 12 *2.566e-38 *8.988e9.

12 *8.988e9=107.856e9=1.07856e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 1.07856e11 *2.566e-38=2.767e-27 J.

Again, same result.

Hmm. Given that none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in initial assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are being placed one by one, each time considering the potential due to all previously placed charges plus the fixed charge.

In that case, the first charge would contribute (2e)^2 *k/(2) =2e²
