Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let's see what the question is. So, there are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The question is about the orbital periods of these two planets, planet #1 and planet #2. The key data given are the periodic shifts in their spectral lines detected via the RV method. Planet #1 has a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, the RV method detects the Doppler shift caused by the star moving due to the planet's gravity. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity of the star, right? So the velocity of the star is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But in this case, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, so maybe the sin i is similar for both, assuming the orbits are edge-on. Wait, but the problem doesn't say anything about the inclination. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the orbital periods. Let me think about the formulas involved. The RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star’s velocity, K. The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2))) ) )^(1/3) * something. Hmm, maybe I should look for a simplified version.

Alternatively, I recall that the RV semi-amplitude is related to the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the mass of the star. The formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) )

But wait, because M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies. Let's see, G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, and P is the orbital period.

But maybe there's a simpler way. Since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the ratio of their velocities (semi-amplitudes K) would depend on the inverse of the cube root of their orbital periods. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * (1 + (M_p/M_*))^(1/3) )) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to K ≈ (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Given that both planets have the same mass (same M_p) and same M_*, the ratio of K1 to K2 would be (P2 / P1)^(1/3). Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3). Wait, let me get that right.

If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1 = (1 / P1^(1/3)) * some constants, and K2 = (1 / P2^(1/3)) * same constants. So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3). So rearranging, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it properly.

K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3). So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3). Therefore, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

But wait, that would mean P2 is (K1/K2)^3 times P1. Wait, no, let's see. Let me think of it this way.

If K1 is smaller than K2, then the star is moving less in planet 1's case. So planet 1 has a lower K, which implies a longer period? Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So lower K would mean higher P.

Wait, wait. Let's think about it step by step. The semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star. If a planet has a larger semi-amplitude, that means it's causing the star to move more, which could be due to a more massive planet or a shorter orbital period.

But in this problem, the planet masses are similar (Neptune), so the difference in K must be due to the orbital periods.

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ). So, K = (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

So, if we take the ratio K1/K2 = ( (M_p1 / M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/P1^(1/3)) ) / ( (M_p2 / M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/P2^(1/3)) ) )

But since M_p1 ≈ M_p2, and M_* is same for both, the M_* terms cancel. So, K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait, that would mean if K1 is less than K2, then P2 is less than P1. Because (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2. So if K1 < K2, then (P2/P1)^(1/3) < 1 → P2/P1 < 1 → P2 < P1.

Wait, but in the question, planet #1 has K1=5 milliangstroms, planet #2 has K2=7 milliangstroms. So K2 is larger than K1. So according to the formula, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

To find P2/P1, cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → (125)/(343) = P2/P1.

So, P2 is 125/343 times P1. So what is that as a decimal? Let's compute 125 ÷ 343.

Well, 343 is 7^3=343. 125 is 5^3=125.

125 divided by 343: 343 is approximately 343 ≈350. 125/350 ≈ 0.357. So approximately 0.36.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is ~0.36 times that of planet #1.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is the period of planet #2 than planet #1. So does that mean P2 / P1?

Wait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So it's P2 / P1.

From our calculation, P2/P1 = 125/343 ≈0.36. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. So the ratio is 0.36. Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because another way to think: the star's velocity is K. K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So if K2 is larger than K1, then the cube root of P2 is smaller than the cube root of P1. So P2 is smaller. So the period of planet #2 is shorter.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Since P2 is shorter, the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. So the correct answer is option A, ~0.36.


The problem involves determining the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets detected around stars with identical masses, using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Since both planets have similar masses and the stars have the same mass, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343}.
\]

Approximating \( \frac{125}{343} \) gives:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.36.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's, and the ratio \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \) is approximately 0.36.
