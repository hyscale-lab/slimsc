--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, forming product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what each of these products are.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. KOH is a strong base, so this sounds like an elimination reaction. Since it's dibromide, heating with a base would probably cause an E2 elimination, forming an alkene. So product 1 is likely adamantylene or something similar. Wait, adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromines on adjacent carbons? No, wait, 1 and 3 are positions on the adamantane structure. Oh, right, when you eliminate two bromides from adjacent positions, you'd form an alkene bridge. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantylene or maybe a diene? Alternatively, perhaps it's forming a cyclohexene ring or something else. But I'm not entirely sure about the structure—I might need to think more about that.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Because the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone. Wait, but if KOH is used, which is a base, perhaps it's an elimination to form a ketone? Or maybe the reaction is actually a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, and perhaps some oxidation?

Wait, another thought: KOH in this context might be causing a substitution reaction instead of elimination. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide. When heated with a strong base like KOH, it's more likely to undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantylene. But then the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing an elimination to form a ketone, but that doesn't seem right because 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the Brs on adjacent carbons. Eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh! Wait, another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's undergoing a Hoffman elimination or some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution to form a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-type elimination. Wait, pinacol involves a vicinal diol undergoing elimination to form an alkene, but here we have a dihalide.

Wait, maybe I should think about other reactions. Wait, when a dihalide reacts with a strong base like KOH, sometimes it can form an epoxide. But I don't think so because that would require a cyclic structure. Alternatively, maybe the base induces elimination of HBr twice, leading to a conjugated diene? But how would that lead to a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the NMR. Product 1 has:

4.79 ppm (2H) – that's probably a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an ether or ester group.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O). So product 1 probably has a ketone or ester group. Hmm, but if it's a ketone, where would that come from? Starting with a dihalide, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, but then another reaction occurs. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes a substitution to form a diol, and then that's oxidized.

Wait, but KOH is not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination with KOH, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's a conjugate addition or elimination. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not from elimination but substitution. Wait, but with KOH, I don't think 1,3-dibromoadamantane would substitute twice to form a diol. Because in that case, the product would have two OH groups, and the NMR would show OH signals, but the given NMR doesn't show any broad peaks, so perhaps it's not a diol.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR of product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet maybe, but the description says "4.79(2H)" without specifying. Then, 2.41-2.23 (10H), which is a multiplet, probably from the adamantane structure. Then 1.94 (2H), perhaps another CH2 group. So maybe product 1 is a diol? But the IR at 1720 suggests carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. But an epoxide would have an oxygen, but the IR would show a peak around 1250 cm-1 for the epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, another idea: Maybe KOH is causing elimination, forming an alkene, but then also causing some kind of oxidation. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, not an oxidizer. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after elimination, there's an adjacent group that can form a carbonyl through some process. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone from a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH could form a potassium salt, but that doesn't directly lead to a carbonyl. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's move on and see if the next steps help.

Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 might be an alkene or a ketone. If product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al isopropoxide could lead to some kind of acylation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and Al isopropoxide is used in a polymerization, but that's probably not it.

Wait, product 1's IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. If product 1 is a ketone, then heating with aluminum isopropoxide could lead to a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but for that, the ketone would need to have an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and Al isopropoxide is used in some kind of Diels-Alder reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone. Let's say the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH gives a ketone. How? Perhaps through a double elimination and oxidation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's forming an enol which tautomerizes to a ketone, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane doesn't have the right structure for that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution: each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would give a diol, and I'm not seeing OH peaks in the NMR. The NMR has a 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an -OCH2O- structure, like in an epoxide. Wait, but the IR would show the epoxide C-O-C stretching around 1250 cm-1, but the IR here shows 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm stuck on product 1. Maybe I should think about the NMR again. The 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH2 next to a carbonyl group. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group. For example, maybe it's a structure like (CH2)2CO.

Wait, but how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Let's imagine the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. When KOH is added, perhaps it eliminates two HBr molecules, forming a double bond. However, that would produce an alkene, but then where does the carbonyl come from?

Wait, unless the elimination forms an oxide. Maybe it's an epoxide, but I don't think that's likely because the starting material isn't a diol. Alternatively, perhaps elimination of HBr leads to an allylic carbocation, which then might form a carbonyl. But that would require some kind of rearrangement and oxidation, which I'm not sure KOH would cause. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming a gem-diol, which then loses water to form a carbonyl. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH might form a diol via substitution, but then if the diol is a geminal diol (but 1,3 positions are not geminal), that can't form a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the diol is vicinal, and then the two OH groups are adjacent. Vicinal diols can form epoxides, but that requires acid catalysis. Alternatively, under basic conditions, maybe the diol could dehydrate to form a carbonyl, but that's more of an elimination scenario. Wait, maybe the diol is further oxidized, but I don't see that happening with KOH alone.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 could be a ketone. What if product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane? How would that form? From 1,3-dibromo via elimination and oxidation. But with KOH, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's not an oxidation but a rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice to form a conjugated diene. Then, maybe one of the double bonds is further reacted with the base. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider that product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, which might facilitate some kind of acylation. But without an aromatic ring, Friedel-Crafts isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing some kind of enolate formation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Let's think: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a base, perhaps it forms an epoxide. But I'm not sure about that mechanism. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but again, the IR doesn't support that.

Hmm, maybe I should move on and see if the next steps help. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis is used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond that is cleaved during ozonolysis.

So, product 2 has an alkene. Then ozone cleaves it, and DMS is added (which is a reductive work-up, leading to aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure of the alkene).

So, product 2 is likely an alkene, perhaps some kind of substituted cyclohexene. Then, product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which would be carbonyl compounds.

So, let's retrace: product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide to form product 2, which is an alkene. So product 1 must have a structure that can form an alkene upon treatment with Al isopropoxide. Hmm, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Wait, but if product 1 is an epoxide, then heating with Al isopropoxide might not form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide forms an alkene via elimination, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: product 1's NMR shows 4.79 (2H). Maybe it's an ether, like OCH2CH2O, but that would be a singlet, perhaps. Or maybe it's an ether group next to a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something that can form an alkene when treated with a Lewis acid. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclohexenone, which when treated with Al isopropoxide, undergoes some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four fused cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are across from each other in one of the rings. When KOH is added, perhaps the two Brs are eliminated, forming a bridgehead double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantylene, which is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond.

But then, the IR would show a peak around 1650 cm-1 for the C=C, but the given IR is at 1720. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated diene, which has a different IR signature.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH in aqueous solution would perhaps substitute each Br with an OH group, forming 1,3-diol adamantane. But then, the NMR wouldn't show a 4.79 (2H) unless it's a different structure.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the diol undergoes oxidation to form a diketone. But with KOH alone, I'm not sure about the oxidation part.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 is a ketone. Let me imagine that structure. So, perhaps the elimination leads to a ketone. For that, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form an alkene, but then some process forms a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. Wait, Wagner-Meerwein involves the shift of a carbocation to a more stable position, but I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is adamantane-1,3-dione. If that's the case, then the IR would have a strong peak around 1700 cm-1, which matches the 1720 given. The NMR would then have signals from the ketone groups and the surrounding CH2 groups.

So, product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. But what would that do? Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts, but without an aromatic ring, maybe it's used for acylation or alkylation elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe it's used to form an enol.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it forms an enol, which then dimerizes or undergoes some reaction. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is formed by elimination to form an alkene. So, product 2 would be an alkene, which then undergoes ozonolysis.

So, putting this together:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → (KOH, heat) → diol (product 1). Then, product 1 → (Al isopropoxide, heat) → alkene (product 2). Then, product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (carbonyl compounds).

But how does the diol form an alkene? That would require elimination, which could be facilitated by Al isopropoxide as a Lewis acid, perhaps acting as a catalyst for elimination. So, the diol (product 1) has adjacent OH groups, which upon treatment with a Lewis acid, lose water to form a double bond, giving product 2 as an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of the alkene would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. For example, if the alkene was in a six-membered ring, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes or ketones.

Now, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The NMR of product 3 is what we're being asked about, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

The most deshielded hydrogen in an NMR is usually the one closest to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So, perhaps in product 3, the most deshielded H is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

But how would that H be coupled? It would depend on the neighboring Hs.

Wait, let's think about the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 was a substituted cyclohexene. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. The exact structure would determine the coupling.

Alternatively, product 2 might be a bridgehead alkene, such as in adamantane, which upon ozonolysis would form two ketones. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a simple cyclohexene, and ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes. But in that case, the Hs adjacent to the aldehyde would be deshielded.

Wait, but in the case of ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up (like with dimethylsulfide), the aldehydes would be formed. So, the Hs on the carbons next to the aldehyde would be deshielded. 

For example, if the ozonolysis product is an aldehyde with adjacent CH2 groups, the Hs on the CH2 adjacent to the aldehyde would be deshielded. Each of these Hs would couple with neighboring Hs.

Wait, but what about the coupling pattern? The most deshielded H would be on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each of these Hs would couple with the adjacent Hs.

Wait, perhaps the Hs are in a structure like (CH2)nCO. For example, if the structure is CH2CH2CO, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH2 adjacent to CO, but that's still unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis leads to a diketone, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the coupling pattern in the NMR is determined by the number of neighboring Hs. For example, a triplet occurs when a H is next to two neighboring Hs, each with a splitting of n+1.

Wait, if the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each H on that CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent group. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets, or maybe a triplet if the coupling constants are similar.

Wait, let me think. Suppose you have a structure like O=CH-CH2-CH2-O. No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=CH-CH2-CH2-O, but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like (CH2)2CO. So, the Hs on the CH2 next to the CO would each be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. But wait, each H on the CH2 adjacent to CO would have two neighboring Hs on the same CH2, but also perhaps coupling with Hs on another adjacent group.

Wait, perhaps it's like CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O. No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diketone, like (CH2)3CO, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis product is a diketone, such as two ketone groups connected by some CH2 groups.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which is likely to be adjacent to a carbonyl.

Let me consider a simple example. Suppose the product after ozonolysis is something like CH2=CH2. Ozonolysis would break this into two formaldehyde molecules, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, if the alkene is in a ring, like cyclohexene, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups. So, the structure would be OHC-(CH2)n-CHO. Depending on n, the Hs adjacent to the aldehyde would have different coupling.

Wait, for cyclohexene, ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups connected by a two-carbon chain. So, the structure would be OHC-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, the Hs on the CH2 adjacent to the aldehyde would each have two neighboring Hs on their own CH2 and perhaps coupling with the Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, each H on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on their own CH2 and two Hs on the neighboring CH2. Wait, no—if the structure is OHC-CH2-CH2-CHO, then each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. Each H on the CH2 would be next to two Hs on the same CH2 and possibly adjacent Hs. Wait, but each CH2 is between two carbonyls, so each CH2 group would have two Hs that are each adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the neighboring CH2.

Wait, but each H on the CH2 would have neighboring Hs on the same CH2 (so two Hs) and on the adjacent CH2 (two Hs). So, each H would be split by four neighboring Hs. But that's not possible because the coupling would be from adjacent groups. Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with Hs from the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OHC-CH2-CH2-CHO. So, each CH2 is in the middle. Each H on the middle CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on their own CH2 (so first coupling, which would split into a triplet), and also adjacent to the Hs on the neighboring CH2 (another coupling, which would split each of those triplets into another pattern).

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's think about the possible coupling. 

Each H on the middle CH2 group would be coupled with two Hs on their own group (leading to a triplet), and also coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group (another coupling). So, the overall coupling would be a triplet of triplets, making a 3x3 grid, which would result in 9 peaks, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, if the coupling constants are different, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets or something else.

Wait, but the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet. So, perhaps the coupling is to two different sets of Hs.

Alternatively, maybe the Hs are in a -CH2-CH2-CH2- structure, but adjacent to a carbonyl. So, the central CH2 would have coupling with the adjacent CH2 on both sides.

Wait, another approach: in the NMR, the most deshielded H is likely to be on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's imagine that each H on this CH2 is split by two Hs on the same group (so a triplet) and by two Hs on an adjacent CH2 group (another triplet). So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. That would give 3x3=9 peaks, but in practice, it might be observed as a complex multiplet.

But looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, which would fit this scenario. Alternatively, the Hs could be coupled with three Hs, leading to a quartet, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and one on the other. Or maybe the coupling is with two Hs on adjacent groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each H is coupled with two Hs on the same CH2 and one H on another adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps it's a methylene group (CH2) next to a carbonyl, and each H on the CH2 is coupled with two Hs on the same group (triplet) and also coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 group (another triplet). So, the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

So, the most deshielded H would have a triplet of triplet coupling pattern, which is option B.

Wait, but let me think again. If the adjacent group is a CH2, then each H on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs from their own group and two from the adjacent group. So, each H is split by two couplings: one J for the same CH2, which would split into a triplet, and another J for the adjacent CH2, which would further split each of those triplets into triplets, leading to a triplet of triplet pattern.

Alternatively, if the J values are similar, it might look like a septet, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the options include triplet of triplets (option B) and doublet of triplets (option C). I'm a bit confused here.

Another thought: perhaps the Hs are on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. So, each H would have two Hs on the same group (triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent group. But that would make a triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, the Hs on the CH2 next to the CO would each be adjacent to two Hs on their own group and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. But that would again lead to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the Hs are on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and the adjacent group is a CH group. So, each H on the CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on their own group and one H on the adjacent CH. That would lead to a triplet of doublets, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but based on the reasoning, I think the coupling is a triplet of triplets, making option B the correct answer.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, likely undergoing elimination to form a carbonyl-containing compound.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group.  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 1.94 ppm, 2H; and 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H) suggests a structure with a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl and other hydrogens from the adamantane framework.  
   - Product 1 is likely **1,3-adamantanedione**, a diketone.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid.  
   - This likely facilitates the formation of an alkene (product 2) via elimination, as Al isopropoxide can promote such transformations.  
   - Product 2 is therefore an alkene derived from 1,3-adamantanedione.

3. **Ozonolysis and Work-Up**:  
   - Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive work-up with dimethylsulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming carbonyl compounds (product 3).  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyls deshield nearby hydrogens.

4. **Coupling Pattern Analysis**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.  
   - Each hydrogen on this CH₂ group couples with two hydrogens on the same CH₂ group (forming a triplet) and with two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group (forming another triplet).  
   - This results in a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is **triplet of triplets**.

ANSWER: B
