Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it carefully. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. 

So the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second, the wave function is a complex number because of the 'i' term, which is the square root of -1. Oh right, wave functions can be complex in quantum mechanics.

The problem states that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. That implies that the wave function must be zero outside this region. But wait, the wave function given here is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. If the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3, how does that fit in?

Wait, maybe the wave function given is the part where it's non-zero. Oh right, because the problem says that each particle can move along the x-axis, but the wave function is given for the part of space where it can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So outside this region, the wave function is zero. But the given wave function is only valid in that region.

But wait, the wave function's modulus squared gives the probability density. For the wave function to be zero outside 1<x<3, it must be non-zero only there. So the question is about normalizing this wave function so that the integral of the probability density over all space is 1. Because when you have a normalized wave function, the total probability is 1, which makes sense.

So the wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that's a complex function. But when you take the modulus squared, the imaginary part will contribute. However, in this case, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So maybe the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5).

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalizable. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 must equal 1. Because outside, it's zero.

Let me write the wave function as ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. The modulus squared would be [a / sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)². Because the modulus of a complex number a + ib is sqrt(a² + b²), so the square is a² + b².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral of |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3 must be 1.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral. Let's break it into two parts: the integral of a²/(1+x) dx and the integral of 0.25 dx.

The first integral is a² times the integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). So the first part is a² * ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding the two results: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So in that case, the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So yes, that's correct.

So putting it together, the integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that. Let me remember that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a ≈ sqrt(0.7213).

What's sqrt(0.7213)? Let me calculate: sqrt(0.7225) is 0.85 because 0.85^2 = 0.7225. So 0.7213 is a bit less, so a is approximately 0.85. Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute a² as 0.5 / ln(2). Let's compute that more accurately.

ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056.

So 0.5 / 0.69314718056 = 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.721347.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.721347) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

So the answer should be B) 0.85.

Wait a second, I'm a bit confused. Because the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. So when I integrate from 1 to 3, the integral becomes a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, so the equation is a² * ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)).

Wait, let me compute 0.5 / ln(2): 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.721347. So sqrt(0.721347) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

But wait another thing, could the wave function be a real function? Because having an imaginary component would affect the normalization. But in this case, the imaginary part is a constant, not varying with x. So when we square the modulus, it adds a constant term. So the integral becomes as I did above.

Wait, but wait another thing. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But if the wave function is supposed to be zero outside x=1 to x=3, then the given function is only valid in that interval, and zero elsewhere. So that's why the integral from 1 to 3 must be 1.

So with that, the calculation seems correct. So the value of 'a' must be approximately 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \(\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i\), we normalize the wave function such that the total probability is 1. The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. The integral of \( \frac{a^2}{1+x} \) is \( a^2 \ln(1+x) \), evaluated from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \), giving \( a^2 \ln(2) \).
2. The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \) is \( 0.25 \times (3-1) = 0.5 \).

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
