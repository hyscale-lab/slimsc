Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and I'm trying to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I've heard a bit about parallax before, but I'm not super clear on all the details. Let me think this through.

Parallax is a measurement that relates to how far away a star is from us. I remember that the parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance. So, a star that's closer has a larger parallax, and a farther star has a smaller parallax. Like, if a star's parallax is 1 parsec, its distance is 1/1 = 1 parsec away. Oh wait, wait, no, actually, the formula is distance = 1 / parallax. So if plx is in parsecs, then distance is in parsecs too. So plx is 1/distance.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, like, if we look at a certain range of parallax values, how many stars do we expect to see in each such range. And how does this number change as parallax changes.

I think this is related to the distribution of stars in space. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars is constant throughout space. So the same number of stars exist in each spherical shell of a certain volume as you go outwards.

Wait, but the way we observe them is affected by their distance. Because stars that are closer will appear brighter, but in this question, the focus is on parallax and the number in each range.

So, let's model this. Let's say we consider a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at a distance d from us. The thickness of this shell is a small change dd. The volume of this shell would be approximately 4πd² * dd. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this shell would be proportional to the volume. So, number of stars N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

Now, how does this relate to parallax? Since parallax plx is 1/d, we can write d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that into the equation. So N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But wait, we need to express everything in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, dd would be - (1/plx²) d plx? Because if plx increases, d decreases. Let me think: d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. But since we're considering small changes, maybe signs don't matter here. So, perhaps the volume in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) d plx ). Wait, but that would be when we write in terms of plx. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the change in plx (d plx) in terms of the change in d. Because when d increases, plx decreases. So, let's find the relation between d plx and dd.

We have plx = 1/d → d plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² d plx. So, the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd = 4π d² (-d² d plx) ) = -4π d^4 d plx.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me try substituting variables.

Let’s say that instead of looking at d, I look at plx. So, the number of stars in a parallax interval d plx would correspond to the volume in that shell. Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, N = n * Volume.

But how does the Volume relate to plx? The shell at distance d has volume 4πd² dd. But d is 1/plx, so Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd).

But wait, dd can be expressed in terms of d plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = (dd plx)/(d plx)^2. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps express dd in terms of d plx. Because d plx is the small change in parallax, so plx = 1/d → d plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² d plx.

Substituting d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx)^2 * d plx.

Now, substitute this into the volume equation:

Volume = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (- (1/plx^2) d plx )

Which simplifies to Volume = 4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx²) d plx ) → 4π (-1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, but volume can't be negative. I'm probably messing up the negative sign, which comes from the derivative. But in terms of absolute numbers, the volume would be proportional to 1/plx^4 multiplied by d plx.

But wait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell with parallax from plx to plx + d plx is N = n * Volume, where Volume is the volume of the shell at parallax plx with thickness d plx.

So, the shell volume is 4π d² (dd), where dd is the change in distance. But how does dd relate to d plx? Since plx = 1/d, so d plx = d (dd/d d) ) = d (dd / (-d²)) ) → d plx = - dd / d → dd = -d (d plx).

So, substituting back, Volume = 4π d² (-d (d plx)) ) = -4 π d^3 (d plx) ).

Wait, d is 1/plx, so d^3 is 1/(plx)^3. So Volume = -4 π (1/(plx^3)) (d plx).

But that's a bit counterintuitive. Maybe I should think in terms of integrating the number of stars over a range of parallax.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to model the number of stars per unit volume as constant. So, the number of stars in a small volume dV is n * dV, where n is the number density.

Now, dV in terms of spherical shells is 4π d² dd. So, the number of stars in that shell is N = n * 4π d² dd.

We want to find N per unit range of plx, so let's express N in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So, plx can be treated as a variable, and dd is related to d plx as we found earlier.

Wait, let's express everything in terms of plx:

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So, substituting into N:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² d plx).

The negatives can be considered as direction, but since we're dealing with small positive increments, perhaps we can take the magnitude.

So, N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d plx.

Wait, that gives N = n * 4π / plx^4 * d plx.

So, the number of stars per unit range of plx (d plx) is N/(d plx) = (n 4π ) / plx^4.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (i.e., per d plx) is proportional to 1/(plx^4).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, option D is 1/plx^3, and so on.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me check my substitution again.

So:

N = n * 4π d² dd.

But d is 1/plx, so d² is 1/plx².

And dd is - (1/plx^2) d plx.

So,

N = n *4π (1/plx^2) * [ - (1/plx^2) d plx ].

Which gives N = -n 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But for the number of stars, we're interested in the absolute value, so we can ignore the sign.

So, N = n 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, that's the number of stars in a range d plx. So, the number per unit plx range is N/(d plx) = (n 4 π / plx^4 ) * d plx / d plx )= n 4 π / plx^4.

Wait, no, because N is the number of stars in a range d plx, so to get the number per unit plx, you would have N divided by d plx, which is (n 4π (1/plx^4) d plx) ) / d plx → n 4 π (1/plx^4) ).

So, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, which would be the answer if this is correct.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember something about the density of stars in terms of distance. Oh right! The number of stars per unit volume is uniform, but when you consider a shell at distance d, the volume depends on d². So, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to d² dd.

But when you convert to parallax plx, since d = 1/plx, d² = 1/plx², and dd is (d plx) / (d^2) ), right? Or wait, earlier I found dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx.

So when you have the number of stars in a shell with parallax plx and a small change in plx (d plx), the number is proportional to (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d plx. Which is 1/plx^4 * d plx.

So, per unit change in plx, it's 1/plx^4.

But that's not matching my initial intuition. Because I thought maybe the number would decrease as 1/plx^3, but perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, maybe another approach: think about the differential. The number of stars between plx and plx + d plx is N = n * 4π d² dd.

But d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So, substituting:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) d plx.

So, N = - n 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

The negative indicates that as plx increases, the number of stars in that shell decreases, but regardless, the magnitude is n 4π / plx^4 * d plx.

So, the number per unit plx is N/(d plx) = n 4 π / plx^4.

So, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, this seems to suggest that the number of stars decreases rapidly as plx increases (i.e., as distance increases), which makes sense because as you look further away, each subsequent shell has less stars in a given plx range.

So the correct answer would be option A) ~1/plx^4.

Wait but that doesn't match what I thought earlier. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me recheck.

Wait, N is the number of stars in a thin shell. So, for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, N= n * 4π d² dd.

Expressed in terms of plx, d=1/plx, so N= n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd).

But dd is (change in d), which is (d plx) * (-d^2). Because d =1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So, substituting:

N = n *4π (1/plx^2) * ( - (1/plx^2) d plx )

= n *4π ( -1/plx^4 ) d plx.

But the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, so the number of stars is positive.

So, the number of stars per unit plx range is (n 4 π) / plx^4.

So, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

But wait, some sources say that the number of stars per unit distance increases with distance cubed or something. Wait, maybe I'm confusing distance and parallax.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of stars per unit volume. Since the number density is uniform, the number of stars in a volume dV is n dV.

The volume element in spherical coordinates is dV = 4π r² dr, where r is the distance.

So, the number of stars per unit distance (dr) at distance r is 4π r² n dr.

So, the number per unit dr is 4π r² n.

Now, in terms of parallax, r =1/plx → r² = 1/plx².

So, the number per unit dr is 4π n (1/plx²).

But wait, to find the number per unit plx (d plx), we need to relate dr to d plx.

Because plx =1/r → dr = - (1/r²) d plx.

So, substituting r =1/plx, dr= - plx² d plx.

So, the number of stars in a parallax interval d plx is N = 4 π n (1/plx^2) * |dr|.

But dr is negative, so |dr|= plx^2 d plx.

So, N =4 π n (1/plx^2) * plx^2 d plx =4 π n d plx.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would suggest N is proportional to d plx, regardless of plx. Which doesn't make sense because then the number of stars per unit parallax would be constant, which isn't what we expect.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the substitution.

Wait, let's try again.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is N = 4 π r² n dr.

To express this in terms of plx, since r =1/plx.

So, dr = - (1/(plx^2)) d plx.

So, substituting,

N =4 π (1/plx)^2 n * [ - (1/plx^2) d plx ]

= -4 π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is N/(d plx) = -4 π n / plx^4.

The negative is just indicating the change in direction, so the magnitude is 4 π n / plx^4.

Therefore, the number reduces as plx increases because plx^4 in the denominator.

So, the correct answer would be option A: ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but in the initial substitution, I thought option A was correct. So, why am I confused now?

Wait, perhaps I should think about this in terms of the number density. Let's say the number density is n stars per cubic parsec. Then, the number of stars in a volume V is n*V.

So, for a thin spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr, V=4 π r² dr.

So, the number of stars is N = n *4 π r² dr.

But in terms of parallax plx=1/r, so r=1/plx.

So, dr = - (1/plx²) d plx.

Substituting back:

N = n *4 π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) d plx )

= -4 π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is N/(d plx) = -4 π n / plx^4.

Which means the number of stars per unit plx range is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So, the correct answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the distribution of stars in space. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed, the number density of stars is constant throughout space. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Thus, the number of stars \( N \) in this shell is:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd,
\]

where \( n \) is the number density of stars.

Parallax \( \text{plx} \) is related to distance \( d \) by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), so \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Substituting this into the volume expression, the volume of the shell becomes:

\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}, \quad dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
N = -n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of change in \( d \) as \( \text{plx} \) increases, but we are interested in the magnitude. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per \( d\text{plx} \)) is:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} = \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \):** Matches the derived result.
- **B) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \).
- **C) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^1} \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \).
- **D) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).
