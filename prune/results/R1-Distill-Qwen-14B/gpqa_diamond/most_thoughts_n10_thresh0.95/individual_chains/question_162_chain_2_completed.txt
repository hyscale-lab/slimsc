Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity or differential geometry, I think. The question gives me a metric and asks about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit unusual. I remember that metrics are used to measure distances in spacetime, but this seems to be in two dimensions since there are only dx and dy terms. So maybe it's a 2D manifold?

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere... I think that's a term from hyperbolic geometry. Or wait, maybe it's a term used in the context of spacetime. Oh right, in relativity, a pseudosphere can refer to a surface of constant negative curvature, like a hyperboloid. Alternatively, sometimes a pseudosphere is a 2D surface embedded in 3D space with constant negative curvature, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the radius here is given as r=2. So maybe it's a hyperbolic space with radius 2? Or perhaps it's a sphere-like concept but with a different metric.

In differential geometry, the area of a sphere in 2D would normally be 4πr², but if it's a pseudosphere, maybe the formula is different. Wait, the options have expressions like 4π(x² + y²), which is similar to the standard area formula for a sphere, but with x and y variables. Hmm, perhaps the area depends on the coordinates?

Wait, the metric given is in terms of x and y, so maybe it's a coordinate system on a pseudosphere. I need to figure out the area element from this metric.

The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the line element depends on x and y, which are probably coordinates on the surface. To find the area, I should compute the area element dA.

In general, the area element in 2D polar coordinates (if I can use them here) would be r dr dθ, but in this case, the metric is given in Cartesian-like coordinates. Alternatively, the area element in a 2D metric is sqrt(g) d²x, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric tensor here is diagonal because the terms are (dx² + dy²) multiplied by a factor. So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and g_yy = same as g_xx. g_xy would be zero because there's no cross term.

So the determinant of the metric tensor, g, would be the product of the diagonal elements since it's diagonal. So g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Then the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy. Wait, no, because for a diagonal metric, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy, and since the determinant is (g_xx * g_yy) because it's diagonal. So yeah, sqrt(g) would be the square root of (g_xx * g_yy), which is (32/(4 - x² - y²)).

So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but that's the area element. To get the total area, I'd need to integrate this over the entire surface, right? But what are the limits of integration here?

The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that x² + y² must be less than 4 to avoid division by zero or negative values. So the domain of x and y is the region where x² + y² < 4. So the integration area is the disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait a second, but if I'm integrating dA over the entire surface, that would be the integral over all x and y where x² + y² < 4. So the area A is the integral of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy over x² + y² <4.

Hmm, that looks a bit tricky. Let me try to compute this integral. Maybe switching to polar coordinates would make it easier.

So, let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ. The denominator becomes (4 - r²).

So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ

Because when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand becomes large. Hmm, but wait, the metric's denominator is 4 - x² - y², so as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, which would make the area element blow up. But perhaps the integral converges?

Wait, let me compute the integral. Let me factor out the constants. 32 is a constant, so:

A = 32 ∫₀^{2π} dθ ∫₀^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr

First, the θ integral is straightforward. ∫₀^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So A = 32 * 2π ∫₀^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr

Now, compute the radial integral I = ∫₀^2 [ r dr / (4 - r²) ]

Let me substitute u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r, so (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

I = ∫_{u=4}^{u=0} (1/u) * (-1/2) du

Which is (-1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 of (1/u) du. But flipping the limits, it's (1/2) ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du.

Wait, that's (1/2) ∫ u^{-1} du from 0 to4. The integral of 1/u is ln|u|.

So I = (1/2) [ ln u ] from 0 to4.

At u=4, ln(4) is about 1.386. At u approaching 0 from the positive side, ln(u) approaches negative infinity.

So I = (1/2) [ ln4 - (-infinity) ] → (1/2) [ ln4 + ∞ ] = ∞.

Wait, so the integral I diverges to infinity. That means the total area A is 32 * 2π * ∞ = infinity.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D is +infty. So the area is infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The denominator is (4 - r²), and as r approaches 2, the integrand behaves like [r/(4 - r²)] = [2/(4 - (2)^2)] when r=2, but wait, that's 2/0, which is infinite. So the integrand becomes very large near r=2.

But in the integral, the behavior near r=2 is important. Let me approximate the integral near r=2.

Let me consider the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r^2)] dr near r=2. Let me make a substitution: let s = 2 - r. So when r approaches 2, s approaches 0. Let me change variable:

r = 2 - s, dr = -ds.

Then, 4 - r² = 4 - (2 - s)^2 = 4 - (4 -4s + s²) )= 4s - s².

So the integral near r=2 becomes:

∫ [ (2 - s) / (4s - s²) ) ] (-ds)

But as s approaches 0, 4s dominates, so denominator is ~4s. The numerator is ~2. So the integrand behaves like (2)/(4s) ) = 1/(2s).

So the integral near s=0 becomes ∫ (1/(2s)) ds, which is (1/2) ln s, which approaches negative infinity as s approaches 0 from the positive side. But since we're integrating from s=0 (r=2) to s=2 (r=0), wait no, I think I might have messed up the substitution direction. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, when r approaches 2 from below, s approaches 0 from above. The integral becomes:

∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr ≈ ∫ [2/(4s)] ds as s approaches 0. So that's ∫ [ 2/(4s) ] ds = ∫ (1/(2s)) ds = (1/2) ln s + C. As s approaches 0+, ln s approaches -infty, so the integral from 0 to some small epsilon would be (1/2)(-infty) which is -infty. But since the substitution involved a negative, perhaps the behavior is opposite.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to check the convergence of the integral. The integral ∫ [r/(4 - r^2)] dr from 0 to 2.

We can write this as ∫ [r/(4 - r^2)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute the indefinite integral first. Let u = 4 - r^2. Then, du = -2r dr → -(1/2) du = r dr.

So:

∫ [r/(4 - r^2)] dr = ∫ (1/u) * (-1/2) du = (-1/2) ln |u| + C = (-1/2) ln(4 - r^2) + C.

Now, evaluating from 0 to 2:

[ (-1/2) ln(4 - (2)^2) ) ] - [ (-1/2) ln(4 -0) ) ]

So that's [ (-1/2) ln(0) ) ] - [ (-1/2) ln(4) ) ]

ln(0) is negative infinity, so (-1/2)*(-infty) is positive infinity. So the integral I becomes ∞, so the area A is 32 * 2π * ∞ = infinity.

So the area is infinite. So looking at the options, option D is +infty.

Wait, but the metric given is in 2D. So the surface is a 2D pseudosphere, but the area is infinite? Or is there another interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of a sphere with radius r=2, but in a space described by this metric. Oh wait, in the metric, the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which suggests a sphere of radius 2, since 4 is 2 squared. So perhaps the metric is describing a 2D surface with negative curvature, making the area infinite.

Wait, but a pseudosphere in geometry typically refers to a surface of constant negative curvature, like the tractricoid. But in 3D, a pseudosphere has finite area. But in 2D, if we're talking about hyperbolic space, the area would be infinite.

Hmm, but the metric given is:

ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

Let me see if this is a hyperbolic metric. For a hyperbolic metric in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - r²)^2, with r <1. So in that case, the area element would be [ (1 - r²)^2 ]^{-1} r dr dθ, which when integrated gives an infinite area because the area element diverges as r approaches 1.

So in the given metric, as r approaches 2 (since 4 - r^2 approaches zero), the area element becomes large, leading to an infinite area.

So the area of the pseudosphere (which in this case is a 2D hyperbolic space modeled by this metric) is infinite.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty, which would be the correct answer.


The metric provided is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we first determine the area element \( dA \) from the metric. For a 2D metric, the area element is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( \det(g) \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is the product of the diagonal components:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To find the total area, we integrate \( dA \) over the entire surface. The domain of \( x \) and \( y \) is restricted by the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which implies \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). This corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane.

Switching to polar coordinates \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \) is straightforward. The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), and the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{-16}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| \), so:

\[
\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln(4) - \ln(0).
\]

As \( u \to 0^+ \), \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), making the integral diverge to infinity. Therefore, the total area \( A \) is infinite.

This result aligns with the properties of a pseudosphere in 2D, which corresponds to a hyperbolic space with constant negative curvature. In such spaces, the area of the entire surface is infinite.

From the given options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the area diverges to infinity.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.
