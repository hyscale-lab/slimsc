Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The problem is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I should find the concentrations and moles involved here. Let me start by calculating the initial concentration after dilution. Oh wait, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. So the initial acetic acid solution is 0.05 M. When I mix 20 cm³ of that with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M) * (20/40) = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, right? So it doesn't completely dissociate. But when we titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, they'll neutralize each other. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid present. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. Original volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. So moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M, but the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So moles of acetic acid is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So the equivalence point moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001 moles.

But the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. So the volume needed at equivalence point would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So when the NaOH added is 25% of that, which is 2.5 cm³, that's the 25% titration point.

Wait, 25% of the equivalence volume: 10 cm³ * 0.25 = 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

So first, let's find the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So let's calculate the moles of acetic acid and acetate ion at this point.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 moles.

Moles of NaOH added: volume (L) * concentration = 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 moles.

So moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 moles.

So the solution now has both acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate. This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, what is pKa? The given Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) or wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

Using logarithm rules: log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 + (-5) = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075).

Simplify the ratio: 0.00025 /0.00075 = 1/3.

Log(1/3) is negative. Log(1)=0, log(3)=0.477, so log(1/3)= -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = approximately 4.256. Let me round that to two decimal places: 4.26.

Wait, but wait—what about the dilution? Because when we add NaOH into the solution, the total volume changes. So the concentrations of HA and A^- would be based on the new total volume.

Wait, let's think again. The original volume after dilution was 40 cm³. Then we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So the concentrations of HA and A^- would be:

[HA] = 0.00075 moles / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 moles / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333, which is 1/3. So same as before. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives the same result.

So pH is approximately 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming sodium acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions in solution is the moles divided by the total volume.

Moles of acetate are 0.001 moles (since all the 0.001 moles of acetic acid reacted with NaOH). The volume is the original diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (10 cm³) = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, the expression becomes:

x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02.

Which is 1.081e-11.

Taking square root: x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but wait—did I make a mistake here? Because the options don't have a pH of 9.02. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * (1e-14 / 1e-5) )= approx 0.5405 * 1e-9 → 5.405e-10. So that was correct.

Wait, but wait—maybe I forgot that acetate concentration is 0.02 M. Let me redo the calculation.

The Kb expression: x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small compared
