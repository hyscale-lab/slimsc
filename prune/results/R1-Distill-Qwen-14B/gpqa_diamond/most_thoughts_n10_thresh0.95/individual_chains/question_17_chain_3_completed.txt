Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The problem states that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. We're also given the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10.

Wait, formation constant? Right, the formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion. So in this case, Ca²+ and EDTA form a complex, and Kf is 5e10.

The options given are A) 2.0e-2, B)5e-3, C)6.3e-7, D)1.0e-2. Hmm.

So, thinking about the problem. The solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Let's denote the complex as CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4− ion. Since it's a 1:1 complex, when it dissociates, it should release Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

But wait, in solution, the complex might not stay entirely intact. It can dissociate a little bit because the formation constant is very high, but I think it's more about finding the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Because EDTA is a chelating agent, it binds tightly to Ca²+, so the concentration of free Ca²+ should be really low. But given Kf is 5e10, which is a large number, meaning the complex is very stable.

So, the reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−. The Kf is given as 5e10. But wait, sometimes Kf is written as the formation of the complex, so the expression would be Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

In this problem, the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²−. So, the initial concentration is 0.02 M. However, some of this complex will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

Let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium).

Initial:
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0
[EDTA^4−] = 0

Change:
- Let x be the amount that dissociates.
So, [CaEDTA²−] decreases by x → 0.02 - x
[Ca²+] increases by x → x
[EDTA^4−] increases by x → x

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

So, plug these into the Kf expression:

Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = (0.02 - x)/(x * x) = (0.02 - x)/(x²)

But wait, Kf is 5e10, which is a huge number. That suggests that the complex is almost completely un dissociated. So, x is going to be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, approximately, Kf ≈ (0.02)/(x²) = 5e10

Solve for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-12 /5e10? Wait, let me compute again. 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) → 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13

Wait, no: 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. Because 1e-2 / 1e10 is 1e-12.

So, 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13.

So, x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5 → 2e-6.5? Wait, let me calculate.

Wait, 1e-13 squared is (1e-6.5)^2, which is 1e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) → 2e-6.5, which is equal to 2 * 1e-6 * 1e-0.5 → 2 * 3.16e-7 → approximately 6.32e-7.

Wait, wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7.

So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M. That would be the concentration of Ca²+.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches this.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation equilibrium is:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) ions. At equilibrium:
- \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x\),
- \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\),
- \([\text{Y}^{4-}] = x\).

Substituting these into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}
\]

Since \( K_f \) is very large (\( 5 \times 10^{10} \)), the complex is highly stable, and \( x \) is negligible compared to 0.02. Thus, \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \), simplifying the equation to:

\[
K_f \approx \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \) M, which matches option C.

Answer: C
