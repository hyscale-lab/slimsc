Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit c. So for finding the relative speed of one astronaut from the other's frame, I can't just subtract the speeds directly. I should use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Let me make sure: if astronaut A is moving at v1 relative to the lab, and astronaut B at v2, then from A's frame, B's speed would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²), but I have to be careful about the signs. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference divided by that factor.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the slower one from the faster's frame would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, no, maybe it's (v1 - v2) over that denominator. Because if v1 is larger than v2, then the relative speed would be v1 - v2, but divided by the Lorentz factor.

Actually, the correct formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). So let me plug in the numbers. v1 is 0.6c (since astronaut 2m is moving at 0.6c) and v2 is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) ).

Calculating numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c)/0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c, which rounds to approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, either option C or D have 0.14c.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². Since the energies add, I need to calculate each one and sum them.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c): gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (3m, 0.5c): gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking back at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and option D has E=5 mc².

So putting it all together, the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is around 5.96 mc². Therefore, the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{1}{7}c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

Combining the results, the relative speed is \(0.14c\) and the total energy is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). From the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
