Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde starting from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, okay. So I need to think about the target molecule and the starting material to figure out the necessary transformations.

Let me break down the target molecule. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So I think that's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group, and there's also an aldehyde group attached to the cyclohexane ring. Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally.

Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which would be a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure would have a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH2 connected to cyclohexyl and OH groups. Also, the cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde group at the same carbon? Or maybe the substituent is at position 1, and the aldehyde is also at position 1? That doesn't make sense, because one carbon can't have two different groups. Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane where one carbon (position 1) has three substituents: a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a methyl group, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the cyclohexane ring has a substituent that's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and another aldehyde group on the same carbon. Hmm, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule is as follows: the cyclohexane ring has a CH2 group attached to it. This CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is cyclohexyl-CH(OH)-CH2-cyclohexane, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's cyclohexyl attached to a CH2 group, which is also attached to an OH and the cyclohexane ring. And then, the cyclohexane ring also has a formyl (aldehyde) group. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and an OH. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-OH-cyclohexyl? No, that doesn't make sense. I think I'm getting stuck on the nomenclature. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl (triple bond) group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. So perhaps it's cyclohex-1-ene with a triple bond? Or wait, ethynyl is just a substituent, so it's cyclohexane with a C≡CH attached to one carbon.

Now, the target molecule seems to have a formyl group (aldehyde) and a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group that's also an alcohol. So maybe the synthesis involves adding groups step by step.

Let me think about the possible reactions. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. What can I do with a triple bond? Maybe add something to it. Let's think about the options given and see which reagents fit.

Looking at the options, let's see the possible steps.

Option A: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So perhaps a methylation reaction, like an alkylation. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. Adding a methyl group via alkylation? How?

Alternatively, NaNH2 is used in deprotonation to form a strong base. Maybe the triple bond is being used in a substitution. Or perhaps it's forming a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, another approach: ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane with C≡CH). So, possible reactions include: 1) Reduction to cis or trans alkenes. For example, using H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's for cis or H2/Pd for trans. 2) Ozonolysis to break the triple bond into carbonyl groups. 3) Using the alkyne in a substitution reaction, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution if possible.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is an alkyne attached to a cyclohexane. I'm thinking of possible transformations. Let's think about each option's steps.

Looking at Option C: Steps are NaNH2 with methyl chloride, then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Then O3 with (CH3)2S, then Ba(OH)2.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. So maybe the first step is deprotonating the alkyne as a triple bond is acidic. Deprotonating ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 would give a cyclohexyl- acetylide. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would be an alkylating agent. So the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, adding a methyl group. So the alkyne becomes CH2CH2... Wait, no. Wait, the acetylide is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So when you treat an acetylide with an alkyl halide like CH3Cl, it would add a methyl group to the sp-hybridized carbon. So the product would be CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think: the starting alkyne is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. Deprotonation gives cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na+. Then adding CH3Cl would give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So the triple bond becomes a single bond with a methyl group attached. So now we have cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the starting molecule is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. Deprotonating gives cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻. Then adding methyl chloride would give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So the triple bond becomes a single bond with a methyl group. So the product after step 1 would be cyclohexylpropane? Wait, maybe cyclohexylpropene? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's more like cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps this reaction is adding a methyl group to the triple bond. So after step 1, the triple bond is converted to a single bond with a methyl group attached. So the molecule becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be. Wait, the triple bond is R-C≡CH. After deprotonation and alkylation, it would be R-C-CH2Cl? No, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group. So R-C≡CH + NaNH2 → R-C≡C⁻Na+, then CH3Cl → R-C≡C-CH3. So the triple bond becomes a single bond with a methyl on the end. So the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH3? No, that would be R-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's an alkane. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall goal. The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde. So perhaps there's an oxidation step involved.

Let me think about each option's steps.

Option C's steps: step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → maybe alkylation of the alkyne. Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond. Wait, but if the triple bond was converted to a single bond in step 1, maybe step 2 isn't needed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps step 1 is deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide, then a reaction. Let's think about each option:

Option A: step 1 NaNH2 and methyl chloride → probably alkylation. Then step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenation. Then step 3: Ba(OH)2. Hmm, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction or for elimination maybe. Then step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → that's the oxymercuration reaction. Wait, but in that case, what would each step achieve?

Wait, maybe the target compound has an aldehyde group. So perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. Ozonolysis followed by something could do that.

Looking at step 3 in some options, O3 is used. Ozonolysis of a triple bond would break it into two carbonyl groups. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. Ozonolysis of a triple bond would typically give two carbonyl groups. For example, R-C≡CH → ozonolysis → RCHO + HCHO (formaldehyde). But in the target molecule, there's a cyclohexyl group attached and an aldehyde. So maybe the alkyne is converted to an aldehyde.

But let me think about each option.

Option C: Steps 1 and 2 would first alkylate the alkyne, then hydrogenate it. Let's say step 1: alkyne becomes R-CH2-CH3? Then step 2: H2/Pd would reduce a triple bond? But in step 1, if the triple bond was alkylated, it's now R-CH2-CH3, which is a single bond. So step 2 hydrogenation might not change anything. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the reagents. Let me think again. H2/Pd is used for hydrogenation of triple bonds to cis alkenes or single bonds. So if we have the alkyne, hydrogenation would turn it into a cis alkene. Then, if we have an alkyl group added, perhaps we can form a diol or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is first converted into an enol ether or something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the target molecule is formed by adding groups to the cyclohexane. So starting from ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps the triple bond is converted into an aldehyde, and then other substituents are added.

So for that, perhaps ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up would give an aldehyde. Let me think.

Option C's steps: step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis with a reagent like (CH3)2S usually leads to reductive work-up, which would give aldehydes or ketones. So if the triple bond is ozonolyzed, the ethynyl group (C≡CH) would become a carbonyl group. So cyclohexane with a formyl group (CHO). Wait, but the target has more substituents. Hmm.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li and liq NH3, then O3 with (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 with methanol would be deprotonating, perhaps to form an acetylide, then quenching with methanol could lead to a methyl group addition. Alternatively, it could be a hydroxymethylation. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1, which is a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl. Also, an aldehyde group is present.

Wait, perhaps the target is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and an OH. Wait, maybe it's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is such that the cyclohexane has a CH2 group attached to it, and that CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group, and the same carbon (the one attached to CH2) also has an aldehyde group. Hmm, that seems challenging.

Wait, maybe the target structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CH2 group, and that same carbon also has an aldehyde group. Wait, but that would require four bonds, which is impossible. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons has a CH2 group attached. This CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group (so perhaps that's a bridge), and also has an OH group. And on the same ring, there's an aldehyde group. Hmm, that's a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps it's a norbornene-like structure? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group, and an aldehyde in the same position. So the same carbon on the cyclohexane has both a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group and an aldehyde. But that's impossible because a carbon can only have four bonds. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the name.

Wait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1, which is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. Then, the cyclohexane also has a carbonyl group (aldehyde) at position 1. Wait, that can't be right either.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the possible synthetic steps that can lead to such a structure. Let's think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group.

To make an aldehyde, perhaps the triple bond is oxidized. Ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up (like with Zn) would give aldehyde groups. Alternatively, catalytic hydrogenation followed by oxidation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a diol via hydration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group attached via a CH2 group to a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a hydroxyl group and a methyl group that's further functionalized.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a cyclohexyl group with a substituent that can be oxidized to aldehyde.

Wait, let me think about each option's steps to see which makes sense.

Option C's steps: step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That would form an acetylide (R-C≡C⁻) which then reacts with methyl chloride to give R-C≡C-CH3. So the triple bond becomes a single bond with a methyl group. Now, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the starting material is R-C≡CH. After alkylation, it becomes R-C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. H2 would add hydrogen across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. Wait, but the triple bond was already converted in step 1. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a double bond. So, maybe after step 1, the triple bond was hydrogenated to a cis double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide, then methyl chloride adds a methyl group, making a longer alkyne. Then step 2 is hydrogenation to a trans alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think: starting with R-C≡CH. Step 1: NaNH2 and CH3Cl → R-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis-alkene, R-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the triple bond R-C≡C-CH3 would hydrogenate to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's not an alkene. Oh wait, H2 and a catalyst like Pd would hydrogenate a triple bond to a single bond. So after step 2, we have R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't create any double bonds. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the steps wrong. Let's think about each option's steps and their possible outcomes.

Option C's step 3 is O3 (ozone) with (CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis with a reductive work-up, which would cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. But if step 2 didn't create a double bond, then ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So maybe step 2 is hydrogenation of a triple bond to a double bond.

Wait, but H2/Pd usually hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. Unless Lindlar's catalyst is used for cis addition, or another method for trans. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide, then methyl chloride adds a methyl group, making R-C≡C-CH3. Then step 2 is hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond, making R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, but that's for double bonds, so that wouldn't apply here. So maybe this isn't the right path.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So perhaps forming an acetylide, then quenching it with methanol. That would give R-CH2-OH. Wait, no, acetylide plus aqueous acid would give R-C≡CH2-OH? Hmm, perhaps that's a hydroxymethylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a milder condition, leading to a substitution.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. So, treating ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 would deprotonate the triple bond to form an acetylide. Then, adding methanol (CH3OH) would lead to an alkylation. Wait, but methanol is a weak electrophile. Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide would attack a methyl group from methanol. But methanol isn't a good source of methyl groups. So that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the first step is deprotonation to form the acetylide, then in step 2, Li and liquid NH3 are used for a lithium-based reaction, perhaps a coupling reaction or addition. Li and liquid NH3 are used in the Birch reduction, or maybe for alkylations or Grignard-like reactions.

Hmm, not sure. Let me think about each option.

Option B: step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So again, forming an acetylide and then ethylating. Step 2 is Li and liq NH3, which could be for a Birch reduction or perhaps forming a Grignard. Step 3 is O3 then H2O (maybe cleavage), followed by NH4OH (which is a reducing agent, maybe for work-up).

Wait, step 3 would be ozonolysis followed by H2O, which is oxidative work-up, leading to carboxylic acids or ketones. Then step 4 is NH4OH, perhaps to work up ozonolysis.

But I'm not seeing the clear path here.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So perhaps the acetylide is formed, then quenching with methanol leads to R-CH2-OH. Wait, but that would involve a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide (R-C≡C⁻) reacts with methanol to form R-C≡C-OCH3, then something else happens. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule requires both aldehyde and alcohol groups. So the alkyne needs to be converted into an aldehyde, and another group added as an alcohol.

So, maybe the triple bond is first converted into an aldehyde via ozonolysis and reductive work-up. Then, another step adds a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, considering the target structure, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a cyclohexene via hydrogenation, then ozonolysis to form a carbonyl. But then adding a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group would require more steps.

Another thought: the target has a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So perhaps that's formed via some kind of alkylation and then hydroxylation.

Alternatively, maybe the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexylmethyl group adjacent to an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is converted to a cyclohexenyl group via hydrogenation, say using H2 and a catalyst to form cis or trans cyclohexene.

2. Then, perform an addition reaction to introduce a substituent, like using a Grignard or organometallic reagent to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but I'm not seeing that in the options. Let me think again.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct steps involve deprotonating the alkyne, adding a methyl group, then hydrogenating, then ozonolysis, and then some work-up.

Wait, looking at option C again. Steps 1 and 2 would create a longer chain, then ozonolysis would cut it. So, let's imagine:

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → NaNH2 and CH3Cl → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's a propane chain attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, but then step 3 is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis acts on double bonds, but in this step, the molecule is a single bond. So that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the steps wrong. Maybe the order of steps in each option is different.

Let me think about each option's steps again.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of alkyne to form R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation of triple bond to single bond, forming R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/ (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but without a double bond, this wouldn't do anything. So this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation of a double bond. So maybe step 1 is an alkyne to alkene via some method, then step 2 is hydrogenation to an alkane.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the target molecule again.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-OH group attached to a cyclohexyl group. Wait, no. Or maybe it's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group connected to both the cyclohexane and a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-O-C6H11? No, that's an ether. Alternatively, cyclohexane-CH2-OH and a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to form a cyclohexylmethyl group attached to the cyclohexane, with a hydroxyl group, and then oxidize to an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target also has an aldehyde group, so perhaps that comes from the ozonolysis of a triple bond.

Wait, let's think about the correct sequence. To get an aldehyde, the triple bond must be converted into a carbonyl group. Ozonolysis would break the triple bond into two carbonyls. But the target has only one aldehyde, so perhaps only one end is broken.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH. Ozonolysis would give R-CHO and HCHO. So if I can protect one end and work on the other, perhaps.

But in the target, the aldehyde is attached to the main cyclohexane ring, and the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So perhaps the aldehyde comes from the ozonolysis of the alkyne, and the substituent comes from another step.

Wait, so if I ozonolyze ethynylcyclohexane, I get cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (R-CHO) and formaldehyde. Then, perhaps I can form a new carbon-carbon bond to add the cyclohexyl group and the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into an aldehyde, and then the other steps add the substituent.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the triple bond is converted into an aldehyde, and then a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

But I'm not sure. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li, liq NH3; then O3 and (CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide, then reacting with methanol. Acetylide + CH3OH → R-C≡C-OCH3? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydroxymethylation, but I don't think that's common.

Alternatively, maybe the acetylide attacks a methyl group from methanol, but I'm not sure that's feasible.

Step 2: Li and liq NH3. That's a strong base, used in Birch reductions or for deprotonating. Or perhaps for forming Grignard-like reagents.

Hmm, perhaps in step 2, the Li in NH3 is used to form a cyclohexyl lithium, which then adds to the aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this step is for a double deprotonation or some coupling.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis with a reductive work-up, which would break double bonds into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for work-up.

Hmm, not sure. Another approach: let's think about the possible intermediates.

The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group with an OH, and an aldehyde group. So perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenating the alkyne to a trans or cis alkene.

3. Ozonolyzing the alkene to form an aldehyde.

4. Adding a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to the same carbon.

Wait, maybe using the alkyne, first add a methyl group, then hydrogenate to a trans alkene, then ozonolyze to form two aldehydes. Then, perform a reaction to add the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide.

2. Alkylation with methyl chloride to add a methyl group, making R-C≡C-CH3.

3. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to a cis or trans alkene: R-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of triple bond to cis or trans would give R-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck because I'm not seeing the correct sequence. Let me think about each option's steps and see which makes sense in terms of forming the target.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of alkyne, making R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, making R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis would require a double bond, but in this case, after step 2, it's a single bond. So ozonolysis wouldn't do anything here. So this option doesn't seem right.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps acetylide plus methanol gives R-C≡C-OCH3.

Step 2: Li and liq NH3 → maybe Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of any double bonds, which would form carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → work-up, maybe hydrolysis.

Not sure about this either.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylate alkyne to R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li, liq NH3 → maybe deprotonate to form a strong base, or perhaps a Grignard.

Step 3: O3, H2O → oxidative ozonolysis, forming carboxylic acids or ketones.

Step 4: NH4OH → maybe neutralization.

Hmm.

Option A:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylate alkyne to R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond or diol.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxymercuration.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the target has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to the same carbon, which is also attached to the cyclohexane and an aldehyde group. So perhaps the aldehyde comes from the alkyne via ozonolysis, and the substituent (cyclohexyl and hydroxyl) comes from another reaction.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group via ozonolysis. Then, a cyclohexyl group is added via some coupling reaction, and a hydroxyl group is added via another step.

Looking at the options, option C's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. So, if we have a triple bond in the molecule, we can ozonolyze it to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's say that in step 1 and 2, we form a longer chain. Then, ozonolysis would split it into two parts, each with a carbonyl group.

But I'm not making progress. Let me consider each option's steps again.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1 which is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group and also a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the cyclohexane. And the same carbon also has an aldehyde group. But that's impossible because a carbon can't have five bonds.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the name. Maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, and the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane.

So, the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1: CH2OH attached to a cyclohexyl group. And another substituent at position 1, which is an aldehyde group (CHO).

Wait, but that can't be because position 1 can't have two different substituents. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and an OH group, and the same carbon also has an aldehyde group. That's not possible with four bonds. So perhaps the structure is different.

Maybe the target is a cyclohexane where one of the carbons has a CH2-OH group attached to a cyclohexyl group, and that same carbon also has an aldehyde group. Wait, but that would require five bonds. So I'm definitely missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group (i.e., a CH2 group connected to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group), and the same carbon as the substituent also has an aldehyde group. But that would require five bonds, which isn't possible. So perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and an aldehyde group on the same carbon. Hmm, but that's impossible.

I think I'm stuck on the structure. Maybe I should focus on the reagents again.

Looking at option C: steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; O3/ (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Wait, after step 2, if the triple bond was hydrogenated to a single bond, then step 3 (ozonolysis) wouldn't do anything. So maybe that's not the right option.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol, step 2 is Li/liq NH3, step 3 is O3/ (CH3)2S, step 4 is NH4OH.

Hmm, perhaps the steps are:

1. Form an acetylide and add a hydroxymethyl group.

2. Use Li and NH3 for some deprotonation or coupling.

3. Ozonolyze a double bond to form an aldehyde.

But I'm not getting it.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the triple bond is first converted into an alkyne with a methyl group, then hydrogenated into a cis or trans alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the alkene into two carbonyl groups. Then, perhaps perform a reaction to add a cyclohexyl group and hydroxyl group.

Option C's steps: step 1 adds a methyl group to the triple bond, step 2 hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond (so no double bond), step 3 is ozonolysis which wouldn't do anything. So that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis or trans alkene.

2. Ozonolyze the alkene to form two carbonyls.

3. Add a cyclohexyl group and hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing that in any option.

Another approach: the target has an aldehyde group, which suggests that the triple bond was oxidized into a carbonyl. Ozonolysis can do that. So perhaps the first step is ozonolysis.

Wait, but looking at the options, only option C and D have ozonolysis as step 3.

Wait, let's say in the correct option, the first step is deprotonation and alkylation, then hydrogenation to a double bond, then ozonolysis to form an aldehyde, then adding the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde comes from the alkyne via oxidation, and the other groups are added via other methods.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct reagents in each step.

The target requires an aldehyde group and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → convert triple bond to aldehyde.

2. Add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to the same carbon.

But how?

Wait, another idea: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via oxidation, then the ketone is subjected to a nucleophilic addition to introduce the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation (like with O3), forming a diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, but without seeing the options, this is difficult.

Looking again at option C: after ozonolysis, the next step is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is used in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but more commonly in elimination reactions or for forming enolates.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the target has a formyl group. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl via ozonolysis, and the other groups are added via some kind of alkylation or substitution.

The correct sequence would involve ozonolysis to make the aldehyde, then adding the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

But let's think about the steps in each option.

Option C:

After steps 1 and 2, perhaps the molecule has a longer chain, which upon ozonolysis would give the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the first two steps are:

1. Alkyne → alkylated alkyne (R-C≡C-CH3).

2. Hydrogenate to single bond (R-CH2-CH2-CH3).

But then ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So no.

Option D:

Step 1: Acetylide + methanol → perhaps R-C≡C-OCH3.

Step 2: Li and NH3 → perhaps deprotonate to form a strong base, leading to some reaction.

Not sure.

Option B:

Step 1: alkylate alkyne with ethyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li, liq NH3 → perhaps Birch reduction or deprotonation.

Step 3: O3, H2O → ozonolysis forms carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → work-up.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate alkyne to form acetylide.

2. Alkylate to add a methyl group → R-C≡C-CH3.

3. Hydrogenate to cis-alkene → R-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but that's a single bond, not a double bond).

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation to a trans alkene, but that's not possible with H2/Pd.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is catalytic hydrogenation to a cis alkene using a different catalyst, but I'm not sure.

Assuming step 2 gives a cis-alkene, then step 3 is ozonolysis to break it into two carbonyl groups. Then step 4 would be adding the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Another thought: perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate to form acetylide.

2. Alkylate with methyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH3.

3. Hydrogenate to alkyne → R-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that doesn't form any double bonds.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the target, it has an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexylmethyl group.

Option C's steps: after ozonolysis, perhaps the aldehyde is formed, and Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination or to form a diol.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones, or for elimination reactions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide.

2. Alkylate with methyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH3.

3. Hydrogenate triple bond to cis-alkene → R-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but that's a single bond again).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, because after alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule has a longer chain which, when ozonolyzed, gives the aldehyde. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: to form the target, we need to introduce a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So perhaps a Grignard reagent is used, which would require a ketone or aldehyde to add the groups.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Convert the alkyne to an aldehyde via ozonolysis.

2. Perform a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

But how?

So, if the aldehyde is formed, then perhaps a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group, but then how to get the hydroxyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps a conjugate addition is used, but I'm not sure.

I'm really stuck, but perhaps I should pick the option that includes ozonolysis (steps 3 in options C and D) followed by reagents that can add a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group.

Looking at option D's steps:

Step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S → reductive work-up to aldehydes.

Step 4 is NH4OH, which could be for work-up, maybe adding hydroxyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which could be for elimination or forming epoxides, but I'm not sure.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but more commonly it's used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones (with H2O2) or in elimination reactions.

Hmm.

Another thought: the target has a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. That suggests that the substituent is a secondary alcohol attached to a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps the substituent is formed via an addition reaction to a carbonyl group, followed by reduction.

Wait, perhaps after forming the aldehyde, a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group, forming a secondary alcohol.

But I'm not sure which option includes that.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this, and perhaps the correct answer is option C.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the analysis of the options involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to achieve the transformations required. The target molecule contains a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (aldehyde) and a substituent that is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. This suggests that the synthesis must involve converting the alkyne into an aldehyde and introducing the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups appropriately.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Likely forms an acetylide intermediate and alkylates it with methyl chloride, resulting in a longer alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₃).
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond (R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: Could induce elimination or diol formation, but it is unclear how this leads to the target structure.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Suggests oxymercuration, but no clear pathway to introduce the aldehyde or the hydroxyl group.

This sequence does not align with the target structure, as ozonolysis (required to form the aldehyde) is missing.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne to form R-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely forms a strong base or facilitates a coupling reaction, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃, H₂O**: Ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds, but the intermediate after step 2 is unclear.
4. **NH₄OH**: Could neutralize or reduce intermediates, but no clear pathway to the target structure is evident.

This sequence does not provide a clear path to the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Forms an acetylide intermediate and alkylates it with methyl chloride, resulting in R-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond (R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive work-up would cleave double bonds, but no double bond is present after step 2, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: Could facilitate elimination or diol formation, but it does not align with the target structure.

This sequence does not effectively produce the target molecule due to the lack of a double bond for ozonolysis to act on.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Forms an acetylide intermediate, which reacts with methanol to form R-C≡C-OCH₃ (a methyl ether).
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely facilitates a Birch reduction or deprotonation, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive work-up would cleave double bonds, but the intermediate after step 2 does not contain a double bond.
4. **NH₄OH**: Could neutralize or reduce intermediates, but no clear pathway to the target structure is evident.

This sequence does not provide a clear path to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly and directly produce the target molecule. However, **Option C** is the most plausible due to its inclusion of ozonolysis, which is necessary to form the aldehyde group. The other steps, despite their ambiguities, align more closely with the transformations required than the other options.
