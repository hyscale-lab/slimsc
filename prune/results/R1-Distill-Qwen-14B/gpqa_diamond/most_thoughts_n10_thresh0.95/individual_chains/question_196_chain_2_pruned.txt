Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is the relativistic version, so things are probably more complicated.

The problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max. Oh, and the speed of light is c, so there's definitely some relativistic effects to consider here.

In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy at maximum displacement A is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (where speed is max) would be equal to that potential energy. So the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's non-relativistic. Since the problem is relativistic, that can't be the answer here.

Relativistic mechanics... Right, in relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential as in the classical case. The total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy. So the total energy E should be the sum of rest mass energy (mc²) and kinetic energy. But wait, wait. In the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the potential plus kinetic. But in the relativistic case, when the particle is at maximum displacement A, all energy is potential. Then, when it reaches the equilibrium point, all that energy converts into kinetic energy. But wait, the kinetic energy in relativity isn't (1/2)mv²; it's (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's think: at maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², just like before. But wait, no, wait. Hold on, in the relativistic case, the potential energy might not be exactly (1/2)kA². Because the force is F = -kx, which is the same as the non-relativistic case, but the equations of motion would involve relativistic momentum.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the total energy includes the rest mass energy. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the total energy E is the sum of potential energy and rest mass energy. So E = (1/2)kA² + mc². Then, at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic plus the rest mass energy.

Wait, but when x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is just mc² plus the kinetic energy. Wait, no. No, wait, that can't be right. Because when the oscillator is at x=A, all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA². When it's at x=0, all that energy is kinetic. But wait, but in reality, the rest mass energy is mc², so the total energy would be mc² plus the kinetic energy (since kinetic is a form of energy, but in relativity, the total energy is mc² plus kinetic).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the steps again.

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)kA². This energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, which are equal when the particle is at the equilibrium position. But in that case, the KE is (1/2)mv_max², so v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But since this is relativistic, perhaps the approach is different.

In the relativistic case, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So when the oscillator is at x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc². Wait, no, wait. Because in the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, since the particle's momentum is relativistic, the potential energy may be different. Or perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the total energy includes the rest mass energy.

Wait, maybe the setup is that the oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)kx^2, just like before, but the energy considerations are different. So when the oscillator is at x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA^2. The total energy E would then be (1/2)kA^2 plus the rest energy mc^2, right? Because when it's at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential (assuming it starts from rest, but maybe in this case, it's moving with maximum speed when x=0; but I'm a bit confused about that).

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So at x=0, the potential is zero, so all the energy is kinetic plus rest. So E = mc^2 + K, where K is the kinetic energy (which is (gamma - 1) mc^2).

Wait, but at maximum displacement x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA^2, and the kinetic energy is zero because the velocity is zero there. So the total energy E would be (1/2)kA^2 + mc^2.

Then, when the oscillator is at x=0, all of that energy E goes into kinetic energy. So E = (gamma) mc^2. Because gamma mc^2 includes the rest and kinetic energy.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1) mc². So E = gamma mc².

So at x=A, the potential is (1/2)kA² and the kinetic is zero. So E = (1/2)kA^2 + mc².

At x=0, E = gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So set them equal:

gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc².

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Let me write that as:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but wait, let's compute gamma in terms of v.

gamma = [1/(sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)))].

We can square both sides:

gamma² = 1/(1 - (v²/c²)).

So,

gamma² = 1/(1 - v²/c²).

But gamma is given by 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²) = (2 mc² + k A²) / (2 mc²).

Wait, let's rearrange the equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is also equal to 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c^2)).

So,

1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Let me compute the denominator on the RHS:

Denominator = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

So,

1 - v²/c² = [ (2 m c^2) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ]².

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Let me define a term for clarity.

Let me let D = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + D)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + D)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + D)^2 ].

Which can be written as:

v²/c² = [ (1 + D)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Expanding the numerator:

(1 + 2D + D²) - 1 = 2D + D².

So,

v²/c² = (2D + D²) / (1 + D)^2.

Factor numerator:

D(2 + D) / (1 + D)^2.

But D is small compared to 1 if kA is much less than mc², but if kA is comparable to mc², then it's not. So, perhaps the expression can be simplified.

But maybe it's better to substitute D back in terms of k, A, m, c.

D = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v²/c² = [ (2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) ) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² ] / [ (1 + k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ]².

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) ) = (k A²)/(m c²).

So numerator becomes (k A²/(m c²)) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Denominator is [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]² = (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (2 m c²)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (4 m² c^4) ) ].

Let me simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (k A^2/(m c^2)) [1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2) ) ].

Denominator: [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2 ] / (4 m² c^4).

Wait, perhaps cross-multiplying.

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4)) ) * 4 m² c^4 ) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Compute numerator inside:

(k A²/(m c²)) * 4 m² c^4 = 4 m c² k A².

(k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) )* 4 m² c^4 = k² A^4.

So numerator is [4 m c² k A² + k² A^4].

Denominator is (2 m c² + k A²)^2.

So,

v²/c² = (4 m c² k A² + k² A^4) / (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Factor numerator:

k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ) / (2 m c² + k A²)^2.

Wait, 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 = k A² (4 m c² + k A²).

Hmm, but denominator is (2 m c² + k A²)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

But wait, 4 m c² + k A² is equal to (2 m c² + k A²) + 2 m c^2. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, notice that 4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c²) + k A², but not helpful.

Alternatively, let's factor the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: k A² (4 m c² + k A²) = k A² (2 * 2 m c² + k A²).

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Hmm, perhaps we can write it as:

( [k A² (2 m c² + k A² + 2 m c²)] ) / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to factor the denominator as (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in earlier steps. Let me double-check.

Earlier, when calculating the numerator, after substitution, I had:

v²/c² = (2D + D²) / (1 + D)^2, where D = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

2D = 2*(k A²)/(2 m c²) ) = (k A²)/(m c²).

D^2 = (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

2D + D^2 = (k A²/(m c²)) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(m c²)) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / ( (1 + D)^2 ).

But 1 + D = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

(1 + D)^2 = (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (4 m² c^4).

So, denominator in the main expression is [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2 / (4 m^2 c^4) ) ].

Putting it all together:

v²/c² = [ (k A²/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] * [4 m² c^4 ] / (2 m c² + k A²)^2.

Multiplying numerator terms:

(k A²/(m c²)) * 4 m^2 c^4 = 4 m c^2 k A^2.

(k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4) *4 m^2 c^4 = k^2 A^4.

So, numerator becomes [4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4].

Denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2.

Factor the numerator: k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) )

So,

v²/c² = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, let's factor the denominator as (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = [ (2 m c^2) + (k A^2) ]^2.

The numerator is k A^2 [ 4 m c^2 + k A^2 ].

Wait, 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps factor 4 m c^2 + k A^2 as 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2.

But I'm not seeing a clear way to simplify that. Maybe I should try to factor out 2 m c^2 or something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps write the numerator as (2 m c^2 + k A^2 + 2 m c^2) ) *k A^2.

Wait, 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2) + 2 m c^2.

So,

v²/c² = [k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2) + 2 m c^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Which is,

= [k A^2 ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2) + 2 m c^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

= [k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 + 2 m c^2) ) ] / denominator^2.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, 4m c² is 2*(2 m c²), so hmm.

Let me think differently. Let me denote B = 2 m c² + k A².

So,

B = 2 m c² + k A².

Then,

Numerator: k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2) = k A^2 ( (2 m c²) + (2 m c²) + k A^2 ) = k A^2 ( (2 m c² + k A^2) + 2 m c² ) = k A^2 ( B + 2 m c² ).

Wait, okay, so numerator becomes k A² (B + 2 m c²).

Denominator is B².

So,

v²/c² = [k A² (B + 2 m c²) ] / B².

But B is 2 m c² + k A², so B + 2 m c² = 4 m c² + k A^2 = (2 m c²) * 2 + k A².

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can factor something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express v in terms of gamma.

Wait, earlier we had:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is also 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me call (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as D again.

So,

1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + D.

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + D).

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + D)^2.

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2.

Which is,

v²/c² = [ (1 + D)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Expanding numerator,

(1 + 2 D + D² - 1 ) = 2 D + D².

So,

v²/c² = (2 D + D²)/(1 + D)^2.

Wait, but this is the same as before. So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 D + D²)/(1 + D)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ D (2 + D) ] ) / (1 + D).

But D = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)).

Hmm, let's compute this step by step.

First, let me compute D = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

2 + D = 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) = (4 m c² + k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

Numerator inside sqrt becomes:

D * (2 + D) = [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] * [ (4 m c² + k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

= (k A^2)(4 m c² + k A^2) ) / (4 m^2 c^4).

So,

sqrt( numerator ) = sqrt( [k A² (4 m c² +k A^2) ] ) / (2 m c^2).

Wait, sqrt( (k A² (4 m c² +k A^2) ) ) = A sqrt(k (4 m c² + k A^2)).

Wait, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the entire expression as:

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 D + D^2) ) / (1 + D).

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( D (2 + D) ) / (1 + D).

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor it differently.

Wait, 2 D + D^2 = D (2 + D).

So,

sqrt( D (2 + D) ) = sqrt( D ) * sqrt(2 + D).

But I don't know if that helps.

Wait, but another approach. Let me compute the expression for v_max.

Let me write v_max as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [D (2 + D)] ) / (1 + D).

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt(D) * sqrt(2 + D) / (1 + D).

But D is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), so sqrt(D) is sqrt(k A²/(2 m c²)) ) = A sqrt( k/(2 m c²) ).

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to make substitutions for simplification.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator in a different way.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute (1 + D)^2 in terms of the denominator.

We have:

v²/c² = [2 D + D²] / (1 + D)^2.

We can write this as:

v²/c² = [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can write (2 + D) = (1 + D) + 1.

But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps to factor D(2 + D) as (2 D + D^2), which is the same as earlier.

It's getting a bit tangled, perhaps I should look at the answer options to see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m) )^2 ) )

Hmm, not similar.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2) )) )

Wait, let me write that.

Option B: sqrt(1 + [1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] )

Wait, that seems different.

Wait, option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c²) ) )^2 ) )

Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, let's compute our expression again:

v²/c² =  [2 D + D² ] / (1 + D)^2.

We can write this as [D (2 + D)] / (1 + D)^2.

Let me factor D as (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

But perhaps another approach: Let me compute the entire expression as a function of D.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute (1 + D)^2 = 1 + 2 D + D².

And numerator is 2 D + D².

So,

[2 D + D²]/(1 + 2 D + D²) = [D (2 + D) ] / ( (1 + D)^2 )

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute terms
