Okay, I'm trying to tackle this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, the question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, I guess I need to consider how relativity affects the calculations.

The setup is a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A, obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. The options involve some expressions with c, the speed of light, so relativity is definitely in play here.

In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is also (1/2)mv_max². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but I don't think that's the right answer here because we're considering relativity.

Wait, but relativity comes into play when velocities approach the speed of light. So maybe in this problem, the maximum speed is such that relativistic effects can't be ignored. So perhaps I need to use relativistic equations of motion or energy.

I remember that in relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does this tie into the oscillator?

The oscillator's potential energy in relativity might not be the same as the classical case. Alternatively, perhaps the system's energy includes both rest mass energy and the potential energy from the spring. So maybe the total energy is E = gamma mc² + (1/2)kA² or something like that. Or wait, no, in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is conserved, so at maximum displacement, all energy is potential, and at equilibrium (zero displacement), all is kinetic. But relativistically, it's not so straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the oscillator's equation of motion is modified in relativity. The classical equation is F = -kx = m d²x/dt². But relativistically, perhaps the mass becomes gamma m, but I'm not sure. Wait, in special relativity, the momentum p is gamma m v, and F is d p /dt. So F = d/dt (gamma m v). But the problem states that the oscillator obeys F = -kx. So the equation becomes d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

That seems complicated because it's a nonlinear differential equation due to the gamma term. Solving that might be tough, but perhaps we can find the maximum speed using energy considerations.

At maximum amplitude A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At that point, the total energy E would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy from the spring. Wait, but in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is just the potential energy at maximum displacement. But relativistically, perhaps the total energy includes the rest mass energy plus the potential energy.

Wait, no. The rest mass energy is mc², and then the oscillator's potential adds to that. So the total energy E is mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum. At that point, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is all kinetic. But relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv²; it's (gamma - 1) mc².

So setting the total energy equal at both points:

At x = A: E = mc² + (1/2)kA²
At x = 0: E = (gamma) mc² - mc² (since kinetic energy is gamma mc² minus rest energy? Wait no, the rest energy is mc², and the total energy is gamma mc², so the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, perhaps I should model it correctly. The total mechanical energy in the classical case is E = (1/2)kA². But in relativity, perhaps the energy is higher because the mass increases as it moves.

Alternatively, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So the total energy is gamma mc², where gamma is evaluated at maximum speed v_max. So:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A²

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Hmm, let me square both sides to get rid of the square root. Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as a term for simplicity. Let’s call this term B: B = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So gamma = 1 + B.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + B)^2

Which gives:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + B)^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2

Which can be rewritten as:

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + B)^2 ]

Let me compute 1 - [1/(1+B)^2 ] as:

( (1+B)^2 -1 ) / (1+B)^2 )

Which is [ (1 + 2B + B²) -1 ] / (1+B)^2 = (2B + B²) / (1+B)^2 )

So,

v² = c² * (2B + B²) / (1 + B)^2 )

But since B is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), which could be small, but perhaps not necessarily. Let's see if we can factor this expression.

Wait, let me write 2B + B² = B(2 + B). And denominator is (1 + B)^2.

So,

v²/c² = ( B (2 + B) ) / (1 + B)^2 )

But B is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), which is (k A²)/(2 m c² ). Let me denote that as (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) = [ (k A^2)/(2 m) ] / c^2.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me expand the expression for v_max.

Wait, let me consider that B is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). So:

v²/c² = [ (2B + B²) ] / (1 + B)^2 = [ B (2 + B) ] / (1 + B)^2

We can factor the numerator and denominator:

Hmm, if B is small compared to 1, then B² is negligible, and we can approximate:

v² ≈ c² [ (2B) / (1)^2 ) ] = 2B c² = [ (2 * (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ] c² = (k A²)/(m )

Which brings us back to the classical result, which makes sense when speeds are low (v << c). So the relativistic expression must be a correction to this.

But the question is about the maximum speed, so the formula I arrived at is:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (2B + B²) ] / (1 + B)^2 )

But I'm trying to match this with the options given.

Let me compute the expression inside the sqrt:

(2B + B²)/(1 + B)^2 = [ B(2 + B) ] / (1 + B)^2

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently.

Alternatively, let me look at the options to see which one could match.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))^2 )

Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

That doesn't look right either.

Option C is the classical result, which we've dismissed as non-relativistic.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute the expression inside the sqrt in option D.

Inside the sqrt: 1 - 1/(1 + C)^2, where C = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 - [1/(1 + C)^2 ] = [ (1 + C)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + C)^2

Which is [ 1 + 2C + C² -1 ] / (1 + C)^2 = (2C + C²) / (1 + C)^2

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * (2C + C^2)/(1 + C)^2

Which is the same as what I derived earlier, because C is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), which is same as B.

Wait, wait, in my earlier derivation, I had B = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so C = B.

Hmm, so option D is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + C)^2 ) where C = B.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2C + C^2) / (1 + C)^2 ]

Which is exactly what I derived.

So the correct option is D.

Wait, but let me double-check.

In my initial approach, I set the total energy at x=A as E = mc² + (1/2)k A², and at x=0, E = gamma mc².

So,

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A²

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as gamma = 1 + C.

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + C

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + C)^2

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + C)^2 = [ (1 + C)^2 -1 ]/(1 + C)^2 )

Expanding numerator: 1 + 2C + C² -1 = 2C + C².

So,

v²/c² = (2C + C²)/(1 + C)^2 )

Which is the same as [ C(2 + C) ] / (1 + C)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2C + C²) ) / (1 + C) )

Which is what option D gives.

Option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which, as I saw, simplifies to the same expression.

So the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and spring constant \( k \), we consider the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the potential energy of the spring \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \) at maximum displacement. At the equilibrium position (where the velocity is maximum), all energy is kinetic, given by \( \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

Equating the total energy at both points:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Let \( C = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + C
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + C)^2
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + C)^2}
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + C)^2}
\]

Simplifying the expression:

\[
v^2/c^2 = \frac{(1 + C)^2 - 1}{(1 + C)^2} = \frac{2C + C^2}{(1 + C)^2}
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{\frac{2C + C^2}{(1 + C)^2}}
\]

Substituting \( C = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), this matches the form of option D:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}
\]

The other options do not align with this derivation. Option A introduces an incorrect denominator, option B has an incorrect expression under the square root, and option C corresponds to the classical result, which ignores relativistic effects.
