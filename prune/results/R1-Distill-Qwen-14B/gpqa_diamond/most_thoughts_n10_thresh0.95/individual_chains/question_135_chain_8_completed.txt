Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let's see what it's about. Hmm.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). I'm a bit rusty on my notation, but I think the λ is the coupling constant, and the fermion fields ψ are for different types of fermions. The term inside the parentheses includes the vacuum expectation value (vev) υ and the boson field X(y). 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing possible fermion-antifermion pairs that X can decay into.

So, I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into. Since the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, the possible decay products would depend on which fermions are involved in the interaction term. Wait, but in the Lagrangian, I see ψf, which probably denotes fermion fields of different flavors. So, f must be a generic index for fermion species.

Wait, wait, the Lagrangian is written as -λf ψ̄f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo in the way it's written. Maybe it's supposed to be λ times some coupling, but more importantly, the interaction is with the fermion fields ψf. So, for each fermion f, the interaction is present.

So, when X decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decays would depend on which fermions are present in the interaction. So, the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair (ff̄) that it can interact with.

But wait, the question is about the kinematic possibility. So, for a decay to be allowed, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion because each fermion would take some energy. So, the fermion mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV because X is 6 GeV.

But wait, wait! The fermions in the Standard Model have various masses. The top quark is the heaviest, around 173 GeV. So, any fermion heavier than 3 GeV would not be allowed because 2m_f must be ≤ 6 GeV. So, m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So, which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV? Let's list the known fermions:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): mass about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down (d): ~0.003 GeV (but wait, depends on the quark, but up and down are the lightest)
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the bottom quark is about 4.7 GeV. So, 2*m_b would be about 9.4 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So, X can't decay into b b̄ because that would require X's mass to be at least twice the bottom mass. So, b quark is out.

So, possible fermions are those with m_f ≤3 GeV. Let's see:

Leptons: e, μ, τ are okay because 2*1.777 GeV is about 3.55 GeV, which is more than 6? Wait, wait no: 2*1.777 is about 3.55 GeV. Which is less than 6 GeV. Wait, 1.777 *2 is 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So, X can decay into τ⁺τ⁻. Similarly, e and μ are even lighter, so all their masses are way under 3 GeV.

For quarks:

u, d, s, c.

u and d are at ~0.003 GeV each, so 2*m_u is negligible.

s quark: 0.095 GeV, so 2*0.095 is 0.19 GeV, which is way under 6 GeV.

c quark: 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5 is 3 GeV, which is exactly the threshold. So, X can decay into c c̄ because 3 GeV ≤6 GeV. So, c is allowed.

But what about the top quark? No, top is way too heavy, so t is out.

What about the bottom quark? As I thought before, 4.7 GeV, so 9.4 GeV needed. X is 6 GeV, so can't decay into b b̄.

So, the possible fermion-antifermion pairs would be:

For leptons: e⁺e⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, τ⁺τ⁻.

For quarks: u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but in the given Lagrangian, it's written as ψf, which includes all these fermions. So, the possible decay channels for X would be each of these pairs.

Now, look at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, e⁺e⁻.

Wait, but X can't decay into b b̄ because 2*m_b >6 GeV. So, option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻.

So, includes c c̄, which is allowed because 3 GeV is allowed. Does the Lagrangian allow c quarks? It depends on whether the coupling λ is the same for all fermions. The question says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, which is for fermions ψf. So, the interaction is with all fermions, so for all f.

Wait, but wait, in the Lagrangian, the term is λf ψ̄f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, that looks a bit off. Maybe it's actually a Yukawa interaction, like λ (ψ̄ (y) X(y) ψ(y)), and the υ is the vev, but perhaps that's not crucial here. The key is that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it couples to, and that the mass allows it.

So, the possible decays are all pairs where m_f ≤3 GeV.

Thus, the allowed pairs are:

e⁺e⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, τ⁺τ⁻, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

So, looking at the options:

Option B includes all these except for the b b̄, which is excluded because m_b is too large.

Option B is: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻. So that's correct.

Option C includes top quark, which is not allowed, so C is incorrect.

Option D includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer must be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The interaction term \(-\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f (y)\) implies that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs \((f \bar{f})\) for all fermions \( f \) that it couples to. However, the decay is kinematically allowed only if the mass of \( X \) is at least twice the mass of the fermion, i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Analyze the fermion masses
The fermion masses in the Standard Model are as follows:
- **Leptons**: \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- **Quarks**: \( m_u \approx 0.003 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_d \approx 0.003 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be allowed, \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This condition is satisfied for the following fermions:
- **Leptons**: \( e, \mu, \tau \)
- **Quarks**: \( u, d, s, c \)

The bottom quark (\( b \)) is excluded because \( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), and the top quark (\( t \)) is also excluded due to its extremely high mass (\( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Step 2: Evaluate the options
The allowed decay channels are:
- \( X \to e^+ e^- \)
- \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \)
- \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \)
- \( X \to u \bar{u} \)
- \( X \to d \bar{d} \)
- \( X \to s \bar{s} \)
- \( X \to c \bar{c} \)

Now, compare these with the given options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which matches the allowed decays. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( X \to t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
