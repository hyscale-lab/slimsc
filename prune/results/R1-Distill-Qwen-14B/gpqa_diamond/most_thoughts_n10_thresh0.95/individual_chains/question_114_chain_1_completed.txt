Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let me start by breaking it down.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's a ketone. Adding NaCN... I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones under certain conditions. Wait, isn't that the case for the formation of cyanohydrins? Oh right, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, like from NaCN, in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the product would have both a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon that was the carbonyl carbon. That fits with the product given, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

So for the first reaction, the reagent A must be an acid. Because the cyanide ion is a good nucleophile, but in the presence of a protic acid, it helps in the reaction by protonating the ketone, making it a better electrophile. So A is probably H3O+ which is a strong acid. Or maybe something else, but the options for A in the choices are H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Oh, wait, that's used in the sulfonation of ketones, like in the Hinsberg reaction? Or maybe more relevantly, in the formation of bisulfite adducts. But for the cyanohydrin formation, the typical reagent is a strong acid like H2SO4 or H3O+. So in that case, A would be H3O+, which is option A or B.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's treated with reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, what's happening here? The nitrile group (CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (COOH). So the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid. I remember that hydrolysis of nitriles under certain conditions can yield different products. For instance, under strong acidic conditions and heat, nitriles can hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, under basic conditions, they might form amides or other intermediates.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group. So the nitrile is adjacent to an OH group. So when the nitrile is hydrolyzed, it becomes a COOH group. So how is that done?

The typical conditions for nitrile to carboxylic acid hydrolysis are either using H2O with an acid catalyst, like HCl, or in the presence of a base. Wait, I think concentrated HCl is used. Alternatively, maybe it's H2O with HCl as the catalyst. Because hydrolysis of nitriles usually requires an acid or base and heat.

So reagent B is H2O, but what is the catalyst? The options for B are HCl or CH3COOH. So the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually needs a strong acid. So if B is HCl, then the reaction would proceed. So in the second step, when the nitrile is treated with H2O and B, which is HCl, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Putting it together, the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, and the second uses HCl as B. Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → this matches what I thought.

Wait, but let me double-check. The first reaction is a ketone reacting with NaCN and an acid. Yes, so A is acid, so H3O+.

Second reaction: nitrile to carboxylic acid. Needs acid, so HCl would be the catalyst. So B is HCl.

So the correct options would be A) A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Looking at the options:

Option A says A = H3O+, B = HCl. That's what I concluded. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but another thought: could B be CH3COOH? Because sometimes weaker acids are used. But for nitrile hydrolysis, I think stronger acids are needed because the reaction typically requires heat and strong conditions. For example, using HCl or H2SO4. So CH3COOH might not be strong enough, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another point: the first reaction is forming a cyanohydrin. So that's an acid-catalyzed addition. So A is H3O+.

So the answer would be option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the ketone, making it more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for this reaction, as it facilitates the formation of the cyanohydrin product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl is the appropriate reagent, as it provides the necessary acidic environment for the hydrolysis reaction to proceed, yielding 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Thus, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
