Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy (E_X = 8 GeV), the mass (m_X = 1.2 GeV), and the width (Γ_X = 320 MeV). The options are A to D, each a different distance in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and velocity. Oh right, the formula is usually something like distance = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, and β is the velocity relative to the speed of light.

But how do I find τ here? Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. Γ is the total decay width, and it's related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. 

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units here. The width Γ is given in MeV, and energy is in units of GeV. Let me convert all units to the same system. Let's think in terms of natural units first, where ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s and c ≈ 3 × 10^8 m/s.

So, first, let me calculate τ. Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.0569e-24 seconds. Wait, does that make sense? Because a small Γ would mean a longer lifetime, which makes sense. So with Γ = 0.32 GeV, the lifetime is about 2e-24 seconds. Seems reasonable for a particle with a short lifetime.

Next, I need to find the velocity β. Hmm, how do I find β? I think it relates to the energy and mass. The total energy E is given as 8 GeV. The relativistic energy equation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for p, the momentum.

Wait, but maybe another approach. The energy E is the total energy, so we can write E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Alternatively, since the problem gives E as the production energy, which might be the total energy. So yes, E is the total energy.

To find β, I can use the relation β = (p c²)/(E m), but maybe it's easier to use the relation β = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)). Let me see. Wait, another way: from E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2. So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2. Then p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/(c). But I might not need p directly; perhaps β is (p c) / E. Because β = v/c, and v = (pc²)/(E). So β = (p c) / E. Or, using E = γ m c² and p = γ m v, so β = v/c = (p c) / (γ m c²) ) = (p c)/(E). So yes, β = (p c) / E.

Wait, but perhaps a more straightforward approach is to use the relation β = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4))? Wait, no. Let me think in terms of units. Let's compute β² as 1 - (m² c^4)/(E²). So m_X is 1.2 GeV, and E is 8 GeV.

So, m_X^2 c^4 = (1.2 GeV)^2. E^2 = (8 GeV)^2.

So β² = 1 - ( (1.2)^2 )/(8^2 ) = 1 - (1.44)/(64) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So β = sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute that. The square root of 0.9775—let's see, sqrt(0.98) is approximately 0.9899, so sqrt(0.9775) is a bit less. Wait, 0.9899^2 = 0.98, so 0.9899^2 is 0.9799. Hmm, no. Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute 0.9775^(1/2). So, 0.9775 is 1 - 0.0225. Let me compute sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ sqrt(0.9775). Let's see, using a binomial approximation: sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 for small x. So x is 0.0225, so sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 1 - (0.0225)/2 = 1 - 0.01125 = 0.98875. Let me check that. 0.98875^2 = ?

0.98875^2 = (0.98)^2 + 2*(0.98)*(0.00875) + (0.00875)^2 ≈ 0.9604 + 2*0.98*0.00875 + 0.00007656. 0.98*0.00875 is about 0.008575, so 2 times that is ~0.01715. So 0.9604 + 0.01715 = 0.97755. Then adding 0.00007656 gives ~0.9776. So yeah, 0.98875^2 ≈ 0.9776, which is close to 0.9775. So β ≈ 0.9888.

So β is approximately 0.9888, meaning the particle is moving at about 98.88% the speed of light.

Now, the mean decay distance is c * τ * β.

Wait, let me think. The lifetime τ is the mean lifetime. The distance is how far the particle travels before decaying. So distance = velocity * time. Velocity is β c, so distance = β c * τ.

Wait, but τ is the mean lifetime, so yes. So putting it all together:

distance = β c τ.

We've got τ = ħ / Γ. Let me plug in all the numbers.

Given:
ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s
Γ_X = 0.32 GeV
c = 3e8 m/s
β ≈ 0.9888

So, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, distance = β * c * τ.

So, compute each part:

β c τ = 0.9888 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, let me compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

3e8 is 3 × 10^8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 × 10^(8-24) = 6.170625 × 10^-16 m.

Then, multiply by β (0.9888):

6.170625e-16 m * 0.9888 ≈ let's compute 6.170625 * 0.9888.

6 * 0.9888 is about 5.9328; 0.170625 * 0.9888 ≈ 0.1688. So adding together: 5.9328 + 0.1688 = 6.1016. So approximately 6.1016e-16 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, they are about 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Hmm, but that gives me about 6e-16 meters, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the product more carefully.

Compute 6.170625e-16 * 0.9888.

6.170625 * 0.9888: Let me compute 6 * 0.9888 = 5.9328. Then 0.170625 * 0.9888 ≈ 0.170625 * 0.9888.

Wait, 0.170625 * 1 = 0.170625, so 0.170625 * 0.9888 is approximately 0.170625 * (1 - 0.0112) ≈ 0.170625 - (0.170625 * 0.0112) = 0.170625 - 0.001916 ≈ 0.168709.

So total is 5.9328 + 0.168709 = 6.1015... So 6.1015e-16 m. Hmm. 

But the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, none of these are close to 6e-16. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of β. Let me double-check that.

Wait, earlier I used β² = 1 - (m^2)/(E^2). Let me check:

m_x is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV.

So (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

So beta squared is 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the square root. Let me calculate sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor in the calculation of the decay distance. Oh wait! Wait a second. The mean decay length is often given by c * τ * β, but perhaps I forgot to account for relativistic factors correctly.

Wait, another approach: The mean decay length L is c * τ * β. But I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of τ. Let's recheck.

τ = ħ / Γ.

Given Γ is 0.32 GeV. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that.

6.582 / 0.32 = approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. That part seems correct.

So the calculation before gives me about 6.1e-16 meters. But the options don't include that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me check the units again.

Wait, the width is given in MeV, so Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. That's correct.

Energy E is 8 GeV. Mass is 1.2 GeV. So all the GeV units are consistent.

Wait, perhaps the formula for decay length is different? Wait, another thought: The mean proper lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. But when the particle is moving, the observed lifetime is γ τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. So the mean decay length is velocity times the observed lifetime. So L = β c γ τ.

Wait, but that complicates things. Wait, let me think. The lifetime τ is the proper lifetime (in the rest frame). In the lab frame, the lifetime is γ τ. So the distance is v * lifetime in lab frame, which is β c * γ τ.

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) ) = E/(m c²). Wait, E is given as 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So gamma is 8/(1.2)=6.666666... So gamma = 6.6667.

So then, the decay length is L = β c gamma tau.

Wait, but earlier I calculated L = beta c tau. So if I forgot the gamma factor, then the result would be too small. So perhaps that's where I went wrong.

Wait, let's clarify. The mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So tau_lab = gamma * tau.

So the distance is L = v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau.

Which would be L = beta gamma c tau.

Ah, that's the mistake! I forgot the gamma factor earlier.

So I need to compute L = beta gamma c tau.

So let's recompute.

We have beta ≈ 0.9887, gamma = 6.6667. So beta gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ let's compute that.

0.9887 * 6 = 5.9322. 0.9887 * 0.6667 ≈ approximately 0.6591. So total beta gamma ≈ 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.

Wait, more accurately: 6.6667 * 0.9887.

Let me compute 6.6667 * 0.9887.

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6591.

So sum is 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.

So beta gamma ≈ 6.5913.

Then, L = beta gamma c tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that.

First, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) × 10^(-24+8) ) = 6.170625e-16.

Then multiply by 6.5913.

6.170625e-16 m * 6.5913 ≈ ?

6 times 6.170625e-16 is 3.702375e-15.

0.5913 times 6.170625e-16 is approximately 3.648e-16.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16.

Let me compute 6.5913 * 6.170625.

6 * 6.170625 = 37.02375.

0.5913 * 6.170625 ≈ Let's compute:

0.5 * 6.170625 = 3.0853125.

0.09 * 6.170625 = 0.555356.

0.0013 * 6.170625 ≈ 0.00798.

So summing: 3.0853125 + 0.555356 = 3.6406685 + 0.00798 ≈ 3.6486485.

So total is 37.02375 + 3.6486485 ≈ 40.6723985.

So 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 = approx 40.6724e-16 m = 4.06724e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

A)5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16

Our calculated value is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the mean proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total decay width,
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy,
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) is the mass of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The mean proper lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is derived from the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(1.2)^2}{(8)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775}.
\]

Using approximations, \( \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9888 \). Thus, \( \beta \approx 0.9888 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau.
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9888 \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9888 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( 0.9888 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5913 \). Then:

\[
L = 6.5913 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

\[
L = 6.5913 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 40.672 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

\[
L \approx 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The closest option to \( 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

Answer: B
