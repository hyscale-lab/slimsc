Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

The problem gives me that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is written as Ay = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, I have to evaluate which of the given statements (A to D) is correct.

Wait, the problem also says that Ay satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ), where a is the eigenvalue and φ the eigenfunction. So I'm to compute the eigenvalues 'a' and the eigenvectors φ.

First, let me write down the matrix S. The first row is 0, -i; the second row is i, 0. So S is:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

Wait, but wait, the operator A is the angular momentum operator. For spin-½ particles, like the muon, the spin matrices are usually the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Because, for example, S_x = ħ/2 σ_x, and similar for S_y and S_z.

Oh wait, but in this problem, the matrix S is given as a 2x2 matrix. So I think in this case, S is the Pauli Y matrix. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and the Y matrix is the one with i and -i in the off-diagonal elements.

Wait, let me recall the Pauli matrices. The Y Pauli matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Yes, that's exactly S in this problem. So S is the Y Pauli matrix, σ_y.

So the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) * σ_y. Wait, but wait: the angular momentum operator for spin is usually written as A = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh, but wait, the problem defines Ay as c·S, where c is h/(4π). Let me compute what that is.

Wait, so if c is h/(4π) and S is σ_y, then Ay = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, S is a scaled version of the Pauli matrix. But let me proceed.

To find the eigenvalues, I can compute the characteristic equation for Ay. The eigenvalues 'a' satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So let me compute the matrix Ay. Ay is c * S, which is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So, the matrix elements are:

Ay11 = 0
Ay12 = (h/(4π)) * (-i) = -i h/(4π)
Ay21 = (h/(4π)) * i = i h/(4π)
Ay22 = 0

So, the matrix is:

[ 0          -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   0         ]

Wait, but when finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a 2x2 matrix, there's a formula. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, and the determinant is product minus the off-diagonal product.

Wait, but for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[c, d]], the eigenvalues are [ (a+d)/2 ± sqrt( ((a-d)^2 + 4bc ) /4 ) ].

In this case, a = 0, d =0. So trace is 0. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) = - ( (-i)(i) (h^2)/(4π)^2 ). Let's compute that.

(-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is - (1 * h²/(4π)^2 ) ?

Wait wait, no. Wait, the determinant is (0)(0) - ( (-i h/(4π)) )( (i h/(4π)) ). So it's 0 - [ (-i)(i) (h^2)/(4π)^2 ) ].

Wait, (-i)(i) is -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is 0 - [1 * h^2/(4π)^2 ] = - [ h^2/(16 π²) ].

Wait, but eigenvalues satisfy λ^2 - (trace) λ + determinant = 0. Since trace is 0, equation is λ² + (determinant) = 0. So λ² = - determinant.

Wait, wait, no: the characteristic equation is det( (Ay - λ I) ) = 0. So, the determinant is:

| -λ      ( -i h/(4π) ) |
| (i h/(4π) )  -λ      |

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - ( (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) )

So it's λ² - [ (-i)(i) h²/(4π)^2 ].

(-i)(i) is (-i^2) = 1, because i^2 is -1. So the determinant is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)).

So the equation is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. So λ² = h²/(16 π²).

Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, because sqrt( h^2/(16 π²) ) is h/(4π), since h is a positive constant.

So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π). Wait, but the options are given in terms of variables, so let me look at the options.

Looking at option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Wait, but our eigenvalues are purely real, right? Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian. Oh, wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, let me check. The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) * S, where S is σ_y. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian because their conjugate transpose equals themselves. So S is Hermitian, and c is real, so Ay would be Hermitian. So Ay is Hermitian, so eigenvalues should be real. So the eigenvalues of Ay are real numbers, ±h/(4π).

Wait, that's important. So any option talking about imaginary parts must be wrong. So looking at the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which can't be correct. So A is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts as ±0.5 and real parts ±1. That's also wrong because the eigenvalues are real.

Option C: eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm, because A is the angular momentum operator, which commutes with A², so eigenfunctions of A will also be eigenfunctions of A². So C might be correct, but I'll have to think more about it.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Wait, the basis functions would be the eigenvectors of Ay. So yes, the eigenfunctions φ are the basis for the operator, but I'm not entirely sure what this option is saying.

Wait, but let's first make sure about the eigenvalues. So my calculation shows that the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So option B and A are incorrect because they have imaginary parts. So the correct eigenvalues are real, ±h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at option A, it's about the eigenvalues. Let's see: option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

So that leaves options C and D as possible correct statements.

Now, the eigenfunctions: Let's compute them.

The matrix Ay is [[0, -i h/(4π)], [i h/(4π), 0]].

We can find the eigenvectors by solving (Ay - a I) v = 0 for each eigenvalue a.

For a = h/(4π):

Matrix becomes:

[ (-h/(4π)) , -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π) , (-h/(4π)) ]

We can write this as:

- h/(4π) [ 1, -i ] 
h/(4π) [ i, 1 ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor out h/(4π), but let's just write the equations.

The first equation: (-h/(4π)) v1 + (-i h/(4π)) v2 = 0.

Divide both sides by (h/(4π)) (non-zero), so:

- v1 -i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ v1; v2 ] = [ -i v2; v2 ].

We can choose v2 = 1, so the eigenvector is [ -i; 1 ].

Similarly for a = -h/(4π):

The matrix becomes:

[ (h/(4π)), -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), h/(4π) ]

So:

( h/(4π) ) v1 + (-i h/(4π) ) v2 = 0.

Divide by h/(4π):

v1 -i v2 = 0 → v1 = i v2.

So the eigenvector is [ i v2; v2 ], which can be written as [ i; 1 ].

Alternatively, let me write the eigenvectors as:

For a = +h/(4π): [ -i, 1 ]^T.

For a = -h/(4π): [ i, 1 ]^T.

Now, I can check if these eigenvectors are normalized. The first eigenvector: | -
