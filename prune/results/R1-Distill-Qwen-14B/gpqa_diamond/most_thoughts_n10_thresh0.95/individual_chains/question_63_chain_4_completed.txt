--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state. What's the fundamental state? Oh right, I think that's the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So for a diatomic molecule modeled by the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels come from both rotation and vibration. But wait, the question is about switching to the next lowest energy state. So which transition are we talking about here?

The molecule is currently in the fundamental state. If it absorbs a photon, it will move to the next state. But I need to figure out the momentum of the photon. Wait, momentum of a photon is related to its energy. Right, because p = E/c, where c is the speed of light. But wait, photons have energy E = hν, where h is Planck's constant and ν is the frequency. So the photon's momentum would be p = hν/c.

But wait, the problem is about a molecule in a certain state, so the energy difference between the states will determine the photon's energy needed. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state.

What's the fundamental state? For a diatomic molecule modeled by the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by the combination of vibrational and rotational energies. The vibrational energy levels are quantized, and the rotational ones too. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state could either be moving to a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So I think that would mean the smallest possible energy increase, which would probably be the next rotational state, since vibrational energy is usually higher per quantum than rotational.

Wait, but wait. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) hν + hν v, where v is the vibrational quantum number. So the energy difference between the next rotational state (J=1) and the current state (J=0) is E_rot_next = B*(1)(2) = 2B. The energy difference for the vibration would be from v=0 to v=1, which is hν.

So I need to figure out which of these is smaller, because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state should be the one that requires the least energy to get to. If E_rot (next) is less than E_vib, then the photon needed would be for the rotational transition. Otherwise, it's for the vibrational.

Let me compute both B and hν to see which is smaller.

First, given the data:
Mx = 20 amu (atomic mass units)
My = 2 amu
Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.
Angular frequency ω = 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, but the rotational constant B is given by (h/(8π² I)) where I is the moment of inertia. I = μ R², with μ being the reduced mass.

So first, compute μ. μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) amu. But wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So let me compute μ.

Mx = 20, My = 2. Sum is 22. So μ = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Converting to kg: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ Let's see, 1.818 * 1.66 is about 3.01, so 3.01e-27 kg.

I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m². So I = 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Then B = h/(8π² I). Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So B = (6.626e-34) / (8 * π² * 1.204e-46). Let's compute the denominator first. 8 * π² ≈ 8 * 9.87 ≈ 78.95. 78.95 * 1.204e-46 ≈ 78.95 * 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.47e-45. So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 9.47e-45 ≈ approximately 7.0e9 rad/s.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me check. Oh wait, no, because B is in cm^-1 or energy units? Wait, no, the rotational constant B is in terms of energy per rotational quantum number.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of energy, but maybe I should have used the formula correctly. Let me double-check.

The rotational constant B is given by:

B = h / (8π² I) (in cm⁻¹, if I is in g·cm²? Or wait, I think in terms of erg·s or J·s if using SI units.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate B in terms of Joules. So, the moment of inertia I is in kg·m². So B would have units of J·s? Let me compute.

So B = h/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34 J·s) / (8 * (π)^2 * 1.204e-46 kg·m² )

Compute denominator: 8 * (approx π^2=9.8696) = 8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568. Then 78.9568 * 1.204e-46 ≈95.09e-46 ≈9.509e-45.

So B ≈ (6.626e-34) / (9.509e-45) ≈7.0e10? Wait, 6.626e-34/9.5e-45 is approximately 7.0e10? Wait, 6.626e-34 / 9.5e-45 = (6.626/9.5) * 1e11 ≈ 0.7 * 1e11 ≈7e10 s^-1. So B is about 7e10 rad/s? But wait, that seems high. Because the angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s, which is much higher. So wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers. I think I must have messed up the exponents.

Wait, I is 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. So (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². Multiply by 3.01e-27 kg: 4e-20 * 3.01e-27 = 1.204e-46 kg·m². That's correct.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So denominator: 8 π² I = 8 * π² * 1.204e-46.

Wait, 8 * π² = 78.956, so 78.956 * 1.204e-46 = let's compute 78.956 * 1.204. 78 *1.2 is 93.6, 0.956 *1.204≈1.152. So about 94.75, so 94.75e-46 = 9.475e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.475e-45 = approximately 6.626e-34 / 9.475e-45 = 6.626 /9.475 * 1e11 = ~0.7 * 1e11 = 7e10 rad/s.

Hmm, but the given angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s. So the rotational constant B is 7e10 rad/s, and the vibrational angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s.

So the energy difference for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = B*(J+1) - B*J = B*(2J+1)? Wait, no. The rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1). So from J=0 to J=1: E_1 - E_0 = B(1*2) - B(0) = 2B.

Similarly, the vibrational energy levels are E_v = (1/2) hω + hω v. So from v=0 to v=1, the energy difference is hω.

So, the energy needed for the next state would be the minimum between these two. Since the question asks for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which transition requires less energy?

ΔErot = 2B = 2 * 7e10 * h? Wait, no. Wait, B is in rad/s, and the energy is E_J = B J (J+1). But wait, B is in terms of energy per J (J+1), so E_J is in units of B multiplied by J(J+1). So the energy difference is 2B. But wait, B itself is in rad/s, but energy is in Joules. So perhaps I need to compute the actual energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energies in Joules.

So, B is about 7e10 rad/s. So for the rotational transition, the energy change is ΔErot = 2B. But wait, E_rot is actually given by (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), where ħ is h/(2π). Hmm, maybe I should have used a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy difference. hω is Planck's constant times angular frequency. Let's compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s. ω =4e14 rad/s. So hω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

For the rotational transition, the energy difference is 2B (since ΔErot = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = 2B). But B is given by h/(8π² I). Wait, so B is in units of energy per J(J+1), but I think the calculation is that E_rot = B J (J+1), but B is in cm⁻¹ if I is in g·cm². Wait, maybe I should calculate B in terms of wavenumbers (cm⁻¹), but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, let me compute B in terms of energy. Since B = h/(8 π² I), which is in J·s/(kg·m²). So units: J·s/(kg·m²) → J/(kg·m²/s²) → J/(kg·m²/s²) → kg·m²/s² * s / (kg·m²) → which is 1/s. So yes, B is in s⁻¹ (rad/s).

So E_rot for J=1 is E_J=1 = B * 1 * 2 = 2B.

But E_rot is in Joules? Wait, no. Because E_rot is B * J (J+1), and B is in s⁻¹, so E_rot would be in J·s * s⁻¹ → J. Correct.

So, E_rot = B * 2. So let's compute that.

B =7e10 rad/s → E_rot = 2 *7e10 rad/s * (h/(2π)) )? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The rotational energy levels are given in terms of B. Let me compute B in terms of energy per J.

Wait, no. The energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1). But B is in units of s⁻¹. So E_J is in J·s^{-1}? That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression.

I think the correct formula is E_J = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), where ħ is h/(2π). So ħ² is (h²)/(4 π²). So E_J = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I). So for J=1, E_J= (h² *2)/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I) * (1/2) ?? Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

E_J = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I) → since J=1, E_1 = (ħ² * 2)/(2 I) ) = ħ²/(I).

So E_rot = ħ² / I.

Hmm, let me compute that.

I is 1.204e-46 kg·m².

ħ is h/(2π) = 6.626e-34/(2π) ≈1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

E_rot = ħ² / I = (1.112e-68) / (1.204e-46) ≈ 9.23e-23 J.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 9.23e-23 J.

Now the vibrational energy difference is hω. Let's compute that.

h =6.626e-34 J·s, ω=4e14 rad/s → hω =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So comparing ΔErot=9.23e-23 J and ΔEvib=2.65e-19 J.

Clearly, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon must have energy equal to the rotational energy difference, so hν = 9.23e-23 J.

Now, the photon's momentum is p = E/c. Let's compute that.

E_photon = 9.23e-23 J.

c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.

p = E/c =9.23e-23 /3e8 = approx 3.076e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but the options are in N·s. Since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s, the answer is 3.076e-31 N·s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the smallest is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is bigger than that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the moment of inertia I.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of μ.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 *2) / (20+2) =40/22= 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

But 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ =1.81818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ let's compute 1.81818 *1.6605.

1.81818 *1.66 is approximately 3.01. So 3.01e-27 kg.

Then R is 2 angstroms =2e-10 meters.

I = μ R² =3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.01e-27 *4e-20 =1.204e-46 kg·m².

That seems correct.

So E_rot is (ħ² )/( I ) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.204e-46) → let me compute (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.10e-68.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = (approx 1.112e-68 J²s²).

I is 1.204e-46 kg m².

So E_rot =1.112e-68 /1.204e-46 = approx 9.23e-23 J.

Hmm, so that's correct.

Photon energy E_photon =9.23e-23 J.

So p = E/c =9.23e-23 /3e8 = ~3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but the options are much larger. The options are all around 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns.

Wait, 3e-31 Ns is much smaller than the options given. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the molecule is in the ground state, which is v=0, J=0, and the next state is the first excited state of vibration, which is v=1, J=0. Or maybe it's the first state that's higher, which could be vibrationally excited or rotationally excited.

Wait, but the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state possible would be the one with the smallest energy jump. So between the rotational and vibrational transitions, which requires less energy.

As we calculated, the rotational transition requires 9.23e-23 J, and the vibrational requires 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition is lower. So the photon's energy would be matching the rotational transition.

But wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, perhaps the molecule's states are considered as a combination of vibrational and rotational. So when you have the fundamental state, it's v=0, J=0.

The next state with the lowest energy could be J=1, v=0, or v=1, J=0. We need to find which has a lower energy.

So compute E_rot (J=1, v=0) and E_vib (v=1, J=0).

E_rot is 9.23e-23 J, as above. E_vib is 2.65e-19 J. So E_rot is much smaller, so the next state would be J=1, v=0.

So the photon must have energy matching the rotational transition.

But then the momentum p = E/c =9.23e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 kg m/s =3.07e-31 N s.

But looking at the options, the smallest option is D)1.4e-28 Ns. Which is four orders larger than our calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B or E_rot.

Let me compute the energy difference again. Maybe I should calculate it using the vibrational and rotational energy contributions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy levels are given by the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The transition could involve a change in either, but the lowest energy jump would come from the rotational part.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a diatomic molecule in the non-rigid rotor model, which might include centrifugal distortion, but the question says it can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, i.e., the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximation.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule is in the vibrational ground state (v=0) and the rotational ground state (J=0). So the energy is E = E_vib(0) + E_rot(0) = (1/2) hω + 0.

The next state could be either increasing J to 1 or increasing v to 1.

Which requires less energy? As E_vib is much larger than E_rot, the next state would be the one with J=1.

So the energy of the photon needed is the rotational transition energy, which is the difference between J=1 and J=0.

But let me compute this again.

E_rot(J=1) = B *1*(1+1) = 2 B.

B is the rotational constant, which is h/(8 π² I).

Earlier calculation had B=7e10 rad/s. Then E_rot(J=1) = 2 *7e10 * h/(8π² I) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the expression for E_rot and the value of B.

Wait, E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm⁻¹ (or in energy terms?) No, B is in units of energy per J (J+1). Wait, no, B is in units of s⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps I should express the rotational energy in terms of B.

Wait, for J=1, E_rot = B * 2. So if B is in units of J·s (because E_rot is in Joules), then E_rot = B * s? No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps B is in terms of Joules multiplied by s. Hmm, maybe I should compute B in terms of energy.

Wait, B is given by h/(8 π² I). So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * π² * 1.204e-46) ≈ 6.626e-34 / (9.509e-45) ≈7e10 s⁻¹.

So B=7e10 s⁻¹. So E_rot(J=1) = 2 * B * ħ, since E_rot = ħ B J (J+1).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the units. Let me think again.

The correct formula for the rotational energy is E_J = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I).

So for J=1, E_J = (ħ² * 2 )/(2 I) )= ħ²/(I).

So we can compute E_J as follows:

ħ = h/(2π) =6.626e-34 / (2π) ≈1.05457e-34 J·s.

I =1.204e-46 kg·m².

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J²·s².

E_J =1.112e-68 /1.204e-46 ≈9.23e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.23e-23 J, so its momentum p = E/c =9.23e-23 /3e8 ≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s → which is 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options don't have anything near 1e-31. The options are 1e-28 to 2e-27. Hmm, that's three orders of magnitude higher.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of E_J. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: calculate the rotational constant B in terms of wavenumbers (cm⁻¹). Because sometimes B is expressed in cm⁻¹, which is energy in Joules divided by hc.

Wait, B (in cm⁻¹) = h/(8 π² c I) * (1/(2π c)) )? Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute B as h c/(8 π² I), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, compute the rotational energy in terms of wavenumbers.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy in terms of Joules correctly.

E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I).

For J=1, E_J= (ħ² *2)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). 

So I have ħ =1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I is 1.204e-46 kg m².

E_rot =1.112e-68 /1.204e-46 = approx 9.23e-23 J.

Hmm, that's correct.

But the options are way bigger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia using reduced mass in atomic mass units.

Wait, I = μ R², but μ is in kg.

Wait, no, I think that's correct. Because R is in meters, μ in kg, so I is in kg m².

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms, but I should convert it to centimeters? No, because the moment of inertia is in SI units, so R should be in meters.

Wait, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the photon's energy is not just the rotational energy, but the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies. No, because the molecule is transitioning from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1). So the energy change is just rotational.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recalculate μ.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) * amu.

Mx=20, My=2. Sum is 22.

μ= (20 *2)/22 =40/22= 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.01e-27 kg.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute B.

B= h/(8 π² I) = 6.626e-34 / (8 * π^2 *1.204e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 * (9.8696) =78.9568. 78.9568 *1.204e-46 =78.9568 *1.204 = approx 95.09, so 95.09e-46 =9.509e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.509e-45 = approx 7.0e10 s⁻¹.

So E_rot (J=1)=2 *7e10 * ħ? Wait, no, E_rot = B J (J+1) * ħ? No, E_rot is B J (J+1) in units of s⁻¹, so to get energy, you multiply by h/(2π) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between B and the actual energy.

Wait, I think the correct formula is E_J = ħ² J (J+1) / (2 I).

Which is what I did earlier.

So E_rot = ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 /1.204e-46 ≈ 9.23e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.23e-23 J, which gives p = E/c =9.23e-23 /3e8 = ~3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options given are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

None of these are close to 3e-31. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the model is not the rigid rotor, but the non-rigid rotor, but the question says it can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the Raman transition, which involves simultaneous changes in J and v, but that's probably more advanced.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. So the energy change is purely vibrational.

In that case, the photon's energy would be hω.

h=6.626e-34 J·s, ω=4e14 rad/s → E=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, option A is 1.9e-28. So 8.83e-28 is close to option A, which is 1.9e-28? No, 8.8e-28 is larger than option A and D.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Because the vibrational energy levels are E_v = (1/2) hω + hω v. So the transition from v=0 to v=1 requires hω.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the transition to the next state, which could involve a change in both v and J. But the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." So the smallest energy jump is the rotational transition.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the fundamental vibration-rotation state, which includes both vibrational and rotational contributions. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next state is the first excited state, which could be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Which of these is lower in energy?

As we saw, E_rot for J=1 is 9.23e-23 J, and E_vib for v=1 is 2.65e-19 J. So E_rot is much lower, so the next state is J=1, v=0.

Thus, the photon should have energy equal to the rotational transition.

So the momentum p = E/c =9.23e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made an error in the calculation of E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of energy per J².

Wait, another approach: compute the rotational constant B in cm⁻¹.

B (cm⁻¹) = h/(8 π² I c) → where I is in g cm², and c is speed of light in cm/s.

Wait, let me compute I in g cm².

I = μ R².

mu in grams: μ =3.01e-27 kg =3.01e-27 * 1000 g =3.01e-24 g.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-8 cm.

So R² = (2e-8 cm)^2 =4e-16 cm².

I =3.01e-24 g *4e-16 cm² =1.204e-40 g cm².

So B = h/(8 π² I c) → h is 6.626e-27 erg·s (since 1 erg =1e-7 J). Wait, 1 erg = 1 g cm²/s².

So h =6.626e-27 erg·s.

c=3e10 cm/s.

I=1.204e-40 g cm².

So B=6.626e-27 / (8 π² *1.204e-40 *3e10).

Compute denominator: 8 π² ≈78.956 →78.956 *1.204e-40 =9.5e-39 →9.5e-39 *3e10 =2.85e-28.

So B=6.626e-27 /2.85e-28 ≈23.25 cm⁻¹.

So B is 23.25 cm⁻¹.

Now, the energy difference for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is ΔErot = 2B (in cm⁻¹) → 2 *23.25 =46.5 cm⁻¹.

So energy in Joules: E = hc * (1/cm) → E = hc * (46.5 cm⁻¹).

Wait, hc is the product of Planck's constant and speed of light. hc = 12400 eV·Å =1240 eV·nm. Hmm, but better to compute in Joules.

But 1 cm⁻¹ is 1.986e-23 J. So 46.5 cm⁻¹ is 46.5 * 1.986e-23 ≈9.24e-22 J.

Wait, that's different from previous calculation. Earlier, I had 9.23e-23 J. Hmm, perhaps I should check units again.

Wait, 1 cm⁻¹ corresponds to energy E = hc * cm⁻¹ → hc=12400 eV·Å, but wait, perhaps it's better to compute directly.

But perhaps instead, I can compute E_rot in terms of B.

E_rot(J=1) =2B, where B is in cm⁻¹. So E_rot =2 *23.25 cm⁻¹ =46.5 cm⁻¹.

So E_photon =46.5 cm⁻¹ * hc.

Wait, hc in eV·cm is 12400 eV·Å =12400 * 1e-8 cm →12400 *1e-8 cm =1.24e-4 eV·cm. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 Å =1e-8 cm. So 12400 eV·Å =12400 eV * 1e-8 cm = 1.24e-4 eV·cm.

So E_photon =46.5 cm⁻¹ * 1.24e-4 eV·cm →46.5 *1.24e-4 ≈5.78e-3 eV.

Convert eV to J: 1 eV=1.602e-19 J →5.78e-3 *1.602e-19 =9.26e-22 J.

Wait, earlier via other method I got 9.23e-23 J. So this is about 10 times bigger. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps hc in cm·eV is 12400 eV·Å → wait, no. Wait, 1 eV·Å = 1e-7 eV·m. Hmm, perhaps I should compute hc in J·m.

h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s → hc=6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

So E_rot = B * 2 in cm⁻¹ is 46.5 cm⁻¹. So E_photon = hc * (46.5 cm⁻¹) → hc=1.9878e-25 J·m, and 46.5 cm⁻¹ =46.5 m⁻¹.

So E_photon =1.9878e-25 J·m *46.5 m⁻¹= 9.27e-24 J.

Ah, this is 9.27e-24 J, which is about 10 times smaller than the earlier 9.23e-23 J. Wait, but that can't be right. I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute E_rot in Joules using the B in cm⁻¹.

So, E_rot (J=1) =2B * (hc), where B is in cm⁻¹.

Wait, wait, no. Each cm⁻¹ corresponds to hc cm⁻¹. So E_rot is 2B * (hc).

Wait, no, E_rot = B (J)(J+1) * hc.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation.

If E_rot =9.27e-24 J, then p= E/c =9.27e-24 /3e8 =3.09e-32 Ns. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for B.

Wait, when I computed B in cm⁻¹ as 23.25, the energy E_rot is 46.5 cm⁻¹. So E_photon=46.5 cm⁻¹ * hc.

But hc in cm·eV is 12400 eV·Å → but 1 cm =1e8 Å, so 12400 eV·Å = 12400 *1e-8 cm * eV → 1.24e-4 cm·eV.

So E_photon=46.5 cm⁻¹ *1.24e-4 cm·eV → (cm⁻¹)*(cm) = unitless, so E_photon=46.5 *1.24e-4 eV → 5.78e-3 eV.

Convert eV to Joules: 5.78e-3 *1.602e-19=9.26e-22 J.

Wait, earlier via the other method I got 9.23e-23 J. So which is correct?

I think the discrepancy comes from two different approaches. But regardless, the calculated momentum p is around 3e-31 Ns or 9e-22 J /3e8 m/s = 3e-30 Ns, which is not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Options: A is 1.9e-28, B 2.3e-27, C 1.1e-27, D 1.4e-28.

If none of my calculations match, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1, whichever has lower energy.

Wait, but earlier, E_rot is lower, so the photon energy needed is for the rotational transition. But when I compute p, it's way below the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, not the rotational. Because in some cases, the vibrational transitions are in the infrared, which have lower energy than rotational transitions? No, wait, no. Vibrational transitions are higher energy than rotational because B is smaller than ω.

Wait, comparing B (7e10 rad/s) and ω (4e14 rad/s), so B is smaller. So the rotational transition's energy is lower.

So the photon should have energy 9.23e-23 J, leading to p=3e-31 Ns.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is wrong, or I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor but ignores the vibrational energy and only looks at the rotational transition. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state, which is the first excited vibrational state, which would require a photon with p ≈8.8e-28 Ns, which is close to option D (1.4e-28). But 8.8e-28 is 6 times larger than D's 1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition that involves both rotational and vibrational changes, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy of the photon needed for the transition to the next vibrational state.

Earlier, E_vib =hω=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 isn't an option. So perhaps the question intended to have this as the answer, but the options don't have it.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the ω value. The question says ω =4e14 rad/s. So that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct momentum for the rotational transition is around 3e-31 Ns, but it's not an option. The option closest to the vibrational transition is 8.8e-28, which isn't present either. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: the question is about the transition to the next state, which in the rigid rotor model, the next state after the ground state (v=0, J=0) would be the first excited state, which could be J=1 (same vibrational state) or v=1 (same rotational state). But perhaps in terms of energy, the next state is the one with the smallest energy, so J=1.

But the photon's energy is E_rot=9.23e-23 J, which gives p=3e-31 Ns. There's no such option.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of E_rot. Let me recompute E_rot.

E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I) → for J=1, E_rot = (ħ² * 2)/(2 I) = ħ² / I.

So ħ=1.05457e-34 J·s.

I=1.204e-46 kg·m².

So E_rot= (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.204e-46.

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

Divide by 1.204e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈9.23e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

So I think the correct momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns, but it's not in the options. Therefore, perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. So the photon's energy is hω=2.65e-19 J, p=8.83e-28 Ns. The closest option is A)1.9e-28, which is about 4.6 times smaller.

Unless I messed up the exponent. Did I calculate E_photon correctly?

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. Correct. Then p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum as p = hν/c, but perhaps I should compute it differently. Let me try again.

hν = E. So p = hν/c = (h/c) ν.

h/c = 6.626e-34 /3e8 ≈2.208e-42 J·s/m.

hν =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = (2.65e-19 J) / (3e8 m/s) =8.83e-28 Ns.

So it's correct. But the options don't have this.

So perhaps the intended answer is option D, 1.4e-28 Ns, which is about 6 times smaller than our calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy using ω in terms of wavenumbers.

Wait, the angular frequency ω is related to the wavenumber ν̃ by ω = c ν̃.

So ν̃ = ω /c =4e14 rad/s / (3e10 cm/s) )=4e14/(3e10) = 1.333e4 cm^-1.

So ν̃ =1.333e4 cm^-1.

But how does that help?

E_photon = h c ν̃.

h c = 12400 eV·Å =12400 *1e-8 cm * eV.

Wait, E_photon =12400 eV·Å * ν̃ (cm^-1 ) → 12400 * ν̃ *1e-8 eV.

Wait, ν̃=1.333e4 cm^-1 → E_photon=12400 *1.333e4 *1e-8 eV.

Wait, 12400 *1.333e4= 165,333,332 → *1e-8 →1.65e-3 eV.

Convert to Joules: 1.65e-3 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV =2.643e-22 J.

Then p = E/c=2.643e-22 /3e8=8.81e-31 Ns.

Oh wait, that's 8.81e-31 Ns, which is approximately 8.8e-31 Ns, which is about 3e-30 Ns. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe the question is expecting me to find the rotational energy, but I'm getting a value that's not in the options. Since none of the calculations match, perhaps I should review the steps once more.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is referring to the transition to the next state with the lowest energy, which could be a combination of both vibrational and rotational. But that would require more advanced treatment, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, and the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), but B is in terms of Joules.

Wait, perhaps B is in J·s. So B = h/(8 π² I ) → 6.626e-34/(8 π² *1.204e-46) =7e10 s⁻¹.

But E_J is in Joules: E_J = B * J (J+1) * ħ.

Wait, no, because E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to find the momentum of the photon as hν/c, where ν is the vibrational frequency.

So ν = ω/(2π) →4e14 rad/s / (2π) ≈6.366e13 Hz.

So p = h ν /c →6.626e-34 *6.366e13 /3e8.

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈4.216e-20.

Divide by 3e8: 4.216e-20/3e8 =1.405e-28 Ns.

Ah! That's option D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, I think I see where I went wrong. I was using ω as the frequency, but when calculating ν (frequency in Hz), it's ω/(2π).

So, ω =4e14 rad/s → ν=4e14/(2π) ≈6.366e13 Hz.

So E_photon= h ν =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈4.216e-20 J.

p=E/c=4.216e-20 /3e8 =1.405e-28 Ns.

So that's option D.

Ah, so the mistake earlier was not converting ω to ν correctly. I was treating ω as ν, but ν is ω/(2π). So the correct photon momentum is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Data:
- **Masses**:  
  \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  \( \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu} \)  
  \( \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.01 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)

- **Bond length**:  
  \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)

- **Moment of inertia**:  
  \( I = \mu R^2 = (3.01 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.204 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \)

- **Rotational constant**:  
  \( B = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.204 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 7.0 \times 10^{10} \, \text{rad/s} \)

- **Vibrational angular frequency**:  
  \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Energy Transitions:
1. **Rotational transition (J=0 → J=1)**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_J = B J (J+1)
   \]  
   For \( J=0 \), \( E_0 = 0 \). For \( J=1 \), \( E_1 = 2B \).  
   The energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_1 - E_0 = 2B = 2 \cdot 7.0 \times 10^{10} = 1.4 \times 10^{11} \, \text{rad/s}
   \]  
   Converting to Joules:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 1.4 \times 10^{11} \cdot \hbar = 1.4 \times 10^{11} \cdot (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \approx 1.48 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Vibrational transition (v=0 → v=1)**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_v = \frac{1}{2} h \omega + h \omega v
   \]  
   The energy difference for \( v=0 \to v=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Comparison of Transitions:
The rotational transition requires significantly less energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 1.48 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)) compared to the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)). Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy corresponds to the rotational transition (\( J=0 \to J=1 \)).

### Momentum of the Photon:
The energy of the photon must match the rotational energy difference:  
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 1.48 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]  
The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:  
\[
p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{1.48 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 4.93 \times 10^{-32} \, \text{Ns}
\]  
However, this value does not match any of the provided options. Reassessing the problem, the closest match corresponds to the vibrational transition, where the photon's momentum is:  
\[
p = \frac{E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
\]  
This is approximately **6 times larger** than the closest option, suggesting a possible misinterpretation of the question or rounding differences.

### Final Answer:
The closest option to the calculated momentum for the vibrational transition is **D) \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)**.

Answer: D
