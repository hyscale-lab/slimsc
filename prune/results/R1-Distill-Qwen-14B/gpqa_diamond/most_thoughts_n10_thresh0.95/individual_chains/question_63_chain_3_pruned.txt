Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so I'll probably have to calculate the energy difference and then relate that to the photon's momentum.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, so it's more like a vibration. So the model accounts for both rotation and vibration.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental vibrational state is the ground state, where the vibrational quantum number is zero. But when it absorbs a photon, it should transition to the next state, which would be the first excited state. So for the vibration part, the quantum number n would go from 0 to 1. Because that's the lowest possible energy increase—vibrational transitions are usually considered as quantum jumps between states.

But wait, the problem mentions the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's a combination of rotational and vibrational changes. Oh, but the question is about the photon's momentum. So I need to figure out the energy required for the transition and then relate that to momentum via E=pc, since for a photon, energy is related to momentum by the speed of light.

Wait, no, photons have energy E = h*f and momentum p = h/(lambda), but since c = lambda*f, E = pc. So yes, p = E/(c). Because E = h f and p = h f / c = E/c.

So first, find the energy difference between the initial and final states. The initial state is the fundamental state, which I think is the state with the lowest possible energy for both vibrational and rotational modes.

But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is in its ground state, and we're looking for the minimal energy photon that can cause a transition. That suggests that the molecule would move to the next possible state, which is the first excited state. But I need to think about the allowed transitions in the rotation-vibration model.

In a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are a combination of vibrational and rotational energy. The total energy is the sum of the vibrational and rotational contributions.

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number (0,1,2,...). The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number (0,1,2,...).

In the rigid rotor model, B = (h²)/(8 π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia. But wait, in the non-rigid model, I might not be fixed, but for the purpose of calculating the energy levels, perhaps I can still use the same approach.

So if the molecule is in its fundamental state, that means it's in the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the initial state is (n=0, J=0). The next lowest state would be the first excited state, which could either be increasing J by 1 (to J=1) or n by 1 (to n=1). Which of these transitions requires less energy?

Wait, but the question says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon's energy should match the smallest possible energy difference. So I need to compare the energy needed to go from J=0 to J=1 without changing n, and the energy needed to go from n=0 to n=1 without changing J, or perhaps a combination.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can only undergo a vibrational transition, and any rotational transitions happen in conjunction. Wait, but for diatomic molecules, the selection rules for vibrational transitions allow Δn = ±1, and rotational transitions typically have ΔJ = ±1.

But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can change both n and J. So the allowed transition would be Δn = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1.

Wait, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the energy of the next state is the next higher energy state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition, whichever is lower.

So I need to calculate the energy required for each possible transition and see which is smaller.

Let me think about the energies.

First, compute the vibrational energy. The energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w.

Next, the rotational energy. The rotational energy for J=0 is E_rot = B * 0*(0+1) = 0. For J=1, it's B *1*2 = 2B. So the energy difference for rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B.

So the photon's energy must provide the difference between these states. But wait, in the case where the molecule is in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0), the next state could be either (n=1, J=0), (n=0, J=1), or (n=1, J=1). But the minimal energy transition would be the one with the smallest energy.

So the energy for (n=1, J=0) is h w. For (n=0, J=1) it's 2B. Which is smaller between h w and 2B?

Wait, but the question states that the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration. So perhaps the molecule's energy has both contributions. So the total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot.

So the initial state (n=0, J=0) has E_initial = (0 + 1/2) h w + 0 = (1/2) h w.

The next possible state could be (n=0, J=1): E = (0 +1/2) hw + 2B = (1/2) hw + 2B.

Or (n=1, J=0): E = (1 +1/2) hw + 0 = (3/2) hw.

Which of these is lower: (3/2 h w) or (1/2 h w + 2B).

But wait, the next state doesn't necessarily have to involve only a single change. It could involve increasing both n and J. But the minimal energy transition would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase.

So compute which is smaller: (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) = h w, or (1/2 h w + 2B) - (1/2 h w) )= 2B.

So the photon's energy needed would be the minimum of h w and 2B.

But I don't know the value of B yet. So I can compute B using the given parameters.

Wait, given data:

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 m.

Angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, but for the rotational constant B, it's given by B = h²/(8 π² I c), or perhaps another expression. Let me recall.

The rotational constant B is defined as B = (ħ²)/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. Wait, in some references, B is expressed as (h²)/(8 π² I), as in B = (h²)/(8 π² I c), but I might be mixing units. Alternatively, B has units of cm^-1, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps a different approach. The moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

Yes, the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My).

Let me calculate μ.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = (
