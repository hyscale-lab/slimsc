--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. Hmm, let's break it down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to the cyclohexane. And then there's a carbaldehyde group—so a formyl group—on the same carbon as that substituent.

Wait, no, let me recheck. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the aldehyde is on carbon 1. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) attached to that same carbon. So, the structure would have a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group attached at position 1. That CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. And the same carbon (position 1) has the aldehyde group.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the nomenclature is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group on carbon 1. Then, on that same carbon 1, there's a substituent which is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, the carbon at position 1 has three substituents: the aldehyde, the cyclohexyl group, the hydroxyl group, and another CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) as a substituent. So, the carbon at position 1 has the aldehyde and a CH2 group that's attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure would be:

The cyclohexane ring has a CH2 group attached at position 1. That CH2 is connected to another cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the CH2 is like -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). And the same carbon also has the aldehyde group. So, the structure would be:

Cyclohexane-CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO.

Hmm, no, that can't be right because the aldehyde is CHO on a carbon adjacent. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it mentally.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent on the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, the structure is such that the aldehyde is attached to a carbon that also has a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So the carbon with the aldehyde has two other substituents: a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl, and a CH2 group leading to another cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the starting material and the steps needed to get to the product.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. Ethynylcyclohexane is probably a cyclohexane ring with a CH2-C≡CH group attached. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me re-express that as [cyclohexyl(CH2-OH)]-CH2-CHO attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, no: the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, that would be a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl. So, the substituent is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). But wait, that's three substituents on a carbon, which isn't possible. Oh wait, no: a cyclohexyl group is a ring, so the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent would be -CH2-OH and -CH2-cyclohexane? No, wait, perhaps it's a single carbon attached to both cyclohexane and hydroxyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) that is attached to a cyclohexyl (cyclohexane) and a hydroxyl group. So the structure would be CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexyl attached to the same carbon, which is also attached to the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this by thinking about the steps needed to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target.

Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with a terminal alkyne group (CH2-C≡CH). To get an aldehyde, I probably need to form a ketone and then reduce it, or perhaps add something to the alkyne. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group (CHO), which is an aldehyde. So, maybe the alkyne is being converted into an aldehyde.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So, if I treat that with certain reagents, perhaps I can introduce a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence involves adding a methyl group or substituents and then oxidizing.

Wait, let's think about the possible reagents given in the options.

Looking at the options, each involves multiple steps. So, let's look at each possible reagent set.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with four steps.

Let me think about each step.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride.

That's deprotonation followed by alkylation. So perhaps introducing a methyl group.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenation, so maybe reducing a triple bond to a single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2: a strong base, perhaps for elimination or epoxidation. Or maybe for forming a diol.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 could be used for epoxidation, but without an epoxide, perhaps it's for elimination.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: that's a typical oxidizing condition for ketones or alcohols. H2SO4 and HgSO4 in aqueous conditions usually oxidizes alcohols to ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, but that's the Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones. Wait, no, for primary alcohols, Jones (CrO3 in H2SO4) oxidizes to carboxylic acids. Wait, but maybe in some conditions, it can stop at aldehyde.

Alternatively, H2SO4 and HgSO4 in H2O is a Jones reagent, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but maybe under controlled conditions, it can produce aldehydes. Hmm.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride.

So, same as option A but with ethyl chloride. So maybe introducing an ethyl group.

2. Li/liq. NH3: that's a strong base, used for deprotonation, perhaps for elimination or for alkyne reactions. Li in NH3 is used for Birch reductions or for deprotonating alkynes to form lithium acetylides.

3. O3/ H2O: ozone followed by workup, which would cleave double bonds to form carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: aqueous ammonium hydroxide, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reductive workup after ozonolysis.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: same as A.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenation, perhaps reducing a triple bond to single bond.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: ozone followed by reductive workup to form aldehydes or ketones, depending on the workup.

4. Ba(OH)2: again, a strong base. Maybe for elimination or forming epoxides.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: deprotonation and then alkylation with methanol. Wait, methanol is an alcohol; perhaps it's a methyl group being added.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, used to deprotonate. So, methyl chloride is CH3Cl, which would be an alkylating agent. So, maybe this step is adding a methyl group via a deprotonation and alkylation.

Wait, but in the product, maybe the substituent is more complex.

Let me think about the possible steps.

First, starting with ethynylcyclohexane. Let's imagine the structure: cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group.

Step 1 in each option is either introducing a methyl or ethyl group. So, perhaps the first step is adding a methyl group via deprotonation and alkylation.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So, the triple bond is at the end. So, perhaps the first step is adding a methyl group to the cyclohexane ring.

Hmm, perhaps the first step is deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide, then alkylating. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base that can deprotonate alkynes, especially terminal ones.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride.

NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide? Or wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so in the presence of ethynylcyclohexane and methyl chloride, perhaps it deprotonates the alkyne (the terminal hydrogen) to form the acetylide ion, which then reacts with methyl chloride as an electrophile.

Wait, but wait, methyl chloride is a primary alkyl chloride. So, the reaction would be alkylation of the acetylide. So, perhaps the acetylide (CH2-C≡C-) would attack the methyl chloride, leading to CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? Hmm, but that's not likely, because methyl chloride is CH3Cl. Alternatively, maybe the acetylide attacks the CH3Cl, leading to CH2-C≡C-CH3 (but that would be a propyl group? Wait, no, the acetylide is CH2-C≡C^–. Adding CH3Cl would give CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonating the cyclohexane ring to form a cyclohexide, which then reacts with methyl chloride. But the cyclohexane is not very acidic. Wait, the alkyne's terminal hydrogen is more acidic than the cyclohexane's. So, NaNH2 would deprotonate the triple bond, forming an acetylide.

So, after step 1, the compound becomes CH2-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, methyl chloride would provide a CH3 group. So, the acetylide would attack methyl chloride, leading to CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, wait, no. Wait, when an acetylide reacts with an alkyl halide, it typically forms a longer alkyne. So, CH2-C≡C^- + CH3Cl → CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? But that doesn't seem right, because methyl chloride is CH3Cl, which would provide a methyl group. Wait, perhaps the acetylide attacks the methyl chloride, leading to CH2-C≡C-CH3 (but that would require CH3Cl, but I'm not sure about the mechanism). Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide would take the methyl group, forming CH2-C≡C-CH3. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the first step is adding a methyl group to the cyclohexane ring. So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Deprotonating with NaNH2 would form an acetylide, which then alkylates with CH3Cl to form CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. So, the triple bond would become a propyne group.

Wait, so after step 1, we have propynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane attached to CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Then, step 2 in option A is H2/Pd. That would hydrogenate the triple bond. So, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would give a single bond. So, CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Wait, no, hydrogenation of triple bond to single bond would give CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, the triple bond is between two carbons. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 upon hydrogenation. But that's butane. Wait, no, wait: propyne (CH3-C≡CH) upon hydrogenation becomes propane (CH3-CH2-CH3). So, in this case, the initial structure is CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane. Upon hydrogenation, it would become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the triple bond is CH2-C≡C-CH3. When hydrogenated, each triple bond adds two H2 molecules to become a single bond. So, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, the triple bond is between the two carbons. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 upon hydrogenation. Wait, no, that would make it a four-carbon chain, but that's not correct. Because the triple bond is between the two middle carbons. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, the hydrogenation of a propyne group (CH3-C≡C-) attached to another CH2 group would become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm mixing up the positions.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane. But that would make the substituent a butyl group? No, that can't be right. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the steps in option A.

Option A:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds a methyl group to the alkyne, making CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenates the triple bond to single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. So now, cyclohexane has a four-carbon chain (butyl group).

Wait, but that doesn't seem to lead towards the target molecule, which has a cyclohexyl substituent attached to a CH2-OH group and a CHO group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about other options.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol.

Wait, methanol is CH3OH. So, NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, which would then react with methanol. But wait, methanol is an alcohol, not an alkyl halide. So, perhaps the acetylide would attack the methanol. But I'm not sure how that would proceed. Alternatively, maybe the acetylide would take a proton from methanol, leading to CH2-C≡C-CH3. But that's similar to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is adding a methyl group via alkylation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how to form the substituent on the cyclohexane ring that includes both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, the target molecule has a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group (as a substituent on a CH2 group) and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So, perhaps that substituent is a (cyclohexylmethyl) group with a hydroxyl. So, the substituent would be -CH2-OH and -CH2-cyclohexyl attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Hmm. So, perhaps the substituent is a vicinal diol, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a result of an epoxide ring-opening.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve forming a cyclohexylmethyl group with an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a ring-opening reaction, such as with an epoxide.

Wait, but I'm not seeing a clear path yet. Let me think of the possible reactions.

Another approach: the target has a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Perhaps the synthesis involves converting the ethynyl group into a carbonyl group.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. So, perhaps via oxidation or some other reaction, that triple bond is converted into a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: the target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a carbonyl group via a reaction like hydration of the alkyne to a ketone, but that doesn't directly give an aldehyde.

Wait, but maybe the alkyne is partially hydrogenated or modified in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, which is then reacted.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then undergoes some addition.

Wait, let me think again about the options.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → adds an ethyl group to the alkyne.

Step 2: Li/NH3 (liquid) → perhaps deprotonates or forms a Birch reduction. Or perhaps it's used to form a diradical, but I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3/H2O → ozonolysis of a double bond to form carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup after ozonolysis, perhaps to form aldehydes.

Hmm. So, perhaps step 2 is for hydrogenating the triple bond into a trans-alkene, but wait, Li in NH3 is more commonly used for Birch reductions (which reduces aromatic rings) or for deprotonating alkynes to form lithium acetylides. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for eliminating a group to form a double bond.

Another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group, along with an OH group on the same CH2. So, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH group attached to the cyclohexane's carbon that also has the aldehyde.

So, perhaps the steps involve adding a methyl group and then forming a diol, then reducing or oxidizing.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about each option's steps.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds a methyl group to the alkyne, making CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, but then step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone would cleave double bonds, but step 2 has hydrogenated the triple bond to a single bond, so no double bonds. So that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps option C's step 3 wouldn't work since there's no double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 in option C is not hydrogenating the triple bond but doing something else. No, H2 and Pd are for hydrogenation.

So, perhaps option C's steps would not yield the necessary carbonyl group.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps adding a methyl group via alkylation.

Wait, but methanol is CH3OH, so perhaps the acetylide would take a methyl group from methanol, but I'm not sure how that would proceed. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonating something else.

Wait, perhaps step 1 is adding a methyl group to the cyclohexane via alkylation. So, the initial structure is ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane). Deprotonate the triple bond with NaNH2 to form the acetylide ion, which then reacts with CH3Cl (in options A and D) to add a methyl group. So, after step 1 in options A and D, the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Then step 2 in D is Li/liq. NH3. That's a strong base, possibly for deprotonating something else. Or maybe it's for elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, if after step 1, the substituent is CH2-C≡C-CH3, perhaps step 2 is for hydrogenating that triple bond into a double bond. But Li in NH3 is not typically used for hydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for deprotonation to form a lithium acetylide again, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for deprotonating another acidic hydrogen, perhaps in the cyclohexane ring, leading to some alkylation.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, let's consider the target molecule again. It has a formyl group (CHO) attached to a carbon that also has a (cyclohexylmethyl) group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a methyl group (step 1), then hydrogenating the triple bond (step 2) to a single bond, making a longer chain. Then, perhaps step 3 oxidizes the chain to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne, making it a propyne (CH2-C≡C-CH3).

2. Hydrogenate the propyne to a propane group (CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3) attached to cyclohexane.

But that doesn't help with the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to an alkene.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, I remember that Ozonolysis of alkynes can give diketones, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, mercury-based conditions can convert alkynes to ketones.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing reactions. Let's think: when you treat a terminal alkyne with HgSO4 and H2SO4, you can get a ketone. So, for example, HC≡C-R would become R-CO-H (a ketone if R is alkyl) or R-COOH (if R is H). Wait, no, for a terminal alkyne, HgSO4 in H2SO4 and H2O would oxidize it to a carboxylic acid. For example, HC≡C-R becomes R-CO2H.

Wait, but if the alkyne is internal, perhaps it would form a diketone. Hmm.

So, perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH). Oxidizing this with H2SO4, HgSO4, and H2O would convert the triple bond into a carboxylic acid group. So, cyclohexane-CH2-COOH.

But the target has a formyl group, so perhaps that's a way to get the aldehyde.

Wait, but then you would have a cyclohexane with a CH2-COOH group. Maybe then you can reduce the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol, then oxidize to the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming an epoxide, then opening it with a nucleophile.

But I'm not seeing the connection yet.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Introduce a methyl group to the alkyne, making a propargyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the propargyl to a propyl group.

3. Ozonolyze to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to form a cyclohexylmethyl group with a hydroxyl group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the target's substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. For example, adding a cyclohexyl group via a Grignard reagent.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then alkylate to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Then, form a double bond via elimination.

4. Ozonolyze the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

Step 1: Add a methyl group to the alkyne, making a propargyl group.

Step 2: Reduce the propargyl to a propyl group.

Step 3: Form a double bond via elimination (like using a strong base to eliminate H2O, forming an alkene).

Step 4: Ozonolyze the alkene to form two carbonyl groups, which can then be reduced or worked up to form aldehydes.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that leads to the target structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Introduce a methyl group via alkylation of the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, creating a trans-alkene.

3. Ozonolyze the double bond to form two carbonyl groups.

4. Then, reduce one of the carbonyl groups to an alcohol or to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the reagents in option B.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → adds an ethyl group to the alkyne, making CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps deprotonates to form a lithium acetylide again, but then what? Or perhaps it's used for elimination, forming an alkene.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis of the double bond, forming carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form aldehydes instead of ketones.

Wait, if step 2 forms an alkene, then step 3 would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is elimination to form an alkene.

So, after step 1, we have CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 attached to cyclohexane. Then, perhaps step 2 deprotonates and eliminates to form a double bond, making CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2- (but that doesn't make sense). Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a double bond.

Wait, but NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group, making a longer alkyne.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for hydrogenating the triple bond to a trans-alkene. But I'm not sure Li/NH3 does that.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for forming a lithium acetylide, which then reacts with something else.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding the ethyl group, step 2 is elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try another approach.

The target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: the ethynyl group is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation. For example, using O3 followed by reductive workup.

Wait, ozonolysis of an alkyne can form diketones or carboxylic acids, depending on conditions.

Wait, but if I have ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane), and I perform ozonolysis, that would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the product would be two formyl groups attached to the cyclohexane.

But the target has only one aldehyde group, so maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol, and then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenating the triple bond to form a CH2-CH2-CH3 group, then performing ozonolysis on a double bond formed elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne (making it CH2-C≡C-CH3).

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to form CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Introduce a double bond via elimination.

4. Ozonolyze the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B.

Looking at option B's steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → adds an ethyl group to the alkyne, making CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps deprotonates and eliminates to form a double bond, making CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2 → but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into an alkene. Wait, no, Li in NH3 is used for deprotonation and alkyne reactions, not for hydrogenation.

Hmm.

Another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group and the aldehyde.

So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. For example, adding a cyclohexyl group to a carbon that also has an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Adding a methyl group (step 1) → CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to form CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (step 2 in options A and C).

3. Introduce an epoxide (step 3 in option A with Ba(OH)2?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, the chain is then oxidized to form a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol, and then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde directly attached.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Introduce a methyl group to the alkyne, making CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. Reduce the triple bond to a double bond (using H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's to form cis alkene, but none of the options use that).

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond.

Wait, but then how to get an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is oxidized to a ketone, but that requires a different setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the target molecule is synthesized via a double addition to the alkyne.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about each option's possible outcome.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates triple bond to single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But after step 2, there's no double bond. So this step wouldn't do anything. Unless step 3 is using O3 to cleave a single bond, which I don't think it does.

So option C's steps after step 2 wouldn't do anything in step 3, so it's unlikely to be correct.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps adds a methyl group via alkylation.

Wait, but methanol is CH3OH. So, the acetylide (from the alkyne) would react with CH3OH. But how?

Perhaps the acetylide (CH2-C≡C^- Na^+) reacts with CH3OH to form CH2-C≡C-CH2-OH. But that's a propargyl alcohol. Then, step 2 is Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps deprotonates to form a lithium acetylide again, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for elimination, forming a double bond, but I'm not certain.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the correct sequence is to form a ketone from the alkyne, which is then reduced to an alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but how to form the correct substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Introduce a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Epoxidize the cyclohexane's substituent.

4. Open the epoxide to form a diol.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target's structure again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1: (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) and a CHO group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both cyclohexane and a hydroxyl group, and another cyclohexane.

So, the structure is cyclohexane-CHO with a CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexane attached to the same carbon.

Wait, that carbon would have four substituents: CHO, CH2-OH, CH2-cyc
