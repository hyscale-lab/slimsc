Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The question is asking which stars can be observed with both ESPRESSO and HIRES. So I need to figure out for each star if it's observable by both instruments.

The given information says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, wait. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if the instrument can observe stars brighter than 17, that means it can see stars with V mag less than or equal to 17? Or wait, wait, no. Wait, the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The text says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, right, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star's V magnitude is less than 17, it's brighter than 17 mag, so it can be detected. So ESPRESSO can observe stars down to a certain brightness, meaning their V magnitude is below a certain value.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So stars with V magnitude less than 16, because they're brighter than 16. So the brightness limit for HIRES is brighter than 16, so V mag <=16? Wait, no. Wait, the way it's phrased: "brighter than 16 V mag"—so higher brightness, lower magnitude. So any star with V mag less than 16 would be brighter than 16 mag. So for HIRES, the stars must have V mag ≤16. Because if a star's V mag is 15, it's brighter than 16, so it's acceptable. But if it's 17, it's fainter than 16, so not acceptable by HIRES.

Wait, wait. No, that's the opposite. Let me think about how magnitudes work. The magnitude scale is inverted. So a magnitude of 0 is brighter than 5. So, a star with V magnitude of 16 is fainter than a star with V mag 15. So, when the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO," that means the instrument can see stars with V mag less than 17. Similarly, HIRES can see stars with V mag less than 16.

So, for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than the lower of the two limits. Because HIRES can only go down to 16, while ESPRESSO goes down to 17. So a star must have V mag ≤16 to be seen by both.

Wait no, wait. Wait, no. Because if a star is brighter than 17 mag (V <17), it can be seen by ESPRESSO. But for HIRES, it must be brighter than 16 mag (V <16). So the stricter condition is V ≤16. So only stars with V mag ≤16 can be seen by both. Because if a star's V is, say, 15, both can see it. But if a star's V is 17, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES cannot because 17>16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The way the question is phrased is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So m_v <17. Similarly, "brighter than 16 mag" for HIRES: m_v <16.

So to be observable by both, the star's apparent V mag must be less than 16, because that's the stricter condition.

Now, each star's situation. Let's go through each one.

Star1: RA=15, DEC=-75. Absolute magnitude is 15.5, distance 10 pc.

Wait, absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude if it were at 10 pc. So since it's at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude is the same as absolute (15.5 mag). So Star1 has m_v =15.5. Which is less than 16, so both instruments can see it.

Star2: RA=30, DEC=55. Apparent V mag is 16.5, located at 5 pc. So its m_v is 16.5. Which is greater than 16, so HIRES can't see it (since HIRES requires m_v <16). But ESPRESSO can see m_v <17. So Star2 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So it's not a candidate for both.

Star3: RA=11h (which is 11*15=165 deg?), DEC=48. Apparent V mag 15.5. E(B-V)=0.6. Distance 15 pc.

Wait, but Star3 has extinction—E(B-V) is 0.6 mag. So that affects its apparent magnitude. The question mentions that the total absorption in V is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So, Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So Av = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So the apparent magnitude is affected by extinction. The apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5, but with extinction, it's 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 mag.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but that would be after extinction? Or is it before? Hmm. The question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) =0.6." So I think the given apparent magnitude is the observed one, so it includes the extinction. Or wait, no, no. Wait, no. Wait, confusion arises here. E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the difference between the observed color and the intrinsic color. But the extinction in V band is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the total extinction in V would be Av = 1.86. So the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude, without extinction, is m0 = m_observed - Av. So m0 = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64 mag. Wait, but that's not necessarily correct. Because when you measure an apparent magnitude, it's already including the extinction. So if the star emits light that would have given it m0, but due to extinction, it's dimmed, so m_obs = m0 + Av.

Alternatively, perhaps the question says that the apparent V mag is 15.5, but that's before considering extinction. So, for example, the star's light is absorbed, so the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 mag.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 and E(B-V) = 0.6. So the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, but this is after extinction. Because E(B-V) is the observed color excess. So, the extinction in V (Av) is 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude would be m0 = m_observed - Av. So 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. So the star's actual brightness (without extinction) is 13.64, but the observed is 15.5. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the observed magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av. Because extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so m increases. So if the observed m is 15.5, and the extinction is 1.86, then the intrinsic m (what it would be without extinction) is 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64.

But in our case, the question is about the apparent magnitude as observed. So the observed m is 15.5. So we don't need to adjust it because the question says that's the observed value. So Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which is less than 16. So it can be seen by both telescopes, right?

Wait, wait. Wait, no. No, wait. Because the extinction is adding to the apparent magnitude. So the star's light is dimmed by 1.86 mag because of the dust, so the observed apparent magnitude is higher than the actual. So if the star without extinction would have m =13.64, but with extinction, it's 15.5.

So, for Star3, the observed m_v is 15.5, which is less than 16. So both spectrographs can detect it.

Wait, but what about the distance? The question says that "apparent V magnitude" is given. So they already account for distance. So the given m_v is the apparent magnitude as seen from Earth. So Star3 has m_v =15.5, so both telescopes can see it.

Star4: RA=85, DEC=-48. Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. E(B-V)=0.4.

Since the distance is 10 pc, the absolute and apparent magnitudes are the same. So m_v =15.5. E(B-V) =0.4. So Av = 3.1 * 0.4 =1.24 mag.

So the observed m_v is 15.5 + 1.24 =16.74 mag.

Wait, same confusion as before. So the absolute magnitude is 15.5. Since it's located at 10 pc, the apparent magnitude is the same as absolute, so 15.5. But extinction makes it appear dimmer. So the observed m_v =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Because the apparent magnitude includes extinction, that's the value we should compare. So 16.74 is greater than 16, so it's beyond HIRES's limit (which requires m_v <16). So Star4's m_v is 16.74, which is too faint for HIRES. But ESPRESSO can handle m_v up to 17, so Star4 would be observable by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So both can't see it.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the given m_v is already the observed value, so the E(B-V) doesn't affect it. Because if the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, any extinction would have been included in that value. But no, because E(B-V) is the color excess, and extinction affects the magnitude. So for Star4, the absolute magnitude is 15.5. At 10 pc, apparent magnitude is 15.5. But with E(B-V)=0.4, so Av=1.24, so the observed m_v would be 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's apparent V magnitude is 16.74, which is higher than 16. So HIRES can't see it, only ESPRESSO can.

Star5: RA=10h (150 deg), DEC=60. Absolute V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc.

Absolute magnitude M_v is 16.5. Distance is 5 pc. So apparent magnitude m_v = M_v + 5 log10(d/10) =16.5 +5*(log10(5/10))=16.5 +5*(log10(0.5)).

Log10(0.5)= -0.3010, so 5*(-0.3010)= -1.505.

So m_v=16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995, approximately 15.0 mag.

So Star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0, which is less than 16. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it.

Wait, but perhaps I should check whether the extinction is considered. But the question didn't mention E(B-V) for Star5. So I assume E(B-V) is zero. So no extinction. So m_v is 15.0, which is within both's limits.

Now, compiling all the stars:

Star1: m_v=15.5 → both can see it.

Star2: m_v=16.5 → HIRES can't (needs <16), ESPRESSO can (needs <17).

Star3: m_v=15.5 → both can see it.

Star4: m_v=16.74 → only ESPRESSO can see.

Star5: m_v=15.0 → both can see.

So which stars are seen by both? Star1, Star3, Star5.

Now, looking at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m_v is 16.74, can't be seen by HIRES. So incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both have m_v ≤16. So correct.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m_v is 16.5, can't be seen by HIRES. So incorrect.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES. So incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.


To determine which stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m_v < 17$), while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m_v < 16$). Therefore, a star must have $m_v \leq 16$ to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute $V$ magnitude: $15.5$  
   - Distance: $10$ pc  
   - Apparent $V$ magnitude: Since the distance is $10$ pc, the apparent magnitude equals the absolute magnitude, $m_v = 15.5$.  
   - Conclusion: $m_v = 15.5 < 16$, so it can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent $V$ magnitude: $16.5$  
   - Conclusion: $m_v = 16.5 > 16$, so it cannot be detected by HIRES, only by ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent $V$ magnitude: $15.5$  
   - Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.6$, so $A_v = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86$.  
   - Observed apparent magnitude: $m_v = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36$.  
   - Conclusion: $m_v = 17.36 > 16$, so it cannot be detected by HIRES, only by ESPRESSO.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute $V$ magnitude: $15.5$  
   - Distance: $10$ pc  
   - Apparent $V$ magnitude: $m_v = 15.5$ (since distance is $10$ pc).  
   - Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.4$, so $A_v = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24$.  
   - Observed apparent magnitude: $m_v = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74$.  
   - Conclusion: $m_v = 16.74 > 16$, so it cannot be detected by HIRES, only by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute $V$ magnitude: $16.5$  
   - Distance: $5$ pc  
   - Apparent $V$ magnitude:  
     \[
     m_v = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - Conclusion: $m_v = 15.0 < 16$, so it can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Final Answer:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1 and Star5**.

Answer: B
