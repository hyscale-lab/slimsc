--- Full Content ---
Okay, I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again and see what it's asking.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, there's this ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels that changes when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Hmm, the part about the Ti atoms' ratio. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations of different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. But the spots are dark, so I think they're cooler than the surrounding photosphere. Oh, but wait, when the spots cover part of the star's surface, the observed effective temperature of the whole star goes down. But in this case, the problem says the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K. So, the star's average Teff is lower. But the question is about the photospheric temperature when the spots are present. Wait, perhaps the spots are cooler regions, so the overall Teff is a mix of the spotted and unspotted areas.

Wait, but the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But does that mean that the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at a lower temperature?

Wait, the original Teff is 6000 K when no spots. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. So the star's photosphere is a mix of 40% spots (which are cooler) and 60% normal (6000 K) areas.

But wait, how does that affect the temperature in the photosphere as a whole? Because when we observe the star, the flux from the spots is lower, so the overall flux (and hence Teff) is lower. But the question is about the photospheric temperature. Are the spots at a lower temperature than the surrounding photosphere?

I think yes. So the star's photosphere is a combination of regions at different temperatures. But when the star has spots, the average observed Teff is lower. But for the purpose of the Boltzmann factor, the temperature we're using is the temperature of the photosphere where the Ti lines are formed. Hmm, but wait, the problem states that the observed ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels is changing when the star has spots. So, perhaps the regions where the Ti lines are formed are either in the spotted or unspotted areas, or perhaps the overall change in the star's photospheric temperature affects the line formation.

Wait, the problem says the photosphere is in LTE, so the local temperature is what's relevant. But when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower. But what's the temperature of the photosphere in the regions where the Ti is? Are the spots cooler, so the Ti is in a cooler part of the photosphere?

Alternatively, perhaps the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots, but the photosphere's effective temperature (the temperature of the photosphere as a blackbody) might be different. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the effective temperature relates to the total luminosity. The star's luminosity drops when spots are present. The star emits less because the spots are cooler and emit less. So the effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity, but the actual photospheric temperature varies across the surface.

But the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere when the star has spots. So, the ratio depends on the temperature of the photosphere where the Ti lines are formed. If the star has spots, some regions are cooler, others are hotter (wait no, the surrounding regions are the same as before, maybe? Or perhaps the spots are cooler regions, but the rest is 6000 K).

So, when spots are present, 60% of the surface is at 6000 K, and 40% is at a lower temperature, say T_spot. The overall effective temperature is 5500 K. Wait, but how do I find T_spot?

Hmm. Wait, the problem doesn't directly give T_spot. It says that the effective temperature of the entire star when 40% is covered by spots is 5500 K. So, the star's total flux is a combination of the flux from the spotted and unspotted regions.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the flux from a star's surface is sigma * Teff^4. But in this case, the total flux is the sum of the fluxes from the two regions.

Let me think. Let the fraction of the surface covered by spots be f = 0.4, and the rest (1 - f) = 0.6 is normal.

The total flux is: F_total = f * sigma * T_spot^4 + (1 - f) * sigma * T_unspotted^4.

But the star's effective temperature when spotted is T_eff = 5500 K. So, the total flux is sigma * T_eff^4.

So, sigma * T_eff^4 = f * sigma * T_spot^4 + (1 - f) * sigma * T_unspotted^4.

Divide both sides by sigma:

T_eff^4 = f * T_spot^4 + (1 - f) * T_unspotted^4.

We know T_unspotted is 6000 K, f = 0.4, T_eff = 5500 K. So,

5500^4 = 0.4 * T_spot^4 + 0.6 * 6000^4.

We can solve for T_spot.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Because the star's effective temperature is a measure of the total emitted flux, not the local temperatures. So, this equation should give us T_spot.

Let me compute the numbers.

Compute 5500^4, 6000^4.

But perhaps I can rearrange the equation.

Let me denote:

Let me compute 5500^4: 5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12.

5.5^4: 5.5 *5.5 =30.25; 30.25 *5.5=166.375; 166.375 *5.5≈ 915.06. So 5.5^4 ≈915.06 → 915.06e12.

Similarly, 6000^4=6^4 *1e12=1296e12.

So,

915.06e12 = 0.4 * T_spot^4 + 0.6 * 1296e12.

Compute 0.6 *1296e12 = 777.6e12.

So,

915.06e12 - 777.6e12 = 0.4 * T_spot^4.

Which is (137.46) e12 = 0.4 T_spot^4.

So,

T_spot^4 = (137.46e12) / 0.4 = 343.65e12.

Take the fourth root:

T_spot = (343.65e12)^(1/4).

Let me compute 343.65e12 = 3.4365e14.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (343.65e12)^(1/4).

But 343.65e12 is 3.4365e14.

What's the fourth root of 3.4365e14?

Wait, 1e14 is (1e3.5)^4 ≈ because (1e3.5)^4 = (3.16e3)^4 ≈ 1e14. So, 3.4365e14 is about (3.4365)^(1/4) *1e3.5.

Wait, 3.4365^(1/4) is approx sqrt(sqrt(3.4365)).

sqrt(3.4365) is about 1.854. sqrt(1.854) is about 1.362.

So, 1.362 * 1e3.5 ≈ 1.362 *3.16e3 ≈ 4304 K.

Wait, that's about 4300 K. So T_spot is approximately 4300 K.

Okay, so when the star has spots, 40% of the surface is at 4300 K, and 60% is at 6000 K. Now, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere.

Wait, but where are the Ti lines formed? If the line is formed in the unspotted regions, the temperature would be 6000 K. If it's in the spotted regions, 4300 K. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, perhaps the line is formed in the spotted regions, or the overall photospheric temperature is lower, so the average ratio is lower.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. But the line formation depends on the local temperature. So, if the Ti lines are formed in the cooler spots, then the local temperature is 4300 K. If in the unspotted regions, 6000 K.

But the problem states that the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels (levels 1 and 2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) is lower.

Assuming that the line is formed in the same regions (unspotted or spotted). Wait, but when the star has spots, 40% of the surface is cooler, perhaps where the lines are formed? Or maybe the entire photosphere's temperature is considered as 5500 K for this purpose?

Wait, the problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. I think that's in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet. Ti lines in this region are often used for temperature diagnostics because they are sensitive to the excitation conditions.

So, the ratio n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Let me denote delta_E = E2 - E1, so ratio is proportional to exp( - delta_E/(k T) ).

Assuming g2/g1 is the same in both cases (no spots and with spots), then the ratio would change based on T.

Wait, but in the case when the star has spots, the line is formed in the cooler regions.

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused about what T to use. Let me clarify.

If the line is formed in the unspotted regions, then T remains at 6000 K, so the ratio would be the same. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the line must be formed in regions where the temperature has decreased.

Alternatively, perhaps the line is formed in the overall photosphere, which now has an effective temperature of 5500 K. But wait, the photosphere itself is a combination of different temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire star's photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that doesn't make sense because the spots are cooler regions.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that when the star has spots, the average temperature of the photosphere is lower, and the line ratio is determined by that average.

Wait, but the problem says the photosphere is in LTE, so each region's temperature is local. So, the ratio observed would be a combination of the contributions from both regions. But how would that work for a line?

But the problem says that the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two levels (n2/n1) is observed to decrease when spots are present. So, perhaps the line forms in regions where the temperature is now lower on average.

Alternatively, perhaps the line is formed in the cooler regions when spots are present, so the effective T is lower, leading to a lower ratio.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio (n2/n1) is lower. Let's think about how the ratio changes with T.

The ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( - delta_E/(k T) ). So, as T increases, the exponent becomes smaller (since denominator is larger), so the ratio increases. So, higher T leads to higher ratio.

Wait, if when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So, when the star has spots, T is lower, leading to lower ratio.

So, in the no-spots case, T is 6000 K, leading to a higher ratio. When spots are present, T is lower (4300 K from earlier calculation), leading to a lower ratio.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the line's formation is influenced by the overall Teff, but that doesn't seem right because line formation is in the local photosphere.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the average T of the photosphere is 5500 K, but that's not how photospheres work. The photosphere has a range of temperatures, but perhaps the effective temperature is an average.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the ratio when the star doesn't have spots and when it does. Let me denote T1 as 6000 K (no spots), and T2 as the temperature when spots are present. But wait, when spots are present, the overall effective T is 5500 K, but the local T where the line is formed could vary.

Wait, but the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, in the spotted case, the local T is lower, making the ratio lower. So, to find the factor by which the ratio changes (no spots vs. spots), we need to compute (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Which is [ (g2/g1) exp(-delta_E/(k T1)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-delta_E/(k T2)) ] ) = exp( [ -delta_E/(k T1) + delta_E/(k T2) ] ) = exp( delta_E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, because when T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio decreases. Wait, let me re-express the ratio.

Ratio without spots: R1 = exp( -delta_E/(k T1) )

With spots: R2 = exp( -delta_E/(k T2) )

But no, wait, T2 is lower than T1. So, delta_E/(k T2) is larger than delta_E/(k T1). So, R2 = exp( - (something larger) ), which is smaller than R1, leading to R1/R2 being a number greater than 1.

So, the ratio R1/R2 will be exp( (delta_E/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

But wait, T1 is 6000 K (no spots), and T2 is the temperature when spots are present. But in the spotted case, the line is formed in cooler regions, but I'm not sure what T to use. Alternatively, perhaps T2 is 5500 K, the effective temperature.

Wait, but earlier calculation found that when the star has spots, the spots themselves are at around 4300 K, but the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. So, the line is formed in both regions. But how does that affect the observed ratio?

In reality, the line would be formed in each region, and the observed line profile would be a combination, but the equivalent width or the strength of the line would be a blend. However, the problem states that the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels decreases when the star has spots. So, perhaps the line is formed in the cooler regions when the star has spots, so T is lower.

But I'm not entirely certain, so perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering that the overall effective temperature is the temperature used in the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, but the effective temperature is the overall flux, not the local temperature. So, when the star's overall Teff is 5500 K, the line strength may be influenced by the average temperature. But that's perhaps an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the photospheric temperature is 5500 K when the spots are present, regardless of the actual local temperatures.

But that doesn't make physical sense. The photosphere isn't uniformly at 5500 K when 40% is cooler. So, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed ratio is due to the entire photosphere cooling to 5500 K.

But wait, the initial Teff is 6000 K, and when spots are present, the Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the problem is using Teff as the temperature for the photosphere in the ratio calculation.

If that's the case, then T1 = 6000 K, T2 = 5500 K.

But let's compute the ratio.

We need to find the ratio (n2/n1) when T=6000 K divided by when T=5500 K.

Ratio = [ exp( -delta_E/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ exp( -delta_E/(k *5500) ) ] = exp( delta_E/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

Compute the exponent:

delta_E/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ]

But wait, delta_E is the energy difference between levels 2 and 1, and the wavelength is given as approximately 1448 Å. So, we can compute delta_E using the relation E = hc/lambda.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light.

E = hc/lambda.

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So,

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

But delta_E is E2 - E1, so this is the energy difference. So, delta_E = 1.372e-18 J.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

delta_E/(k) = (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23) ≈ 9.94e4 ≈ 99,400 K.

So, the exponent becomes:

99,400 * [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ]

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000≈1.667e-4.

Difference: 1.51e-5.

So,

99,400 * 1.51e-5 ≈ 99,400 * 0.0000151 ≈ approx 1.501e0 → approx 1.5.

So, the exponent is about 1.5.

So, the ratio is exp(1.5) ≈ 4.48.

Wait, exp(1.5) is e^1.5 ≈ 4.48.

So, the ratio R = no spots / has spots ≈ 4.48. So, the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but wait. Earlier I assumed that when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K and used that as T2. But in reality, the spots are cooler, and the rest is 6000 K. So, perhaps the correct T2 is 4300 K, if the line is formed in the spotted regions.

Wait, let's redo the calculation with T2=4300 K.

Compute the exponent:

delta_E/(k) [1/4300 - 1/6000]

Compute 1/4300 ≈ 2.326e-4, 1/6000≈1.667e-4.

Difference: 6.59e-5.

Multiply by 99400:

99400 * 6.59e-5 ≈ 6.55e0 = 6.55.

So, exponent is 6.55.

exp(6.55) is about 689. But wait, that's much larger than any of the options. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I got the expression wrong. Let's re-express the ratio.

Wait, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So, the problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So, it's R1 / R2.

In the no-spots case, T1=6000 K, so R1 = exp(-delta_E/(k T1)).

With spots, perhaps the line is formed in a region with T2=4300 K. So R2 = exp(-delta_E/(k T2)).

Thus, the ratio R1/R2 = exp( [delta_E/(k T1)] - [delta_E/(k T2)] )

But wait, that would be:

delta_E/(k) [ 1/(6000) - 1/(4300) ) ]

Wait, 1/6000 is smaller than 1/4300, so the exponent becomes delta_E/(k) * (negative number), which is negative. So the ratio R1/R2 would be less than 1, which contradicts the problem statement that the ratio decreases when the star has spots (so R1/R2 is greater than 1).

Hmm, perhaps I mixed up the ratio. Let's clarify.

The ratio when no spots is R1 = n2/n1 at T1=6000 K.

The ratio when spots are present is R2 = n2/n1 at T2=4300 K.

Since T2 < T1, delta_E/(k T2) > delta_E/(k T1), so R2 = exp(-a larger number) < R1. So, R1/R2 = [exp(-x)] / [exp(-y)] where x < y? Wait no: x is delta_E/(k T1), y is delta_E/(k T2). So x < y since T1 > T2.

Wait, let me rephrase.

R1 = exp(-x) where x = delta_E/(k T1).

R2 = exp(-y) where y = delta_E/(k T2).

Since T2 < T1, y > x.

So, R1/R2 = exp(-x) / exp(-y) = exp( y - x ) = exp( (delta_E/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because y - x = delta_E/(k T2) - delta_E/(k T1) = delta_E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So, that's the same as before.

So, the factor is exp( (delta_E/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, if T2 is 4300 K and T1 is 6000 K,

delta_E/(k) = 99400 K.

So,

(1/4300 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 4300)/(4300*6000) ) = 1700/(25800000) ≈ 6.59e-5.

Multiply by 99400: 99400 * 6.59e-5 ≈ 6.54.

So, the exponent is 6.54, which is about 6.5. exp(6.5) is about 665. So, R1/R2 would be about 665, which is way larger than any of the options. So that can't be right.

Wait, but earlier when I assumed T2 was 5500 K, the exponent was 1.5, leading to a ratio of ~4.5, which is option C.

So, perhaps the problem is considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, which is the effective temperature. But that's not physically accurate because the photosphere isn't uniform. However, maybe the problem is simplifying it that way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the star's entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, which would be an approximation for the sake of the problem.

Given that, let's proceed with T1 = 6000 K, T2 = 5500 K.

So, exponent is delta_E/(k) [1/5500 - 1/6000] = 99400 * (1/5500 - 1/6000).

Compute (1/5500)= ~1.818e-4, (1/6000)= ~1.667e-4. Subtract: 1.51e-5.

Multiply by 99400: 99400 *1.51e-5 ≈ 1.50.

So, exponent is 1.5, and exp(1.5) ≈ 4.48.

So the ratio is about 4.5, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when spots are present, the average T is lower, so the photosphere's temperature is 5500 K. Hence, the ratio would be about 4.5 times higher when there are no spots.

Another possibility is that the problem is considering that the line is formed in the unspotted regions when spots are present, so T remains 6000 K. But then the ratio wouldn't change, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K, but the line is formed in the photosphere. If the line is formed in the unspotted regions, the T is 6000 K, so R1/R2 would be 1, which doesn't make sense. But the problem says the ratio decreases, so the line must be formed in the cooler regions.

Hmm, perhaps the line is formed in the cooler regions, so T2=4300 K. But then the ratio would be too high, as I calculated earlier, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the effective temperature of the star's entire photosphere is 5500 K, so the line is formed in a photosphere that is at 5500 K. So, T1=6000 K, T2=5500 K.

Then, the ratio is exp(1.5) ≈4.48, so factor is about 4.5, which is option C.

Given the options, and the likely approach the problem expects, the correct answer is probably option C, ~4.5.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels using the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The problem asks for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.

### Key Information:
1. **No Spots**: The star's effective temperature (\(T_{\text{eff}}\)) is 6000 K.
2. **With Spots**: 40% of the surface is covered by cooler spots, and the overall \(T_{\text{eff}}\) decreases to 5500 K.
3. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, so \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\).

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta E\)
\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Boltzmann Constant Ratio
The ratio of the populations changes as:
\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right),
\]
where \(T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\). Substituting \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.51 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

\[
\text{Exponent} = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = 99,400 \times 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.5.
\]

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.5) \approx 4.48.
