Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. 

The data provided includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak at 3000 suggests it's an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong peak, often around 2500-3300. If it's a broad peak at 3000, maybe it's an alcohol. But wait, another possibility is an -OH group in another form, like maybe a phenol or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not.

Then, the FTIR also shows two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typically where carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb. So that's a strong indication of a carbonyl. Now, the 1650 peak could be another carbonyl, but maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, or an aromatic ring perhaps? Wait, aromatic rings (like in benzene) typically show peaks around 1450-1600 cm^-1 for C=C stretching. But 1650 is a bit higher. So maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Let me think: maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. So perhaps a ketone or an ester that's conjugated with a double bond.

So putting that together, the compound has an O-H group (from the broad peak) and a carbonyl group (from 1700). So possible structures could be something like a ketone with an alcohol group, or maybe an ester with an alcohol? Wait, but esters have two carbonyl groups? No, wait, esters have a carbonyl (C=O) and also an ether linkage. Wait, no, the ester group is O-C-O. So the carbonyl would be around 1700-1750. So if there's a peak at 1700, that could be an ester or a ketone. The 1650 peak might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring. Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR has several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, so that suggests the presence of a double bond. So the compound has a double bond, possibly conjugated with a carbonyl group. So maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. That would fit with the 1650 cm^-1 peak, which could be the C=C stretching in conjugation with the carbonyl.

So now, putting it all together. The compound has an O-H group, a carbonyl group, and a double bond. So it's probably something like a beta-keto alcohol or maybe an enol ester. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated ester with an alcohol group.

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2: Degree of unsaturation? Formula is C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one DoU, which would be one ring or one double bond. But wait, the NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond. So that would require DoU to be at least one. Wait, wait, let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, the formula is C6H12O2. The general formula for a saturated compound is 2n+2, where n is carbons. So for n=6, 2*6+2=14 H. Our compound has 12 H, so 14-12=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. Each DoU is a double bond or a ring. So two DoU in the molecule. So possibilities include a ring plus a double bond, or two double bonds, etc. For example, a benzene ring (3 DoU) but that's more than two. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, more accurately, the degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C6H12O2: C=6, H=12, O=2.

So (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. Hmm, that doesn't add up because the NMR suggests a double bond (so one DoU) and maybe another ring or a carbonyl group (which is another DoU). Wait, but wait, a carbonyl is a double bond, so that would contribute another DoU. So two DoU. But according to the calculation, the formula only allows for one DoU. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check. The formula is C6H12O2. For a molecule with O's and other atoms, the calculation remains the same because X and N are not present. So (2*6 +2 -12 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. So that suggests the molecule has either one ring, one double bond, or a combination of one ring and one double bond (but that would be two DoU, which is more than one, so that can't be). Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the O's affect it? No, the formula for DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, so O doesn't factor in. So the O's don't count. So, for the formula C6H12O2, the DoU is 1. So either a ring or a double bond or a triple bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So that's one DoU. Then, where's the other DoU? Or perhaps the carbonyl group (which is a double bond) is part of that same DoU. Wait, but the carbonyl is a C=O, which is a double bond. So that's another DoU. Wait, but earlier calculation said DoU is 1, so that's a problem.

Ah, perhaps I'm miscalculating the DoU. Let me try again. Let's compute for each option.

For option A: C6H12O2: DoU is (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. So with a double bond (1) and a carbonyl (another double bond, which is another DoU), that would require two DoU, but the formula has only one. That's a problem.

Wait, maybe the carbonyl is part of a cyclic structure. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me check the other options.

Option B: C6H10O: DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. So that could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2: DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU.

Option D: C6H12O: DoU is (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU.

So in the problem, the FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O), which is a double bond (so DoU 1), and the NMR shows a double bond (another DoU). So two DoU's. Therefore, the compound must have two DoU's. So which options have two DoU's?

Looking at the options:

A: DoU=1 → not enough.

B: DoU=2 → possible.

C: DoU=2 → possible.

D: DoU=1 → not enough.

So the correct formula must be either B or C.

Wait, but let's think about the FTIR again. We have peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a strong carbonyl, probably an ester or ketone. 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring. But the problem says the NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond. So perhaps the molecule has a conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

So, for instance, something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would have a carbonyl at ~1700 and a conjugated double bond, which would have a peak in the IR for the C=C at around 1650.

Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, or maybe an aromatic ring.

Wait, but the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond not in an aromatic ring (since aromatic protons are usually in a different region and have different splitting). So it's more likely an isolated double bond, perhaps conjugated with a carbonyl.

So, the structure likely has a carbonyl group (like an ester or ketone) and a double bond. So that's two DoU's. So the formula must have two DoU's, which points to options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H10O2).

Now, looking at the Mass Spec data: a fragment peak at m/z=45.

What's the m/z 45? Well, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3O- (32 for CH3 and 16 for O?), wait, no. Wait, 45 is molecular weight. Let's see: 45 could be (CH3)2O (which is 45: 2*(15) for CH3 (12+3=15) → 2*15=30, plus O is 16 → 46. No, that's 46. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)CO- , but that's 59? Wait, maybe 45 is a fragment from the molecule.

Alternatively, 45 could be C3H7O (but that's 3*12 +7 +16= 36+7+16=60? No. Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, 45 is the mass. Let's see:

- 45 could be C3H3O (3*12=36, 3H=3, O=16 → 36+3+16=55. No.)

Wait another approach: possible fragments. For example, the molecular ion could fragment into smaller ions. The m/z 45 could be a fragment like a methyl group plus something else. Alternatively, 45 is the mass of a CH3CO group? Let's see: CH3CO (without H) is 2*12 +3 +16 + another O maybe? Wait, CH3CO is 45? Let me compute:

Carbon: 2 → 24.

Hydrogen: 3 → 3.

Oxygen: 1 → 16.

Total: 24 +3 +16=43, no. Wait, maybe CH3COO-? No, that would be higher.

Wait, maybe it's a (CH2)2O group? (CH2)2O is 44 (2*(14) +16=44). No, 14*2=28, +16=44 → m/z 44. Not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a (CH3)2O group, which is 32 (15*2 +16=46? Wait, no. 15 is CH3, so 2 would be 30, plus 16 O → 46. So that's not 45.

Hmm, perhaps a different approach. Let me think about the possible molecular formulas. Let's see the options:

Option B: C6H10O.

What's the molecular weight? 6*12=72 + 10*1=10 +16=16 → 72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. MW: 6*12=72 +10 + 32= 72+10=82 +32=114.

So the molecular ion would be at 98 or 114. The fragment at 45 is much smaller than either. So perhaps it's a fragment of the molecule breaking off a part with mass 45.

What could give a fragment of 45? Let's think of common fragments. For example, a ketone or ester group. Alternatively, an ester group could lose a part.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of a methyl group (15) plus something else. Or perhaps it's a CH3CO- group without some Hs? Wait, CH3CO is 43 (12*2 + 3*1 +16 = 24+3+16=43). So not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be a fragment from an ester. Let's say the ester group is R-O-CO-O-R. No, that's not right. Maybe if the molecule is an ester, like RCOOR', upon fragmentation, it could lose the R' group, leaving RCOO- which would have a mass of, say, RCOO.

For example, if RCOO is CH3COO-, which is 59 (12*2 + 3 + 16*2= 24+3+32=59). Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a smaller part. Another approach: the molecular formula of the fragment is CxHyOz such that 12x + y +16z=45.

Let me try possible x, y, z.

Looking for x, y, z where 12x + y +16z =45.

z can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

If z=2: 16*2=32, so 12x + y =13. Possible x=1 → 12 + y=13 → y=1. So C1H1O2 → C=O-OH? Not likely.

z=1: 16*1=16 → 12x + y=29.

x=2 → 24 + y=29 → y=5. So C2H5O: molecular weight 2*12 +5 +16=24+5+16=45. So possible. So a fragment of C2H5O.

What would that be? It could be an ethoxy group (C2H5O), but in a fragment, perhaps a CH2CH2O+ ion? Not sure.

Alternatively, another z=1 possibility: x=1 → 12 + y=13 → y=1 → CHOH? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, z=3: 16*3=48. Which would make 12x + y = -3, which is impossible.

z=0: 12x + y=45. x=3 → 36 + y=45 → y=9. C3H9: which is possible, but would that fragment be likely? Maybe a propyl group.

Alternatively, x=2 →24 + y=21 → y=21. Which is high for H, but possible as a radical maybe.

Hmm, not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a carbonyl group plus something else.

Wait, what if the molecule is an ester with the formula RCOOR', and upon fragmentation, it loses the R' group, leaving the RCOO- group. Let's see the molecular weight of RCOO-.

RCOO- would be (R is C5H10O?), wait, but the original formula must fit.

Alternatively, thinking about the molecular formula, let's take option C: C6H10O2. If it's an ester, the structure could be RCOOR'. For example, methyl something or ethyl.

Wait, if the ester is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 or something, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's a diester or something else.

Wait, but the fragment at 45 could come from a smaller part of the molecule. Let me think about this. For example, for option C, which is C6H10O2, let's say it's a cyclic ester (a lactone), but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester, but then the NMR would have aromatic protons, which the question doesn't mention. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so maybe an alkene is present.

Another approach: Let's think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So maybe a cyclohexane ring with an ester group. But that would have a ring (DoU 1) and an ester (which has a carbonyl, DoU 1). Wait, but that would be two DoU's, but the formula only allows one. Hmm, so that's impossible. Therefore, option A can't be correct.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So maybe a molecule with a double bond and a ring.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So same as B, but with an extra O. Could be an ester or a ketone plus a ring or another double bond.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=1. So either a ring or a double bond. But we have both a carbonyl (another DoU) and a double bond in the NMR, so this would require two DoU's, which D doesn't provide. So D is out.

So we're down to options B and C.

Now, looking back to the FTIR, the strong peak at 1700 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, perhaps an ester or ketone. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring, but the presence of vinyl protons suggests a double bond, so it's more likely a conjugated carbonyl.

So, if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the structure would have a double bond next to the carbonyl. That would fit the IR peaks at 1700 (ester) and 1650 (conjugated double bond).

Which of the options B or C would fit that structure?

Option C is C6H10O2. That would have a molecular formula that allows for two DoU's. Let's say the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2... Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester with a double bond. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is something. Let's see, the formula would be C6H10O2. Let's count the carbons. CH2=CHCOO is 4 carbons (CH2-CH-COO-), so R would be two carbons, like CH2CH3. But wait, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 would be C5H8O2, but our options have C6. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a longer chain. For example, CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That would be six carbons (CH2=CHCH2-COO-CH2CH3). Wait, that's 2 (from CH2=CH) + 2 (CH2COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) = 6. So formula would be C6H10O2. Yes, because each CH2 adds 2 H's.

Wait, let me count the H's:

CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3.

Breaking it down:

CH2=CH- : 2 H's each on the double bond carbons → 2*2=4 H.

CH2- : 2 H's.

COO- : no H's attached.

CH2CH3: 5 H's (CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3).

Wait, but wait— the structure would actually be CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3.

So, the formula: each CH2=CH is 2 carbons, each with 3 H's but because of the double bond, it's 4 H's total. Then CH2 is 2 H's. COO is O's. CH2CH3 is 2 carbons, 5 H's. So total H's: (CH2=CH) contributes 4 H, (CH2) contributes 2, (COO) 0, (CH2CH3) contributes 5. That's 4+2+5=11 H. But the formula is C6H10O2. So 11 H's doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, maybe the structure is different. Like, for example, cyclopentene with an ester group. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a conjugated double bond, but I'm not quite getting it right.

Let me think about the mass spec again. The fragment at m/z 45 could be a CH3COO- group. Wait, CH3COO- is 59 (12*2 +3 +16*2=24+3+32=59). No, that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a smaller fragment. Like, a CH2CO- group? That would be 12+24 +16= 52. No. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a CH3CH2O group. CH2CH2O: 15 (CH2CH3) + 16 (O) → 31. No, that's 31, not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a COOCH2 group. CO
