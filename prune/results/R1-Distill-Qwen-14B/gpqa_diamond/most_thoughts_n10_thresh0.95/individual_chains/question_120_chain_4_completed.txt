Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Parallax (plx) is in arcseconds, and the formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1 / plx. So a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec away, 0.5 would be 2 parsecs, etc.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So I need to find how N (number of stars) depends on plx.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that would mean that the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. Wait, but how does that translate into the number per unit parallax?

Let me think about the volume of a sphere. For a given distance range, the volume is (4/3)π r³. But since we're dealing with parallax, which is inversely proportional to distance, maybe I should express it in terms of plx.

Wait, the distance can be written as d = 1/plx. So if I have a small change in plx, say d(plx), how does that relate to the distance? Let me see. Differentiating d = 1/plx gives dd = (1/plx²) d(plx). So d(plx) = plx² dd. Hmm, or perhaps the other way around? Let me see.

Wait, plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. The differential is dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx). But when plx increases, the distance decreases, so perhaps I need to consider the infinitesimal change in plx when moving from one distance shell to another.

But I'm getting a little confused. Let's think about the number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx.

The volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is surface area (4π d²) multiplied by dd. The number of stars in this shell would be the volume multiplied by the number density (n), since stars are uniformly distributed. So N = n * 4π d² dd.

But since d = 1/plx, substituting that in, d = 1/plx → d = plx^-1. Then, let's express everything in terms of plx and dplx.

So the volume element, dV, is 4π d² dd. But dd is the change in distance, which relates to the change in plx.

We have d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases. But since we're considering a small change, the magnitude would be what matters for the number of stars. So dd = (1/plx²) dplx → dplx = plx² dd.

Substituting back into dV: dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But from earlier, dd = dplx / plx². So dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

So the number of stars in the shell is N = n * dV = n * (4π dplx / plx^4).

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So per dplx, the number N is proportional to 1/plx^4. Because N = (n * 4π) * (dplx) / plx^4. So the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4 times a constant.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that would be the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of differential number. The number of stars per unit volume is n. The volume element in terms of plx is dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²). So dV = (4π) (dplx) / plx^4. So n dV = n (4π dplx) / plx^4. Which again gives the number per dplx as proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait a second, perhaps another approach. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume dV is n dV. Let's express dV in terms of parallax.

The volume as a function of parallax is tricky because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So the differential volume element in terms of parallax would be the derivative of the volume with respect to plx.

The volume up to a certain parallax plx is the volume of a sphere with radius d = 1/plx. So V = (4/3) π (1/plx)^3. Then, the change in volume dV when plx changes by dplx is dV = dV/dplx * dplx.

Compute dV/dplx: derivative of (4π/3) (1/plx)^3 → 4π/3 * (-3) (1/plx)^4 → -4π/(plx^4). The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, V decreases, which makes sense.

But the absolute value is 4π/(plx^4) * dplx. So the volume element dV is 4π dplx / plx^4.

So the number of stars in this volume is n * dV = n * 4π dplx / plx^4.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit change in plx (dplx) is (n 4π) / plx^4.

So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars (n) is constant. Parallax is inversely related to distance: \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). 

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density \( n \). The volume of the shell is \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}) \), where \( d(\text{plx}) \) is the small change in parallax. The negative sign indicates that as parallax increases, distance decreases, but we focus on the magnitude for the number of stars.

Substituting \( dd = \frac{d(\text{plx})}{\text{plx}^2} \) into \( dV \), we get:
\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{d(\text{plx})}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{4\pi d(\text{plx})}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then:
\[
N = n \cdot dV = n \cdot \frac{4\pi d(\text{plx})}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d(\text{plx}) \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
