Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound, called X, has some IR and NMR data, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find out what the final product is from the options given. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution reaction, like maybe a hydrolysis or a halogenation. Wait, no, wait, red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of certain groups, like maybe in the formation of an acid from an ester or something else.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad region. That probably indicates O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, sometimes broad because of hydrogen bonding. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl group. That could be a carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹) or maybe an ester or ketone. Also, 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ might be aromatic C=C stretches. So the presence of these suggests a benzene ring with substituents.

Now the NMR data. Let's go through each peak:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) → That's a broad singlet. Probably an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols have protons around 1-5 ppm, but a broad peak around 10 is more indicative of a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) → These are typical of para-substituted benzene rings. The doublets suggest two sets of protons in a para-substituted aromatic ring, like two sets of two equivalent protons each. So maybe something like a para-substituted benzoic acid or benzyl group.

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → A multiplet, maybe a CH group adjacent to something else, like an oxygen or another CH. Maybe part of a chain or a substituent on the benzene.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → A multiplet integrating for two protons. Could be CH₂ groups, perhaps in a chain like -CH₂-CH₂-.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → A doublet, probably a CH₃ group attached to something that splits the signal into a doublet. Maybe a methyl group attached to a CH₂, like in an isobutyl group or something like that.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → A triplet, integrating for three protons. That's a typical terminal methyl group, like CH₂CH₂CH₃. So maybe a propyl chain, but wait, the triplet comes from adjacent CH₂, so maybe an ethyl group attached to a CH₂.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring is para-substituted with a substituent that includes a chain. The O-H at 10.5 suggests a carboxylic acid. So the substituent is a -COOH group. Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which fits a carboxylic acid (they are typically a bit lower, like around 1700, but can vary). Alternatively, maybe an ester, but the NMR doesn't show ester groups or carbonyl adjacent O's. So I'm leaning towards a benzoic acid.

So the structure I'm thinking is something like para-substituted benzoic acid with a side chain. The NMR also shows a CH group (2.9 ppm), a CH₂ (1.7 ppm), and some branching. Let me try to sketch it out.

The aromatic ring has a COOH group at the para position. Then, attached to the ring, there's a substituent which is a chain. Let's see the NMR:

The 2H at 1.7 ppm, perhaps a CH₂ connected to something. The 3H at 1.4 ppm as a doublet suggests a CH(CH3) group. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is a CH3 at the end of a chain. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH₂-CH(CH3)₂ group? Wait no, maybe a butyl group. Alternatively, maybe a propyl group with branching.

Wait, looking at the substituent: the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which could be a CH connected to two other groups. For example, maybe a CH connected to a CH₂ and a CH(CH3)₂. Or perhaps a CH connected to a CH₂ and another CH₂.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group? Let me think. The NMR shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): maybe a methylene group adjacent to the ring. No, wait, that's one proton. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a secondary carbon. Let's consider the entire chain.

Suppose the substituent is a -CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₂CH3) group. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂- group? Or perhaps a branching like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Let me think about the integration.

The 2H at 1.7 ppm (m) could be a CH₂ group, perhaps adjacent to a CH group. The 3H at 1.4 ppm is a methyl attached to a CH, which is then attached to a CH₂. The triplet at 0.9 ppm would come from a CH3 attached to a CH₂, which is part of a longer chain.

Putting it all together, maybe the substituent is a -CH₂-CH(CH3)₂ group. Wait, no, that would give a 9 ppm shift for the CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₂CH3) group? No, that might not fit.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH₂-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring. But that leaves the 1.7 ppm as a CH₂ and the 2.9 as a CH.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, maybe I should think about the options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, the structure of compound X must be such that when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it forms one of these products.

Wait, but what's the reaction? Red phosphorus and HI. Oh, I think that's a hydrolysis reaction, perhaps. Or maybe a substitution. Wait, red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to form amines, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a halogenation?

Wait, no, another thought: when a benzyl halide reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it might undergo substitution. Wait, another possibility: if the compound is an ester, red phosphorus and HI can cause its hydrolysis. Alternatively, if it's a nitrile, it might form an amide or an acid.

Wait, but looking at the IR, the 1720 cm⁻¹ could be a carbonyl. If it's a nitrile, the carbonyl would be around 2200 cm⁻¹, which isn't present. So maybe it's a ketone, ester, or carboxylic acid. The presence of O-H in IR and NMR suggests a carboxylic acid, because esters don't usually have O-H unless it's a hemiacetal or something.

So if X is a benzoic acid with some substituent, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI might not change it? Or perhaps it's an ester. Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a phenyl ester. For example, something like phenyl acetate. Then, hydrolysis with HI and red phosphorus would produce the corresponding acid. But I'm not too sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps X is an aromatic nitrile, but the IR doesn't show the nitrile peak.

Alternatively, maybe X is a benzyl ester, like methyl benzoate. Then, hydrolysis with HI would produce benzoic acid. But let's look at the options. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would imply that the starting material had a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring as an ester or something else.

Wait, but the starting compound has a substituent as in the NMR. Let me try to figure out the structure of X.

The NMR:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) → O-H of a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene. So two protons in one position (downfield) and two in another.

So the substituent is at the para position. Wait, the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are doublets, which suggests each is for two protons each. So the substituent is para. So the substituent is at position 4.

So, the benzene has a substituent at position 4 (para) which is the acid group, and another substituent at position 1? Or wait, maybe both substituents are at the same position?

Wait, no, if it's a para-substituted benzene, that's one substituent. But the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests two different substituents. Wait, no, perhaps it's a monosubstituted benzene with two different substituents, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group, which would cause the ring protons to split into doublets.

Wait, maybe it's a monosubstituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group, causing the ortho and para protons to split into doublets. But the downfield shift suggests that the substituent is electron-withdrawing, like a carbonyl group, which would deshield the protons.

Wait, in a monosubstituted benzene with a strong electron-withdrawing group (like -COOH), the ring protons would typically be split into two sets. For example, the para position (the substituent is at position 1), the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded and appear downfield, and the meta protons (positions 3 and 5) would be upfield. Or wait, no, the position of the substituent affects the ring protons in a certain way.

Wait, the substituent is at position 4, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: in a para-substituted benzene with a strong electron-withdrawing group, the two protons adjacent (ortho) to the substituent would be more deshielded (downfield) and appear as a doublet. The other two protons (meta to substituent) would be less deshielded and appear upfield. But in the NMR provided, the peaks are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H), which suggests two sets of two protons each. So maybe the substituent is at a position where it causes the ortho and para protons to split into two doublets. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the ring is disubstituted, leading to two doublets.

Wait, but the compound is para-substituted, but perhaps the substituent is another group. Maybe the substituent includes a side chain. So, for example, the benzene has a substituent at the para position that's a -COOH group and also has another substituent, like a butyl group. Hmm, but the NMR only shows two sets of aromatic protons. So probably it's a monosubstituted benzene, but the substituent is such that it causes two different environments for the ring protons. Wait, but that's possible only if the substituent is such that it's causing the ring to have two sets of protons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that's not symmetric, leading to ortho and meta protons having different shifts.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -COOH, which is a strong EWG. So the ring protons would be at two different positions. The two ortho protons would be more deshielded (8.0 ppm) and the two meta protons would be less deshielded (7.2 ppm). So that would fit the NMR data. So the substituent is -COOH at the para position, making the ortho protons more downfield.

But then, what about the other signals in the NMR? Let's look at the rest.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to the ring. Let's say the substituent is -COOH, and maybe it's attached to a chain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a larger group, like a -CH2-COOH. Wait, but the IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which would fit a carboxylic acid's carbonyl.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any carbonyl adjacent protons, like a CH2COOH. So maybe the substituent is directly attached as a -COOH group, and the other groups are part of the side chain.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is perhaps a CH group connected to the ring. Then the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is CH2, and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain.

So putting it together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. Wait, or more accurately, maybe the substituent is a -CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂- group, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH₂CH(CH3)₂. So the structure would be benzene with a substituent at the para position. The substituent would be a -COOH group (from the O-H in the NMR and IR), but also a sec-butyl group? That can't be because the ring can't have two substituents if it's a monosubstituted benzene. Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are only showing two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene with one substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring, making it a butyl group, and the -COOH is attached elsewhere? That doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps compound X is a phenyl ester, like ethyl benzoate. But then the ester group would have a carbonyl (IR 1720), and the O-H would be in the ester, but esters don't have O-H protons. Wait, but the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which is O-H. So that's more consistent with a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-COOH group. So the benzene ring has a -CH2-COOH group attached at the para position. Then the aromatic protons would be ortho and meta to that group.

In that case, the CH2-COOH would give a CH2 group, but in the NMR, the CH2 is at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). Wait, no, CH2 would be two protons. Oh wait, no, perhaps it's a CH group. Let me think.

If the substituent is -CH2-COOH, then the CH2 would be adjacent to the ring. The CH2 would be split into a quartet or triplet, but in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. Hmm, maybe it's a CH group (like -CH-), but that would require a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring, with a carboxylic acid somewhere. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think about the product after the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce carboxylic acids. Alternatively, if X is an ester, the reaction might hydrolyze it into a carboxylic acid. But the NMR suggests that X already has a carboxylic acid group, so maybe the reaction is something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a benzyl chloride or benzyl bromide, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, I've heard that red phosphorus and HI can be used in the substitution of certain groups. Wait, maybe the compound X is a benzyl ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to the acid. So if X is, say, ethyl benzoate, then reaction with HI and PPh3 (but wait, the question says red phosphorus and HI) would hydrolyze it to benzoic acid. But in our case, the substituent is more complex.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would imply that the starting material had a sec-butyl ester group attached to the benzene ring. Then, hydrolysis would convert the ester to a carboxylic acid.

So if X is the ester, for example, 4-(sec-butyl)phenyl benzoate, then hydrolysis would give 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But wait, let's see. The NMR of X would then be that of the ester. But the NMR we have shows a broad O-H signal which suggests a carboxylic acid, not an ester. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, maybe X isn't an ester. Let me think again about the NMR data. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, 1H, which is O-H. So perhaps X is a benzoic acid with a substituent. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would do what? Maybe it's a protection or deprotection reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a nitrile attached to a benzene ring with a substituent. Then, reaction with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So if X is 4-(propyl)benzonitrile, then the reaction would produce 4-(propyl)benzoic acid. But looking at the NMR, it doesn't show any nitrile protons (which would be around 2 ppm as a triplet or something). So that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe X is a ketone, but I don't see how the IR would fit. The IR would show a strong carbonyl around 1720, but the NMR doesn't show any protons adjacent to the carbonyl, which is more typical of a ketone.

Wait, going back to the NMR, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is then attached to something else. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain. So perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let me consider a sec-butyl group.

A sec-butyl group is CH₂CH(CH3)₂. So the substituent on the benzene ring would be CH₂CH(CH3)₂, but that would make the structure 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid if the benzene has a COOH group. But wait, the substituents would both be on the benzene, which isn't possible unless it's a disubstituted benzene.

Wait, but the NMR shows only two groups of aromatic protons, suggesting a monosubstituted benzene. So maybe the substituent is a -COOH group along with a butyl group, but that would mean two substituents, which might complicate the NMR.

Hmm, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let's look at the options again. The options are either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would have a benzene ring with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group. But that would make it a disubstituted benzene, which would have different NMR signals than what's given. The NMR given shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, which is more consistent with a para-substituted benzene. But if there are two substituents, the aromatic protons would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: the reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI gives one of the options. So what kind of reaction is that?

Red phosphorus and HI are often used to cleave triple bonds, like in the hydrolysis of nitriles. For example, a nitrile (R-C≡N) can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid (R-COOH) using HI and red phosphorus. So if X is a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid derivative. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus would produce 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But then, what is the NMR of X? Let's imagine X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile.

The NMR would show:

- Aromatic protons: depending on the substituent, but if it's a para-substituted benzene with a nitrile, the ring current would cause the ortho and para protons to split into two doublets. So that would fit the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm signals.

Other signals:

- The nitrile group doesn't have protons, so no signal around 2 ppm. However, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have its own signals.

Wait, the substituent would be a CH₂CH(CH3)₂ group attached to the ring. The NMR of X (the nitrile) would have:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets, as observed.

- The CH₂ group of the sec-butyl: perhaps around 1.4 ppm as a triplet or something? Hmm, but the given NMR has 1.4 ppm as a doublet (3H), which would imply a CH3 attached to a CH. So maybe the substituent is a propyl group or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Let me think.

If X is 4-(propyl)benzonitrile, then the substituent would be a propyl group (CH₂CH₂CH3) attached to the ring. The NMR would show:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets.

- The CH₂ groups in the propyl chain: the middle CH₂ might be at 1.7 ppm, and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

But wait, the given NMR has a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which would be a CH group adjacent to something else, like a CH₂. So perhaps the substituent is a CH₂CH(CH3)₂ group, which is a sec-butyl.

So the substituent is -CH₂-CH(CH3)₂ attached to the benzene ring. So the structure would be:

Ph-(CH₂)₂-C(CH3)₂.

Wait, no, wait. The substituent is a sec-butyl group: CH₂CH(CH3)₂.

So the NMR of X (the nitrile) would have:

- The aromatic protons as two doublets.

- The CH₂ group (attached to the ring) would have protons; perhaps around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet.

- The CH group (CH(CH3)₂) would have protons. The CH(CH3)₂ group would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups and a triplet for the central CH.

Wait, but in the given NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would correspond to a methyl group attached to a CH, which is then attached to a CH₂. So that would suggest a structure like CH₂-CH(CH3)-something.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting closer. If X is a nitrile with a substituent that includes a sec-butyl group, then after hydrolysis, the product would be a benzoic acid with the same substituent.

So, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile. After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it becomes 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

But let me check the NMR of X. The nitrile would not have any protons on the carbon adjacent to the ring. So the substituent would be a -CH₂-CH(CH3)₂ group attached to the ring. The CH₂ group would be adjacent to the ring and perhaps have a triplet or something, but in the given NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for one H, which would be the CH group in the middle.

Wait, the substituent is -CH₂-CH(CH3)₂. So the CH₂ is between the ring and the CH(CH3)₂
