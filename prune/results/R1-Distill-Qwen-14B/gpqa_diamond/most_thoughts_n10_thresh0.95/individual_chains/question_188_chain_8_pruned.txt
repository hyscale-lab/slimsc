Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance of a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice, which is important for things like X-ray diffraction.

So the given data includes the interatomic distance, which I think refers to the lattice parameter 'a' in a cubic crystal. Wait, but wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, not cubic. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are equal (a = b = c), but the angles between them aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Here, alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. That's quite a distortion from the cubic structure.

The formula for interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices multiplied by some factors. Wait, the general formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cosα + 2hl cosβ + 2kl cosγ) ) ), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the inverse of the square root of (h² + k² + l²) multiplied by something else, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I remember that in a cubic system, the formula simplifies because all angles are 90 degrees. So for a cubic system, cos terms become zero, and the formula becomes d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But in a rhombohedral system, the angles aren't 90, so the formula has additional terms.

Wait, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) )? Or is it hkl squared plus some other terms? Oh right, I think I'm getting it wrong. Let me think. The general formula for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - (2hk cos α)/(a b) - (2hl cos γ)/(a c) - (2kl cos β)/(b c) ) )

But wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, a = b = c, right? Because all edges are equal. So a is the same as b and c. And all the angles are 30 degrees. So let's plug these into the formula.

So, for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and angles α=β=γ=30 degrees.

The Miller indices here are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So substituting into the formula:

d = 1 / sqrt( (1²/a²) + (1²/a²) + (1²/a²) - 2*(1*1 * cos 30°)/(a²) - 2*(1*1 * cos 30°)/(a²) - 2*(1*1 * cos 30°)/(a²) )

Wait, let's think about that. Each term is:

h²/a² + k²/a² + l²/a² = (1 + 1 + 1)/a² = 3/a².

Then the other terms are:

-2hk cos α/(a²) for each pair (h,k), (h,l), (k,l). But since all angles are 30 degrees, each term is -2*(1)(1)*cos30° / a².

So, there are three such terms. So:

-2 * 3 * (cos30° ) / a².

Wait, no. Wait, each cross term is for a specific pair: hk, hl, kl. Each has their own angle, but in this case, all are 30 degrees.

So:

-2*(hk cos α)/(a²) - 2*(hl cos β)/(a²) - 2*(kl cos γ)/(a²)

But since α=β=γ=30°, and h=k=l=1, each term is 2*(1*1 * cos30°)/(a²). So the sum of the three terms is -2*3*(cos30°)/(a²) ?

Wait, no, the three terms are each -2*(hk cos α)/(a²), -2*(hl cos β)/(a²), -2*(kl cos γ)/(a²). Because hk is 1*1, and each angle is 30, so each cos is cos30.

So each term is -2*(1*1 * cos30)/a². There are three terms, so -6 * (cos30°)/a².

Putting it all together, the denominator inside the square root is:

(3/a²) - (6 * cos30° / a²) = [3 - 6 cos30° ] / a².

So d = 1 / sqrt( [3 -6 cos30° ] / a² ) = a / sqrt(3 -6 cos30° ) ?

Wait, but wait, in the formula, the denominator is 3/a² minus 6 cos30°/a². So that's (3 - 6 cos30°)/a². So the square root of that is sqrt( (3 -6 cos30)/a² ) = sqrt(3-6 cos30)/a.

So d = 1 / [ sqrt(3 -6 cos30)/a ] = a / sqrt(3 -6 cos30° )

Wait, but wait, the interatomic distance given is 10 Angstrom. Wait, I think I'm mixing terms. Oh, wait, the interatomic distance in a crystal is the lattice parameter a, right? So a=10 Angstrom.

So substituting a=10 into the equation:

d = 10 / sqrt(3 -6 cos30° )

Calculate the values step by step.

First, compute cos30°. Cos30 is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So 3 -6 * 0.8660 = 3 -5.196 = 3-5.196= -2.196. Wait, that can't be right because the denominator inside the square root would be negative, which would make d imaginary. That can't be correct. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 h k cos α - 2 h l cos β - 2 k l cos γ )

Wait, no, that can't be right because in a cubic system, the formula would reduce to a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but wait, the formula I'm thinking of is for when the angles are 90 degrees, so the cos terms would be zero. But wait in this case, all angles are
