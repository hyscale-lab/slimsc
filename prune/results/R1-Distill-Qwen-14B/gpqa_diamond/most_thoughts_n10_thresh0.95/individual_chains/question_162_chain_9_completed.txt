Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait a second, that looks a bit like a conformally flat metric. Right, because it's just a scalar function multiplied by the flat (dx² + dy²) part. So the metric is conformally related to the Euclidean metric in 2D. 

I remember that in general, the area element in such a metric would be the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. Since the metric is diagonal and each component is multiplied by the same function, the determinant is just the square of the function. So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy. Since g_xy is zero here, it's just sqrt(g_xx * g_yy). Both g_xx and g_yy are 32/(4 - x² - y²), so the product is (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2. The square root of that would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere—oh right, that's a surface with constant negative curvature, like a saddle shape. In 2D, a pseudosphere is sometimes called a tractricoid or something like that. Alternatively, maybe in this context, it's referring to a 2-sphere with negative curvature, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, a sphere would have positive curvature. Pseudosphere must have negative curvature.

Now, the metric given here looks like it's for a space with negative curvature. Because the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that the function is positive when x² + y² <4. So the domain is the disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. That makes sense because for a pseudosphere, which is a surface of revolution of a tractrix, the radius of the pseudosphere is related to the curvature. So if the radius here is 2, perhaps the domain is a disk of radius 2.

Wait, but wait. The options are giving the area. So the area would be the integral of dA over the domain where the metric is defined. The domain is all (x,y) such that 4 - x² - y² >0, so x² + y² <4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2.

So to find the total area, I need to integrate dA over x and y in that circle. So the integral is ∫∫ [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy, integrated over x² + y² <4.

Hmm, that integral might be a bit tricky. Let me switch to polar coordinates because of the circular symmetry. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, and the Jacobian determinant is r. So dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

The integrand becomes 32/(4 - r²) * r dr dθ. So the integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute the radial integral first. Let me make a substitution for the integral of r/(4 - r²) dr. Let u = 4 - r², then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. Hmm, so when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] r dr = 32 ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [1/u] (-du/2) )

Wait, let's see: r dr = (-du/2) → so the integral becomes:

32 ∫ (r=0 to 2) [1/(4 - r²)] r dr = 32 * (1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) (-du) )

Wait, the limits flip because when r increases, u decreases. So the integral r from 0 to2 becomes u from 4 to 0. So with the substitution, the integral becomes:

32 * (1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) [1/u] (-du) )

The (-du) comes from the substitution, so the integral becomes:

32 * (1/2) ∫ (from 0 to4) [1/u] du )

Because the limits flip and the negative flips them back. So that equals 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du.

Wait, but ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4 is ln(u) evaluated from 0 to4. Oh wait, ln(4) - ln(0). But ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, that can't be right. So the integral would diverge? That would mean the area is infinite. But that can't be right either because the metric's behavior is at the boundary.

Wait, let me double-check the substitution. The substitution for the radial integral:

r dr = (-du/2), so the integral becomes:

32 * ∫ [1/(u)] * (-du/2) evaluated from u=4 to u=0.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du.

Which is equal to (32 * (-1/2)) * [ln(u) from 4 to 0] → 32 * (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is -infinity, so ln(0) - ln(4) is -infinity - ln(4) = -infinity. So the whole thing becomes (32 * (-1/2)) * (-infinite) → positive infinity. Wait, but wait. Let me compute it again.

Wait, the integral is from 0 to 2 for r, which corresponds to u from 4 to 0. So the integral becomes 32 * ∫ (r from 0 to2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this without substitution perhaps. Let me integrate r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me set u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → ( - du/2 ) = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [1 / u ] (-du/2) = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du → (-1/2) ln |u| + C.

So evaluating from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2, u=4 - (2)^2=0 → ln(0) is -infty. At r=0, u=4.

So the definite integral is (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ] → (-1/2)(-infty - ln4) = (-1/2)(-infty) → positive infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. So the radial integral diverges, which would imply that the area integral is infinite.

So the area would be ∫θ=0 to 2π [radial integral] dθ. If the radial integral is infinite, then the whole area is infinite. So the total area is infinite. So looking at the options, option D is +infty. 

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again. The metric might be for a pseudosphere, which is a finite area surface. Oh wait, but in 2D, the pseudosphere is a surface of infinite area. Or wait, perhaps not. Wait, no— the pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a surface of finite area. But perhaps in this metric, we're looking at a surface that wraps around infinitely, but in this case, the domain is the disk x² + y² <4, which is finite. So why is the integral giving infinite area? That would mean the area is infinite, which would correspond to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me think again. The area element is (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ. So the integral over r from 0 to2 and θ from 0 to 2π.

Let me compute the radial integral: ∫0^2 [32 r ] / (4 - r²) dr.

Let me make substitution u = 4 - r². du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ [1/u] (-du/2) from u=4 to u=0.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du.

So that's 32 * (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

= 32 * (-1/2) ( ln 0 - ln4 )

But ln 0 is -infty, so ln0 - ln4 = -infty - ln4 = -infty.

So multiplying: 32 * (-1/2) * (-infty) = 32 * (infty/2) = infty.

So the integral is infinite. So the area is infinite, which corresponds to option D.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the pseudosphere in this metric is a finite area. Or maybe I'm thinking of the 3D pseudosphere, which has finite area, but in 2D, perhaps the integral is divergent.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Because the metric is in two dimensions (only dx and dy), so the "pseudosphere" here might be referring to a 2D surface. Wait, but pseudospheres are usually surfaces in 3D. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a 2D surface embedded in 3D, but in any case, the metric given is 2D.

Wait, perhaps the metric is for a 2D surface, and the area in question is the area of the entire pseudosphere, which would have some finite area. But according to the integral, the area is infinite, so the answer would be option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me compute the integral again.

Compute the radial integral: ∫0^2 (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me do it another way. Let me expand the denominator as (4 - r²) = (2 - r)(2 + r). Perhaps partial fractions?

But 32 r = A (2 - r) + B (2 + r). Let me see, but I don't think partial fractions will help here because the numerator is r and denominator is (4 - r²), which is (2 - r)(2 + r).

Alternatively, note that d/dr (4 - r²) = -2r. So the integrand can be expressed as (32 r)/(4 - r^2) = -16 * [d/dr (4 - r^2)] / (4 - r^2). So that's -16 d/dr [ ln(4 - r^2) ) ].

Wait, but integrating that would give -16 ln(4 - r^2). Evaluated from 0 to 2.

At r=2, ln(0) is -infty. So the integral would be [ -16 ln(0) ] - [ -16 ln(4) ] → (-16)(-infty) - (-16 * ln4) = +infty + 16 ln4. Which is infinity.

So yes, the integral diverges, leading to infinite area.

So the area is infinite, so the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is conformally flat, meaning it is related to the Euclidean metric by a scalar function. The area element in this metric is derived as:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where the determinant of the metric tensor is \(\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). The domain of the metric is restricted to \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over this domain:

\[
A = \int_{x^2 + y^2 < 4} \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\), and \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-1}{2u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du\) diverges because \(\ln(u)\) approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\). This indicates that the area integral diverges, leading to an infinite total area.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
