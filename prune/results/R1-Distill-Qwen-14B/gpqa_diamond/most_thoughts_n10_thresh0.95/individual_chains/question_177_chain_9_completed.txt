Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Hmmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, M1 = 1.5 M2. Interesting. Then, the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation, which depends on their temperatures.

Wait, the peak wavelength (lambda_max) is given by Wien's law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda_max is the same, then T must be the same. So T1 = T2.

But wait, the radial velocities are different. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But how does that affect their observed luminosity? Oh, right, because of the Doppler effect. When a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength shifts. But wait, the problem says they found the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe the Doppler shift doesn't affect the peak wavelength because they're using the rest frame measurements? Or perhaps the observed brightness is affected by the Doppler shift through changes in flux.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosities assuming the stars radiate as black bodies. So the luminosity calculation might not directly consider the Doppler effect, but perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed flux, which we can relate to luminosity.

Wait, no. Luminosity is an intrinsic property of the star, but the observed flux depends on the distance and any Doppler-related effects. But in this problem, perhaps the radial velocities are given to calculate something else. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think.

The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. So I need to compute L1 / L2.

Luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth.

Wait, but I thought earlier that T1 = T2 because lambda_max is the same. So if T is the same for both, then L is proportional to R squared. So if R1 is 1.5 times R2, then L1 would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times L2.

But wait, why are the options not exactly 2.25? The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, so maybe I'm missing something here. Because according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, if T is the same, L is proportional to R squared. So with R1 = 1.5 R2, L1 should be (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times L2. So option A is ~2.25.

But why are there other options close to that? Did I miss any factors?

Wait, the problem mentions that the radial velocities are different. How does that come into play? Because the observed flux (which is what we use to calculate luminosity) depends on the velocity due to Doppler shift.

Wait, the formula for flux from a star when there's a radial velocity is affected by the Doppler effect. The flux from a star moving towards us is blueshifted, which increases the observed flux in the blueshifted wavelength, but since we're considering the star's intrinsic luminosity, perhaps the Doppler effect doesn't change the total luminosity but affects the observed flux in a particular band.

Wait, no. Luminosity is an intrinsic property, so it shouldn't be affected by the star's velocity. Hmm. Wait, but if a star is moving towards us, we receive more photons per unit time because of the Doppler boosting. So the observed flux increases. But the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity using the black body assumption. So maybe they correct for the Doppler effect when calculating the flux, thereby accurately measuring the intrinsic luminosity.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocities affect the observed temperature, because of the Doppler shift. Because the star's spectral lines are Doppler shifted, but if they measure the peak wavelength, maybe they have to correct for that.

Wait, the problem says that the peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So without considering the Doppler shift, their intrinsic peak wavelengths would be the same. But if one star is moving towards us, its observed peak wavelength would be shorter than the intrinsic. Similarly, if moving away, the observed wavelength would be longer.

Wait, the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its observed peak wavelength would be longer than its intrinsic peak. But since Star_1's observed peak is the same as Star_2's, Star_1's intrinsic peak must be shorter than Star_2's. Or does it?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The peak wavelength λ_max observed is the same for both. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed λ_max is same as its intrinsic λ_max. Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s, but let's say it's moving away. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v_r2/c), where v_r2 is positive if moving away. Similarly, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then v_r2 is negative and λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v_r2/c). Or wait, the Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) when moving away, but I'm not too sure about the exact formula.

Wait, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) when the source is moving away. Alternatively, when the source is moving towards the observer, λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ), which is less than λ_rest, so the wavelength is blueshifted.

But in this problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So for Star_1, which has v_r1 = 0, λ1_obs = λ1_rest. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ1_rest (since they are same). So we can relate λ2_rest to λ2_obs using the Doppler shift formula.

So, λ2_rest = λ2_obs * sqrt( (1 - v_r2/c) / (1 + v_r2/c) ) )

But λ2_obs = λ1_obs = λ1_rest. And since Star_1's λ1_rest is equal to its T1, because λ_max = b / T.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach: since both stars appear to have the same observed λ_max, but their rest λ_max would be different due to their velocities.

But wait, the problem says that the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. So the observed peak wavelengths are the same.

Let me denote λ1 as the intrinsic (rest) peak wavelength of Star_1, and λ2 as that of Star_2.

So, for Star_1, since it's not moving (v=0), λ_obs1 = λ1.

For Star_2, moving at v = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away. Then, the observed wavelength would be λ_obs2 = λ2 * (1 + v/c), where v is positive if moving away. Wait, no, that's the non-relativistic approximation. The exact formula is more complicated, but perhaps for 700 km/s, which is about 0.00233c (since c is about 3e5 km/s), the relativistic effects might be negligible, and the non-relativistic formula is sufficient.

But wait, to be precise, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is approximately λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive when moving away. Similarly, if moving towards, λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 - v/c).

In this problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The question doesn't specify whether it's moving towards or away, but the problem states that Star_1's radial velocity is 0, and Star_2's is 700. Let's assume that Star_2 is moving away, so v is positive.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, then its observed wavelength would be longer than its rest wavelength. But the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So Star_1's λ1 is equal to Star_2's observed λ_obs2.

So, λ_obs2 = λ2 * (1 + v_r2/c) ) = λ1.

But if λ1 is the rest wavelength for Star_1, and λ2 is for Star_2, and both are blackbody emitters, their rest wavelengths are related to their temperatures via Wien's law.

So, λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2.

But in this scenario, because the observed λ_max for Star_2 is longer than its rest λ_max (if moving away), but λ_obs2 = λ1.

So, let's write the relationship:

λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v_r2/c)

But since λ1 = b / T1 and λ2 = b / T2, substituting in:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Divide both sides by b:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Then,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, then (1 + v_r2/c) is greater than 1, so T1 would be less than T2. But earlier, I thought that T1 and T2 are the same because the observed λ_max are the same. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the observed λ_max is the same, but the rest λ_max (and thus T) are different.

Wait, let me think again. The observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So for Star_1, which is stationary, λ1_obs = λ1_rest. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * Doppler factor. So:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c )

But λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature: λ_max = b / T. So,

λ1_rest = b / T1

λ2_rest = b / T2

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Since v_r2 is positive (moving away), denominator is >1, so T1 < T2.

So, the temperatures are different. Now, this complicates things because earlier I thought T1 = T2, but that's not the case.

So now, the earlier approach of L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4

But R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

But T1 is T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So let's compute (T1/T2)^4.

But what is v_r2 in km/s? It's 700 km/s.

We need to compute v_r2/c.

v_r2 = 700 km/s.

c is approximately 299,792 km/s, so 3e5 km/s for approximation.

So v_r2/c ≈ 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333...

So (1 + v_r2/c ) ≈ 1.002333.

Thus, T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * (0.997675).

So T1 ≈ 0.997675 T2.

So (T1/T2) is approximately 0.997675.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.997675)^4.

Let me calculate that:

First, 0.997675 is approximately 1 - 0.002325.

So, (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x +6x² -4x³ +x^4, where x is 0.002325.

But maybe just calculate (0.997675)^4.

0.997675 squared is (approx):

0.997675 * 0.997675 = ?

Let me compute 0.997675 * 0.997675.

Well, 1 - 0.002325 is 0.997675.

(1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a².

a = 0.002325.

So,

1 - 2*(0.002325) + (0.002325)^2 = 1 - 0.00465 + 0.0000054.

Which is approximately 0.9953554.

Then, (0.9953554)^2.

Again, (1 - 2a + a²)^2 = 1 -4a + 6a² -4a³ +a^4.

But let's compute it directly.

0.9953554 * 0.9953554 ≈ (approx) 0.9907218.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

0.9953554 * 0.9953554:

= (1 - 0.0046446)^2

= 1 - 2*0.0046446 + (0.0046446)^2

= 1 - 0.0092892 + 0.00002157

≈ 0.9907323.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just compute the exponent:

(0.997675)^4 ≈ (0.997675)^2 squared.

Earlier, (0.997675)^2 ≈ 0.995355.

So (0.995355)^2 ≈ 0.990721.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.990721.

So, putting it all together, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1/R2 = 1.5.

So (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Multiply by (0.990721):

2.25 * 0.990721 ≈ 2.227.

So approximately 2.227, which is around 2.23.

Looking at the options, D is ~2.23. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the Doppler effect would be negligible, but it's actually making a small difference here.

So, the initial approach without considering the Doppler effect would give 2.25, but after considering the Doppler shift, the factor is a bit lower, around 2.23.

Hence, the correct answer is D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

Thus, the ratio of luminosities is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radii and Masses
The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5
\]

Squaring this gives:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperatures
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{max, obs}}\)) of both stars are the same. Using Wien's law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

the intrinsic temperature of a star is inversely proportional to its peak wavelength. For Star_2, which has a radial velocity of \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) (assumed to be moving away), the observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

For small velocities (\(v_r \ll c\)), this simplifies to:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest}} \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest, 2}} \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}\), we get:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}
\]

The speed of light \(c \approx 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), so:

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.00233
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \frac{1}{1 + 0.00233} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Ratio to the Fourth Power
Raising the temperature ratio to the fourth power:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (0.99767)^4
\]

Using the approximation \((1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x\) for small \(x\), where \(x = 1 - 0.99767 = 0.00233\):

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.00233) = 1 - 0.00932 = 0.99068
\]

### Step 4: Combine Ratios
Substituting into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.99068 \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
