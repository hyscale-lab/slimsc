Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

So, the setup: there's a spherical conductor, right? It's uncharged, meaning it has no net charge initially. Inside this conductor, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity isn't at the center—the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and since r is less than R (the radius of the conductor), the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Now, someone placed a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. Also, there's an angle θ between l and s.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields. Inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field is zero. Oh wait, but this is a cavity inside. So, charges can reside on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged initially. When a charge is placed inside the cavity, what happens? Oh right, in such a scenario, the charge induces charges on the cavity's inner surface and the conductor's outer surface. Let me think—since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface of the cavity would have an induced charge of -q. Then, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out, ensuring the conductor remains neutral.

Wait no, because the conductor was initially uncharged. So when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the cavity (inside the conductor) must have an induced charge of -q. That leaves the outer surface of the conductor with +q. Because the conductor as a whole must be neutral if we started with a neutral conductor. Wait, no—wait, the conductor was uncharged. So, the total charge on the conductor after placing +q inside would have to be +q? No, wait. Let me think again.

No, actually, the conductor was initially neutral. So when we place +q in the cavity, the conductor must adjust. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q, because the +q charge attracts the electrons. Then, since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the inner surface has -q, and the conductor as a whole needs to balance, so the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor's total charge is +q.

But the problem says the conductor is uncharged. Wait, hold on, the question states the conductor is uncharged, so perhaps when we put +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface is -q and the outer surface is +q. So the conductor's net charge is +q? But that contradicts the initial statement that the conductor is uncharged. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Oh wait, the conductor is a neutral spherical conductor. So when you place a charge +q inside its cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) will have an induced charge of -q. Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have +q to balance the -q on the inner side. So, the conductor's net charge is +q now. But wait, the question says the conductor is uncharged. Oh, maybe I misread. Let me check the question again.

The question says, "an uncharged spherical conductor of radius R"—so the conductor is neutral. So when we add charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's total charge remains neutral because the induced charges happen. Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's initial charge is zero. Placing +q in the cavity would cause the inner surface to have -q, and the outer surface would have +q, making the conductor's total charge +q. But the problem says the conductor is uncharged. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. No, the conductor was initially uncharged. When you place a positive charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have an induced negative charge of -q, leaving the outer surface to have +q. So the conductor's overall charge would be +q. But the problem says the conductor is uncharged. So that can't be. Wait, maybe the conductor is neutral, so the induced charges are such that the conductor's total remains zero.

Wait a second, perhaps I got it wrong. Let's think again. The conductor is neutral. Inside the cavity, we place a charge +q. The conductor's inner surface (cavity's walls) must have an induced charge of -q, because the +q attracts electrons. Then, since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance. So the conductor's net charge is +q, but the problem says it's uncharged. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting thoughts.

Wait, no—that's not right. Oh, wait, the conductor's net charge would be the sum of the inner and outer charges. The inner is -q, the outer is +q, so total is zero. Oh! Because the conductor was uncharged. So the outer surface has +q, inner has -q, so net is zero. So the conductor as a whole remains neutral.

So, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, and the inner surface has -q. When considering the electric field outside the conductor, only the charge on the outer surface contributes. Because, inside the conductor, the charges would have redistributed so that the field inside is zero. Outside, the field is as if the charge were a point charge at the center, since the conductor is spherical.

Wait, but the conductor isn't a point charge; it's a sphere. So the electric field outside the conductor would be as if the charge were located at the center of the sphere. So, for a point P outside, the electric field E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / (L²), where Q_enclosed is the charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface at radius L.

In this case, the conductor's outer surface has charge +q. So the total charge outside is +q. Therefore, the electric field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, but the charge inside the cavity is +q, and the conductor's inner surface is -q, outer is +q. So the total charge on the conductor is (-q + q) = 0. Wait, but then outside the conductor, the charge that contributes is the +q on the outer surface. So the electric field outside should be as if +q is at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity (as long as it's inside), the outer surface's charge will make the field outside similar to a point charge at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is a sphere, and the cavity is off-center. Does that affect the outer charge distribution? Because if the cavity is not at the center, the inner induced charge (-q) would not be uniformly distributed. It would be more concentrated towards the point where the charge +q is. But the outer surface, being a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, must have a symmetric distribution. Because the conductor itself is neutral, except for the induced charges.

Wait, no. If the cavity is not at the center, and the charge q is placed inside, the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge of -q, but not uniformly distributed. It would be closer to the charge q. But the outer surface of the conductor is still a sphere, so the charge on it would distribute uniformly, because the conductor is neutral. So the outer surface would have +q, as the conductor's net charge is zero. Because the inner surface is -q, so outer must be +q.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so it has zero net charge. When the +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) must have an induced -q. Because the +q charge attracts electrons from the conductor's material. So, the conductor's inner surface is -q. But since the conductor's overall charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because (-q) + (+q) = 0.

So the outer surface has +q, and it's spread uniformly because it's a conductor. So, from the outside, the conductor behaves as if all the charge is at the center. So the electric field outside would be as if a point charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the electric field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Hmm, looking at the options, option B matches that. Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

But wait, is there more to it? Because the point P is l distance from the cavity's center. The setup mentions l, s, and the angle θ. So perhaps the field isn't just from the outer charge. Maybe the inner charge's field also plays a role outside.

Wait, but the inner charge is -q, located on the inner surface. But outside the conductor, any charges inside the conductor (including the inner charge) are shielded. So their fields don't contribute outside. Only the outer charge contributes, so the field outside the conductor is just that of the +q on the outer surface, centered at the conductor's center.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so as per the shell theorem, a spherical shell of charge contributes to the electric field outside as if all the charge were at the center. So yes, the field at any point outside the sphere is as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

So regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity, the outer shell's field is uniform. So, for point P, the E is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L², which is option B.

Wait, but another thought: the cavity's center is offset by s from the conductor's center. The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center and makes an angle θ. How does that affect the field?

Hmm. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer charge is symmetric. So when considering the field outside, it's as if the charge is at the conductor's center. So the position of the cavity's center (s away) shouldn't affect the external field. Because the charges on the outer surface are symmetrically distributed, so the field outside is the same as a point charge at the center.

Wait, but if the charge inside the cavity is off-center, will that affect the outer charge distribution? No, because the outer surface is a conductor and must maintain electrostatic conditions. The outer surface's charge distribution depends on the overall charge on the conductor, which is +q. So yes, the outer surface's charge would distribute uniformly because it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, regardless of where the inner charge is placed.

So the electric field outside should be the same as if the charge were at the center of the conductor, so option B is correct.


The problem involves a neutral spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity). Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a spherical conductor is determined by the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. In this case, the outer surface of the conductor has a charge of $+q$, and this charge distributes uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. The electric field outside the conductor is therefore equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Effect of Off-Center Cavity**: The fact that the cavity is off-center (offset by $s$) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the charges on the outer surface of the conductor distribute uniformly, and the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, not on the distribution of charges inside the cavity.

4. **Electric Field at Point $P$**: Since the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the charge on the outer surface, the field at point $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. This expression suggests the electric field depends on $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the field outside the conductor.
- **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor, which depends only on $L$.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. This expression suggests the electric field depends on $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant for the field outside the conductor.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. This expression ignores the fact that the electric field outside the conductor depends on the total charge on the outer surface, not just $l$.

### Final Answer:
The electric field at point $P$ is given by:
\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
\]

Answer: B
