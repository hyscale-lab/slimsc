Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let's see what I can figure out. Hmm, the question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term is given, but I'm not sure how much that's going to factor into the kinematics part.

Wait, the problem is about finding which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed usually means the decay products' combined mass should be less than the mass of the boson, right? So, I'll need to look at the masses of possible fermion pairs.

The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So, any fermion pair it decays into must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions.

Fermions include quarks and leptons. The up (u) and down (d) quarks are the lightest, but their masses are around a few MeV. So, u and anti-u would be negligible. Same for d and anti-d. Then, the strange quark (s) is about 100 MeV, so s anti-s would be around 200 MeV. But wait, wait, but when considering pair production, the mass of each is added. Wait, but wait, the rest mass of each fermion is considered. For example, for a pair, you need twice the mass of the individual because you have both a particle and an antiparticle.

But wait, no, because in pair production, each fermion and anti-fermion have the same mass. So for a pair, the total rest mass is 2m. So, for a pair to be produced, the center-of-mass energy must be at least 2m.

So, for X to decay into a pair (like f and f-bar), 2m_fermion must be less than or equal to m_X.

So for each fermion, check 2m_f <= 6 GeV.

Let me list the fermion masses:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV (511 keV)
- Muon (μ): ~0.1057 GeV (105.7 MeV)
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV (3 MeV)
- Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV (4 MeV)
- Strange quark (s): ~0.10 GeV (100 MeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV (average say ~4.5 GeV)
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV

So, let's compute 2m for each:

- e: 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV --> way less than 6.
- μ: 2 * 0.1057 = 0.2114 GeV
- τ: 2 *1.777 = ~3.554 GeV
- u: 0.006 GeV
- d: 0.008 GeV
- s: 0.2 GeV
- c: 2.54 GeV
- b: 9 GeV (since 4.5*2=9), which is more than 6 GeV. So for b quarks, 2m_b = 9 GeV >6 GeV.

So, any fermion pair where 2m_f <=6 GeV is allowed.

So, looking at the possible fermions:

- e, μ, τ: yes, because 2m for τ is ~3.554 GeV <6 GeV.
- u, d: yes.
- s: yes.
- c: yes because 2.54 <6.
- b: no, because 9>6.
- t: no way.

So the allowed fermion pairs are: e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Wait, but the options don't have all of these. Let me look at the options.

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s, u u, d d, tau+, tau-, e+ e-. Wait, but b is 4.5 GeV per quark. So 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is way above 6. So option A is including b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c c, s s, u u, d d, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. All the fermions except b. Because c is 1.27 GeV, so 2.54 <6. So option B includes all the allowed except b. So this seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the option letters. Let me read the options again.

Option A includes b, which is not allowed. So it's wrong.

Option B: includes c c-bar. Because 2.54 is less than 6. So yes. So B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So any pair where 2m_f <6.

Wait, what about the top quark? It's not included because t is too heavy, but no option includes t.

So option B is correct? Let's see the options.

Option C includes t, which isn't allowed because 2m_t is way too big. So C is wrong.

Option D: includes b. So D is wrong.

Wait, looking back:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes, all allowed except b and t.

Wait, the given interaction term is L(y) = -λ f bar ψ f (y)(v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, but I think that's about the Yukawa coupling. But the interaction term probably determines which fermions can couple to X. Because the question is about the decay, so X can decay into fermions f and f-bar if the interaction term allows it.

Wait, the interaction is given as L = -λ f bar ψ_f (y) (v + X) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps I'm misreading that. Wait, the notation is a bit confusing. Let me parse it.

The term is -λ f bar psi_f (y) (v + X(y)) psi_f(y). Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of Yukawa coupling.

Wait, maybe the interaction is something like λ f ψ_f X. So, that would mean the coupling is between X and fermions ψ_f and another fermion f? Or perhaps it's a typo and should be something else. Wait, perhaps the term is -λ ψ_f^† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but that would be for a scalar coupling to a fermion field.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Yukawa interaction of the form ψ_f ψ_f X, but that would require X to be a scalar. So, the interaction term suggests that X is coupling to a fermion-antifermion pair. So, X can decay into any fermion pair ψ_f and ψ_f-bar if the coupling is present.

But perhaps the interaction term allows X to couple to any fermion ψ_f, which would imply that X can decay into any such fermion pair, provided the mass condition is met.

Wait, but the problem is about kinematically allowed decays, which depends only on the masses, not on the couplings. Because even if the interaction exists, if the mass condition isn't met, the decay isn't possible.

So, the possible decays depend only on the masses. So, regardless of the interaction, as long as the boson X has a mass greater than twice the fermion mass, that decay is possible.

Wait, but the interaction term tells us which fermions X can interact with. So, if the interaction term doesn't include a particular fermion, X can't decay into that fermion pair, even if the mass is right.

So, looking back at the given Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f bar ψ_f (y)(v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Hmm, perhaps I misread the term. Let me think again. Maybe the term is written as L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Maybe it's a Yukawa coupling involving two fermions and a scalar X.

Wait, perhaps it's a four-fermion interaction? Maybe it's a typo, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a trilinear term, but that's less common.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is a Yukawa coupling term where the boson X is interacting with a fermion and its antifermion. So, the term would be something like X ψ ψ, which would allow X to decay into ψ and anti-ψ.

In that case, the interaction allows X to decay into any fermion-antifermion pair ψ and ψ-bar, provided the mass condition is met.

So, if the coupling is present for all fermions, then all allowed fermion pairs with 2m_f <6 GeV are possible.

But wait, the given interaction term is written as involving f and psi_f. Wait, perhaps f is a different fermion. So, for example, maybe X couples to a pair of the same fermion, meaning that X can decay into any pair of fermions f and f-bar, provided the mass allows.

So, the interaction allows any fermion pair, as long as the coupling is present. But the given Lagrangian term would only include specific fermions, right? Because the term is written as -λ f bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the interaction term is written as -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). That doesn't look like a standard Yukawa coupling, which is usually something like X ψ ψ.

Alternatively, maybe the term is a typo, and it's supposed to be something else. But perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that X can decay into any fermion pair f and f-bar, provided that 2m_f <m_X.

So, the only constraint is the mass. So X can decay into any fermion pair where 2m_f <6 GeV.

So, the allowed fermions are:

e: 2m_e=0.001 GeV <6 → allowed.

mu: 0.211 GeV <6 → allowed.

tau: 3.554 GeV <6 → allowed.

u: 0.006 GeV → allowed.

d: 0.008 GeV → allowed.

s: 0.2 GeV → allowed.

c: 2.54 GeV → allowed.

b: 9 GeV → not allowed.

t: 346 GeV → way too big.

So X can decay into any of these pairs except b and t.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A includes b, which isn't allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all allowed except b, which is correct. So B is a candidate.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, and also t and b. But t is way too heavy (346 GeV), but wait, no, because 2m_t is 346 GeV, which is way over 6 GeV. So including t is wrong. So option C is incorrect.

Option D includes b, so it's incorrect.

So the correct answer would be option B.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed fermion pairs except b and t. So, the answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term provided suggests that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, but the kinematics depend only on the mass of \( X \) and the rest masses of the fermions. For a decay \( X \rightarrow f\bar{f} \) to be allowed, the total rest mass of the fermion pair, \( 2m_f \), must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

The rest masses of the fermions are approximately:

- Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.1057 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.2114 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_u \approx 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_d \approx 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 0.10 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_s \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_c \approx 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermion pairs that satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( e\bar{e} \), \( \mu\bar{\mu} \), \( \tau\bar{\tau} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), and \( s\bar{s} \), \( c\bar{c} \). The bottom quark (\( b \)) and top quark (\( t \)) pairs are excluded because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), and \( e^+\,e^- \), all of which are allowed. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed fermion pairs for the decay of \( X \).

Answer: B
