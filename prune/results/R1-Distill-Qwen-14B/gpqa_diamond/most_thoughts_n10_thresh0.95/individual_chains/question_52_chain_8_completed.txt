Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. It's about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, I remember that when stars have spots, it can change their overall brightness and temperature. 

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The ratio decreases when there are spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Wait, the transition between these levels is at 1448 Å. Oh, that's in the near-ultraviolet range. Titanium lines can be important for stellar classification. So, the problem is about the Boltzmann equation, right? Because under LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels depends on temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So without spots, Teff is higher (6000 K), and with spots, it's lower (5500 K). The ratio is n1/n2? Or is it n2/n1? The question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So let's think: when temperature decreases, what happens to the ratio of the number of atoms in higher energy to lower energy? Because for each level, higher energy levels have fewer atoms.

Wait, the ratio is the number of atoms in level 1 divided by level 2. Or the other way around? Let me read the question again. "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". It doesn't specify which is numerator and which is denominator. Hmm, but the problem says that when there are spots, the ratio decreases. So let's suppose that when the temperature is lower (with spots), the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Or wait, maybe n2/n1 is higher when T is lower.

Wait, let's get this straight. The ratio they're talking about is level 1 to level 2. If the ratio decreases when there are spots, that means the ratio (n1/n2) is smaller when the star has spots. So, without spots (T=6000 K), the ratio is higher than when spots are present (T=5500 K). 

But given the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So, if T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller (since T is in denominator, so lower T makes the exponent more negative), meaning n2/n1 decreases. Wait, no. Let's think: the exponent is -(E2-E1)/(kT). Suppose E2 > E1, which it usually is since higher energy level. So ΔE is positive. So when T decreases, ΔE/(kT) increases (since T is smaller, denominator gets smaller, so ratio goes up). So the exponent is more negative, so exp(-ΔE/(kT)) becomes smaller as T decreases. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) multiplied by a smaller number as T decreases. If the ratio (n2/n1) decreases, that would mean that when T decreases, the ratio goes down. So if with spots, the ratio is lower, that would mean n2/n1 is lower. 

Wait, but the problem says the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let me think about how the ratio n1/n2 would change. If the star is cooler (with spots), the atoms are less likely to be in higher energy levels. So n2 would decrease more than n1, making n2/n1 smaller. So if the observed ratio is n1/n2, then when T decreases, n2 decreases more, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present. So perhaps the ratio being discussed is n2/n1. Because when T is lower, n2/n1 is lower, so the ratio would decrease. So that aligns with the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when there are spots, Teff is 5500 K. So the ratio (n2/n1) is lower in spots. So when you compute the ratio without spots (T=6000 K) divided by the ratio with spots (T=5500 K), you get a factor.

So, the factor is (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K.

Since n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - ΔE/(k T) ), but I don't know the statistical weights. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give them, so perhaps they are the same for both levels, or perhaps the ratio of g's is 1. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming g1 and g2 are equal, so they cancel out.

Wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about the statistical weights, so maybe they are the same. Or perhaps it's a typo, and the transition is given, but that's about the wavelength. Alternatively, perhaps the transition is a specific line, and the corresponding energy difference can be calculated from the wavelength.

Wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. That wavelength is the photon's wavelength when the electron transitions between the two levels. So the energy difference between the levels can be found using the relation E = hc/λ.

So, let's compute ΔE. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) = let's compute that.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 divided by 1.448e-7 is approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But to make this useful, perhaps we can express ΔE in terms of k*T. Because in the Boltzmann equation, it's ΔE/(k T), which is a dimensionless quantity.

So let's compute ΔE/(k T) for each temperature.

Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So for T =6000 K, ΔE/(k T) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23 * 6000 )

Compute denominator: 1.38e-23 *6000 = 8.28e-20.

So numerator is 1.373e-18. So 1.373e-18 / 8.28e-20 = approx (1.373 / 8.28 ) * (1e-18 / 1e-20 ) which is (0.1657) * (100) = 16.57.

Wait, 1.373e-18 is 1.373 *1e-18. Denominator is 8.28e-20, which is 8.28 *1e-20.

So (1.373e-18)/(8.28e-20) = (1.373/8.28) * (1e-18 / 1e-20) = (0.1657) * 100 ≈16.57.

Similarly, for T=5500 K: denominator is 1.38e-23 *5500 = 7.59e-20.

So ΔE/(k T) = 1.373e-18 /7.59e-20 = (1.373 /7.59 ) * (1e-18/1e-20 ) → (0.1809) * 100 = approx 18.09.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, let me recheck the calculations. Because when T increases, the denominator (k T) becomes larger, so the ratio ΔE/(k T) would decrease. But for T=6000 K, ΔE/(k T) is about 16.57, and for T=5500 K, it's 18.09. Wait, that can't be right. Because if T is lower, the denominator is smaller, so the ratio increases.

Wait, I think I may have inverted something. Let me recompute.

Wait, E = hc/λ. Let me compute that again.

h =6.626e-34 J·s
c=3e8 m/s
λ=1448e-10 m

E = (6.626e-34 *3e8 ) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) ) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

So E is 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Now, for T =6000 K,

ΔE/(k T) = (1.373e-18) / ( (1.38e-23) * 6000 )

Compute denominator: 1.38e-23 * 6e3 = 1.38 *6 = 8.28 → 8.28e-20.

So 1.373e-18 /8.28e-20 = (1.373 /8.28 ) * (1e-18 /1e-20 )= 0.1657 * 100 = 16.57.

For T=5500 K,

Denominator: 1.38e-23 *5.5e3 = 1.38 *5.5 = 7.59 → 7.59e-20.

1.373e-18 /7.59e-20 = (1.373 /7.59 ) * (1e-18 /1e-20 )= 0.1809 * 100 =18.09.

Wait, so when T is higher (6000 K), the ratio ΔE/(k T) is smaller (16.57) than when T is lower (18.09). So the exponent in the Boltzmann equation becomes more negative as T decreases.

Now, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for higher T (6000 K), the exponent is -16.57, and for lower T (5500 K), it's -18.09.

Wait, but wait, the ratio n2/n1 depends on exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So let's compute these exponents.

For T=6000 K: exponent is -16.57 → exp(-16.57) ≈ ?

Similarly, for T=5500 K: exponent is -18.09 → exp(-18.09) ≈ ?

Wait, let me think about the values. exp(-16) is about 8.1e-7. Because ln(8.1e-7)≈ -16.

Similarly, exp(-18) is about 1.5e-8. Because ln(1.5e-8 )= ln(1.5) + ln(1e-8 )= ~0.4 - 18.42 ≈ -18.02.

So, exp(-16.57) is about 8e-7? Let me compute more accurately.

But perhaps I can compute the ratio of the two exponents. 

So, the factor we're looking to compute is (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K = [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*5500)) ].

The g2/g1 terms cancel out, so it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ] )

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000 ≈1.6667e-4. The difference is about 0.151e-4 → 1.51e-5.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) = (1.373 /1.38 )e5 K ≈ 0.995e5 ≈ 99500 K.

So ΔE/(k) = approximately 99500 K.

Multiply by 1.51e-5:

99500 * 1.51e-5 ≈ (99500) * 0.0000151 → let's see:

Calculate 99500 * 0.0000151:

99500 is approx 1e5. 1e5 * 0.0000151 = 1.51.

But more accurately:

99500 * 0.0000151 = 99500 * 1.51e-5 = (99500 / 1e5 ) * 1.51 = (0.995) *1.51 ≈1.50245.

So the exponent is 1.50245.

So the factor is exp(1.50245) ≈ e^1.50245. 

What's e^1.5? e^1 is 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.648. So e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

Wait, 1.50245 is a bit more than 1.5. Let's compute e^1.50245.

Compute e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

The additional 0.00245 is e^0.00245 ≈ 1.00245.

So e^1.50245 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.00245 ≈ ~4.494.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me consider that 1.50245 = 1.5 + 0.00245.

We can use the Taylor series for e^x around x=1.5.

e^(a + b) = e^a * e^b.

So e^0.00245 ≈ 1 + 0.00245 + (0.00245)^2/2 + ... ≈ approx 1.00245 + (0.00000306)/2 → 1.00245 + 0.00000153 →≈ 1.0024515.

So e^1.50245 ≈ e^1.5 * 1.0024515 → 4.4817 * 1.0024515 ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.0024515) → 4.4817 + 0.01099 → approx 4.4927.

So the factor is approximately 4.49, which is about 4.5.

So the ratio (n2/n1)_6000K divided by (n2/n1)_5500K is about e^(1.5)≈4.48, so around 4.5. 

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5. 

Wait, but wait, the question is about the ratio when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 ≈4.5. 

But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would mean (n2/n1)_5500 is less than (n2/n1)_6000. So the factor is (6000)/(5500) ratio, which we found to be ~4.5. 

So the correct answer should be C) ~4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE):

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Effective Temperatures**: 
   - Without spots: \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\),
   - With spots: \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\).

2. **Energy Difference**:
   The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), we calculate:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Boltzmann Factor**:
   The ratio of populations depends on the exponential term \(\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)\). For two temperatures \(T_1\) and \(T_2\), the factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]

4. **Calculation**:
   - Boltzmann constant: \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\),
   - \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\),
   - \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.51 \times 10^{-5}\),
   - \(\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}\).

   Substituting into the factor:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(99500 \times 1.51 \times 10^{-5}\right) = \exp(1.50245).
   \]

   Using \(e^{1.5} \approx 4.4817\) and \(e^{1.50245} \approx 4.4927\), the factor is approximately \(4.5\).

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which this ratio changes (when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots) is approximately **4.5**.
