Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction mechanisms can get tricky. Let's try to take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Hinsberg reaction, which is for testing amines. Wait, but wait, the Hinsberg reaction usually involves reacting a compound with benzene sulfonyl chloride and then with something else, like NaOH or acid. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Red phosphorus with HI is another reaction. Oh right! That's for the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe for elimination reactions. Wait, no, wait. Oh! Red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of alkyne oxides? Or wait, another thought: maybe it's used in the dehydrohalogenation or something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reagents. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent sometimes, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, I think when you have a ketone reacting with HCl and red phosphorus, it can form an alcohol. Or maybe it's about the elimination of HX. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's about the cleavage of a nitrile. Oh, right! Red phosphorus and HI can be used to hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: nitriles (R–C≡N) when treated with HI and red phosphorus typically get converted into carboxylic acids. So maybe that's what's happening here. So if Compound X is a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid.

But let's not jump the gun. I should first figure out what Compound X is.

Looking at the IR data: 3400–2500 cm^-1. That's a broad peak, probably O-H stretch, which could be from a carboxylic acid, but wait, if X is reacting to form an acid, maybe X is a nitrile. Wait, but in the IR, a nitrile has a strong peak around 2200-2260 cm^-1. Hmm, but the given IR doesn't show that. Wait, maybe I misread the IR data.

Wait, the IR given is: 3400–2500 (broad, maybe O-H?), 1720 (probably a carbonyl, maybe ester or ketone?), 1610 and 1450, which could be aromatic C=C stretching.

Wait, but let's check the NMR data. 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong deshielded proton. Could be an aldehyde proton, but more likely a carboxylic acid proton because aldehydes are around 9-10, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, aldehydes are around 9-10, but a carboxylic acid proton is around 10-12. So 10.5 ppm is probably a -COOH proton. So if the compound has a carboxylic acid group, that makes sense.

But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If it's a hydrolysis of a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. So if X is a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. So looking at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be Ph-CH2-COOH.

Option C:4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Structure is Ph-(CH2)2-COOH, but sec-butyl is (CH2)2CH2 attached to the benzene as a substituent.

Wait, but if X is a nitrile, then the product would have a COOH group. So looking at IR, the 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl. But a nitrile converted to a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl in the COOH group. So that fits.

But wait, the IR also shows 1610 and 1450 cm^-1, which are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons, probably adjacent to substituents.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): another set of aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted.

So the aromatic ring is probably 1,4-disubstituted. Because the two doublets suggest two sets of protons, each integrating to 2H, which is typical for a para-substituted benzene, where each pair of protons is equivalent.

So the aromatic ring has substituents in the para positions. Let me think: if the substituents are at para positions, then the two doublets would be for the two ortho protons each, but wait, in para substitution, each ortho position would have two equivalent protons. Wait, no, that's more for substitution like in para-xylene. For example, if the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4, then each substituent (like a group) would have two ortho protons and one meta. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, with substituents at positions 1 and 4. So for example, substituents are at the top and bottom. Then, the two protons at the top would be a doublet, and the two at the bottom would be another doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the 1 and 4 positions, making it para to each other. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That fits with the NMR data.

So, the aromatic ring has two substituents. Let's look at the other NMR signals.

The NMR shows a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Let's think about these. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH3 group (ethyl). The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) could be a CH(CH3) group. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) and 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2CH2 group or perhaps a CH2 connected to something else.

Putting this together: perhaps there's a substituent on the benzene ring that's an ethyl group and a branch. Wait, but let me think in terms of the product after reaction.

Wait, no. The NMR is for Compound X, not the product. So the product is formed after X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So I need to figure out what X is, then see what it becomes after the reaction.

So for X:

We have a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. From the NMR, the substituent groups attached to the benzene are:

Wait, but looking at the NMR, let's see:

The aromatic substituents: let's think, the NMR shows 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So the proton environment is such that there are two sets of two equivalent protons each. That suggests the substituents are in the para positions. So for example, one substituent is at position 1, another at position 4.

So, the substituents could be groups that are de-shielding the adjacent protons. For example, if substituent R is in position 1, then the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear downfield. Similarly, substituent S in position 4 would cause the ortho protons (positions 3 and 5) to be deshielded as well.

Wait, but the question is, what are these substituents? Let me think about the other peaks.

The NMR has a proton at 10.5 ppm (probably -COOH), but wait, if X is a nitrile, then the COOH would be the product after reaction. So maybe X is a nitrile with a benzene ring.

Wait, but let's think again. If the product is a carboxylic acid, then X is a nitrile. So in X, the substituents would be a nitrile group and another group.

Hmm. Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (br, 1H), which is a broad peak. That could be a -COOH proton, but that's after reaction. Wait, no, because the question states the NMR and IR are for Compound X. So if X has a broad peak at 10.5, perhaps that's a -COOH group. But if X is a nitrile, it wouldn't have a COOH group. So maybe I'm wrong about the reaction.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is not the hydrolysis of a nitrile, but something else. Let's think again about the reagents. Red phosphorus and HI. Another reaction I remember is the Baeyer-Villiger reaction, but that involves ketones and forms lactones or ketones. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reagents are used for the elimination of HX, such as in dehydrohalogenation, but that's usually with strong bases like KOtBu. Alternatively, maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but that's for ketones to alkanes. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents are causing a substitution. Wait, another possibility: when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes hydrolysis to form an amine. Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up reactions. Wait, nitriles with HCl and red phosphorus typically form the corresponding amine via the Stephen reduction. Wait no, the Stephen reduction uses HCl and a catalyst, like a mercury salt, to reduce nitriles to amines. Alternatively, with HI and red P, maybe it's a different pathway.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possible structures of X. Let's try to piece together X's structure from NMR and IR.

IR shows 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, perhaps -OH stretch. But if X is a nitrile, it shouldn't have an -OH group. So maybe X is a ketone. Because if X is a ketone, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might be something else. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me try again. Let's think about the IR data. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. But since X is reacting to form a product, perhaps X has a carbonyl group that's being modified.

Wait, but the carbonyl could also be a nitrile, but nitriles have a peak around 2200-2250, which isn't present here. So 1720 is more likely a ketone or an ester or acid.

Wait, but let me look at the NMR. There's a peak at 10.5 ppm which is a singlet, broad, integrating for one proton. That's a very downfield proton, which could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10. Alternatively, it's a carboxylic acid proton, which is around 10-12. But if X is a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. So X would have a nitrile group, which doesn't have a proton. So perhaps that peak in X's NMR isn't a COOH proton, but something else.

Wait, perhaps it's an aldehyde. If X is an aldehyde, then the IR would show a peak around 2800 cm-1 (stretching for the aldehyde C-H) and a strong peak around 1720 cm-1 (the aldehyde C=O). But in that case, the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. The 10.5 could be a bit high for an aldehyde, but maybe. Alternatively, if the aldehyde is conjugated or in a different environment, it might be downfield shifted.

But wait, another thought: perhaps X is an ester. Esters have carbonyl peaks around 1720-1750 cm^-1. So that fits the IR. If X is an ester, then what reaction would happen with red phosphorus and HI? Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the reagents. Let me think about the reagents again. Red phosphorus and HI. Another possibility: when an ester is treated with HI, it can undergo hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. But wait, that usually requires more vigorous conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents are used for the elimination of HX. For example, if X is a benzyl chloride, treatment with HI and red phosphorus might not do much, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine. Wait, but that would require different conditions.

Wait, another approach: let's try to figure out what X is. Let's look at the NMR to build the structure.

NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): likely to be either an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid proton. But if X is a nitrile, then COOH is the product, so X can't have that. So maybe X is an ester.

Wait, an ester would have a carbonyl (so the IR 1720 cm^-1), and the ester group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's think about the NMR peaks:

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde proton around 9.5-10 ppm. If X is a substituted benzaldehyde, the peak could be at 10.5 if there's electron-withdrawing groups. But what about the other peaks?

Looking at the aromatic protons: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with a substituent that's electron-withdrawing. For example, a nitro group would de-shield the adjacent protons, making them appear upfield or downfield?

Wait, substituents can affect the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons. Electron-withdrawing groups like -NO2 would cause the ortho and para protons to be deshielded, appearing downfield. So if the substituent is in para, the adjacent protons would be downfield.

Alternatively, if the substituent is an electron-donating group like -OCH3, the adjacent protons would be upfield.

But in this case, the substituents are causing the protons to be at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. Let's think about substituents that would cause that.

Another possibility is that the substituent is a carbonyl group. For example, a ketone attached to the benzene ring. So, maybe X has a substituent like -COR.

Wait, but the NMR also has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is probably a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps X has an ethyl group attached to something, maybe a carbonyl.

Putting this together: perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with an ethyl group attached via a carbonyl.

Wait, like a propanal attached to benzene. But let's think in terms of structure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propargyl group attached to benzene, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another approach: looking at the downfield protons. The 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde, but I'm not certain. Let's think about the other peaks.

The NMR shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

These are all in the range of aliphatic protons. The 0.9 triplet suggests a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 doublet (3H) could be a CH(CH2) group. Let's think of an isobutyl group.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a singlet? No, it's a doublet. So that's a CH2 group attached to another CH2 or something.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that's a chain: the chain has a CH(CH2CH3) group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group connected to two other CH2 groups. Let me think: maybe the group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, but perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H, which would correspond to a CH(CH3) group. So let's say the structure is benzene with a substituent that's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, another possibility is a propyl group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH2CH3. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to a branching point. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached via a carbonyl.

Wait, let me try to draw this mentally. The benzene ring has a substituent that's a chain: maybe a CH2-CH2-CH2- group, but there's a branching as well.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH(CH3), but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a secondary butyl group. Because the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group, and the 0.9 is CH2CH3.

So the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm.

But let me think about the coupling. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH connected to two CH2 groups. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with a substituent like -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would be a butyl group. But the NMR doesn't show enough peaks for that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the splitting and integration.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): maybe a CH that's connected to two different groups, like CH2 and another CH2.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two protons, perhaps from a CH2 group adjacent to the CH.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH group, which is attached to another group.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH2CH3 group attached via a CH2.

So putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group? Not quite. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the structure would be benzene with a substituent like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COR or something like that.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options given, maybe that can help.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: structure would be Ph-CH2-COOH, where Ph is 4-ethylphenyl.

B)1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: that's cumene, but wait, that's actually isopropyl attached to benzene. Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2)CH3, attached to the benzene.

C)4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

D)1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: benzene with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4.

Wait, but the product after reaction is the question. So the reaction is X + red phosphorus and HI → product.

So if I can figure out what X is, I can see what the product would be.

Let me think about the reaction again. If X is a nitrile, then the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI would be a carboxylic acid. So the options would be A or C.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Structure is Ph-sec-butyl-COOH. So for X, the nitrile would be Ph-sec-butyl-CN. Then, after hydrolysis, it becomes Ph-sec-butyl-COOH.

But let's see if that fits with the NMR of X.

Wait, X's NMR would have the aromatic protons, a nitrile (which doesn't have protons), and the substituents. But in X's NMR, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which would be the product's COOH. So perhaps X is a nitrile, but then X's NMR shouldn't have that proton. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester. If X is an ester, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus could hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. But esters typically require more acidic conditions for hydrolysis.

Wait, but the IR of X shows 1720 cm^-1, which is consistent with an ester or a ketone.

Another possibility: X is a ketone. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a reduction. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reaction differently. Red phosphorus and HI is sometimes used to remove hydrogen halides. For example, in the formation of alkenes by dehydrohalogenation. But that requires a vicinal dihalide. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of elimination. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the options and see which one could be the product of X reacting with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would come from hydrolysis of a nitrile. So X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile.

What would the NMR of X look like? Well, the aromatic protons would be similar, but the nitrile group doesn't have protons. But in X, there would be no COOH group, so the 10.5 ppm peak would not be present. So that conflicts with the NMR data given for X. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile with a substituent that's a benzyl group. Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about each option and see what X would be before the reaction.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So X would be 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanenitrile.

The NMR of X would have a nitrile group (no protons), and the substituent would be a 4-ethylphenyl group attached to a CH2-CN.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have a 10.5 ppm peak. X would have a CH2-CN group, so perhaps in X, the substituent would have a CH2 group adjacent to the nitrile. But that wouldn't account for the 10.5 ppm peak. So perhaps this is not the right approach.

Alternatively, let's think about the reaction. If the reagents are red phosphorus and HI, and X is a nitrile, then the product is a carboxylic acid. So the options are A and C.

Looking at the NMR of X, which includes a broad peak at 10.5 ppm. If X were a nitrile, that peak wouldn't be present. So perhaps X isn't a nitrile. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a ketone, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a reduction. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative, and the reaction reduces the ketone to an alcohol. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an aldehyde. Let's think: X has a benzaldehyde group and another substituent. The IR would have a peak around 2800 cm^-1 for the aldehyde C-H, but in the given IR, the 3400-2500 cm^-1 is a broad peak, which could be O-H or N-H. Wait, but aldehydes don't have O-H. So perhaps it's an alcohol.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about the NMR.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, broad, 1H. If X is a carboxylic acid, that would make sense. But if X is reacting to form a product, which is also a carboxylic acid, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps X is not a nitrile. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not hydrolysis, but another type. Let's think: red phosphorus and HI could be used for the reduction of esters to alcohols. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's the reduction of a carbonyl group to a CH2 group. Wait, but I don't recall that.

Alternatively, perhaps the
