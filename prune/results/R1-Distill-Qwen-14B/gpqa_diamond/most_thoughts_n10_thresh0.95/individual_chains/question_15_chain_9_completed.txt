Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the orbital distance. But wait, the main formula for transit probability is something like P = (R_p / a) * (1 / (something with the star's radius)), no, maybe I should think more carefully.

Oh right, the transit probability for a planet is given by the formula P = (R_p / a) * (something else), but wait, actually, the exact formula from what I recall is P = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), where e is the orbital eccentricity. But in this case, both planets have circular orbits, so e is zero, so the denominator is 1. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, no, the transit probability P is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital plane's area that is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. The probability is given by (R* / a), where R* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Oh wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again.

Ah, right! The transit probability formula is P = (R_p / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but wait, no, more accurately, the probability is approximately (R_* / a), where R_* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or wait, another way: the probability is P = (R_p + R_* ) / a, but I'm not sure. I might be mixing up the exact formula.

Wait, I think I should look up the correct transit probability formula. But since I can't, I'll try to derive it. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the area where the planet's orbit is edge-on compared to the total possible orientations. 

The planet's orbit has a certain inclination. The transit happens only when the inclination is exactly 90 degrees (edge-on). However, due to the finite size of the star, the actual probability isn't zero but depends on the planet's orbital distance. 

The transit probability is given by P = (R_* / a) * (1 / (b)), where b is the impact parameter. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, I think the probability is proportional to (R_* / a), because the planet's orbital plane must be within a certain cone relative to our line of sight, and the size of that cone depends on how close the planet is (a) and the star's radius (R_*). 

So, the formula for transit probability is P = (R_* / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))), but since both planets have circular orbits, e=0, so P = R_* / a.

Wait, but if R_* is the same for both stars, because the problem says both stars have the same radii. Oh, right, the stars have same radii. So, the probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (a) of the planet's orbit.

So, P ∝ 1/a. Because R_* is same for both, so P is inversely proportional to a.

So, if a is smaller, the probability is higher. So which planet has a smaller a?

Because the orbital period is given. We can use Kepler's third law. The law states that (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_* + M_p))/(4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So, a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_*. So, a ∝ (P^2 * M_*)^(1/3).

Wait, but for each planet, the semi-major axis a depends on the mass of the host star and the orbital period.

So, for Planet_1: a_1 is such that (a_1)^3 = [ (G * (M_1 + M_p1) ) / (4π²) ] * P_1^2. Similarly for Planet_2: a_2^3 = [ G (M_2 + M_p2) / (4π^2) ] * P_2^2.

But both planets have the same mass, M_p1 = M_p2. So, M_1 is twice M_2 (since M_1 = 2 * M_2). The period P_1 is three times shorter than P_2. So, P_1 = P_2 /3.

So, let's compute a_1 and a_2.

Let me write the ratio a_1 / a_2.

a_1^3 / a_2^3 = [ (M_1 * P_1^2 ) / (M_2 * P_2^2) ) ].

Because M_p is same, and much smaller than M_*, we can ignore it.

So, a_1^3 / a_2^3 = (M_1 / M_2) * (P_1^2 / P_2^2).

Given that M_1 = 2 M_2 and P_1 = (1/3) P_2.

So, a_1^3 / a_2^3 = (2 / 1) * ( ( (P_2 /3 )^2 ) / P_2^2 ) )

Wait, let me compute this:

( (P_1)^2 ) / (P_2)^2 ) = ( (P_2/3)^2 ) / (P_2^2) ) = ( P_2^2 / 9 ) / P_2^2 ) = 1/9.

So, (M_1 / M_2) = 2.

So, a_1^3 / a_2^3 = 2 * (1/9) ) = 2/9.

So, a_1^3 = (2/9) a_2^3.

Taking cube roots,

a_1 = a_2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

What is (2/9)^(1/3) approximately? Let's compute. 2/9 is about 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606.

So, a_1 ≈ 0.606 * a_2.

So, a_1 is about 0.606 times a_2, which is smaller than a_2.

Thus, since a_1 is smaller than a_2, the transit probability P is higher for Planet_1 because P is inversely proportional to a.

Wait, but wait. Because the transit probability is P = (R_* / a). But in this problem, both stars have the same radius R_*, since they are same radius.

So, P_1 = R_* / a_1.

P_2 = R_* / a_2.

So, P_1 / P_2 = (R_* / a_1) / (R_* / a_2) ) = a_2 / a_1.

But a_1 = 0.606 a_2 → a_2 = a_1 /0.606 ≈ 1.65 a_1.

Wait, no, let's calculate P_1 / P_2.

P_1 / P_2 = (a_2) / (a_1) ) because P_1 = R*/a1, P2 = R*/a2.

So, since a_1 is 0.606 a_2, then a_2 = a_1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a_1.

Wait, let me think again. Let me compute the ratio P_1 / P_2.

P_1 = R_* / a_1.

P_2 = R_* / a_2.

So, P_1 / P_2 = (R_*/a_1) / (R_*/a_2) ) = a_2 / a_1.

We found that a_1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a_2 ≈ 0.606 a_2.

So, a_2/a_1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So, P_1 is 1.65 times higher than P_2.

Wait, because P_1 / P_2 = 1.65 → P_1 = 1.65 * P_2.

So, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability than Planet_2.

So, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times, but that's much higher. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

We have a_1^3 = (2/9) a_2^3 → a_1 = a_2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3).

Cube of 0.6 is 0.216.

Cube of 0.606 is approximately (0.606)^3. Let's compute: 

0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36; 0.36 * 0.6 = 0.216.

0.606^3 = (0.6 + 0.006)^3.

But for approximation, 0.6^3 is 0.216, and 0.606 is a bit higher, but not by much. Let me compute (0.606)^3:

0.606 * 0.606 = approx 0.367.

0.367 * 0.606 ≈ 0.367 *0.6 = 0.2202, plus 0.367 *0.006 = 0.0022. So total ~0.2224.

Which is close to 2/9 (0.2222). So, yes, a_1 is 0.606 a_2.

So, a_2/a_1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So, P_1 is 1.65 times P_2.

So, Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Therefore, the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options, the correct choice is option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_*}{a}
\]

where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability of transit is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

### Step 1: Relating Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_* \) by:

\[
a^3 \propto P^2 M_*
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2, we know:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
- \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \).

### Step 2: Comparing Transit Probabilities
Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the ratio of the probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The transit probability of Planet_2 is not 1.5 times higher.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and its transit probability is approximately 1.65 times higher.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The transit probability of Planet_1 is not 2.7 times higher.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its smaller orbital distance, making it the better choice for observation.
