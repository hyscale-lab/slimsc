Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best.

First, the question says the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols, phenols, or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but the peak is very broad. Hmm, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch because they're more acidic and can form strong hydrogen bonds. Another possibility is a carbonyl group, but I think that's higher, like around 1700 or so. Oh wait, the question mentions 1700 and 1650. Those are in the carbonyl region. So 1700 is probably a ketone or maybe an ester, and 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or maybe an amide. But I don't see any mention of amines, so maybe just another carbonyl group.

So the IR has peaks at 3000 (broad, maybe O-H), 1700 (maybe ester or ketone), and 1650 (another carbonyl group, perhaps conjugated). Wait, but if there are two carbonyl peaks, that's a bit unusual. Maybe one is a carbonyl and another is an aromatic ring with conjugation? No, aromatic C=C is around 1450-1600. Wait, 1650 is more like a conjugated carbonyl. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else.

Wait, another thought: A carbonyl group and an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. But the 1650 peak is a little high for a simple aromatic ring. Maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, like a conjugated system. Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl, such as an ester.

Then, looking at the NMR. It says there are several peaks, including ones for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has an alkene group somewhere. So that suggests either an isolated double bond, maybe part of a ring, or part of a conjugated system.

Then, the Mass Spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Let me think about common fragments. For example, a methyl group (15) plus some other fragment? Or maybe a carbonyl group. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COO- (which is a fragment in esters). But wait, the molecular ion would break into a smaller fragment. Alternatively, the CH3COO group could split off, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the compound has an ethyl group, but that's 29. Another possibility: 45 is the mass of a (CH3)2CO+ ion, which is acetone. Or maybe a ketene? Not sure. Alternatively, 45 could be the mass of a fragment like C3H7O or something similar.

Wait, let's think about the possible formulas:

Options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So all are C6 with varying H and O.

The IR has a broad peak around 3000 cm-1, which suggests an O-H group. If it's a broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have O-H that's broad and strong. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl like an ester or an acid. 

Wait, but looking at the options:

If the compound has two oxygen atoms, like in options A and C, that could explain possible carbonyl groups. For example, if it's a diester, or a ketone and an ester, or a carboxylic acid and a ketone, but that might be less likely.

Alternatively, the O-H could be from an alcohol, but the peak would be less broad and maybe a bit lower in wavenumber but I'm not certain. But the IR says a very broad absorption, so probably a strong O-H like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have strong absorption around 1700 cm-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So IR shows peaks at 1700 and 1650. So maybe the 1700 is the C=O of the acid, and 1650 is another group. But wait, another carbonyl? That would require two oxygen-containing groups. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), that might not show a broad O-H. Hmm, but if it's a lactone, the O-H would be from the ring-opening, but maybe not as broad.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. So then the 1700 could be a ketone, and 1650 the conjugated double bond. But then where's the O-H? Oh, wait, the initial peak at 3000 is O-H.

So putting it together, perhaps the compound has a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an O-H group, and maybe another group. But wait, looking at the options, some have two oxygen atoms. For example, option C is C6H10O2 and option A is C6H12O2.

So, let's consider that. Let's think about possible structures. For example, if it's a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have an ester group (O-CO-O) but that would require a five or six-membered ring. Alternatively, perhaps a compound like methyl cyclohexene carboxylate? Or maybe a di-ester? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with a ketone group and an alcohol group. But that might complicate things.

Wait, another angle: the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests the presence of a double bond. So, the compound has a double bond, perhaps in an aromatic ring or an isolated double bond.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0 and N=0, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So degree of unsaturation is 1. That could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so probably a double bond. But with a degree of unsaturation of 1, it's either one double bond or one ring.

Option B: C6H10O. Degree of unsaturation: (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2= 2. So that's either two double bonds, one double bond and a ring, or two rings. Since the NMR shows vinyl H, perhaps a double bond, and maybe a ring.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation: (14-10)/2=2. So same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. Degree of unsaturation: (14-12)/2=1, same as A.

So, from the NMR, the presence of vinyl hydrogens implies a double bond. So all options except perhaps A and D have two degrees of unsaturation, which could include a double bond and a ring or two double bonds.

Wait, but if the compound has a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone and a double bond, that would fit the IR peaks. So perhaps the structure has both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene (C=C).

So, looking back at the IR: 1700 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, and the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or a conjugated double bond.

Wait, maybe the compound is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone (conjugated double bond and ketone). That would explain the 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Also, the broad peak at 3000 could be an O-H from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if it's a ketone and an alcohol, that would be two oxygen-containing groups.

Wait, but for a ketone and an alcohol, the formula would have two oxygen atoms. So looking at the options, A and C have O2.

If the compound is something like a cyclohexene with a ketone and an alcohol group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with an alcohol group? Wait, no, cyclic esters are lactones, which don't have separate O-H groups. Unless it's a hemiacetal or something else, which seems less likely.

Wait, maybe the compound is a substituted cyclohexenone with a hydroxyl group. So structure like cyclohexenone with an OH group. In that case, the IR would show the C=O at around 1700, the conjugated C=C might show a peak at 1650, and the O-H would be the broad peak at 3000.

But then, considering the formula, cyclohexenone would be C6H8O. Wait, but our options have either 10H or 12H. Wait, so maybe the structure is not a cyclohexenone but something else.

Wait, another possibility: the compound could be a di-ester, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted compound with a ketone and another group. But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Let's think about the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z 45 is significant. What could that be? Let me think about common fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (acetone, 45 g/mol). So maybe the compound breaks into a fragment that includes a (CH3)2CO group.

Alternatively, 45 could correspond to CH3COO- (methyl acetate is 88, so that's not it). Wait, no. Wait, the fragment is 45, which is the molecular ion of acetone. So perhaps the parent compound has a ketone group, which upon fragmentation, loses some parts and the acetone fragment remains.

Alternatively, the fragment might be a CH3CO+ group, which is 45. So that suggests the presence of an acetone-like structure in the molecule.

If the parent compound includes an acetone fragment, then the formula would have to have that.

Wait, but let's look at the options. Let's take each option and see if it can produce a fragment of 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: 6*12 +12 + 2*16 = 72 +12 +32 = 116. The molecular ion would be at 116. If a fragment breaks off, like 116 - 45 = 71, but I'm not sure what fragment would be 71. Alternatively, maybe the 45 is part of the molecule.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total 72+10+32=114.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. For example, something like methyl cyclohexanoate. But then the H's might not add up. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted compound with an ester group and a hydroxyl, but that seems complicated.

Option B: C6H10O. Maybe cyclohexene with an alcohol group. So cyclohexene has a double bond (so H would be 10 if it's a substituted cyclohexene). So, for example, cyclohexenol. That would fit the formula C6H10O.

But wait, cyclohexenol would have an O-H group (so the broad IR peak), a double bond (so the vinyl H in NMR). The IR would show a carbonyl at 1700? No, because cyclohexenol doesn't have a carbonyl. Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1700. So that can't be it. So the structure must have a carbonyl group.

Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Oh wait, the IR shows a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So the compound must have a carbonyl group, which would require O. So the options with O are A, B, C, D.

Wait, actually, all options except B have O. Option B is C6H10O, which has one O. So, if the compound has a carbonyl group, that O is part of the formula. So any of the options with O could have a carbonyl.

Wait, so the O in the compound could be part of a carbonyl group or an alcohol or another functional group.

Wait, the FTIR shows a peak at 1700, which is a strong carbonyl. So the compound must have a carbonyl group. So the O in the formula is likely part of that.

So the options are A, C, D have at least one O. But wait, the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group. So the compound has both a carbonyl (C=O) and an O-H group. Therefore, the formula must have at least two O's. Because the O in the carbonyl is one O, and the O in the O-H is another. So, the formula must have O2.

Looking at the options, only A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2) have two O's. So now I can eliminate options B and D, which have one O.

So now the options are A and C.

So the formula is either C6H12O2 or C6H10O2.

Now, let's think about the H count. The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. The molecular formula's degree of unsaturation will help.

For option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That can be a ring or a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation: (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

But the NMR shows vinyl H, so there's a double bond. So for option A, with one degree of unsaturation: either a ring or a double bond. If it's a double bond, then that's the vinyl H. So that's possible. If it's a ring, perhaps it's a cyclo structure without a double bond, but that would conflict with the NMR data. So for option A, the degree of unsaturation is 1, so if it's a double bond, that's accounted for, but then any ring would require more H's, which may not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring without a double bond, but then the vinyl H wouldn't be present. So maybe option A doesn't fit, unless the structure includes both a ring and a double bond, which would make the degree of unsaturation 2.

Wait, but no. Because the degree of unsaturation for option A is 1. So it can't have two rings or a ring and a double bond, because that would be two degrees. So for option A, the structure must have either a single double bond or a single ring.

But the NMR shows vinyl H, which implies a double bond. So for option A to have a double bond, that's one degree, but then the O's are in the carbonyl and the O-H. So that could fit.

But let's think about the possible structure for option A. For example, perhaps it's methyl cyclohexanoate. But cyclohexanoate would have an ester group (O-CO-O), which would account for the two O's. Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1700, which is typical for an ester (they have strong C=O around 1700-1750). The 1650 peak could be from something else, perhaps an aromatic ring, but in esters, the carbonyl is at higher wavenumbers. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated ester.

Wait, but if the structure is something like methyl vinyl ketone, but that would have a different formula. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, a lactone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclohexenone with an ester group. But that might complicate the formula.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diester with a double bond. Hmm.

But let's think about option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation is 2. So that could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. Since the NMR shows vinyl H, there's a double bond. So perhaps a ring (like cyclohexene) plus another double bond (like a carbonyl), which would make two degrees.

So the structure could be something like cyclohexenone with an ester group. For example, an ester substituent on a cyclohexenone.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted maleic anhydride derivative, but that might not fit the formula.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a conjugated carbonyl might result in the 1650 peak. So if the structure has a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl, that would explain both peaks in IR. So for option C, which has two degrees, it's possible.

Also, the mass spectrum fragment at 45 could come from a (CH3)2CO group, which is 45. So if the parent molecule includes an acetone fragment, how would that fit?

Wait, but the molecular weight of option C is 114. If the parent ion is 114, then losing 45 would leave 69. Hmm, but I'm not sure what fragment would be 69.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the (CH3)2CO+ ion, which is 45. So if the parent compound has an (CH3)2CO group attached to something else, then upon fragmentation, that group breaks off, leaving a smaller ion.

For example, if the structure is something like CH2=C(CH2CO)CH2... etc. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetone derivative attached to a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the parent compound is an ester with an acetone group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a cleavage involving the ester group. For example, in an ester, the cleavage between the carbonyl and the oxygen could lead to a fragment. For example, in methyl propionate, the cleavage could produce a fragment with the propionyl group and another with the methyl. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps the fragment at 45 is from CH3COO-, which is 60 (CH3COO- has a molecular weight of 60: 12+1*3 +12 +16*2). Wait, 12(C) + 3 H3 + 12 C + 32 O2. Wait, no, wait: CH3COO^- is C2H3O2^-, which is 2*12 +3 + 16*2 =24 +3 +32= 59. Hmm, but the fragment is at 45, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, the fragment is C3H7O, which is 3*12 +7 +16= 36+7+16=59. Still doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a different fragment. Let's think about the possible structures again.

Another approach: Let's think about the molecular formula and see which has an even number of H's that would fit the NMR.

But perhaps that's not the best approach here.

Wait, let me think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight 116. If the structure is something like methyl cyclohexanoate (C6H10O2?), but wait, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted ester.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 114. Perhaps a structure like ethyl vinyl carbonate? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the presence of two oxygen atoms and a double bond. So, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But lactones have the ester group, which is O-CO-O. Wait, but that would require three oxygen atoms. No, because the formula only has two O's. So perhaps it's not a lactone.

Alternatively, it could be an ester with an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. So, for example, an ester where the carbonyl is conjugated to a double bond. So perhaps a structure like CH2=CHCOOR. But let's see the formula.

CH2=CHCOOCH3 (methyl acrylate) would have the formula C4H6O2. But our compound is C6H10O2 or C6H12O2. So perhaps a longer chain or a ring.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. If the compound is a substituted cyclopentenone with an ester group, but that might complicate the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a di-substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, an ester substituent on a cyclohexene.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Wait, since the fragment is 45, which is the mass of acetone, maybe the parent compound includes acetone. For example, if the compound is something like cyclopentyl acetone, but I'm not sure if that fits.

Another approach: Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation again.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So either one ring or one double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees: 2. So either two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So for option A to have a double bond, that uses up the one degree. But then, where's the other O? It's part of the O-H and the carbonyl. So perhaps a structure like cyclohexenone with an ester group. Wait, but that would require more O's. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclohexene with a ketone group and an ester group. But that would mean higher O count.

Alternatively, perhaps the O's are in an ester group. So for option C: C6H10O2.

Wait, if the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent, that could account for the O's.

For example, consider a structure like methyl cyclohex-2-enecarboxylate. That would have a double bond (cyclohexene), a carbonyl (ester), and an O from the ester. Wait, but that would have O2. Let's see the formula.

Methyl cyclohex-2-enoate would be C7H10O2. Our options are up to C6. Hmm. So perhaps it's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ortho ester, but I'm not familiar enough with that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted maleic anhydride, but that would have more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The formula would be C5H8O2, but again, we're dealing with C6H10O2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexene with a substituent that has an ester group. For example, cyclohexene with an ester substituent like OOCR.

Wait, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Perhaps the structure is a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. Let's think about the possible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diethyl maleate, but that's more than C6.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal, but that might not fit the IR data.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has a conjugated dienone system. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative, but then the formula would include a benzene ring, which would require more O's.

Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentanone with an ester group. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the mass spectrum. If the fragment is 45, which is (CH3)2CO, then the parent compound may have a (CH3)2CO group attached. So the molecular formula would have that.

So, for option C: C6H10O2.

If the parent compound is something like (CH3)2CO-R, where R is a group that brings the formula to C6H10O2, then what's R?

The (CH3)2CO is C3H6O. So the remaining part (R) would be C3H4O. Since the molecular formula is C6H10O2, subtracting C3H6O leaves C3H4O. Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the parent compound is something like CH2=C(CH2COO-)R.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, another approach: The presence of a fragment at m/z 45 suggests that the molecule can break into a 45 fragment. Let's imagine that the parent molecule is something like CH3COO-R, where R is a fragment that upon cleavage, the CH3COO group breaks off, giving a 45 fragment. But wait, CH3COO is 60 (molecular weight). Hmm.

Wait, no. Wait, the molecular weight of CH3COO- is 60. So if the parent ion is 114 (option C), and a fragment is 45, that doesn't fit because 114-45=69, which doesn't correspond to a known fragment. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is formed via a different pathway.

Wait, another possibility is McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in mass spectrometry for ketones. The McLafferty rearrangement involves the cleavage of a gamma hydrogen, leading to the formation of an allyl vinyl ether and the loss of a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, for example, in the McLafferty rearrangement, a molecule like hexa-1,5-dien-3-one would lose a fragment of 45 (like the (CH3)2CO group).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion, but I don't recall the exact masses for that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a retro-aldol cleavage. For example, if the molecule can break into a smaller ketone and another fragment.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me recap the data:

IR: broad peak at 3000 (O-H), 1700 (C=O), 1650 (maybe another C=O or conjugated double bond).

NMR: vinyl H, so a double bond is present.

Mass: fragment at 45.

So, putting it all together, the compound has an O-H group (broad peak), a carbonyl group (1700), a conjugated group (1650), a double bond (from vinyl H), and a fragment at 45.

So, the structure likely includes both a carbonyl (C=O) and a conjugated double bond, along with an O-H group.

So, the formula must be either A (C6H12O2) or C (C6H10O2), as earlier.

Looking at the options, option C has two O's and a higher degree of unsaturation, which would allow for a double bond and another double bond or ring.

But wait, if the structure has a conjugated carbonyl and double bond, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, that would account for the 1700 and 1650 peaks.

So, the structure could be something like CH2=C(CH2COOH)R, but that might not fit the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexenone with an ester group, but that would complicate the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-ester with a conjugated
