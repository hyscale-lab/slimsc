Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. 

The question is asking about the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that it's a mass m attached to a spring obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The maximum amplitude is A. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs at the equilibrium point, where all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The formula for the maximum speed v_max is sqrt(kA^2/m), right? But wait, that's in the non-relativistic case. Here, it's relativistic, so things are different. Oh right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant.

So in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv^2. Instead, the total energy includes a gamma factor. The total energy E is gamma * m c squared, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the oscillator is both potential and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So in the non-relativistic case, all this potential energy converts into kinetic at the equilibrium point. But relativistically, I think the energy would have contributions from both kinetic and potential, but how?

Wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², similar to the classical case. But the total energy would be the sum of kinetic and potential, but I'm not sure how that works here. Alternatively, perhaps the oscillator's total energy is quantized, but since the problem doesn't mention quantization, perhaps it's treating it as a classical system.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me start over. The system is a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. So, the potential is V(x) = (1/2)k x². The kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv², but (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy E is (gamma -1) mc² + (1/2)k x². At maximum amplitude x = A, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)k A². When the oscillator passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So E = (gamma -1) mc². So setting these equal:

(1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Because in the relativistic case, the total energy E would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So maybe E = gamma m c². But how does the potential energy tie into this?

Alternatively, perhaps the total mechanical energy of the oscillator is the sum of kinetic and potential, but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't as straightforward. Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the energy equation would be: the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy due to motion, plus the potential energy. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the setup is such that the maximum potential energy is (1/2)k A², and when the mass is at maximum speed (x=0), all that potential is converted into kinetic, which is relativistic.

So, when x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all the total energy is kinetic. So, E = (1/2)k A² = K. But wait, the kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma - 1) m c². So,

(1/2) k A² = (gamma -1) m c².

We can solve for gamma.

gamma = 1 + ( (1/2) k A² ) / ( m c² )

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. At x=A, the mass is at rest, so gamma is 1. So the total energy E = m c² + (1/2) k A². When the mass is at x=0, it's moving with maximum speed, so E = gamma m c². So,

gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A².

So, gamma = 1 + ( (k A²) )/( 2 m c² ).

Hmm, so then gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Wait, but that can't be right because if (k A²)/(2 m c²) is large, gamma would be much bigger than 1, but I think the expression for gamma in terms of speed is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, perhaps another approach.

So, the total energy E is (1/2)k A² plus the rest energy mc². So,

E = m c² + (1/2) k A².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic, so E = gamma m c². So,

gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by m c²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/( 2 m c² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2 ). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max/c)^2 ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root.

1/(1 - v_max²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )]^2.

Rearranging,

1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )]^2.

So,

v_max²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express this:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ]

Hmm, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me compute the denominator.

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as a variable, say, a. Then,

gamma = 1 + a.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + a.

Squaring both sides,

1/(1 - v^2/c^2) ) = (1 + a)^2.

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1+a)^2.

Then,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1+a)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ]

= c^2 [ ( (1+a)^2 -1 ) / (1+a)^2 ) ]

(1+a)^2 is 1 + 2a + a².

So numerator is 1 + 2a + a² -1 = 2a + a².

So,

v^2 = c^2 ( 2a + a² ) / (1 + a)^2.

But a is (k A²)/( 2 m c^2 ), which is a small quantity if the amplitude isn't too large. Wait, but in the options, some have expressions involving (1 - ... )^2 in the denominator. Let me see which option matches this.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2m))^2 ) )

But wait, the denominator in the expression I have is (1+a)^2, but a is (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so 1+a = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, but let's go back.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me recheck:

We had a = (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 ).

So,

gamma = 1 + a.

So,

v^2 = c^2 ( (1+a)^2 -1 ) / (1+a)^2 )

Wait, no, that doesn't look right. Wait, okay, let me go back to the step where I had:

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (1+a)^2 - 1 ) / (1+a)^2 ]

Which expands to:

( (1 + 2a + a²) - 1 ) / (1 + a)^2 ) = (2a + a² ) / (1 + a)^2.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this numerator as a (2 +a ), but not sure.

But looking at the options, perhaps none of them directly match this expression. Let me check each option.

Option C: sqrt( k A² / m ) → that's the non-relativistic case, but since this is a relativistic question, C is probably not the correct answer.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) )

Wait, let's compute 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2, where a = (kA^2)/(2 m c² ). So,

1 - 1/(1+a)^2 = [ (1+a)^2 - 1 ] / (1+a)^2.

Which is (1 + 2a + a² -1 ) / (1+a)^2 → (2a + a² ) / (1+a)^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * (2a + a²)/(1+a)^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2a + a²)/(1+a)^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( (a (2 + a )) / (1 + a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( a (2 +a) ) / (1 +a )

But I'm not sure if any option matches this. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, that term inside the sqrt is 1 + 1/(1 - a'), where a' is (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ). Hmm, our expression doesn't seem to match that.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m))² )

Wait, but in option A, the denominator is (1 - (kA²/(2m))² ), which is different because our a is (kA²)/(2 m c² ), so it's a different denominator.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 ) )

Hmm, let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2, where a is (kA²)/(2 m c² ), then:

1 - [1/(1+a)^2] = [ (1+a)^2 -1 ] / (1+a)^2.

Which is ( 1 + 2a + a² -1 ) / (1+a)^2 → (2a + a² )/(1 +a)^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c² * (2a + a² )/(1 +a )^2.

Which would give:

v_max = c * sqrt( (2a + a²)/(1+a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( a(2 +a ) ) / (1 + a )

Hmm, but none of the options seem to directly match this. Let me see if any can be rewritten to match.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me factor numerator and denominator.

2a + a² = a(2 +a )

Denominator: (1 +a )^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ a (2 + a) ] ) / (1 +a )

= c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) / (1 + a )

Hmm, let me try to see if any of the options look like that.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) v = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m))² ) )

Hmm, let's compute the expression inside the sqrt of option A:

1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m))² )

= [ (1 - (kA²/(2m))^2 ) + 1 ] / (1 - (kA²/(2m))^2 )

= [ 2 - (kA²/(2m))^2 ] / denominator.

Wait, that seems different from our expression.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, going back to the energy equation:

E = (1/2)kA^2 + m c^2.

So,

gamma m c^2 = (1/2)kA^2 + m c^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me denote (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as b. So,

gamma = 1 + b.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + b.

Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c² ) = (1 +b )^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 +b )^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 +b )^2.

Which is,

v²/c² = [ (1 +b )^2 -1 ] / (1 +b )^2.

(1 +b )^2 is 1 + 2b + b². So,

(1 + 2b + b² -1 ) = 2b + b².

So,

v² = c² (2b + b² )/(1 + b )^2.

But b is (kA^2)/(2 m c² ). So,

v² = c² [ 2*(kA²/(2 m c² )) + (kA²/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] / (1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )^2.

Simplify numerator:

2*(kA²/(2 m c² )) → (kA²)/(m c² ) .

So numerator is:

(kA²/(m c² )) + (k² A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator is [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c² ) ]^2 → [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]^2 / (2 m c^2 )^2.

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Let me try to factor the numerator:

Numerator: (kA²/(m c² )) [ 1 + (k A²)/( 4 m c^2 ) ]

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write numerator as (kA²/(m c^2 )) ) (1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2 )) ) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the entire expression as:

v = c * sqrt( (2b + b²) ) / (1 + b )

= c * sqrt( b (2 +b ) ) / (1 +b )

But since b = (kA²)/(2 m c^2 ), which I'll write as b = (k A²) / (2 m c² ), perhaps I can write this as:

v = c sqrt( [ (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ) * ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe I can factor the numerator inside the square root.

Wait, maybe I can factor (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) as (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) = x. Then, the numerator becomes x (2 + x ), and the denominator is (1 + x )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( x (2 +x )) / (1 + x )

= c * sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

I'm not seeing a clear way to match this with any of the options provided.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Maybe in the relativistic case, the potential energy is actually different?

Wait, another approach: perhaps in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is V(x) = (1/2)k x^2 / gamma, but I'm not sure. Or maybe the force is F = -k x / gamma, but that's making a lot of assumptions.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Lagrangian approach for a relativistic oscillator. The Lagrangian would be L = -m c^2 / gamma + (1/2)k x^2, where gamma is from the kinetic term. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the equation of motion for a relativistic oscillator is different. Oh right, the equation would be d/dt (gamma m v ) = -k x.

But solving that would be complicated, perhaps leading to an equation involving v and x in a nonlinear way. But I'm not sure if that's the way to go.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the energy is quantized. But the question doesn't mention quantum mechanics, so perhaps it's classical.

Another thought: perhaps using the virial theorem for relativistic oscillators. The virial theorem relates the average kinetic and potential energies. In the non-relativistic case, average kinetic and potential energies are equal, each being (1/2)k A^2 / 2. But relativistically, this might change.

Wait, but at maximum amplitude, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At equilibrium, velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic. But the problem is how the kinetic energy is expressed.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be when the kinetic energy is maximum, which is when all potential energy is converted into kinetic. So v_max = sqrt( (k A^2)/(m) ). But relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1 ) m c^2.

So,

( gamma -1 ) m c^2 = (1/2) k A^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + (1/2) (k A^2 )/( m c^2 )

= 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

As before.

So,

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2 )) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1/(sqrt(1 - v_max²/c² )) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me solve for v_max:

Let me denote (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as b again.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + b.

Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c² ) = (1 + b )^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + b )^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + b )^2.

= ( (1 + b )^2 -1 )/(1 + b )^2.

= (1 + 2b + b² -1 )/(1 + b )^2.

= (2b + b² )/(1 + b )^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2b + b^2 )/(1 + b )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (b(2 + b )) ) / (1 + b )

Hmm, this brings me back to the same expression as before.

Looking at the answer options, perhaps none of the options match this directly, but perhaps one of them can be transformed into this expression.

Let me look again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Wait, compute the term inside the sqrt of option D:

1 - [ 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ]

= ( (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 - 1 ) / (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2.

Expanding the numerator:

(1 + 2*(kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) -1.

= 2*(kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

= (kA^2)/(m c^2 ) + (kA^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 )

Hmm, that's what we have in the numerator. So,

v_max^2 is c^2 times [ (kA^2/(m c^2 )) + (kA^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ] divided by [ (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ].

Which is the same as our earlier expression. So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (kA^2/(m c^2 )) + (kA^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ] / (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which simplifies to c * sqrt( (2b + b^2 )/(1 +b )^2 ), with b = kA^2/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2b + b^2 )/(1 +b )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (b(2 +b )) )/(1 +b )

Which is what we had earlier. So, option D's expression is this.

Wait, option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [ 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ] )

Which is the same as what I've derived.

So option D's expression is correct. So, the answer is D.

Wait, wait a second. Let me recheck.

Wait, in option D, the expression inside the square root is 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )? No, looking back, option D says:

D) v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Wait, the denominator inside is (1 + (kA^2/(2 mc^2 )) )^2. So yes, that's exactly what I have in my expression.

So option D matches.

Wait, but I thought option D had (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) in the denominator of a fraction, like 1/(1+ ... )^2, which is what I have.

Ah, so option D is correct.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and force constant \( k \), we analyze the system's energy. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and its potential energy at maximum amplitude:

\[
E = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2.
\]

At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we get:

\[
\gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( m c^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \left( 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right)^2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right)^2}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, we see that it matches **Option D**:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right)^2}}.
\]

The other options are incorrect because they either use the wrong denominator, omit relativistic corrections, or include incorrect terms.

**Answer: D**
