Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. Let me break it down. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, right? Since c is the speed in a vacuum, which is given as 1 here. So normally, the light's speed in the glass would be 1/n.

But wait, the glass is moving. So does that affect the speed of the light as observed in the lab? I'm a bit confused here. Oh, right! Because from the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the light's speed isn't just the usual 1/n. I think this has something to do with velocity addition in special relativity. But wait, I'm not sure if that applies here because the speeds involved might be non-relativistic. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify, so I should probably assume that relativistic effects matter. Or maybe it's just using the Galilean addition because the velocities are small.

Wait, no. If the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is moving within the glass, which is moving. So the speed of light in the lab frame would be the speed of light in the glass (which is 1/n) plus the velocity of the glass, but only if we're in the same direction.

Wait, that might be the case in classical mechanics. So, using Galilean velocity addition: u' = u + v. But wait, in this case, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the lab would measure the speed as (1/n) + v? But wait, that can't be right because if v is large, that would exceed the speed of light, which isn't possible.

Oh, right! So I probably shouldn't use Galilean addition because it doesn't account for relativity. The correct approach would be to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's recall what that is.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, in this case, c is 1 because c=1 in the problem. So it becomes u' = (u + v)/(1 + u*v) because c squared is 1.

Wait, but u is the speed of light in the glass frame. No, wait, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the light's speed in the glass's frame is 1/n. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let's think. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is moving through the glass at velocity u = 1/n in the glass's frame. So the question is, what is the light's speed in the lab frame.

So using the relativistic velocity addition, u' would be (u + v)/(1 + u*v). Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v, and the light's speed in the glass's frame is u.

Wait, but wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = 1/n. So substituting into the formula, u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v ). Let me compute that.

But let me think again. Let me consider the direction. The glass is moving towards the observer and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at velocity u = 1/n (since it's propagating in the same direction as the glass's velocity in the lab).

Wait, no. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving toward the observer, then from the lab's perspective, the light's speed would be higher than in the glass's frame. Wait, no, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer. So the light's velocity in the glass frame is towards the observer direction, but the glass itself is also moving towards the observer.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the direction. Let's clarify: the glass is moving towards the observer (in the lab frame), and the light is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So in the lab, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light's speed within the glass is 1/n towards the observer.

So the lab sees the glass moving, and the light moving within it. So the speed in the lab frame would be the sum considering the glass's motion. But using the relativistic formula because the speeds could be significant.

So using u' = (u + v) / (1 + u*v). Here, u is the speed of light in the glass frame, which is 1/n, and v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab.

Wait, no, wait. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer in the lab frame. The light's velocity in the glass's frame is u = c/n = 1/n towards the observer. So applying the velocity addition formula: the lab will see the light's velocity as u' = [ (1/n) + v ] / [ 1 + (1/n)*v ]

Wait, but wait, I thought the direction matters. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction. So both velocities are in the same direction. So the signs are positive.

Wait, but let me think about the formula. The relativistic velocity addition formula when the two velocities are in the same direction is indeed (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). Since c is 1, it's (u + v)/(1 + u v).

So substituting u as 1/n, and v as +v (since it's in the same direction as the light), the formula becomes ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

Hmm, but let's see what the options are. The options are A) (1 + n v)/(n + v), B) 1, C) (1 +n v)/(n - v), D) (1 -n v)/(n +v).

Wait, let me compute the expression I have:

( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

Let me factor this. Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the fractions.

Numerator: (1 + n v)
Denominator: (n + v)

So it becomes (1 + n v)/(n +v )

Which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The formula I used is the relativistic velocity addition, which requires that both velocities are in the same direction. So that should be correct.

Wait, but what if the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light? So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v, and the light in the glass is moving at 1/n in the same direction. So the lab would observe the light at (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)v )

Which, when multiplied by n, gives (1 +n v)/(n + v ), which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait another thought. Does this hold in all cases? What if v is not small? For instance, if the glass is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. But the problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity, which implies that it's in an inertial frame, so relativistic effects should apply.

Alternatively, another approach: in the lab frame, the speed of light is always c, right? Because the speed of light is a constant in all inertial frames. Wait, but that's in vacuum. In a medium, the speed is c/n. So wait, no. Wait, the speed of light in a medium is c/n in the rest frame of the medium. But when the medium is moving, what's the observed speed?

Wait, but wait, no. Because in any inertial frame, the speed of light in a medium would depend on the medium's motion. Or does it? Hmm. Wait, no. Because in the lab frame, the medium is moving. So the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame would be different.

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in a medium moving at velocity v relative to the lab would still be c as measured in the lab. Because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Wait, but that's in a vacuum. In a medium, it's different.

Wait, that's a confusion point. Let me clarify: in a vacuum, the speed of light is c in all frames. But in a medium, the speed depends on the medium's properties. So when the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium as observed in the lab would not necessarily be c. So what's the correct approach here?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is about the speed of light in the glass, which is moving, as observed in the lab. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is 1/n. But when the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab, what is the observed speed?

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula, which is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). Substituting u = 1/n, and c=1, we get (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n) v )

Which simplifies to (1 + n v)/(n + v ), as we did before. So that's option A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Some might think that the speed of light in the medium is always c, regardless of the medium's motion. But that's not correct. The speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties and its velocity. So in this case, it's not the vacuum, so the speed is not c. The observed speed should be calculated using velocity addition.

So my conclusion is that the correct answer is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we start by noting that the speed of light in a medium is given by \( \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the medium. Since \( c = 1 \) in this problem, the speed of light in the glass in its rest frame is \( \frac{1}{n} \). However, the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. This requires us to account for the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, which is \( \frac{1}{n} \),
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory,
- \( c = 1 \) (as given).

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \) into the formula, we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{1}{n} v}
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- Option B (\( 1 \)) is incorrect because it does not account for the refractive index or the motion of the glass.
- Option C (\( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \)) is incorrect because the denominator should not involve \( n - v \).
- Option D (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \)) is incorrect because the numerator should not involve \( 1 - n v \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
