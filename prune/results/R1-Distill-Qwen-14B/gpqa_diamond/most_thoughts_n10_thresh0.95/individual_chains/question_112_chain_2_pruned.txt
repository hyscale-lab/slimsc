Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

Alright, first, the setup. We've got an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think that means they're the standard basis states for spin-1/2 particles. So, S_z |up> = (ħ/2)|up>, and similarly for |down>.

The first part of the problem is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation A where Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that doesn't sound right. Oh wait, let me think. For a 2x2 matrix, if i≠j, Aij is ħ/2, else 0. So the matrix would be:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0 ]

Wait, no. Wait, the operator's matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j. So for a 2x2 case, it's a matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Oh wait, no. Wait, because for a 2x2 matrix, there are two diagonal elements (i=j=1 and 2), and the off-diagonal terms (i≠j). So the matrix would be:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Wait, no, because if i≠j, then A_ij is ħ/2. So the matrix is:

First row: [0 (for i=1,j=1), ħ/2 (i=1,j=2)]
Second row: [ħ/2 (i=2,j=1), 0 (i=2,j=2)]

So the matrix is:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

Wait, but that's only for a 2x2 matrix. So this operator A is acting on a two-dimensional space, which makes sense because our state is in that space.

Wait, but wait. The state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the state is a linear combination of the two basis states. So the actual state is |alpha> = c1 |up> + c2 |down>, where c1 = (1+i), c2=(2-i), but multiplied by some normalization factor, since the problem says it's proportional.

So first, I should normalize |alpha>, I think. Because probabilities are calculated from the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

So let me compute the normalization: the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the normalization factor would be the inverse of the square root of (|c1|^2 + |c2|^2).

Compute |c1|²: (1+i) has magnitude sqrt(1² +1²) = sqrt(2), so |c1|² = (sqrt(2))² = 2.

Wait, no. Wait, |a + ib|² is a² + b². So (1+i): 1 squared plus 1 squared is 2. So |c1|² = 2.

Similarly, c2 = 2 - i. So |c2|² is 2² + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So |c2|²=5.

So normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2+5) = 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but wait, the problem says it's proportional, so the actual |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, and when calculating probabilities, we'll just take the squared magnitudes of these coefficients, but then the probabilities would be |(1+i)|²/(2+5) and |(2-i)|²/(2+5).

So the probabilities for |up> and |down> in the z-basis are |1+i|² / 7 and |2-i|² /7. Which are 2/7 and 5/7, right? Because |1+i|² is 2, |2-i|² is 5.

Wait, but the question is about measuring in the eigenstates of the operator A. Wait, operator A has matrix [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]], correct? So what are the eigenstates of this operator?

Because the operator's matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], its eigenstates are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, scaled by ħ/2. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation.

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λI) = 0.

So:

| -λ   ħ/2 |
| ħ/2  -λ |

Determinant is (λ)^2 - (ħ/2)^2 = 0 → λ^2 = (ħ/2)^2. So λ = ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the equation is ( -λ )^2 - (ħ/2)^2 =0 → λ² = (ħ/2)^2 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenstates correspond to these eigenvalues. The eigenstate for λ=ħ/2 would be found by solving (A - (ħ/2) I)|v> =0.

Wait, let me write the matrix A - (ħ/2) I:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   -ħ/2 ]

So the equations are:

(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenstate is proportional to [1, 1], so |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ= -ħ/2, the eigenvector comes from A + (ħ/2) I:

[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]

Which gives the equations (ħ/2)(v1 + v2) =0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenstate is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, typically the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |–x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? So in this case, our operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So A = (ħ/2) X.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of X, which are |+x> and |–x>, as I wrote.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |–x>, which are given by (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So when we measure in the basis of A's eigenstates, the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projections of |alpha> onto each eigenstate.

So, to find the probabilities, we can expand |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |–x> and then compute the square of the coefficients.

But perhaps a simpler way is to write |alpha> in the original basis and express it in terms of the new basis.

Alternatively, since the eigenstates are known, we can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

So let's compute the components.

First, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7) for normalization.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

The eigenstates of A are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2)
|–x> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2)

So the inner product < +x | alpha > is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2-i) <up|down> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2-i) <down|down> ]

But <up|down> = 0, so this simplifies to:

(1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i)*1 + (2-i)*1 ]

Which is (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] = (1/(sqrt(14))) (3 + 0i) ) → 3 / sqrt(14).

So the amplitude for |+x> is 3/(sqrt(14)), and the probability is (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14.

Similarly, compute <–x | alpha>.

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (2-i) <down|down> ]

Because <up|down> is 0, and <down|up> is 0.

So that's (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) *1 - (2 -i)*1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ -1 + 2i ]

So the amplitude is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The probability is the squared magnitude: [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) ]^2.

Wait, no, the squared magnitude is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / (14) ) = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14.

Wait, wait: the squared magnitude is ( | -1 + 2i |^2 ) / (14) → (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

Wait, so the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14? Let me check my calculations.

Wait, earlier when I did < +x | alpha >, I had 3/sqrt(14), so that's 3 squared is 9, over 14. And the other is 5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 +5/14 is 14/14=1, so that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Now, looking at the options, let me see which one has these fractions.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 ... 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which rounds to ~0.643, and 5/14 is ~0.357. Close to 0.64 and 0.36. So option A has 0.64 and 0.36 as probabilities. But let me see the option.

Option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. So that seems to match.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46 → 5.4/10, 4.6/10. 5.4+4.6=10, so 54%
