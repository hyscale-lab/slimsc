Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal, right? So the lattice parameters are the same. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ)), but wait, no. I might be mixing up the formulas. Oh wait, another thought: when the crystal is cubic, the formula simplifies because all angles are 90 degrees. But here, the angles are 30 degrees, so it's not cubic.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Oh, right! For a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is a special case where a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma. So the Miller indices (hkl) can be used with a modified formula.

The general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is d = (a^2 * (sin α sin β sin γ) )^(1/2) / sqrt( (h l cos α + k m cos β + l n cos gamma) ) Hmm, no, wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to recall the correct formula.

Oh wait, the correct formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is a bit tricky. I think it's given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ), where θ is the angle between the lattice parameters. Since here, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and all angles are 30 degrees.

Wait no, for a rhombohedral system, the angles between edges are alpha, beta, gamma. But in this case, all are 30 degrees. So the formula for d is a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ). Because in rhombohedral, the unit cell is based on a, a, a with angles between each pair.

So plugging in the values, since alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

The (111) plane has h=1, k=1, l=1.

So let's compute the denominator first.

Denominator = sqrt(1² + 1² +1² + 2*(1)(1) cos30 + 2*(1)(1) cos30 + 2*(1)(1) cos30 )

Wait, cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 approximately 0.8660.

So the terms inside the sqrt:

1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then, the cross terms: 2*1*1 * cos30 * 3 (since each cross term is hk, hl, kl, each multiplied by 2 and cos30).

Wait, wait, because each cross term is 2hk cos α, 2hl cos β, 2kl cos gamma. Since all angles are 30, each term is 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3).

So for hk: 2*1*1*cos30 = sqrt(3)
Same for hl and kl.

So three terms each contributing sqrt(3): so 3 * sqrt(3).

So total inside the sqrt is 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ?

Wait wait, no. Let me write it:

Denominator = sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos gamma )

So h=k=l=1.

So h² + k² + l² = 3.

And 2hk cos α = 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3). Similarly for 2hl cos β and 2kl cos gamma. So each is sqrt(3), and there are three such terms, so 3*sqrt(3).

So the sum inside sqrt is 3 + 3√3.

So denominator = sqrt(3 + 3√3).

Compute that:

3 + 3√3 ≈ 3 + 3*1.732 ≈ 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So denominator ≈ 2.863.

So d = a / denominator = 10 Angstrom / 2.863 ≈ 3.493 Angstrom? Wait that can't be right. Because the options are around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the formula. No, wait, no, I think I messed up unit cell parameters. Wait, wait, no, let's re-examine.

Wait, the a here is the interatomic distance. Wait, but in a rhombohedral crystal, a is the lattice parameter, the edge length. But in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. But in some other structures, like in a face-centered cubic, the interatomic distance is a*sqrt(2)/2 or something else.

Wait, wait a second. Is a the interatomic distance (as given) the same as the lattice parameter? Because in the question, it says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". So perhaps the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstrom.

Wait, but for a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is based on the lattice parameters. So a = interatomic distance. So a=10 Angstrom.

So with that, the interplanar distance is a over that denominator.

Wait, but when I calculate, I get 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom. But the options are in the 8-10 range. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos gamma )

Wait, that's what I used before. Let me recalculate.

h,k,l=1,1,1.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 2*(1)(1) cos30 *3.

Wait, no, wait, 2hk cos(alpha) is 2*1*1 * cos30.

So 2 * 1 * 1 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3).

Same for 2hl cos beta and 2kl cos gamma. So each is sqrt(3). So sum is 3 +3*sqrt(3).

So 3 +3*1.732≈8.196. sqrt(8.196)=~ 2.863.

d=10 / 2.863 ≈ 3
