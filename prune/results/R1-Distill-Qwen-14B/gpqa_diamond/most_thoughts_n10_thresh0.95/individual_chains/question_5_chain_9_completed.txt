Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, right.

Wait, let's parse the problem. The operator is P, and it's a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each component is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh, right, I remember that spin operators are often represented this way. Like, for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So I think this relates to the spin-up state along that direction.

Wait, eigenvectors of the spin operator along a direction n. Oh! That's the eigenstate of the spin component in the direction of n. So for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction.

So, the operator P is given by the vector components P = (P_x, P_y, P_z). The total operator in the direction of n would be P·n, where n is a unit vector. Since n lies in the x-z plane, it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane corresponds to φ=0, so the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, no. Wait, n is in the x-z plane, so it has components (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So we can write n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ? Wait, wait, no, that would make it in the x-z plane, but usually, θ is measured from the z-axis. So if I have a vector in the x-z plane making an angle θ with the z-axis, its components would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Because when θ=0, it's along z (n_x=0, n_z=1), when θ=90, it's along x (n_x=1, n_z=0). Yeah, that makes sense.

So the operator in the direction of n is P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z. Because P_y would be multiplied by n_y, but since n is in x-z, n_y=0, so that term drops out.

Each of the P components are given as matrices. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P·n is (ħ/2) [n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Wait, no, earlier I thought n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. Let me get that right. Because n is in x-z, so the direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So:

P·n = (ħ/2)[ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute this matrix. The first term is sinθ times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]]. The second term is cosθ times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. So adding them:

P·n = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, no. Let me do it step by step.

The matrix for P·n is:

Row 1:
- Element (1,1) is (ħ/2)(n_z) = (ħ/2) cosθ
- Element (1,2) is (ħ/2)(n_x) = (ħ/2) sinθ

Row 2:
- Element (2,1) is (ħ/2)(n_x) = (ħ/2) sinθ
- Element (2,2) is (ħ/2)( -n_z ) = -(ħ/2) cosθ

So matrix form:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ, (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

So the operator P·n is this matrix. Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Eigenvalue equation: (P·n - (+ħ/2) I) |v> = 0

So, let me write the matrix (P·n - (ħ/2) I):

Each element is subtracted by (ħ/2) in the diagonal.

So,

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ) - (ħ/2), (ħ/2 sinθ) ],
  [ (ħ/2 sinθ), -(ħ/2 cosθ) - (ħ/2) ] ]

Factor out (ħ/2):

[ [ cosθ -1 , sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, - (cosθ +1) ] ]

Multiply by (ħ/2), but since we're looking for non-trivial solutions, the determinant must be zero. So let's compute the determinant and find the eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to work in dimensionless terms. Let me divide everything by (ħ/2), since the exact scaling factors can be incorporated into the eigenvector normalization.

Let me define a scaled matrix:

M = [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
       [ sinθ, -(cosθ +1) ] ]

The determinant of M must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

Compute determinant:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = 0

Let me compute each term:

First term: (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -(cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) = -(cos²θ -1) = - ( (-sin²θ) ) = sin²θ

Second term: -(sinθ)(sinθ) = - sin²θ

So determinant is sin²θ - sin²θ = 0. Which holds, as expected for eigenvalues.

So the equation is (cosθ -1) x + sinθ y = 0

Wait, no. Wait, the equations come from (Mv)=0.

So, the first row of M is [cosθ -1, sinθ], and the second row is [sinθ, -(cosθ +1)].

So, the equations are:

(cosθ -1) x + sinθ y = 0

sinθ x - (cosθ +1) y = 0

So, from the first equation:

(cosθ -1)x = - sinθ y → y = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] x

Hmm, let's simplify (1 - cosθ)/ sinθ. Remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So (1 - cosθ)/ sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = [ sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) ] = tan(θ/2)

So y = tan(θ/2) x

So, the eigenvector can be written as any scalar multiple of (x, y) = (1, tan(θ/2))

But we can write this as a vector. Let me represent it as |v> = [1; tan(θ/2) ]

But we need to normalize this eigenvector.

The norm is sqrt(1^2 + [tan(θ/2)]^2 ) = sqrt( (cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2)) ) / cos²(θ/2) )

Wait, wait, let's compute 1 + tan^2(θ/2) = 1 + [sin²/(cos²)] = [cos² + sin²]/cos² = 1/(cos²(θ/2)).

So the norm is sqrt(1/(cos²(θ/2))) ) = 1/(cos(θ/2)).

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T multiplied by something. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, no. Wait, let me compute the normalization factor. Let me write the vector as [1; tan(θ/2)].

The squared magnitude is 1 + tan²(θ/2) = sec²(θ/2) → so magnitude is sec(θ/2). So to normalize, divide each component by sec(θ/2), so [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

Wait, yes! Because tan(θ/2) = sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2). So the vector [1, tan(θ/2)] becomes [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] when normalized.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), but it's written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So option C is that. Option D is scaled by sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ, but our result doesn't have any ħ factors, and the components are just cos and sin. So probably option C is the correct one.

Wait, but wait a second. The operator given is for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle, so the eigenvectors are as I found. But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result.

But wait, looking at the options, the options have different forms. Let me check again.

Option B is (cosθ, e^{i phi} sinθ ), which is spherical coordinates for a point on the unit sphere, but that's for a vector in 3D, not a 2D spinor. Option C is 2D, which makes sense.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2). Why would there be ħ factors there? The eigenvectors are dimensionless, as they are vectors in Hilbert space. So options A and D have ħ, which doesn't make sense for a normalized vector. Because eigenstates are normalized, and ħ has units of angular momentum. So the components shouldn't have factors of ħ.

So option C is the only one without ħ, so that's probably the right answer.

Wait, but wait again. The eigenvector I found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. Let me double-check the calculation.

Earlier, the matrix P·n is (ħ/2) times [[ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ]]. So when finding the eigenvector, the scaling by (ħ/2) is part of the matrix, which affects the eigenvalues but not the eigenvectors themselves. Because the eigenvectors are found in the matrix's basis. So the eigenvectors are the same regardless of the overall scaling of the operator.

So the normalized eigenvector is indeed [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

Looking at the options, option C is exactly this.

Wait, but there's option D. Let me see what the components are. Option D: sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2). The normalization factor would be sqrt( (2/3 ħ^2 cos^2(theta/2) ) + (1/3 ħ^2 sin^2(theta/2)) ) ) = ħ sqrt( (2/3 cos^2 + 1/3 sin^2) )

But since eigenvectors are normalized, the components should be unit vectors. So if option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), that's possible if the coefficients are multiplied by a factor that when squared gives 2/3 and 1/3, but the sum would be 2/3 + 1/3 = 1, which is correct. So perhaps the eigenvector is [ sqrt(2/3) cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but why would the eigenvector have those coefficients? Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me think differently. The operator P·n is (ħ/2) times the rotation matrix. Since P·n is a spin operator, its eigenvectors should be the eigenstates of spin in that direction.

Wait, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So for the +ħ/2 eigenvalue, the eigenvector is the spin-up state along n. For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvectors are given by the spherical harmonics, or more simply, in the spinor representation.

The general formula for the eigenvector along a direction (theta, phi) is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but in our case, phi is zero because n lies in the x-z plane (phi=0), so phi=0. So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which matches option C.

So why is option D presented as an option? I'm probably missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should represent the operator in terms of the Pauli matrices. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) sigma, where sigma are the Pauli matrices. So the operator P is the same as S.

So the eigenvectors are the same as the eigenstates of spin along direction n.

So the spin-up state is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T. But since phi=0, it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So the normalized eigenvector is option C.

Wait, but some sources might express the eigenvectors in a different normalization. Wait, no, the standard expression is as I mentioned.

So looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so that's the right answer.

Wait, but let me check the other options:

Option A: sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ. These have ħ which doesn't belong in a normalized eigenvector. So incorrect.

Option B: (cosθ, e^{i phi} sinθ ). That's a 3D unit vector, not a spinor. So incorrect.

Option D: sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2). Again, the presence of ħ is a red flag because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So D is incorrect.

Hence, option C is the correct one.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane and can be expressed as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z
\]
Substituting the given components:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad n_x = \sin\theta, \quad n_z = \cos\theta,
\]
we find:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for the eigenvector
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0,
\]
where $I$ is the identity matrix. Substituting $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ and simplifying:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} |v\rangle = 0.
\]
Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the matrix becomes:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvector satisfies:
\[
\begin{cases}
(\cos\theta - 1)x + \sin\theta y = 0, \\
\sin\theta x - (\cos\theta + 1)y = 0.
\end{cases}
\]
From the first equation:
\[
y = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} x.
\]
Using the trigonometric identities $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} = \tan(\theta/2).
\]
Thus, $y = \tan(\theta/2) x$, and the eigenvector can be written as:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The norm of the eigenvector is:
\[
\sqrt{1^2 + \tan^2(\theta/2)} = \sqrt{\sec^2(\theta/2)} = \sec(\theta/2).
\]
Dividing each component by $\sec(\theta/2)$, the normalized eigenvector becomes:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for a normalized eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ represents a 3D unit vector, not a spinor.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
