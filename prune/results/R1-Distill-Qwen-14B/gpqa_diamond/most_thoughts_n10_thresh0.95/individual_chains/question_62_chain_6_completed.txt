--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's see.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break that down. So, the structure must be something like a cyclohexane ring attached to another cyclohexane, but with a hydroxy and methyl group, and then a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally.

Starting from ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond, right? So ethynylcyclohexane would have a triple bond between two carbons attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, no—ethynyl is a substituent, so it's like cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

I need to get to this 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's parse that name. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO). The substituent is at position 1, which is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, the substituent is a methyl group connected to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure would be like:

O
||
C-(CH2-cyclohexane-OH) connected to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituent is -(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So it's a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is something like (cyclohexyl)(OH)CH2-.

So the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and at position 1, there's a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. So, the molecule is:

O
||
C6H11-C-CH2-(C6H11-OH)
Wait, perhaps more accurately:

The cyclohexane ring has a -CHO group. On the same carbon as the -CHO, there's a CH2 group that's attached to another cyclohexane (cyclohexyl) and an OH group. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CH2CHO group? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexane with a formyl group, and on that same carbon, there's a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl.

So to synthesize this, I need to figure out the steps starting from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me think about possible reactions.

Ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. Common reactions for terminal alkynes include hydration, alkylation, or deprotonation. So, possible initial steps could involve deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide.

Looking at the options, the first reagent in all options is NaNH2, which is a strong base, so it's likely deprotonating the ethynyl group. For example, NaNH2 would deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide ion.

After deprotonation, the next step varies. Let's look at the options:

Option A: Second step is methyl chloride. So, the acetylide would react with methyl chloride in an alkylation. That would add a methyl group to the acetylide. So from CH2C≡C-C6H11, after deprotonation, you get the acetylide, then methyl chloride would give CH2C≡C-CH2-C6H11? Wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH. Deprotonation gives C6H11-C≡C^- + NH2^- . Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide, adding a methyl group. So the product would be C6H11-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, wait, wait. Wait, the acetylide is a strong base, so it would attack the methyl chloride, giving C6H11-C≡C-CH3. Because the chloride is a good leaving group, so the acetylide attacks CH3Cl, resulting in substitution. So the alkyne becomes CH2C≡CCH3? No, wait. Wait, original structure is C6H11-C≡CH. Deprotonated to C6H11-C≡C^- . Alkylation would add a methyl group, so the product would be C6H11-C≡C-CH3. So after this, it's 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethylene or 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylacetylene.

But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is (cyclohexyl)ethynyl, so deprotonation gives the acetylide. Then alkylation with methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the acetylide, making (cyclohexyl)propyne? Or wait, (cyclohexyl)ethynide plus CH3Cl would become (cyclohexyl)propylide? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The acetylide has a negative charge on the sp carbon. When methyl chloride (a primary alkyl halide) is added, the acetylide would attack, leading to substitution. So the product would be (cyclohexyl)propane-1-yn-1-yl chloride? No, not chloride. Wait, no, after substitution, the chloride leaves, so the product is (cyclohexyl)propyne. Wait, no, I think that the alkylation step would add a methyl group to the acetylide, making a longer alkyne. So if we start with ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH), deprotonate to C6H11-C≡C^- , then methyl chloride would add a methyl, giving C6H11-C≡C-CH3. So that's 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethyne, which is 1-cyclohexylpropyne.

Wait, but the next step in option A is H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation, so it would add hydrogen across the triple bond. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the product would be C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, the structure after alkylation is C6H11-C≡C-CH3, so hydrogenation would make it C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's just a propane chain attached to cyclohexane. That doesn't seem to fit the target molecule.

Then, step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or oxidation? Hmm, but the target has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps oxidation. Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like the oxymercuration reagent, but HgSO4 is in H2SO4—maybe for oxidation. Wait, or maybe it's for epoxidation? Not sure. Alternatively, H2SO4 and HgSO4 could be used in the oxidation of alkenes to diols, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group and a substituted CH2 group. So perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkene, then into an alcohol, then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. Wait, hydration of an alkyne can give a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on the conditions.

Let me think about each option's steps.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: So same initial step as A, but with ethyl chloride instead of methyl. So the alkyne becomes longer. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's for deprotonation or alkylation? Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is typically used for Birch reductions or for forming Grignard reagents, but in some cases, it's used for deprotonation of terminal alkynes. Alternatively, in the presence of a diethyl ether solvent, it could be used for alkylation via a transmetallation. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Grignard-like conditions. After alkylation, the next step is O3/H2O, which is ozonolysis. Then NH4OH, which is for reductive workup in ozonolysis.

So let's trace:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH). Deprotonate with NaNH2 to get C6H11-C≡C^- . Then alkylation with ethyl chloride to make C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then step 2 is Li in NH3. Maybe that's for forming a Grignard reagent, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's for deprotonation again. Wait, maybe the ethyl chloride step adds an ethyl group, but then Li/NH3 could induce elimination. Or perhaps it's a two-step alkylation? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is alkyne deprotonation, step 2 is alkylation with ethyl chloride to make a longer alkyne. Then step 3 is O3/H2O—ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a di-substituted alkyne? Wait, no, ozonolysis is for alkenes. So maybe step 2 converts the alkyne to an alkene. Wait, but if the alkyne is extended, maybe in step 2, they're hydrogenating it to a cis-alkene or something else. Not sure.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: So same as option A, adding a methyl group to the alkyne. Then step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That's hydrogenation, so perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane, but Pd is usually for hydrogenation of alkynes to cis-alkenes, but if it's with CaCO3, perhaps it's a Lindlar catalyst for hydrogenating the alkyne to cis-alkene. Wait, Lindlar catalyst is for alkynes to cis-alkenes. So if we have C6H11-C≡C-CH3 after step 1, step 2 would hydrogenate the triple bond to cis double bond, making C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, the structure after step 1 is C6H11-C≡C-CH3. Hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond. Using H2 and Pd likely would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. Wait, no, hydrogenation of an alkyne to an alkene requires a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar. Without that, the alkyne would hydrogenate all the way to the alkane. So step 2, H2/Pd would add H2 to the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So the product would be C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozone followed by (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. Wait, but after step 2, if we had an alkene, then ozonolysis would break it. But in this case, the triple bond was hydrogenated all the way to single bond, so after step 2, it's a single bond. So ozone would have nothing to react with. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting the step wrong.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is longer, then step 2 is hydrogenation to cis-alkene. Wait, but the reagent is H2 and Pd, which would hydrogenate to the alkane. Unless the catalyst is different. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to the alkene, then ozonolysis would break it.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group, so perhaps oxidation is involved. Also, the substituent has a hydroxyl group, which suggests some kind of epoxide opening or maybe an oxidation from an alcohol.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: That's deprotonation with methanol. Wait, methanol as the alkylating agent? Or perhaps it's an alkylation with a methyl group from methanol. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so it would deprotonate the alkyne, then methanol would act as an electrophilic methylating agent. So, the acetylide would attack methanol to form an ethyl ether or something else. Wait, but methanol has a good leaving group (the hydroxide ion?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Gilmann reaction, where the acetylide is treated with a methyl group from a methyl halide. Wait, but the first step in option D is NaNH2 and methanol. So, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation with methanol as the alkylating agent. Methanol has a methyl group attached to oxygen. So the acetylide would attack the methyl in methanol, but that would require a good leaving group. Methanol isn't a good leaving group, though. So perhaps this step isn't an alkylation. Alternatively, maybe it's for forming a vinyl ether, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step in D is deprotonating the alkyne to form the acetylide, then treating with methanol. Wait, but that would just give the same alkyne with a hydroxyl group? No, I'm not getting this.

Alternatively, maybe the first step in D is deprotonation, then the second reagent is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, and step 4 is NH4OH.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about each step's purpose. Let me outline what's needed for the target molecule.

The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which suggests an oxidation of a cyclohexylmethanol group to a -CHO. Also, the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group attached to the main ring. So perhaps the main steps are: alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group, hydrogenation to form a double bond, then dihydroxylation or epoxidation, then ring-opening to form the diol, followed by oxidation.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted to an alkene via deprotonation and alkylation. Then, the alkene is hydrogenated or oxidized.

Alternatively, let's consider the steps needed to form the hydroxymethyl group. Maybe we need to form an epoxide and then perform acid-catalyzed ring opening to form a diol, which can then be oxidized to a carbonyl.

Let me try to map out the steps:

1. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH).

2. Deprotonate to form the acetylide (C6H11-C≡C^-).

3. Alkylation with a methyl group to get C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

4. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond (maybe cis or trans), which would give C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, if the alkyne is C6H11-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would turn the triple bond into a single bond, so the product is C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3. That doesn't form an alkene, though. Oh, wait, unless the hydrogenation is partial, but with H2 and Pd, it's usually full hydrogenation.

Hmm, perhaps the next step is to form an alkene through a different method. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first transformed into an enol ether or something else.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a carbonyl group. For example, hydration of the alkyne would give a ketone. But ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, so acid-catalyzed hydration would give cyclohexylacetaldehyde (CH3-CO-C6H11). But then how does that lead to the target structure?

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane, then oxidized to a ketone.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. So maybe we need to form a secondary alcohol and then oxidize it. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then transformed into an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an enol ether, then hydrolyzed to a ketone or aldehyde.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me go back to the options.

Looking at the options, which ones include steps that can form an aldehyde and a diol or alcohol substituent.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: forms C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenates the alkyne to cis-alkene? Or to alkane? Because with Pd and H2, it's usually full hydrogenation. So alkyne to single bond, so the triple becomes a single bond, making C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Then step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis, which breaks double bonds. But if after step 2, it's a single bond, there's no double bond. So that doesn't make sense. So perhaps this option is not correct.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: deprotonate to acetylide, then perhaps methylating with methanol? But I'm not sure how that would proceed. Alternative, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol in a coupling reaction, but I'm not certain.

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That could be for deprotonation again, forming a stronger base, or perhaps for another alkylation. Then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S, which is ozonolysis with reductive workup.

After ozonolysis, the alkyne would be cleaved. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Option B:

First step: NaNH2, ethyl chloride. So same as before, but with ethyl. So alkyne becomes C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Maybe this is for deprotonation and further alkylation, but I'm not sure. Then step 3: O3/H2O, which would break any double bonds, then step 4: NH4OH, which could be for workup, maybe to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but how would that lead to the target structure?

Alternatively, perhaps after the alkylation, the triple bond is converted into a ketone or aldehyde via hydration. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which suggests that at some point, there's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So maybe we need to form a ketone or aldehyde through oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via some process, then that's oxidized to an aldehyde.

Alternatively, considering that the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the hydroxymethyl group and the aldehyde, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol from an epoxide, then oxidizing to form the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate to acetylide.

2. Alkylation to add a methyl group (from methyl chloride), making a longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenation to make a cis-alkene.

4. Ozonolysis to break the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but in that case, the product after ozonolysis would have two carbonyl groups, which might form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis and workup, the chain is cleaved into two parts, each with a carbonyl group.

But wait, let's see. Suppose the alkyne after alkylation is C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, hydrogenation (maybe with a catalyst that stops at the alkene) would make C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 as a single bond, which doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkene via deprotonation and alkylation, then hydrogenated to a different structure.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option B is Li in NH3, which is used to form a Grignard-like reagent. Then, perhaps the Grignard adds to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the target's substituent: the hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So maybe we need to form a vicinal diol on the cyclohexane, which can then be oxidized to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how do we get the diol? Maybe via epoxidation followed by acid treatment.

But looking at the options, which ones have steps that would form a diol or epoxide?

Option C: After step 2 (hydrogenation), step 3 is ozonolysis. So if after hydrogenation, the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Let me think: Alkyne becomes cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would break into two carbonyls. So for example, if the structure after hydrogenation is C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3, no, that's a single bond. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne after alkylation is C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3, which upon hydrogenation becomes C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (single bond). No, that's not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation is selective to form a cis-alkene. For that, the catalyst would need to be Lindlar's, which is poisoned. If the option uses H2 and Lindlar's catalyst, then the alkyne becomes cis-alkene. But in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. I think Pd is not necessarily Lindlar, unless it's specified. So if it's just H2 and Pd, it would hydrogenate the alkyne all the way to the single bond, not stopping at the alkene.

So perhaps option C isn't the right path.

Looking back, the target has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. So perhaps the reaction sequence involves oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone, but wait, the target is an aldehyde, which is a primary oxidation.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So maybe the synthesis includes forming a benzaldehyde-like structure but on a cyclohexane ring.

Perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate to acetylide.

2. Alkylation → longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenation to alkane.

4. Oxidation to aldehyde.

But that doesn't seem to account for the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl via hydration, then further reactions.

Wait, but in that case, how do we get the hydroxymethyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkyne with a methyl group, then hydrogenated to form a propyl chain attached to cyclohexane, which is then oxidized to form the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps:

Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate → alkyne → alkylation (methyl) → longer alkyne → hydrogenate to propyl → oxidation to form aldehyde.

But I'm missing the hydroxymethyl part.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxymethyl comes from epoxide ring-opening. So, perhaps after forming an alkene, we form an epoxide, which upon acid treatment forms a diol, which is then oxidized.

Wait, let me think of each option again.

Looking at option C, steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to single bond.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis (but no double bond, so unclear).

Hmm, not making sense.

Option D steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps form an ether.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe deprotonate something else.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Not sure.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → longer alkyne.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe form a Grignard.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

If step 2 is Grignard, perhaps it's adding to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the hydroxymethyl and the aldehyde. So perhaps the molecule is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide.

So, perhaps the reaction sequence involves:

- Forming an epoxide from an alkene.

- Then, acid-catalyzed ring-opening to form a diol.

- Then, oxidation of the diol to form the aldehyde.

But how to get the alkene?

Wait, maybe the alkyne is converted into an alkene via hydrogenation, then epoxidized, then opened.

So, for example:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate to acetylide.

2. Alkylation with methyl chloride → longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate to alkene (cis or trans).

4. Epoxidation → form epoxide.

5. Acid treatment → diol.

6. Oxidation → aldehyde.

But looking at the options, do any of them include epoxidation and acid workup?

Looking at the options, option C has a step with Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, maybe for forming epoxides via base?

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used for elimination reactions, such as converting alcohols to alkenes via E2. But for epoxidation, we usually use an oxidizing agent like mCPBA.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used in some kind of elimination.

Wait, but looking at option C, step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. So ozonolysis. I'm not seeing an epoxide step.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the target again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, on the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde ring, there's a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

So, perhaps the CH2 group comes from an alkyne that's been hydrogenated and then functionalized.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to form a ketone from the alkyne, then perform some kind of alkylation or Grignard addition.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via hydration. For example, acid-catalyzed hydration of the alkyne to form cyclohexylacetaldehyde (C6H11COCH3). Then, perhaps perform a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then further oxidized.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated to form a longer alkyne, which is then hydrogenated to a trans- or cis-alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol, and then the diol is oxidized to form a carbonyl.

But looking at the options, none include OsO4, which is used for dihydroxylation.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for an elimination reaction, forming an alkene from an alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide.

2. Alkylate with methyl chloride to make a longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate to cis-alkene.

4. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

But how does this form the target?

Wait, if the alkyne is C6H11-C≡C-CH3, and after hydrogenation, it's C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 (single bond), no double bond. So ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene.

Wait, but without the correct catalyst, it would hydrogenate all the way. So maybe the hydrogenation step is partial, stopping at the alkene. But I'm not sure if the options account for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene using a poisoned catalyst, and then ozonolysis breaks it.

Suppose the alkyne is converted to a cis-alkene. Then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So for example, if the structure is C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 (single bond), no, that doesn't help. Wait, maybe the alkyne after alkylation is C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, partial hydrogenation to cis-CH2-CH2 in the middle.

Wait, perhaps:

C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3 → (partial hydrogenation) → C6H11-CH2-C-CH2CH3 (but that's not right, because the triple bond is between C6H11 and C-CH2CH3.

After partial hydrogenation, it becomes C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't form a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps another approach: look for the reagents that would form the target's functional groups.

The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol: perhaps deprotonation and methylation.

2. Li in NH3: maybe deprotonation again or Grignard.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH: workup.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide.

2. Alkylate with methanol (but not sure how that would proceed).

3. Then, Li in NH3 could form a stronger base, perhaps leading to more alkylation.

4. Ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves forming a ketone, then reducing it to an alcohol, then oxidizing to an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target's aldehyde is directly on the cyclohexane.

Another idea: Use the alkyne to form a benzyl-type structure, then introduce the necessary substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then subjected to oxidation.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about each option's possible product.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond? Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination. So, heating with Ba(OH)2 might dehydrate the molecule to form an alkene. So, C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 → C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3 is a single bond. Wait, but eliminating would require adjacent hydroxyl groups or another leaving group. Hmm, not sure.

Then step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's the Jones oxidation conditions, which oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones. But if there's no alcohol, this wouldn't do anything.

So Option A might not form the target.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → longer alkyne.

2. Li in NH3 → perhaps another alkylation or deprotonation.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Perhaps after ozonolysis, the alkyne is cleaved into two carbonyl groups, which could form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group. But I'm not certain.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → no double bond, so no reaction.

Option C seems incorrect.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps form an ether.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe form a stronger base.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not seeing the formation of the required groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate alkyne to form acetylide.

2. Alkylation with methyl chloride to form longer alkyne.

3. Hydrogenate to alkene.

4. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

But looking at the options, only option C has a hydrogenation step, but it's followed by ozonolysis which doesn't have a double bond. Unless the hydrogenation in option C is with a poisoned catalyst, which is not specified.

Wait, another possibility: the correct sequence is to form an alkyne, hydrogenate it to a cis-alkene, then perform dihydroxylation (though the options don't include OsO4), then form the diol, which is then oxidized to form the aldehyde.

But given the options provided, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, the target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, both attached to the cyclohexane.

If option C's step 3 is ozonolysis, but after hydrogenation, the molecule would be a single bond, which wouldn't react. So perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option C's step 2 is hydrogenation to an alkene, then step 3 is ozonolysis.

Wait, in that case, after hydrogenation, the structure would have a double bond, so ozonolysis would cleave it.

But in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is likely full hydrogenation to a single bond. So no.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about each step's purpose again.

The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a formyl group attached to the cyclohexane. That suggests that there's a -CH2-CHO group attached to the ring.

So perhaps the alkyne is first alkylated to form a longer chain, then hydrogenated to form a CH2-CHO group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard adds to form the necessary groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to acetylide.

2. Alkylate with methyl chloride to form C6H11-C≡C-CH3.

3. Hydrogenate to CH2 group, but that would make a single bond, not a carbonyl.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, the alkyne becomes a carbonyl group via oxidation. Wait, but the reagents after hydrogenation in the options don't include oxidizing agents except for option A's Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4.

Wait, option A after hydrogenation uses Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Then, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's the Jones reagent for oxidation.

So, in option A:

Step 1: alkyne becomes longer (C6H11-C≡C-CH3).

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate to single bond, C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form an alkene.

Then, step 4: Jones oxidation (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) → oxidize to a ketone or carboxylic acid.

Wait, but after step 3, if Ba(OH)2 is used, maybe it's causing an elimination, forming an alkene.

Let me think:

After step 2, the molecule is C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. If there's a possible elimination (like adjacent H's), it could form an alkene. But with C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3, there are CH2 groups, but without any leaving groups, Ba(OH)2 may not cause elimination unless there's a good leaving group. But in this structure, there's no leaving group. So perhaps Ba(OH)2 isn't doing anything here, making option A incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is for epoxidation, but I don't think so.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of steps each option has. The target has two new functional groups: an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Looking at the options, option D has four steps, which might be needed for forming both substituents.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps form a methyl ether.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe deprotonate to form a strong base.

3. Ozonolysis → cleave any double bonds.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not seeing the necessary formation of the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the hydroxymethyl and aldehyde groups. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then undergoes some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated, hydrogenated, then oxidized.

Given the time I've spent on this, I think the correct sequence is option C: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2. Wait, no, option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule has a double bond, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups. Then Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination or oxidation.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B.

Wait, considering option B: after alkylation with ethyl chloride, then Li in NH3 (maybe for deprotonation), then ozonolysis, and then NH4OH.

But without knowing the exact steps, I'm not confident. 

Given the time I've spent, perhaps the best approach is to conclude that the correct sequence is option C. Wait, but I'm not certain.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the reaction sequence must achieve the following transformations:

1. **Deprotonate the terminal alkyne** to form an acetylide intermediate.
2. **Alkylate the acetylide** to extend the carbon chain.
3. **Hydrogenate the alkyne** to form an alkene or alkane.
4. **Ozonolyze the alkene** to cleave it into carbonyl groups.
5. **Functionalize the carbonyl groups** to form the hydroxymethyl and aldehyde groups.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond (alkane), not an alkene.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, but no clear pathway to form the required functional groups.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols or alkenes. However, no alcohol or alkene is present after step 2.

This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with an ethyl group, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely forms a Grignard-like reagent, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Reductive workup after ozonolysis, but no double bond is available for cleavage.

This sequence does not clearly form the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group, forming a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis-alkene.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the alkene into two carbonyl groups.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

This sequence partially aligns with the required transformations but lacks clarity in forming the hydroxymethyl and aldehyde groups.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne, but methanol is not a suitable alkylating agent for acetylides.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely forms a Grignard-like reagent, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Reductive workup after ozonolysis, but no double bond is available for cleavage.

This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
None of the options clearly and correctly outline the steps to synthesize the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** comes closest to achieving the necessary transformations, despite some uncertainties in the exact role of Ba(OH)₂.
