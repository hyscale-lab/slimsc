Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but let me think this through.

The question says the crystal is rhombohedral with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. They're asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The options are A, B, C, D, all around 9 to 10 Angstroms.

Wait, interatomic distance... Oh right, in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice. But in a cubic system, the interatomic distance 'a' is the edge length. But rhombohedral is a bit more complex because all the edges are the same length, but the angles between them aren't necessarily 90 degrees.

So rhombohedral is like a cube that's been stretched or compressed along the diagonals, right? So the lattice parameters are a, a, a with angles alpha, beta, gamma. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees.

The interplanar distance (d) for a particular plane (hkl) is given by the formula from the Bragg's law context. The formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - [ (h²k² sin² alpha + k² l² sin² beta + l² h² sin² gamma ) / (a^4) ) ] * (1/(1 + cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 gamma - 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Or maybe I remember the formula as:

d = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a^2 [h k (cos gamma + cos beta) + k l (cos alpha + cos beta) + h l (cos alpha + cos gamma)] ) ]^(1/2) ) / [ ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) * ... hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar spacing formula for a general crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(kl cos alpha) - 2(lh cos beta) ) )

But wait, no, I think the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(kl cos α) - 2(lh cos β) ) )

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the angles. Because in the rhombohedral system, the angles can be tricky. Let me think again.

In the rhombohedral system, the three vectors all have the same length 'a', but the angles between them are all equal (in this case, 30 degrees each, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees).

So for any plane (hkl), the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(kl cos α) - 2(lh cos β) )

But wait, since all angles are the same and all the edges are same, maybe this can be simplified.

Wait, the angles alpha, beta, gamma in rhombohedral are all the same, right? So in this problem, each is 30 degrees. So cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So substituting, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So,

d = a / sqrt( (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) - 2*(1*1 * cos 30) * 3 terms )

Wait, because each angle is 30, so the terms would be:

- 2(1*1 cos 30) for each of the three pairs: hk, kl, lh.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 2*(3 terms) * cos30 )

Wait, let me compute the denominator step by step.

h² +k² + l² = 3.

Each of the cross terms is 2*(1*1)*cos(30) for each pair. There are three cross terms: hk, kl, lh. So each is 2 * 1 * 1 * cos30.

So total cross terms is 3 * (2 * cos30) ?

Wait, no. Let me write the formula again:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 h k cos γ - 2 k l cos α - 2 l h cos β )

But in this case, all the angles are 30, so:

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )

So that's 3 - 2*3* cos30.

Wait, because each of the three terms (hk, kl, lh) would be 1*1, and each is multiplied by cos of the respective angle, which is all 30. So each term is 2 * 1 * 1 * cos30, and there are three such terms. So sum of cross terms is 6 cos30.

Wait, no:

Wait, the formula is:

Denominator under square root is: 

h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos γ - 2kl cos α - 2lh cos β

So substituting,

h=1, k=1, l=1,

gamma = 30, alpha=30, beta=30.

So,

3 - 2(1)(1) cos30 - 2(1)(1) cos30 - 2(1)(1) cos30.

Which is 3 - 6 cos30.

Because 2*1*1 is 2 for each of the three terms, so 2+2+2=6 times cos30.

So,

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 6 * cos30 )

Wait, cos30 is about 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.866 is approximately 5.196.

So 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's a problem because the denominator would have sqrt of a negative number. That can't be right.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, maybe I got the angles wrong. Maybe in the formula, the angles are the angles between the vectors, so in a rhombohedral system, each angle is the angle between two vectors. For example, gamma is the angle between a and b vectors? Or is it a and c?

Wait, in the context of crystallography, the angles are defined as follows: alpha is the angle between b and c vectors, beta between a and c, and gamma between a and b.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Maybe the formula in terms of the angles is different. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal system. The formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * [1 - (2 cos α cos β cos γ) / (cos² α + cos² β + cos² gamma - 1) ) ] 

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar distance d is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) ) * [ 1 - (2 cos α cos beta cos gamma) / ( 1 - cos² alpha - cos² beta - cos² gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma ) ) ]

No, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about using the structure factor approach or perhaps using vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d^2 = (a^2 (h² +k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos gamma + kl cos alpha + lh cos beta )) / (h² +k² + l²)^2 * ... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another source says that in a rhombohedral system, all edges are a, and all angles are equal (rho). So the formula for d can be simplified.

In that case, the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos rho )

Because all the angles are the same. So rho is 30 degrees.

So for (111) plane:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So denominator under square root is:

3 - 2*(1*1 + 1*1 +1*1)*
