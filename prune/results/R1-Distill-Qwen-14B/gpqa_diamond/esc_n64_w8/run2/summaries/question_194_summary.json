      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. And I need to find the partition function Z.\n\nWait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), right? Since \u03b2 is 1/(kT), but that's just a constant here. So each state contributes exp(-\u03b2E) multiplied by its multiplicity.\n\nFirst, I should figure out all the possible configurations of the spins. Each spin has two options, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe some of them are the same in terms of energy.\n\nLet me list them. S1, S2, S3 can each be +1 or -1. So the possible states are:\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1)\n2. (+1, +1, -1)\n3. (+1, -1, +1)\n4. (+1, -1, -1)\n5. (-1, +1, +1)\n6. (-1, +1, -1)\n7. (-1, -1, +1)\n8. (-1, -1, -1)\n\nNow I need to compute the energy for each of these states. The energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute each term.\n\nFor state 1: All +1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.\n\nState 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, no: wait, the sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E is -J*(-1) = J. Hmm, right.\n\nState 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is (-1)+1+(-1)= -1. So E is J.\n\nState 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is (-1)+(-1)+1 = -1. E is J.\n\nState 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is (-1)+(-1)+1 = -1. E is J.\n\nState 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is (-1)+1+(-1) = -1. E is J.\n\nState 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. E is J.\n\nState 8: All -1. S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E = -J*(3) = -3J.\n\nWait a minute, so let's summarize the energies:\n\n- States 1 and 8 have E = -3J each.\n- All the other six states (2-7) have E = J each.\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2E). Since each state's energy contributes a term, but some are the same, we can group them.\n\nSo, the two states with E = -3J each contribute exp(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = exp(3J\u03b2). Each contributes e^{3J\u03b2}, and there are two such states. So 2 * e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nThe other six states have E = J, so each contributes e^{-\u03b2*(J)} = e^{-J\u03b2}. There are six of these, so 6 * e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nSo adding them together, Z = 2e^{3J\u03b2} + 6e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option A is 2 e^{-3J\u03b2} +6e^{J\u03b2}, which doesn't fit. Option B is 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches my calculation. So that's option B.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Oh wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the energy is E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So for state 2, for example, the sum is 1*(-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E is -J*(-1) = J. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the partition function, each state is counted once. So for each state, we have exp(-\u03b2 E). So for E = J, the term is exp(-\u03b2 J). For E = -3J, it's exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nYes, so the Z would be 2 * exp(3 J \u03b2) + 6 * exp(- J \u03b2). So the correct option is B.\n",

Let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z for this system.\n\nWait, what's a partition function again? Oh right, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor e^(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT), and E is the energy of each state.\n\nSo, each spin can be +1 or -1, which gives us 2^3 = 8 possible states. I need to calculate E for each of these states and then sum up e^(-\u03b2E) for all of them.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.\n\nEach spin has two options, so the total number is 8. Let me list them:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nFor each of these, I need to compute the energy E.\n\nThe energy E is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nStarting with the first state:\n1. All spins +1:\nS1S2 = 1*1=1\nS1S3=1*1=1\nS2S3=1*1=1\nSum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.\n\nNext, state 2:\nS1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1\nSum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1\nE = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nState 3:\nS1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\nS1S2= -1\nS1S3= +1\nS2S3= -1\nSum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1\nE = J.\n\nState 4:\nS1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\nS1S2 = -1\nS1S3 = -1\nS2S3 = 1\nSum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1\nE= J.\n\nState 5:\nS1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\nS1S2 = -1\nS1S3 = -1\nS2S3 =1\nSum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1\nE= J.\n\nState 6:\nS1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\nS1S2= -1\nS1S3=1\nS2S3=-1\nSum: (-1) +1 + (-1)= -1\nE= J.\n\nState7:\nS1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\nS1S2=1\nS1S3=-1\nS2S3=-1\nSum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1\nE= J.\n\nState8:\nAll spins -1:\nS1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1\nSum: 3\nE= -3J.\n\nWait, let me double-check a couple of these. For state 2: S3 is -1, so S1S3 is 1*-1 = -1. S2S3 is 1*-1 = -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Yes, E = J.\n\nSimilarly, state8: all -1, each pair product is 1, so sum 3, E=-3J.\n\nNow, let's count how many states have each energy.\n\nLooking at E:\n\n-3J occurs in states 1 and 8. So 2 states.\n\nJ occurs in states 2,3,4,5,6,7. That's 6 states.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recount:\n\nStates 2-7: 6 states, each with E=J.\n\nSo, the energies are either -3J or J.\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp( -\u03b2 E ).\n\nWait, the formula is Z = sum_{n} exp(-\u03b2 E_n).\n\nSo for each state, compute exp(-\u03b2 E_n), then sum all.\n\nBut since states with same E contribute the same factor, we can group them.\n\nSo, for E=-3J: each state contributes exp(3J\u03b2) because E is -3J.\n\nNumber of such states is 2, so their contribution is 2 * exp(3J\u03b2).\n\nFor E=J: each state contributes exp(-J\u03b2), because E= J, so -\u03b2 E is -J\u03b2.\n\nNumber of such states is 6, so their contribution is 6 * exp(-J\u03b2).\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait no. Because E is negative three J, so when we plug into the formula, it's exp(-\u03b2 E). So E is -3J, so:\n\nexp(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = exp(3J\u03b2).\n\nSimilarly, for E= J, exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3J\u03b2} + 6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, which option is that?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B is Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nYes, that's what I have.

Oh right, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor e^(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT), and E is the energy of each state.\n\nSo, each spin can be +1 or -1, which gives us 2^3 = 8 possible states. I need to calculate E for each of these states and then sum up e^(-\u03b2E) for all of them.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.\n\nEach spin has two options, so the total number is 8. Let me list them:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nFor each of these, I need to compute the energy E.\n\nThe energy E is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nStarting with the first state:\n1. All spins +1:\nS1S2 = 1*1=1\nS1S3=1*1=1\nS2S3=1*1=1\nSum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.\n\nNext, state 2:\nS1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1\nSum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1\nE = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nState 3:\nS1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\nS1S2= -1\nS1S3= +1\nS2S3= -1\nSum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1\nE = J.\n\nState 4:\nS1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\nS1S2 = -1\nS1S3 = -1\nS2S3 = 1\nSum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1\nE= J.\n\nState 5:\nS1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\nS1S2 = -1\nS1S3 = -1\nS2S3 =1\nSum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1\nE= J.\n\nState 6:\nS1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\nS1S2= -1\nS1S3=1\nS2S3=-1\nSum: (-1) +1 + (-1)= -1\nE= J.\n\nState7:\nS1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\nS1S2=1\nS1S3=-1\nS2S3=-1\nSum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1\nE= J.\n\nState8:\nAll spins -1:\nS1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1\nSum: 3\nE= -3J.\n\nWait, let me double-check a couple of these. For state 2: S3 is -1, so S1S3 is 1*-1 = -1. S2S3 is 1*-1 = -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Yes, E = J.\n\nSimilarly, state8: all -1, each pair product is 1, so sum 3, E=-3J.\n\nNow, let's count how many states have each energy.\n\nLooking at E:\n\n-3J occurs in states 1 and 8. So 2 states.\n\nJ occurs in states 2,3,4,5,6,7. That's 6 states.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recount:\n\nStates 2-7: 6 states, each with E=J.\n\nSo, the energies are either -3J or J.\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp( -\u03b2 E ).\n\nWait, the formula is Z = sum_{n} exp(-\u03b2 E_n).\n\nSo for each state, compute exp(-\u03b2 E_n), then sum all.\n\nBut since states with same E contribute the same factor, we can group them.\n\nSo, for E=-3J: each state contributes exp(3J\u03b2) because E is -3J.\n\nNumber of such states is 2, so their contribution is 2 * exp(3J\u03b2).\n\nFor E=J: each state contributes exp(-J\u03b2), because E= J, so -\u03b2 E is -J\u03b2.\n\nNumber of such states is 6, so their contribution is 6 * exp(-J\u03b2).\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait no. Because E is negative three J, so when we plug into the formula, it's exp(-\u03b2 E). So E is -3J, so:\n\nexp(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = exp(3J\u03b2).\n\nSimilarly, for E= J, exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3J\u03b2} + 6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, which option is that?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B is Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nYes, that's what I have. So the correct answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: 2e^{-3J\u03b2} +6e^{J\u03b2} \u2192 No, that's opposite.\n\nOption B: 2e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 Yes.\n\nOption C: 2e^{2J\u03b2} +6e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 No, exponents are wrong.\n\nOption D: 6e^{2J\u03b2} +2e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 No.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \\( Z \\) for a system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\). The energy of the system is given by \\( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \\), and the partition function is defined as \\( Z = \\sum_{\\text{all states}} e^{-\\beta E} \\), where \\( \\beta = 1/(kT) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Enumerate all possible states\nThere are \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) possible states for the three spins.

The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). \n\nWait, but each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states in total. I need to list all the possible combinations and calculate E for each. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without listing all of them.\n\nThe energy expression is -J times the sum of the products of each pair. So E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Since each S is either +1 or -1, each product S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. \n\nSo the sum can be 3 (all three products are +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), or -3 (all three products are -1). So the possible values of the sum are 3, 1, -1, -3. \n\nThen, E would be -J multiplied by these sums. So E can be:\n\n- For sum=3: E = -J*(3) = -3J\n- Sum=1: E = -J*(1) = -J\n- Sum=-1: E = -J*(-1) = J\n- Sum=-3: E = -J*(-3) = 3J\n\nWait, but how many states correspond to each of these sums? Because the number of states with a particular sum will affect the partition function.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases.\n\nCase 1: All three products are +1. That would mean S1S2=1, S1S3=1, and S2S3=1.\n\nEach product being 1 implies that the spins are aligned. So S1=S2, S2=S3, so S1=S3. So all three spins are the same. So S1=S2=S3=+1 or all -1. So there are two such states.\n\nIn this case, the sum is 3, so E=-3J. So the contribution to Z from these two states is 2 * exp(\u03b2 * 3J) because E is -3J, so -\u03b2E is 3J\u03b2. So exponential is e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nWait, no: Z is sum of exp(-\u03b2E). Wait, no, the partition function is sum_{states} exp( - \u03b2 E ). So for E = -3J, exp( - \u03b2 (-3J) ) = exp(3J\u03b2). So each of these two states contributes e^{3J\u03b2}, so total 2 e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nCase 2: Sum =1. So two products are +1, and one is -1. Let's see how that can happen.\n\nEach product is S_i S_j. So for example, S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, and S2S3=-1.\n\nWait, if S1S2=1 and S1S3=1, then S2 = S1 and S3=S1. So S2 and S3 are both S1. Then S2S3 = S1^2 =1. But we need S2S3=-1. That's a contradiction. So this combination can't happen. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the number of ways the sum can be 1. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the number of states where the sum is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about all possible spin configurations and count how many of them lead to each sum.\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1, so 8 states:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nNow, for each state, compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\n1. All +1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 \u2192 sum=3.\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\n   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum=1-1-1 = -1. Wait no: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:\n   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum= -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:\n   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1 \u2192 sum= -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:\n   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 \u2192 sum= -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\n   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum= -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:\n   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum= 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n8. All -1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 \u2192 sum=3.\n\nWait, so state 1 and 8 have sum 3. The rest (states 2-7) have sum -1? No, wait, in state 2, the sum is -1.\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me recompute state 2:\n\nState 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (+1)(+1) = 1.\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS2S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nSo sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nSimilarly, state 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2= (-1), S1S3= (+1), S2S3= (-1). Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nState 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2= (-1), S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (+1). Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nState 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2= (-1), S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (+1). Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nState 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2= (-1), S1S3= (+1), S2S3= (-1). Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nState7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (-1). Sum:1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nWait, so states 1 and 8 have sum 3, and all others have sum -1. So there are 2 states with sum 3, and 6 states with sum -1. But wait, that can't be right. Because when sum is 3, energy is -3J, and when sum is -1, energy is J.\n\nWait, but according to our initial analysis, the sum could be 3, 1, -1, or -3. But in our analysis, the sum is either 3 or -1. So where are the states with sum 1 or -3?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider another approach. For three spins, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be written in terms of the total spin. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1\u00b2 + S2\u00b2 + S3\u00b2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S is either +1 or -1, S_i\u00b2 =1. So (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me rearrange:\n\nS1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ] / 2.\n\nSo the sum can be (m\u00b2 -3)/2, where m is S1+S2+S3.\n\nBut m can be -3, -1, +1, +3.\n\nSo when m=3, sum is (9-3)/2 =3.\n\nWhen m=1, sum is (1-3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nWhen m=-1, sum is (1-3)/2 = -1.\n\nWhen m=-3, sum is (9-3)/2=3.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So m=3 and m=-3 give sum 3. m=1 and m=-1 give sum -1.\n\nSo each state's sum is either 3 or -1, depending on whether m is 3 or -3 (sum 3) or m is 1 or -1 (sum -1). So the sum can only be 3 or -1. So earlier assumption about sum being 1 or -3 was incorrect. So the sum can't be 1 or -3. So the possible energies are E = -J*(3) = -3J and E = -J*(-1)= J.\n\nSo the number of states with sum 3 is the number of states where m=3 or m=-3. How many such states are there?\n\nm=3: all spins up \u2192 S1=1, S2=1, S3=1 \u2192 only 1 state.\n\nm=-3: all spins down \u2192 S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1 \u2192 another state. So 2 states with sum 3.\n\nThe other 6 states have m=1 or m=-1, so their sum is -1, so E= J.\n\nSo, for each state, the energy is either -3J (2 states) or J (6 states).\n\nSo the partition function Z is sum of exp(-\u03b2 E) for each state.\n\nSo Z = [2 * exp(3J\u03b2)] + [6 * exp(-J\u03b2)].\n\nWait, let me check: for E = -3J, exp(-\u03b2 E) is exp(3J\u03b2) multiplied by 2 (since two states). For E= J, exp(-\u03b2 E) is exp(-J\u03b2), multiplied by 6 (six states).\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3J\u03b2} + 6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2) +6 e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches this.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the options.\n\nOption A: 2 e^{-3J\u03b2} +6 e^{J\u03b2} \u2192 no.\n\nOption B: 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 yes.\n\nOption C: 2 e^{2J\u03b2} +6 e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 no.\n\nOption D: 6 e^{2J\u03b2} +2 e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 no.\n\nSo the correct option should be B.\n",

So each of these two states contributes e^{3J\u03b2}, so total 2 e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nCase 2: Sum =1. So two products are +1, and one is -1. Let's see how that can happen.\n\nEach product is S_i S_j. So for example, S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, and S2S3=-1.\n\nWait, if S1S2=1 and S1S3=1, then S2 = S1 and S3=S1. So S2 and S3 are both S1. Then S2S3 = S1^2 =1. But we need S2S3=-1. That's a contradiction. So this combination can't happen. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the number of ways the sum can be 1. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the number of states where the sum is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about all possible spin configurations and count how many of them lead to each sum.\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1, so 8 states:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nNow, for each state, compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\n1. All +1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 \u2192 sum=3.\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\n   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum=1-1-1 = -1. Wait no: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:\n   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum= -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:\n   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1 \u2192 sum= -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:\n   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 \u2192 sum= -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\n   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum= -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:\n   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum= 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n8. All -1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 \u2192 sum=3.\n\nWait, so state 1 and 8 have sum 3. The rest (states 2-7) have sum -1? No, wait, in state 2, the sum is -1.\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me recompute state 2:\n\nState 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (+1)(+1) = 1.\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS2S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nSo sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nSimilarly, state 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2= (-1), S1S3= (+1), S2S3= (-1). Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nState 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2= (-1), S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (+1). Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nState 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2= (-1), S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (+1). Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nState 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2= (-1), S1S3= (+1), S2S3= (-1). Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nState7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (-1). Sum:1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nWait, so states 1 and 8 have sum 3, and all others have sum -1. So there are 2 states with sum 3, and 6 states with sum -1. But wait, that can't be right. Because when sum is 3, energy is -3J, and when sum is -1, energy is J.\n\nWait, but according to our initial analysis, the sum could be 3, 1, -1, or -3. But in our analysis, the sum is either 3 or -1. So where are the states with sum 1 or -3?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider another approach. For three spins, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be written in terms of the total spin. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1\u00b2 + S2\u00b2 + S3\u00b2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S is either +1 or -1, S_i\u00b2 =1. So (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me rearrange:\n\nS1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ] / 2.\n\nSo the sum can be (m\u00b2 -3)/2, where m is S1+S2+S3.\n\nBut m can be -3, -1, +1, +3.\n\nSo when m=3, sum is (9-3)/2 =3.\n\nWhen m=1, sum is (1-3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nWhen m=-1, sum is (1-3)/2 = -1.\n\nWhen m=-3, sum is (9-3)/2=3.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So m=3 and m=-3 give sum 3. m=1 and m=-1 give sum -1.\n\nSo each state's sum is either 3 or -1, depending on whether m is 3 or -3 (sum 3) or m is 1 or -1 (sum -1). So the sum can only be 3 or -1. So earlier assumption about sum being 1 or -3 was incorrect. So the sum can't be 1 or -3. So the possible energies are E = -J*(3) = -3J and E = -J*(-1)= J.\n\nSo the number of states with sum 3 is the number of states where m=3 or m=-3. How many such states are there?\n\nm=3: all spins up \u2192 S1=1, S2=1, S3=1 \u2192 only 1 state.\n\nm=-3: all spins down \u2192 S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1 \u2192 another state. So 2 states with sum 3.\n\nThe other 6 states have m=1 or m=-1, so their sum is -1, so E= J.\n\nSo, for each state, the energy is either -3J (2 states) or J (6 states).\n\nSo the partition function Z is sum of exp(-\u03b2 E) for each state.\n\nSo Z = [2 * exp(3J\u03b2)] + [6 * exp(-J\u03b2)].\n\nWait, let me check: for E = -3J, exp(-\u03b2 E) is exp(3J\u03b2) multiplied by 2 (since two states). For E= J, exp(-\u03b2 E) is exp(-J\u03b2), multiplied by 6 (six states).\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3J\u03b2} + 6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2) +6 e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches this.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the options.\n\nOption A: 2 e^{-3J\u03b2} +6 e^{J\u03b2} \u2192 no.\n\nOption B: 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 yes.\n\nOption C: 2 e^{2J\u03b2} +6 e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 no.\n\nOption D: 6 e^{2J\u03b2} +2 e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 no.\n\nSo the correct option should be B.\n\n\nTo find the partition function \\( Z \\) for the system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\), we start with the energy expression:\n\n\\[\nE = -J \\left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \\right).\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Possible Energy Values\nThe sum \\( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \\) can take the values \\( 3, 1, -1, -3 \\), depending on the alignment of the spins. However, upon analyzing all possible spin configurations, it is found that the sum can only be \\( 3 \\) or \\( -1 \\). This is because:\n\n- If all spins are aligned (\\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 \\)), the sum is \\( 3 \\).\n- For all other configurations, the sum is \\( -1 \\).\n\nThus, the possible energy values are:\n\n\\[\nE = -J \\cdot 3 = -3J \\quad \\text{(for sum = 3)},\n\\]\n\\[\nE = -J \\cdot (-1) = J \\quad \\text{(for sum = -1)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Number of States for Each Energy\n- There are **2 states** with \\( E = -3J \\) (all spins aligned: \\( +1, +1, +1 \\) or \\( -1, -1, -1 \\)).\n- There are **6 states** with \\( E = J \\) (all other configurations).\n\n### Step 3: Partition Function\nThe partition function \\( Z \\) is the sum over all states of \\( \\exp(-\\beta E) \\), where \\( \\beta = 1/(kT) \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, let's try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nSo the setup is that there are three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [ S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 ]. I need to find the partition function Z.\n\nWait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), where beta is 1/(kT). Right, but since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states for the system. Oh wait, no, wait\u2014no, each spin has two states, so three spins would indeed have 8 possible configurations. But wait, maybe I can find a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the possible values of the energy and their multiplicities, then compute the sum accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the energy expression. E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 ). Let me denote the sum S = S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3. So E = -J * S.\n\nSo the energy depends on the sum S. So I need to find all possible values of S and how many times each occurs.\n\nEach term in S is the product of two spins. Since each spin is \u00b11, each product term (like S1 S2) will be either +1 or -1.\n\nWait, let's compute S for all possible states. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, think about the possible values of S. Let's see: each term in S is \u00b11, so S can range from 3 (all +1) to -3 (all -1) in steps of 2. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nEach term is S_i S_j, which is +1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 otherwise. So each term is either +1 or -1. So the sum S is the sum of three terms, each \u00b11. So S can be 3, 1, -1, -3. Wait, because 3*(1)=3, 1+1-1=1, etc.\n\nWait, let me compute possible values of S. Let's consider all possible combinations.\n\nBut perhaps a smarter approach is to note that S can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.\n\nWait, but wait: Let me compute S for all possible states. For three spins, each being +1 or -1.\n\nBut that's a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry here.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the possible values of S. Let me think:\n\nThe sum S = S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3.\n\nLet me consider each term:\n\nEach term S_i S_j is 1 if S_i and S_j are the same, -1 otherwise.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find the number of states where S is 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note that S can take values 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: All three spins are the same. So S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or all = -1.\n\nIn this case, S1 S2 = +1, S1 S3 = +1, S2 S3 = +1. So S = 3.\n\nSimilarly, if all are -1: each product is (+1), so sum S = 3.\n\nSo how many states have S=3? Well, there are two such states: all +1 and all -1.\n\nSo for S=3, multiplicity is 2.\n\nCase 2: Two spins are the same, one different. Let's say S1 and S2 are +1, S3 is -1.\n\nThen S1 S2 = +1, S1 S3 = -1, S2 S3 = -1. So S = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, so in this case S is -1.\n\nWait, but wait, how many such states are there where exactly two are the same and one is different? Let's see.\n\nEach spin can be the one that's different. So for each spin, there are two possibilities (since the majority could be +1 or -1). Wait, perhaps more precisely:\n\nFor each spin, you can choose whether it's the one that's different. For example, S1 is different, S2 and S3 are same. But the same applies for S2 and S3.\n\nSo for each choice of which spin is different, there are two possibilities: the different spin is +1 or -1, but wait, no: wait, the majority is either +1 or -1. Hmm, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, when two spins are the same and one is different, there are three possibilities for which spin is different. For each of these, the two possibilities for the majority spin (+1 or -1). So each case has 2 possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of states where exactly two spins are same and one different is 3 * 2 * 1? No, wait, no, perhaps it's 3 * 2.\n\nWait, for each of the three spins, it can be the one that's different. For each choice, the majority can be +1 or -1. So for each spin, 2 possibilities, so 3 * 2 =6 states.\n\nWait, but in each of these states, what's the value of S?\n\nIn the example I did earlier, when two are +1 and one is -1, S was -1. Wait, let me recheck that.\n\nWait, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nSo S1 S2 = +1, S1 S3 = -1, S2 S3 = -1. So sum S = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, if two are -1 and one is +1, what happens?\n\nS1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1 S2 = (+1), S1 S3 = (-1), S2 S3 = (-1). So sum S= 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, so in both cases where two are same and one different, S is -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So for all 6 states where two are same and one different, S is -1.\n\nSo the sum S is -1 in these cases. So the multiplicity for S=-1 is 6.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014could there be any other states where S is 1?\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose I have S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: S=3.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S=1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nS1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S = (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait another example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1 S2 = (-1), S1 S3 = (-1), S2 S3 = (+1). So sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nWait, so all cases where exactly two are same and one different give S=-1.\n\nWait, but what about when all three spins are different? Wait, but each spin can only be +1 or -1. So for three spins, the only possibilities are all same, two same and one different, or all different? Wait, but three spins can't all be different because you can only have two states per spin. So, for three spins, the possibilities are either all same, or exactly two same and one different. There's no case where all three are different, because each spin is binary.\n\nWait, so the possible values of S are 3 and -1. Because when all same, S=3; when two same and one different, S=-1. Hmm.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that S could be 1 or -3 as well. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let's consider another possibility: what if all three spins are different? Wait, but since each spin can only be +1 or -1, for three spins, having all different isn't possible because you can't have three different states with two options. So that's impossible. So the only possible S values are 3 and -1, with multiplicities 2 and 6, respectively.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I think about the sum S, it's the sum of three terms, each of which is \u00b11. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier analysis, in all possible states, S is either 3 or -1. So perhaps I'm missing some cases.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of S for some states.\n\nLet me take another example. Let me pick S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nThen S1 S2 = -1, S1 S3 = +1, S2 S3 = -1.\n\nSo sum S = (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nAnother example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1 S2 = -1, S1 S3 = -1, S2 S3 = +1. Sum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nHmm. So all cases with two same and one different lead to S=-1.\n\nWait, but what about if two spins are opposite, and the third is also opposite. Wait, perhaps I'm not considering a case where S could be +1 or -3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of all possible states and compute S for each.\n\nThere are 8 possible states:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS = 3.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) ?\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, S1 S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS1 S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1.\n\nS2 S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nSo sum S = -1 + 1 -1 = -1.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1 S2 = -1, S1 S3 = -1, S2 S3 = +1.\n\nSum S = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1 S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS1 S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS2 S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1.\n\nSum S = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1 S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS1 S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1.\n\nS2 S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nSum S = (-1) + 1 -1 = -1.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1 S2 = (+1).\n\nS1 S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS2 S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nSum S = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS = 3.\n\nWait a second! So in all 8 states, S is either 3 (for two states) or -1 (for six states).\n\nSo S can only take two values: 3 and -1.\n\nSo the possible energies are E = -J * S.\n\nSo when S=3, E = -3 J.\n\nWhen S=-1, E = J.\n\nWait, because E = -J * S. So if S=3, E= -3 J. If S=-1, E= J.\n\nSo each state contributes exp( -beta E ) to the partition function.\n\nSo for each state, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -beta * E ).\n\nSo for the two states where S=3, E=-3J, so the Boltzmann factor is exp( -beta*(-3J) ) = exp(3 beta J).\n\nEach of these two states contributes exp(3 beta J), so together that's 2 exp(3 beta J).\n\nFor the six states where S=-1, E= J, so Boltzmann factor is exp( -beta * J ), which is exp(-beta J).\n\nEach of these six states contributes exp(-beta J), so together that's 6 exp(-beta J).\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum of these contributions:\n\nZ = 2 e^(3 J beta) + 6 e^(-J beta).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 2 e^(-3 J beta) + 6 e^(J beta). Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me double-check.\n\nE = -J * S.\n\nSo when S=3, E = -J * 3 = -3 J.\n\nThen the Boltzmann factor is exp( -beta E ) = exp( -beta (-3 J) ) = exp(3 beta J).\n\nSimilarly, when S=-1, E = (-J)(-1) = J.\n\nSo the Boltzmann factor is exp( -beta * J ), which is e^(-beta J).\n\nSo the two terms are 2 e^{3 J beta} and 6 e^{-J beta}, so Z = 2 e^{3 J beta} +6 e^{-J beta}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: 2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^(J\u03b2)\n\nOption B: 2 e^(3J\u03b2) +6 e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nYes, so option B is the correct partition function.\n\nWait, but wait, the options presented are:\n\nA) Z=2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2)\n\nB) Z=2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nD) Z=6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nSo the correct answer would be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, let's try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nSo the setup is that there are three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [ S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 ]. I need to find the partition function Z.\n\nWait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), where beta is 1/(kT). Right, but since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states for the system. Oh wait, no, wait\u2014no, each spin has two states, so three spins would indeed have 8 possible configurations. But wait, maybe I can find a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the possible values of the energy and their multiplicities, then compute the sum accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the energy expression. E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 ). Let me denote the sum S = S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3. So E = -J * S.\n\nSo the energy depends on the sum S. So I need to find all possible values of S and how many times each occurs.\n\nEach term in S is the product of two spins. Since each spin is \u00b11, each product term (like S1 S2) will be either +1 or -1.\n\nWait, let's compute S for all possible states. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, think about the possible values of S. Let's see: each term in S is \u00b11, so S can range from 3 (all +1) to -3 (all -1) in steps of 2. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nEach term is S_i S_j, which is +1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 otherwise. So each term is either +1 or -1. So the sum S is the sum of three terms, each \u00b11. So S can be 3, 1, -1, -3. Wait, because 3*(1)=3, 1+1-1=1, etc.\n\nWait, let me compute possible values of S. Let's consider all possible combinations.\n\nBut perhaps a smarter approach is to note that S can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.\n\nWait, but wait: Let me compute S for all possible states. For three spins, each being +1 or -1.\n\nBut that's a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry here.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the possible values of S. Let me think:\n\nThe sum S = S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3.\n\nLet me consider each term:\n\nEach term S_i S_j is 1 if S_i and S_j are the same, -1 otherwise.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find the number of states where S is 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note that S can take values 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: All three spins are the same. So S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or all = -1.\n\nIn this case, S1 S2 = +1, S1 S3 = +1, S2 S3 = +1. So S = 3.\n\nSimilarly, if all are -1: each product is (+1), so sum S = 3.\n\nSo how many states have S=3? Well, there are two such states: all +1 and all -1.\n\nSo for S=3, multiplicity is 2.\n\nCase 2: Two spins are the same, one different. Let's say S1 and S2 are +1, S3 is -1.\n\nThen S1 S2 = +1, S1 S3 = -1, S2 S3 = -1. So S = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, so in this case S is -1.\n\nWait, but wait, how many such states are there where exactly two are the same and one is different? Let's see.\n\nEach spin can be the one that's different. So for each spin, there are two possibilities (since the majority could be +1 or -1). Wait, perhaps more precisely:\n\nFor each spin, you can choose whether it's the one that's different. For example, S1 is different, S2 and S3 are same. But the same applies for S2 and S3.\n\nSo for each choice of which spin is different, there are two possibilities: the different spin is +1 or -1, but wait, no: wait, the majority is either +1 or -1. Hmm, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, when two spins are the same and one is different, there are three possibilities for which spin is different. For each of these, the two possibilities for the majority spin (+1 or -1). So each case has 2 possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of states where exactly two spins are same and one different is 3 * 2 * 1? No, wait, no, perhaps it's 3 * 2.\n\nWait, for each of the three spins, it can be the one that's different. For each choice, the majority can be +1 or -1. So for each spin, 2 possibilities, so 3 * 2 =6 states.\n\nWait, but in each of these states, what's the value of S?\n\nIn the example I did earlier, when two are +1 and one is -1, S was -1. Wait, let me recheck that.\n\nWait, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nSo S1 S2 = +1, S1 S3 = -1, S2 S3 = -1. So sum S = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, if two are -1 and one is +1, what happens?\n\nS1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1 S2 = (+1), S1 S3 = (-1), S2 S3 = (-1). So sum S= 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, so in both cases where two are same and one different, S is -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So for all 6 states where two are same and one different, S is -1.\n\nSo the sum S is -1 in these cases. So the multiplicity for S=-1 is 6.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014could there be any other states where S is 1?\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose I have S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: S=3.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S=1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nS1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S = (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait another example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1 S2 = (-1), S1 S3 = (-1), S2 S3 = (+1). So sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nWait, so all cases where exactly two are same and one different give S=-1.\n\nWait, but what about when all three spins are different? Wait, but each spin can only be +1 or -1. So for three spins, the only possibilities are all same, two same and one different, or all different? Wait, but three spins can't all be different because you can only have two states per spin. So, for three spins, the possibilities are either all same, or exactly two same and one different. There's no case where all three are different, because each spin is binary.\n\nWait, so the possible values of S are 3 and -1. Because when all same, S=3; when two same and one different, S=-1. Hmm.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that S could be 1 or -3 as well. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let's consider another possibility: what if all three spins are different? Wait, but since each spin can only be +1 or -1, for three spins, having all different isn't possible because you can't have three different states with two options. So that's impossible. So the only possible S values are 3 and -1, with multiplicities 2 and 6, respectively.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I think about the sum S, it's the sum of three terms, each of which is \u00b11. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier analysis, in all possible states, S is either 3 or -1. So perhaps I'm missing some cases.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of S for some states.\n\nLet me take another example. Let me pick S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nThen S1 S2 = -1, S1 S3 = +1, S2 S3 = -1.\n\nSo sum S = (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nAnother example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1 S2 = -1, S1 S3 = -1, S2 S3 = +1. Sum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nHmm. So all cases with two same and one different lead to S=-1.\n\nWait, but what about if two spins are opposite, and the third is also opposite. Wait, perhaps I'm not considering a case where S could be +1 or -3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of all possible states and compute S for each.\n\nThere are 8 possible states:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS = 3.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) ?\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, S1 S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS1 S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1.\n\nS2 S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nSo sum S = -1 + 1 -1 = -1.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1 S2 = -1, S1 S3 = -1, S2 S3 = +1.\n\nSum S = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1 S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS1 S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS2 S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1.\n\nSum S = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1 S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS1 S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1.\n\nS2 S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nSum S = (-1) + 1 -1 = -1.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1 S2 = (+1).\n\nS1 S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS2 S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nSum S = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS = 3.\n\nWait a second! So in all 8 states, S is either 3 (for two states) or -1 (for six states).\n\nSo S can only take two values: 3 and -1.\n\nSo the possible energies are E = -J * S.\n\nSo when S=3, E = -3 J.\n\nWhen S=-1, E = J.\n\nWait, because E = -J * S. So if S=3, E= -3 J. If S=-1, E= J.\n\nSo each state contributes exp( -beta E ) to the partition function.\n\nSo for each state, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -beta * E ).\n\nSo for the two states where S=3, E=-3J, so the Boltzmann factor is exp( -beta*(-3J) ) = exp(3 beta J).\n\nEach of these two states contributes exp(3 beta J), so together that's 2 exp(3 beta J).\n\nFor the six states where S=-1, E= J, so Boltzmann factor is exp( -beta * J ), which is exp(-beta J).\n\nEach of these six states contributes exp(-beta J), so together that's 6 exp(-beta J).\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum of these contributions:\n\nZ = 2 e^(3 J beta) + 6 e^(-J beta).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 2 e^(-3 J beta) + 6 e^(J beta). Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me double-check.\n\nE = -J * S.\n\nSo when S=3, E = -J * 3 = -3 J.\n\nThen the Boltzmann factor is exp( -beta E ) = exp( -beta (-3 J) ) = exp(3 beta J).\n\nSimilarly, when S=-1, E = (-J)(-1) = J.\n\nSo the Boltzmann factor is exp( -beta * J ), which is e^(-beta J).\n\nSo the two terms are 2 e^{3 J beta} and 6 e^{-J beta}, so Z = 2 e^{3 J beta} +6 e^{-J beta}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: 2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^(J\u03b2)\n\nOption B: 2 e^(3J\u03b2) +6 e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nYes, so option B is the correct partition function.\n\nWait, but wait, the options presented are:\n\nA) Z=2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2)\n\nB) Z=2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nD) Z=6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nSo the correct answer would be option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \\( Z \\) for a system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factors, which is e^(-\u03b2E), where E is the energy of each state. \n\nThe system has three spins: S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. So each spin has two possible states. The total number of possible states for the system should be 2^3 =8, right? Wait, but maybe I should double-check that. Because each spin is independent, yeah, so 2 options each, multiplied together: 2*2*2=8 states.\n\nThe energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Oh wait, J is a coupling constant. So the energy depends on the product of each pair of spins. Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are the same or opposite. \n\nI think I should first figure out all the possible states and calculate their energies, then compute the partition function by summing e^(-\u03b2E) for each state. But wait, that might take a while, but maybe I can find a smarter way by grouping states with the same energy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me denote this sum as H, so E = -J H. So H can take different values, and each value corresponds to a certain number of states. Then, the partition function Z would be the sum over all possible H of (number of states with that H) multiplied by e^{\u03b2 J H}.\n\nWait, because E = -J H, so -\u03b2E = \u03b2 J H. So each state contributes e^{\u03b2 J H}.\n\nSo I need to find all possible H values and how many states correspond to each H.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of H. Each term S_i S_j is \u00b11. So each of the three terms (S1S2, S1S3, S2S3) is either +1 or -1. So H is the sum of three terms each \u00b11. So the possible values of H can range from -3 to +3, in steps of 2. Because each term contributes either +1 or -1, so the sum can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), or -3 (all -1). Wait, no, wait: 3, 1, -1, -3. Are these all possible?\n\nWait, let me think again. For three terms, each \u00b11:\n\nThe maximum sum is 3 (all +1). The minimum is -3 (all -1). What about in between? Let's see:\n\nIf two are +1 and one is -1: 2*1 + (-1) = 1.\n\nIf one is +1 and two are -1: 1 + 2*(-1) = -1.\n\nSo the possible H values are 3, 1, -1, -3. So four possible H values.\n\nWait, but wait: let me make sure. Let's think of all possible combinations. Maybe I can list all the possible H values and how many states give each.\n\nBut wait, each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 each being \u00b11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the number of states for each H.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me compute H for all possible 8 states.\n\nBut that's manageable because 8 is small.\n\nEach state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3) where each S is \u00b11.\n\nSo let's list all 8:\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1)\nH = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3\n= (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 =3.\n\n2. (+1, +1, -1)\nH = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n3. (+1, -1, +1)\nH= (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\n4. (+1, -1, -1)\nH= (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, state 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(-1)= +1.\n\nSo H = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.\n\nSo state 4 gives H=-1.\n\n5. (-1, +1, +1)\nH = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = -1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\n6. (-1, +1, -1)\nH = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 =-1.\n\n7. (-1, -1, +1)\nH = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = 1 -1 -1 =-1.\n\n8. (-1, -1, -1)\nH = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) =1 +1 +1=3.\n\nWait, so let me count how many states give each H.\n\nLooking at the 8 states:\n\nH=3 occurs in states 1 and 8: so two states.\n\nH=-1 occurs in states 2,3,4,5,6,7: that's six states.\n\nWait, what about H=1 and H=-3? Did I miss any?\n\nWait, looking again: did any state have H=1 or H=-3?\n\nWait, in my list, all the H values for the 8 states are either 3 or -1. Hmmm. So that can't be right because earlier I thought H could be 3,1,-1,-3.\n\nBut according to this, the only H values are 3 and -1.\n\nWait, that's odd. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating H for some states.\n\nLet me recompute H for state 2.\n\nState 2: (+1, +1, -1)\n\nS1S2=1*1=1.\n\nS1S3=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nS2S3=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nSo H=1 -1 -1 = -1. Correct.\n\nState3: (+1, -1, +1)\n\nS1S2=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nS1S3=1*1=1.\n\nS2S3=(-1)*1=-1.\n\nSo H= -1 +1 -1 =-1. Correct.\n\nState4: (+1, -1, -1)\n\nS1S2=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nS1S3=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nS2S3=(-1)*(-1)=1.\n\nH= -1 -1 +1 =-1. Correct.\n\nState5: (-1, +1, +1)\n\nS1S2= (-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nS2S3= (+1)(+1)=1.\n\nH= -1 -1 +1 =-1. Correct.\n\nState6: (-1, +1, -1)\n\nS1S2= (-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(-1)=+1.\n\nS2S3= (+1)(-1)=-1.\n\nH= -1 +1 -1 =-1. Correct.\n\nState7: (-1, -1, +1)\n\nS1S2= (-1)(-1)=1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nS2S3= (-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nH=1 -1 -1 =-1. Correct.\n\nSo all the states except 1 and 8 have H=-1. So only two states have H=3, and six have H=-1. So I guess I was wrong earlier when I thought H could be 1 or -3. It seems that for three spins, the possible H is only 3 and -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps because the number of terms is three, and each term is \u00b11, so the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3. But in our case, perhaps the symmetry is such that only even numbers of +1 and -1 in the terms? Or perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the possible combinations.\n\nWait, for three terms (each \u00b11), the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.\n\nBut in our case, when all three are +1, sum is 3. When two are +1 and one -1, sum is 1. When one +1 and two -1, sum is -1. When all three are -1, sum is -3.\n\nBut in the calculation, the states gave only H=3 and H=-1.\n\nSo where are the H=1 and H=-3 states?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Let's think of another state. Suppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: H=3.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: H=1+ (-1)+ (-1) =-1.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: H= (-1) + (+1) + (-1) =-1.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1: H= (-1) + (-1) + (+1) =-1.\n\nWait, so the states where two of the products are +1 and one is -1 give H=1?\n\nWait, no, in the state S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1-1-1= -1.\n\nAh, so that state gives H=-1.\n\nWait, what about a state where two products are +1 and one is -1.\n\nWait, is that possible? Let's see: suppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: all products are +1. H=3.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: product terms are 1, -1, -1. Sum is -1.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: product terms are -1, 1, -1. Sum is -1.\n\nAnother case: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1: product terms are -1, -1, 1. Sum is -1.\n\nWait, so all the states with two +1 and one -1 in the products give H=-1.\n\nHmm, what about a state where two products are -1 and one is +1.\n\nWait, that would be H= -1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not getting any H=1 or H=-3. So perhaps in this system, H can only take 3 and -1.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Because for three variables, each \u00b11, the sum can vary. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider different configurations.\n\nWait, let me think of a state where two of the S_i S_j terms are +1 and one is -1. That would sum to 1. But in our calculation, all such cases gave H=-1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the possible H values are only 3 and -1 because of the way the spins are arranged.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the possible H for each state.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of the H as the sum of all three pairwise products. Let me consider the possible values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry here. Let me think: for three spins, the sum S1 + S2 + S3 can be something, but that's a different approach. But in this problem, the energy depends on the sum of the products, not the sum of the spins.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the sum H as S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me see if this can be expressed in terms of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 or something else.\n\nBecause S1^2 =1, same for S2 and S3. So (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = 3 + 2H.\n\nSo H = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 -3 ] / 2.\n\nHmm, that's an interesting relation. So H depends on the square of the sum of spins.\n\nNow, the sum S1 + S2 + S3 can be any integer from -3 to +3, but in steps of 2. Because each S is \u00b11, so the sum is odd or even? Let's see: 3 is odd, 1 is odd, -1 is odd, -3 is odd. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for three spins, each \u00b11, the sum can be:\n\nAll +1: sum is 3.\n\nTwo +1 and one -1: sum is 1.\n\nOne +1 and two -1: sum is -1.\n\nAll -1: sum is -3.\n\nSo possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nSo then, the square of the sum is 9, 1, 1, 9.\n\nSo H would be (9 -3)/2 =3, (1-3)/2 =-1, etc.\n\nSo for sum S=3, H=(9-3)/2=3.\n\nFor sum S=1, H=(1-3)/2=-1.\n\nFor sum S=-1, H=(1-3)/2=-1.\n\nFor sum S=-3, H=(9-3)/2=3.\n\nSo H can only be 3 or -1, depending on whether the sum S is 3 or \u00b11 or -3.\n\nSo this means that for our system, the possible H values are 3 and -1.\n\nSo that matches what we saw earlier when we calculated the H for each state: only H=3 and H=-1.\n\nSo, going back, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{\u03b2 J H}.\n\nBut since all states with H=3 contribute e^{\u03b2 J *3}, and those with H=-1 contribute e^{\u03b2 J * (-1)}.\n\nSo the number of states with H=3 is 2 (states 1 and 8), and the number with H=-1 is 6.\n\nSo Z = 2 * e^{3 \u03b2 J} + 6 * e^{-1 \u03b2 J}.\n\nSo Z= 2 e^{3 J \u03b2} +6 e^{-J \u03b2}.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option A is Z=2 e^{-3 J \u03b2} +6 e^{J \u03b2}.\n\nOption B is Z=2 e^{3 J \u03b2} +6 e^{-J \u03b2}.\n\nWhich matches our calculation.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factors, which is e^(-\u03b2E), where E is the energy of each state. \n\nThe system has three spins: S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. So each spin has two possible states. The total number of possible states for the system should be 2^3 =8, right? Wait, but maybe I should double-check that. Because each spin is independent, yeah, so 2 options each, multiplied together: 2*2*2=8 states.\n\nThe energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Oh wait, J is a coupling constant. So the energy depends on the product of each pair of spins. Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are the same or opposite. \n\nI think I should first figure out all the possible states and calculate their energies, then compute the partition function by summing e^(-\u03b2E) for each state. But wait, that might take a while, but maybe I can find a smarter way by grouping states with the same energy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me denote this sum as H, so E = -J H. So H can take different values, and each value corresponds to a certain number of states. Then, the partition function Z would be the sum over all possible H of (number of states with that H) multiplied by e^{\u03b2 J H}.\n\nWait, because E = -J H, so -\u03b2E = \u03b2 J H. So each state contributes e^{\u03b2 J H}.\n\nSo I need to find all possible H values and how many states correspond to each H.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of H. Each term S_i S_j is \u00b11. So each of the three terms (S1S2, S1S3, S2S3) is either +1 or -1. So H is the sum of three terms each \u00b11. So the possible values of H can range from -3 to +3, in steps of 2. Because each term contributes either +1 or -1, so the sum can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), or -3 (all -1). Wait, no, wait: 3, 1, -1, -3. Are these all possible?\n\nWait, let me think again. For three terms, each \u00b11:\n\nThe maximum sum is 3 (all +1). The minimum is -3 (all -1). What about in between? Let's see:\n\nIf two are +1 and one is -1: 2*1 + (-1) = 1.\n\nIf one is +1 and two are -1: 1 + 2*(-1) = -1.\n\nSo the possible H values are 3, 1, -1, -3. So four possible H values.\n\nWait, but wait: let me make sure. Let's think of all possible combinations. Maybe I can list all the possible H values and how many states give each.\n\nBut wait, each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 each being \u00b11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the number of states for each H.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me compute H for all possible 8 states.\n\nBut that's manageable because 8 is small.\n\nEach state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3) where each S is \u00b11.\n\nSo let's list all 8:\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1)\nH = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3\n= (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 =3.\n\n2. (+1, +1, -1)\nH = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n3. (+1, -1, +1)\nH= (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\n4. (+1, -1, -1)\nH= (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, state 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(-1)= +1.\n\nSo H = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.\n\nSo state 4 gives H=-1.\n\n5. (-1, +1, +1)\nH = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = -1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\n6. (-1, +1, -1)\nH = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 =-1.\n\n7. (-1, -1, +1)\nH = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = 1 -1 -1 =-1.\n\n8. (-1, -1, -1)\nH = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) =1 +1 +1=3.\n\nWait, so let me count how many states give each H.\n\nLooking at the 8 states:\n\nH=3 occurs in states 1 and 8: so two states.\n\nH=-1 occurs in states 2,3,4,5,6,7: that's six states.\n\nWait, what about H=1 and H=-3? Did I miss any?\n\nWait, looking again: did any state have H=1 or H=-3?\n\nWait, in my list, all the H values for the 8 states are either 3 or -1. Hmmm. So that can't be right because earlier I thought H could be 3,1,-1,-3.\n\nBut according to this, the only H values are 3 and -1.\n\nWait, that's odd. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating H for some states.\n\nLet me recompute H for state 2.\n\nState 2: (+1, +1, -1)\n\nS1S2=1*1=1.\n\nS1S3=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nS2S3=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nSo H=1 -1 -1 = -1. Correct.\n\nState3: (+1, -1, +1)\n\nS1S2=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nS1S3=1*1=1.\n\nS2S3=(-1)*1=-1.\n\nSo H= -1 +1 -1 =-1. Correct.\n\nState4: (+1, -1, -1)\n\nS1S2=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nS1S3=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nS2S3=(-1)*(-1)=1.\n\nH= -1 -1 +1 =-1. Correct.\n\nState5: (-1, +1, +1)\n\nS1S2= (-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nS2S3= (+1)(+1)=1.\n\nH= -1 -1 +1 =-1. Correct.\n\nState6: (-1, +1, -1)\n\nS1S2= (-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(-1)=+1.\n\nS2S3= (+1)(-1)=-1.\n\nH= -1 +1 -1 =-1. Correct.\n\nState7: (-1, -1, +1)\n\nS1S2= (-1)(-1)=1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nS2S3= (-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nH=1 -1 -1 =-1. Correct.\n\nSo all the states except 1 and 8 have H=-1. So only two states have H=3, and six have H=-1. So I guess I was wrong earlier when I thought H could be 1 or -3. It seems that for three spins, the possible H is only 3 and -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps because the number of terms is three, and each term is \u00b11, so the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3. But in our case, perhaps the symmetry is such that only even numbers of +1 and -1 in the terms? Or perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the possible combinations.\n\nWait, for three terms (each \u00b11), the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.\n\nBut in our case, when all three are +1, sum is 3. When two are +1 and one -1, sum is 1. When one +1 and two -1, sum is -1. When all three are -1, sum is -3.\n\nBut in the calculation, the states gave only H=3 and H=-1.\n\nSo where are the H=1 and H=-3 states?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Let's think of another state. Suppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: H=3.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: H=1+ (-1)+ (-1) =-1.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: H= (-1) + (+1) + (-1) =-1.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1: H= (-1) + (-1) + (+1) =-1.\n\nWait, so the states where two of the products are +1 and one is -1 give H=1?\n\nWait, no, in the state S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1-1-1= -1.\n\nAh, so that state gives H=-1.\n\nWait, what about a state where two products are +1 and one is -1.\n\nWait, is that possible? Let's see: suppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: all products are +1. H=3.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: product terms are 1, -1, -1. Sum is -1.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: product terms are -1, 1, -1. Sum is -1.\n\nAnother case: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1: product terms are -1, -1, 1. Sum is -1.\n\nWait, so all the states with two +1 and one -1 in the products give H=-1.\n\nHmm, what about a state where two products are -1 and one is +1.\n\nWait, that would be H= -1 -1 +1 =-1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not getting any H=1 or H=-3. So perhaps in this system, H can only take 3 and -1.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Because for three variables, each \u00b11, the sum can vary. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider different configurations.\n\nWait, let me think of a state where two of the S_i S_j terms are +1 and one is -1. That would sum to 1. But in our calculation, all such cases gave H=-1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the possible H values are only 3 and -1 because of the way the spins are arranged.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the possible H for each state.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of the H as the sum of all three pairwise products. Let me consider the possible values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry here. Let me think: for three spins, the sum S1 + S2 + S3 can be something, but that's a different approach. But in this problem, the energy depends on the sum of the products, not the sum of the spins.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the sum H as S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me see if this can be expressed in terms of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 or something else.\n\nBecause S1^2 =1, same for S2 and S3. So (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = 3 + 2H.\n\nSo H = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 -3 ] / 2.\n\nHmm, that's an interesting relation. So H depends on the square of the sum of spins.\n\nNow, the sum S1 + S2 + S3 can be any integer from -3 to +3, but in steps of 2. Because each S is \u00b11, so the sum is odd or even? Let's see: 3 is odd, 1 is odd, -1 is odd, -3 is odd. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for three spins, each \u00b11, the sum can be:\n\nAll +1: sum is 3.\n\nTwo +1 and one -1: sum is 1.\n\nOne +1 and two -1: sum is -1.\n\nAll -1: sum is -3.\n\nSo possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nSo then, the square of the sum is 9, 1, 1, 9.\n\nSo H would be (9 -3)/2 =3, (1-3)/2 =-1, etc.\n\nSo for sum S=3, H=(9-3)/2=3.\n\nFor sum S=1, H=(1-3)/2=-1.\n\nFor sum S=-1, H=(1-3)/2=-1.\n\nFor sum S=-3, H=(9-3)/2=3.\n\nSo H can only be 3 or -1, depending on whether the sum S is 3 or \u00b11 or -3.\n\nSo this means that for our system, the possible H values are 3 and -1.\n\nSo that matches what we saw earlier when we calculated the H for each state: only H=3 and H=-1.\n\nSo, going back, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{\u03b2 J H}.\n\nBut since all states with H=3 contribute e^{\u03b2 J *3}, and those with H=-1 contribute e^{\u03b2 J * (-1)}.\n\nSo the number of states with H=3 is 2 (states 1 and 8), and the number with H=-1 is 6.\n\nSo Z = 2 * e^{3 \u03b2 J} + 6 * e^{-1 \u03b2 J}.\n\nSo Z= 2 e^{3 J \u03b2} +6 e^{-J \u03b2}.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option A is Z=2 e^{-3 J \u03b2} +6 e^{J \u03b2}.\n\nOption B is Z=2 e^{3 J \u03b2} +6 e^{-J \u03b2}.\n\nWhich matches our calculation.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the partition function \\( Z \\) for the system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\), we start by analyzing the energy of the system. The energy is given by:\n\n\\[\nE = -J \\left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( J \\) is the coupling constant.

Specifically, the possible values of \\( H \\) are \\( 3, 1, -1, -3 \\). However, upon analyzing all 8 possible spin configurations, it turns out that \\( H \\) can only take the values \\( 3 \\) and \\( -1 \\). \n\n- **For \\( H = 3 \\):** This occurs when all three spins are aligned, i.e., \\( (S_1, S_2, S_3) = (+1, +1, +1) \\) or \\( (-1, -1, -1) \\). There are 2 such states.\n- **For \\( H = -1 \\):** This occurs in all other configurations, where two spins are aligned and one is anti-aligned. There are 6 such states.\n\n### Step 2: Partition Function\nThe partition function is given by:\n\n\\[\nZ = \\sum_{\\text{all states}} e^{-\\beta E}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( E = -JH \\), we have \\( -\\beta E = \\beta J H \\). Thus, the partition function becomes:\n\n\\[\nZ = 2 e^{3 J \\beta} + 6 e^{-J \\beta}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Matching with Options\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n- **Option A:** \\( Z = 2 e^{-3 J \\beta} + 6 e^{J \\beta} \\) \u2014 Incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed.\n- **Option B:** \\( Z = 2 e^{3 J \\beta} + 6 e^{-J \\beta} \\) \u2014 Correct, matches the derived expression.\n- **Option C:** \\( Z = 2 e^{2 J \\beta} + 6 e^{-2 J \\beta} \\) \u2014 Incorrect, as the exponents are incorrect.\n- **Option D:** \\( Z = 6 e^{2 J \\beta} + 2 e^{-2 J \\beta} \\) \u2014 Incorrect, as both the coefficients and exponents are wrong.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct partition function is:\n\n\\[\nZ = 2 e^{3 J \\beta} + 6 e^{-J \\beta}.\n\\]\n\nThis corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.\n\nThe problem says we have three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.\n\nWait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). Right, so first I should figure out all possible states of the system and calculate E for each.\n\nEach spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nNow for each state, I need to compute the energy E. Let's compute each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3.\n\nStarting with state 1: All spins +1. So each product is +1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E = -J * 3 = -3J.\n\nState 2: S3 is -1. So S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recheck. No, E is -J times the sum. So if sum is -1, E is -J*(-1) = J.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me compute each:\n\nState 2: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = 1*1=1.\n\nS1S3=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nS2S3=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nSum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nSo E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nHmm, okay. Next state 3: S2=-1, others +1.\n\nS1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.\n\nS1S2 = -1.\n\nS1S3=1.\n\nS2S3 = -1*1= -1.\n\nSum is -1 + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nE = J again.\n\nSimilarly, state 4: S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2=-1.\n\nS1S3=-1.\n\nS2S3= (-1)(-1)=1.\n\nSum is -1 + (-1) + 1 = -1.\n\nE = J.\n\nWait, same as states 2 and 3.\n\nState 5: S1=-1, others +1.\n\nS1=-1, S2=1, S3=1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nS2S3=1*1=1.\n\nSum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nE= J.\n\nSame as before.\n\nState 6: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2= (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(-1)=1.\n\nS2S3=1*(-1)=-1.\n\nSum: -1 +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nE= J.\n\nState7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1.\n\nS1S2=1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(1)= -1.\n\nS2S3= (-1)(1)= -1.\n\nSum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nE= J.\n\nFinally, state 8: All spins -1.\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3.\n\nE= -J *3= -3J.\n\nWait, so let's tally up all the energies.\n\nLooking at each state:\n\n1: E= -3J\n\n2: E= J\n\n3: E= J\n\n4: E= J\n\n5: E= J\n\n6: E= J\n\n7: E= J\n\n8: E= -3J\n\nWait, so states 1 and 8 have energy -3J. The other 6 states (2-7) each have energy J.\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2 E).\n\nSo Z = [exp(-\u03b2*(-3J))] + [6 * exp(-\u03b2*(J))] + [exp(-\u03b2*(-3J))].\n\nWait, wait. No. Because each state contributes its own exp term. Let me list each state's contribution.\n\nState 1: exp(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = exp(3\u03b2J).\n\nState 2: exp(-\u03b2*(J)) = exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nSimilarly, states 2-7 each have E= J, so their contributions are each exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nState 8: exp(3\u03b2 J) again.\n\nSo total Z = [exp(3\u03b2 J) ] + 6 * exp(-\u03b2 J) + [exp(3\u03b2 J)].\n\nSo that's 2 * exp(3\u03b2 J) + 6 * exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nOption A: Z=2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^{J\u03b2} \u2192 No, because the exponents are opposite.\n\nOption B: Z= 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 Yes, that's what I have.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again. Because I might have mixed up the signs.\n\nWait, E is the energy. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -\u03b2 E ), right?\n\nSo for state 1: E = -3J \u2192 -\u03b2 E = 3 \u03b2 J \u2192 exp(3\u03b2 J).\n\nFor states 2-7: E= J \u2192 -\u03b2 E = -\u03b2 J \u2192 exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nState 8: same as state 1.\n\nSo the contributions are:\n\n2 * exp(3\u03b2 J) + 6 * exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nWhich matches option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nOption B: Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2) \u2192 That's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the state energies.\n\nWait, state 2: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2=1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1.\n\nSum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSo E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, state 3: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.\n\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3 = -1.\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 = -1 \u2192 E= J.\n\nYes.\n\nSo all the states with two +1 and one -1, or two -1 and one +1? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of pairs that are aligned or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a smarter way is to note that the Hamiltonian is symmetric under permutation of spins. So perhaps we can group the states based on how many spins are aligned.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the energy depends on the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me denote this sum as S.\n\nEach term S_i S_j can be +1 (aligned) or -1 (anti-aligned).\n\nSo for three spins, each pair contributes either +1 or -1. The total sum S is the sum of the three terms.\n\nSo E = -J * S.\n\nSo for each state, the energy depends on the value of S.\n\nSo let me calculate S for each possible state:\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to count how many states have a certain value of S.\n\nWhat are the possible values of S?\n\nEach of the three terms is either +1 or -1. So the sum S can range from 3 (all +1) to -3 (all -1), in steps of 2?\n\nWait, no. Let's think: For three terms each \u00b11, the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nFor example:\n\n- All three +1: sum is 3.\n\n- Two +1 and one -1: sum is 1 +1 -1 = 1.\n\n- One +1 and two -1: 1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) \u2192 Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the sum is each product.\n\nWait, let's think about specific states.\n\nCase 1: All spins same, say all +1.\n\nEach term S_i S_j = +1. So sum is 3.\n\nCase 2: Two spins +1, one -1.\n\nSay S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.\n\nCompute S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, so S = -1.\n\nSimilarly, any state with two +1 and one -1: S = -1.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, no. Let me take another state: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.\n\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3 = -1.\n\nSum is (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nHmm, so any state with two +1 and one -1 gives S = -1.\n\nWhat about when two are -1 and one +1?\n\nLet's take S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1.\n\nS1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1.\n\nSum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSame as before.\n\nWait, so any state that is not all +1 or all -1 has S = -1.\n\nWait, let's confirm with another example.\n\nTake S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2= (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nS1S3=1.\n\nS2S3= (-1)(-1)=1.\n\nSum: -1 +1 +1 =1.\n\nWait, wait! Now the sum is +1.\n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recompute for this state.\n\nS1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2 = (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(-1)=1.\n\nS2S3= (1)(-1) = -1.\n\nSo sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = (-1 -1) +1 = -2 +1 = -1.\n\nWait, no, that gives sum -1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought S1S3 is 1, but S2S3 is -1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(-1) = 1.\n\nS2S3 = (1)(-1) = -1.\n\nSum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = (-1) + (1 -1) = -1 + 0 = -1.\n\nHmm, so that state has S=-1.\n\nWait, let's try another state where S might be +1.\n\nWait, how about S1=1, S2=1, S3=1: sum S=3.\n\nAnother state: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1: sum S=1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nWait, maybe the only time the sum S is positive is when all three are aligned.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me think of a state where two are -1 and one is +1, but the sum is positive.\n\nWait, S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1.\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.\n\nSum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nHmm, same as others.\n\nWait, what about S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2= -1.\n\nS1S3= -1.\n\nS2S3= 1.\n\nSum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nWait, same result.\n\nHmm, so I must be missing a state where S is positive.\n\nWait, is there any state with S=1?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, what about the state S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.\n\nS1S2= -1.\n\nS1S3=1.\n\nS2S3= -1.\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum S can't be 1. Because for three terms each being \u00b11, the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, but according to the examples, states where two are same and one different give sum S=-1.\n\nWait, but I'm getting all the other states to have sum S=-1 except for the all same.\n\nWait, but that would imply that the only states with S=3 are the two all same states, and all others have S=-1.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed for state 8 (all -1), the sum S is 3.\n\nSo in that case, all same spins (all +1 or all -1) have S=3, and all others have S=-1.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I thought of S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1, the sum was -1. So perhaps all states except the two all-same states have S=-1.\n\nSo in that case, for the partition function, the energy E is -J * S.\n\nSo for all-same states, E = -J *3.\n\nFor others, E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nSo, the number of all-same states is 2: one with all +1, one with all -1.\n\nThe other 6 states have E= J.\n\nSo the partition function Z is:\n\nZ = 2 * exp(3 J \u03b2) + 6 * exp(-J \u03b2).\n\nWhich matches option B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Z=2e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nSo the answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.\n\nThe problem says we have three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.\n\nWait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT).

Wait, the sum is each product.\n\nWait, let's think about specific states.\n\nCase 1: All spins same, say all +1.\n\nEach term S_i S_j = +1. So sum is 3.\n\nCase 2: Two spins +1, one -1.\n\nSay S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.\n\nCompute S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, so S = -1.\n\nSimilarly, any state with two +1 and one -1: S = -1.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, no. Let me take another state: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.\n\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3 = -1.\n\nSum is (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nHmm, so any state with two +1 and one -1 gives S = -1.\n\nWhat about when two are -1 and one +1?\n\nLet's take S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1.\n\nS1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1.\n\nSum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSame as before.\n\nWait, so any state that is not all +1 or all -1 has S = -1.\n\nWait, let's confirm with another example.\n\nTake S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2= (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nS1S3=1.\n\nS2S3= (-1)(-1)=1.\n\nSum: -1 +1 +1 =1.\n\nWait, wait! Now the sum is +1.\n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recompute for this state.\n\nS1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.\n\nSo S1S2 = (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(-1)=1.\n\nS2S3= (1)(-1) = -1.\n\nSo sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = (-1 -1) +1 = -2 +1 = -1.\n\nWait, no, that gives sum -1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought S1S3 is 1, but S2S3 is -1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(-1) = 1.\n\nS2S3 = (1)(-1) = -1.\n\nSum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = (-1) + (1 -1) = -1 + 0 = -1.\n\nHmm, so that state has S=-1.\n\nWait, let's try another state where S might be +1.\n\nWait, how about S1=1, S2=1, S3=1: sum S=3.\n\nAnother state: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1: sum S=1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nWait, maybe the only time the sum S is positive is when all three are aligned.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me think of a state where two are -1 and one is +1, but the sum is positive.\n\nWait, S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1.\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.\n\nSum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nHmm, same as others.\n\nWait, what about S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2= -1.\n\nS1S3= -1.\n\nS2S3= 1.\n\nSum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nWait, same result.\n\nHmm, so I must be missing a state where S is positive.\n\nWait, is there any state with S=1?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, what about the state S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.\n\nS1S2= -1.\n\nS1S3=1.\n\nS2S3= -1.\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum S can't be 1. Because for three terms each being \u00b11, the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, but according to the examples, states where two are same and one different give sum S=-1.\n\nWait, but I'm getting all the other states to have sum S=-1 except for the all same.\n\nWait, but that would imply that the only states with S=3 are the two all same states, and all others have S=-1.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed for state 8 (all -1), the sum S is 3.\n\nSo in that case, all same spins (all +1 or all -1) have S=3, and all others have S=-1.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I thought of S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1, the sum was -1. So perhaps all states except the two all-same states have S=-1.\n\nSo in that case, for the partition function, the energy E is -J * S.\n\nSo for all-same states, E = -J *3.\n\nFor others, E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nSo, the number of all-same states is 2: one with all +1, one with all -1.\n\nThe other 6 states have E= J.\n\nSo the partition function Z is:\n\nZ = 2 * exp(3 J \u03b2) + 6 * exp(-J \u03b2).\n\nWhich matches option B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Z=2e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nSo the answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \\( Z \\) for a system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\).

Grouping contributions by energy:\n\n\\[\nZ = 2 \\cdot e^{-\\beta(-3J)} + 6 \\cdot e^{-\\beta(J)}.\n\\]\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n\\[\nZ = 2 \\cdot e^{3\\beta J} + 6 \\cdot e^{-\\beta J}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Match with the options\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\nZ = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta}.\n\\]\n\nThis corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

There are 6 such states.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the partition function\nThe partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states:\n\\[\nZ = \\sum e^{-\\beta E}.\n\\]\n- For the 2 states with \\( E = -3J \\), the contribution is \\( 2e^{-\\beta(-3J)} = 2e^{3J\\beta} \\).\n- For the 6 states with \\( E = J \\), the contribution is \\( 6e^{-\\beta(J)} = 6e^{-J\\beta} \\).\n\nThus, the partition function is:\n\\[\nZ = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Match with the options\nComparing this result with the given options:\n- **Option A:** \\( Z = 2e^{-3J\\beta} + 6e^{J\\beta} \\) (incorrect, exponents are reversed).\n- **Option B:** \\( Z = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta} \\) (correct, matches the derived result).\n- **Option C:** \\( Z = 2e^{2J\\beta} + 6e^{-2J\\beta} \\) (incorrect, wrong exponents).\n- **Option D:** \\( Z = 6e^{2J\\beta} + 2e^{-2J\\beta} \\) (incorrect, wrong exponents and coefficients).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct partition function is \\( Z = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta} \\), which corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), where beta is 1/(kT). But wait, in this case, the energy E is given by this formula involving the spins.\n\nThe system has three spins S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. So each spin has two possible states. The total number of possible states for the system is 2^3 = 8. I'll need to list all possible states and calculate the energy for each, then sum the exponentials.\n\nThe energy E is given by E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). So each term is the product of two spins, and the sum is three such terms. Wait, but J could be positive or negative, but I think in this problem it's just a constant so the sign matters for the energy.\n\nLet me list all possible states. Each spin can be +1 or -1. So the states are all combinations of S1, S2, S3. Let's list them:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n6.

Two: states 1 and 8.\n\nHow many have E= J? The other six states (states 2-7).\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-beta E).\n\nBut wait, for each state, the weight is exp(-beta E). So:\n\nFor each state with E = -3J, the weight is exp(-beta*(-3J))= exp(3 beta J).\n\nEach of these two states contributes exp(3 beta J) each. So 2 * exp(3 beta J).\n\nFor the six states with E=J, each contributes exp(-beta J). So 6 * exp(-beta J).\n\nSo Z = 2 * exp(3 beta J) + 6 * exp(-beta J).\n\nNow looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 2 e^(-3J\u03b2) +6 e^(J\u03b2) \u2192 No, because our terms are 2 e^{3 J\u03b2} and 6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nOption B: 2 e^{3 J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 Yes, this matches.\n\nOption C: 2e^{2J\u03b2} +6 e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 No, exponents are different.\n\nOption D: 6e^{2J\u03b2} +2e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 No, exponents and coefficients wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",
