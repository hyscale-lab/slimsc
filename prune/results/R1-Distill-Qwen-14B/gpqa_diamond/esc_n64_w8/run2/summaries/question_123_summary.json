      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, the question is about finding the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think through this.\n\nWait, so both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames. That probably means I can use the Galilean transformations or maybe the Lorentz ones. But wait, the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me check what that is in terms of the speed of light because that matters for which transformations to use.\n\nThe speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times the speed of light. Hmm, that's significant but not super high, but maybe relativistic effects aren't negligible. Wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so I don't have to worry about those factors.\n\nWait, the problem says from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, 60,000 km/s. Oh wait, no, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, right? Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. The problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the center of the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that would mean that in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s. Because in one frame, each object's velocity is the negative of the other's in the other frame when they are moving directly towards each other, assuming no acceleration and inertial frames. So, if in ejecta's frame, galaxy is approaching at v, then in galaxy's frame, ejecta approaches at v. So the speed is 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but that's only true in the case of non-relativistic speeds, right? Because in reality, velocities don't just invert like that in different frames. Oh wait, no, the velocity transformations are different in relativity. But maybe the problem expects us to use a simple approach.\n\nWait, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So the time experienced in the ejecta frame is 50 seconds. But because of time dilation, the time in the galaxy frame might be different. Oh, right, that's the thing. Because in special relativity, time intervals depend on the relative velocity between frames.\n\nSo the key here is to find the proper time or the time experienced in one frame and then find the corresponding time in the other frame. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the Lorentz transformations to relate the time intervals.\n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. So what is the corresponding time in the galaxy's frame? Since the ejecta is moving at a high speed relative to the galaxy, time dilation would cause the galaxy frame to see the ejecta's clock as running slower. So the time in the galaxy frame would be longer.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. Let's denote the galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S'. In S', the time elapsed is \u0394t' = 50 seconds. The speed of the ejecta relative to the galaxy is v = 60,000 km/s. We need to find how much time passes in the galaxy's frame, \u0394t, so that we can calculate the distance the ejecta travels in that time.\n\nBut wait, actually, the distance in the galaxy's frame is speed multiplied by time in that frame. So distance = v * \u0394t. But what's \u0394t in terms of \u0394t'?\n\nIn special relativity, the time dilation formula is \u0394t = \u03b3 \u0394t', where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(c^2)).\n\nLet me compute \u03b3. v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c. So v/c = 0.2.\n\nThen, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.04. So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So \u03b3 is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo \u0394t = \u03b3 * \u0394t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The time in the galaxy frame is longer, so that makes sense because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slower. So the galaxy would measure a longer time.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it. But when you switch frames, the time experienced depends on the frame. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the velocity and the time in each frame.\n\nWait, another approach: the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. So if I can find the time in the galaxy's frame, I can find the distance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the proper time. Wait, proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the moving object. But in this case, the ejecta is moving relative to the galaxy.\n\nWait, let me think again. The ejecta's frame is S', and the galaxy is S. In S', the time is 50 seconds. So in S, the time is longer. So the distance is v multiplied by the time in S.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the Lorentz factor \u03b3.\n2. Compute \u0394t in S (galaxy frame) using \u0394t = \u03b3 * \u0394t'.\n3. Multiply v by \u0394t to get the distance.\n\nLet me compute \u03b3 more accurately. Let's compute v = 60,000 km/s. c = 300,000 km/s.\n\nSo (v/c) = 0.2.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04.\n\n1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.\n\nSo \u03b3 = 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(0.96). Let's see: 0.98^2 is 0.9604, so sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So yes, \u03b3 is 1.0206.\n\nSo \u0394t = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance is v * \u0394t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 *51.03 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000. 60,000 *1.03 is 61,800. So total is 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, that would be about 3,061,800 km, which is close to option D: 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, let me be precise with the calculation. Let's compute 51.03 *60,000.\n\n51.03 * 60,000 = (50 + 1.03) *60,000 = 50*60,000 + 1.03*60,000 = 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nSo approximately 3,061,800 km. Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So the correct answer would be D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the approach. Another way to approach this is to think about the proper time. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the moving object. But in this case, the ejecta is moving, so in the galaxy's frame, the time is longer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used the velocity and the time in the ejecta's frame, but account for length contraction. Hmm, maybe not, because the distance the ejecta is moving is from the galaxy's perspective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by that longer time.\n\nWait, another way: The time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so the ejecta takes longer to reach a certain point from the galaxy's perspective, thus moving a longer distance.\n\nWait, but in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it. So perhaps I should consider the distance the galaxy travels in the ejecta's frame, then apply length contraction.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about it again.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at v. So in 50 seconds (ejecta's time), the galaxy would have moved a distance of v * \u0394t' = 60,000 km/s *50 s = 3,000,000 km.\n\nBut wait, that would be the distance the galaxy moves in the ejecta's frame, which would correspond to the distance the ejecta moves in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, no, because in different frames, distances can contract. Hmm. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at v, so the distance the galaxy covers is v * \u0394t'. But that would be the distance as measured in the ejecta's frame. But the galaxy's frame would measure a longer distance due to length contraction.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's easier to stick with the time dilation approach.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v for a time \u0394t. So distance is v * \u0394t.\n\nWe know \u0394t = \u03b3 * \u0394t' = 1.0206 *50 \u224851.03 s.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km, which is approximately 3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the Galilean transformation, which would ignore relativity. But wait, if we use Galilean, then time is the same in both frames. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves for 50 seconds, so distance is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that both are inertial frames, which is a hint towards using relativity, but I'm not sure. Also, 60,000 km/s is 20% of c, which is a significant fraction. So probably the problem expects us to use the relativistic approach.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 3,000,000, which would be the result from Galilean, and option D is 3,060,000, which is the relativistic result.\n\nSo which approach is correct here?\n\nThe problem states that both are inertial frames, and it's about relative motion. So the correct approach is to use the relativistic transformations.\n\nSo the distance in the galaxy's frame is 3,061,800 km, which rounds to 3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's try to think it through. The question is about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which I remember means no acceleration involved. So we can probably use special relativity here.\n\nThe problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's a really high speed. I know that's a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 1/5th of that. Hmm, so we can't ignore relativistic effects here. Because when speeds are a substantial fraction of c, time dilation and length contraction come into play.\n\nThe question asks: What distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?\n\nWait, I need to clarify. The time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, and we need to find how much distance the ejecta covers from the Galaxy's perspective during that time.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me re-read the question. Oh, right: the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. But the Galaxy's frame will see a different time because of time dilation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the two frames. Since the ejecta and Galaxy are moving relative to each other, I need to use the Lorentz transformation to find the distance.\n\nWait, but the distance in the Galaxy frame is the distance the ejecta moves during the time measured in the Galaxy frame. But the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So perhaps I need to relate the two times.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the speed as v = 60,000 km/s. So v = 6e4 km/s. The speed of light c is 3e5 km/s. So v is 0.2c, which is 20% the speed of light. That's enough for some relativistic effects, but not extreme.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (let's say S'), the Galaxy is moving towards them at v. So in S' (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is approaching at velocity v. The time that passes in S' is t' = 50 seconds. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame (S), which is the distance the ejecta moves in S during time t (measured in S).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy. So from the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at v. So in S, the ejecta's speed is v. So the distance would be v multiplied by the time in S.\n\nBut the time given is in S', the ejecta's frame. So I need to find the time t in S when t' is 50 seconds.\n\nWait, but time dilation says that t' = gamma (t - (v x)/c\u00b2), but I think I'm mixing up the transformations. Alternatively, for events that are moving relative to each other, the time experienced in one frame is different.\n\nWait, the problem is about how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame (S) when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (S'). Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. But from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at v.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up the frames. Let me define S as the Galaxy's frame, and S' as the ejecta's frame. In S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at velocity v. So in S, the speed of the ejecta is v.\n\nIn S', which is the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity v. So from S', the Galaxy is approaching at v.\n\nNow, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame (S'), the time elapsed is 50 seconds. So t' =50 s. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S's frame during t seconds. So the distance would be v * t, but t is the time in S.\n\nBut how do I relate t and t'? Using time dilation? Or perhaps using the Lorentz transformation.\n\nWait, the time in S is related to the time in S' by the time dilation formula, but only when the events happen at the same place in one frame. So if in S', the events (start and end of the time interval) occur at the same point (the ejecta's position), then the time in S is longer. Because from S, the clock in S' is moving, so it runs slower.\n\nWait, in this case, the ejecta is at rest in S', and the Galaxy is moving towards it. So the time in S' is 50 seconds. The events are the start and end of this time period, both occurring at the same point in S' (the ejecta's location).\n\nSo the time in S would be t = gamma * t', because in S, the clock in S' is moving, so the time between events is longer.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let's compute that.\n\nv = 6e4 km/s. c=3e5 km/s. So v/c = 0.2.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04. 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.0206.\n\nThen t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the time in S for the 50 seconds in S'. So the ejecta is moving at v =6e4 km/s for t=51.03 seconds in S.\n\nSo the distance traveled in S would be v * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s = ?\n\nWait, 6e4 is 60,000 km/s. 60,000 * 51.03 is 60,000 *51.03.\n\nLet me compute that. 60,000 *50 is 3,000,000. 60,000 *1.03 is 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 +61,800=3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but the options are A:2.94e6, B:3e6, C:2.88e6, D:3.06e6.\n\nSo D is 3.06e6 km, which is 3,060,000 km. But my calculation gives 3,061,800. Hmm, perhaps the approximation for gamma is a bit off.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv =6e4 km/s. v/c=0.2. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2=0.04. 1 - 0.04=0.96. sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(96/100)=sqrt(96)/10.\n\nsqrt(96) is sqrt(16*6)=4*sqrt(6)=approx 4*2.4495=9.798.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96)=9.798/10=0.9798.\n\nGamma is 1 / 0.9798 = approx 1.0206.\n\nSo t=50 * 1.0206=51.03 s.\n\nBut perhaps I should use more precise calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula for time dilation.\n\nWait, but another approach: Let's think about the proper time. Proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end) occur at the same place. Here, in S', the events happen at the same point (the ejecta's rest frame), so t' is the proper time.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = (1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) * t'.\n\nWhich is the same as before. So same calculation.\n\nSo the distance in S is v * t = v * gamma t'.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nv =6e4 km/s, t'=50 s, gamma \u22481.0206.\n\nSo 6e4 * 50 *1.0206.\n\nWait, 6e4 *50 = 3e6. Multiply by 1.0206: 3e6 * 1.0206 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this exact number. The closest option is D)3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact gamma is a bit different. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 =1 - (0.2)^2 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.979795897.\n\nSo gamma=1/0.979795897 \u22481.020614.\n\nSo t=50 *1.020614=51.0307 seconds.\n\nSo 6e4 km/s *51.0307 s =6e4 *51.0307.\n\nCompute 6e4 *51 = 3,060,000.\n\n6e4 *0.0307=6e4 *0.03=1,800; 6e4 *0.0007=42. So 1,800 +42=1,842.\n\nSo total is 3,060,000 +1,842=3,061,842 km.\n\nWhich is about 3,061,842 km. So the closest option is D)3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but option D is 3,060,000, which is 3.06e6. So 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm, but wait, perhaps I should consider that in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer, and the distance is v multiplied by that time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the velocity addition formula or something else.\n\nWait, another approach: The distance in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. So we need to find t.\n\nThe time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than the time in the ejecta's frame because of time dilation.\n\nSo t = gamma * t'.\n\nWhich gives t=50 * gamma.\n\nThen, distance = v * t = v * gamma * t' = (v gamma) * t'.\n\nv gamma = v * (1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, let me compute v gamma.\n\nv = 6e4 km/s.\n\ngamma = 1.020614.\n\nv gamma =6e4 *1.020614\u224861,236.84 km/s.\n\nWait, but wait, that's not possible because nothing can go faster than c.\n\nWait, no, because v gamma would be v multiplied by gamma, but that's only relevant when considering the product in certain equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing something. Let me think.\n\nWait, the proper way is to compute the distance as v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nSo v =6e4 km/s.\n\nt = gamma * t'.\n\nt =50 *1.020614\u224851.0307 s.\n\nSo distance =6e4 *51.0307\u22483,061,842 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So the closest option is D)3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the time in the Galaxy's frame as the same as the ejecta's frame. But that would be wrong because of time dilation.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I'm in the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving towards me at v. So in my frame, the ejecta's speed is v, and I measure the time as t. The ejecta experiences t' = t / gamma.\n\nWait, no, because if the events are the departure and arrival at two different points, the time experienced in each frame depends on the relative motion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the Lorentz transformation for the coordinates.\n\nIn S' (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity v. So the position of the Galaxy's center in S' is changing.\n\nBut the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in S when t' seconds pass in S'.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The distance in S is v multiplied by the time in S.\n\nBut the time in S is longer than t' because of time dilation. So t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo distance = v * gamma * t'.\n\nWhich is 6e4 km/s *1.020614 *50 s.\n\nWait, 6e4 *50 =3e6. 3e6 *1.020614=3,061,842 km.\n\nSo the closest option is D)3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOption D is 3,060,000 km. So that's 3.06e6 km.\n\nBut my calculation gives about 3,061,800 km, which is 3.0618e6 km. So option D is 3.06e6, which is about 3,060,000. So the correct answer would be D.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in the direction. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy.\n\nSo the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is t.\n\nt is the time in S. So if t' is 50 s in S', then t = gamma * t' \u224851.03 s.\n\nSo distance is 6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that, so perhaps the intended answer is option D:3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to not consider relativity and just multiply v by t', which would be 6e4 *50=3e6 km, which is option B. But that would ignore the time dilation effect, which is significant here because v is 20% of c.\n\nWait, but in reality, we can't ignore relativity here. So the correct approach is to use the time dilation, leading to option D.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe question is: What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame.\n\nSo, the 50 seconds are in S' (ejecta frame). So the time in S (Galaxy frame) is longer.\n\nSo, distance in S is v * t, where t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo, 6e4 km/s * gamma *50 s.\n\nGamma is 1.0206, so 6e4 *1.0206*50 =6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore relativity and just do 6e4 *50=3e6, which is option B.\n\nBut the problem states that both are inertial frames, implying that relativity applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the distance in the ejecta's frame, but that seems unlikely because the question says the ejecta is part of the supernova's ejecta moving towards the center, and the question is about the distance in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the time in S is t = t' * gamma. So 50 *1.0206=51.03 s.\n\nSo distance =v * t=6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this, but option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering length contraction. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nCompute 1 - (v/c)^2 =1 -0.04=0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96)=0.9797959.\n\nGamma=1/0.9797959=1.020614.\n\nSo t=50 *1.020614=51.0307 s.\n\nSo distance=6e4 *51.0307=?\n\n6e4 is 60,000.\n\n60,000 *51 =3,060,000.\n\n60,000 *0.0307=1,842.\n\nTotal=3,060,000 +1,842=3,061,842 km.\n\nSo 3,061,842 km. The options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB)3,000,000 km.\n\nC)2,880,000 km.\n\nD)3,060,000 km.\n\nSo the closest is D)3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, why is D exactly 3,060,000? Because 6e4 *51=3,060,000.\n\nAh, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, so t=50*1.02=51 s.\n\nSo 6e4 *51=3,060,000 km.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D.\n",

So the ejecta is moving at v =6e4 km/s for t=51.03 seconds in S.\n\nSo the distance traveled in S would be v * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s = ?\n\nWait, 6e4 is 60,000 km/s. 60,000 * 51.03 is 60,000 *51.03.\n\nLet me compute that. 60,000 *50 is 3,000,000. 60,000 *1.03 is 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 +61,800=3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but the options are A:2.94e6, B:3e6, C:2.88e6, D:3.06e6.\n\nSo D is 3.06e6 km, which is 3,060,000 km. But my calculation gives 3,061,800. Hmm, perhaps the approximation for gamma is a bit off.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv =6e4 km/s. v/c=0.2. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2=0.04. 1 - 0.04=0.96. sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(96/100)=sqrt(96)/10.\n\nsqrt(96) is sqrt(16*6)=4*sqrt(6)=approx 4*2.4495=9.798.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96)=9.798/10=0.9798.\n\nGamma is 1 / 0.9798 = approx 1.0206.\n\nSo t=50 * 1.0206=51.03 s.\n\nBut perhaps I should use more precise calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula for time dilation.\n\nWait, but another approach: Let's think about the proper time. Proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end) occur at the same place. Here, in S', the events happen at the same point (the ejecta's rest frame), so t' is the proper time.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = (1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) * t'.\n\nWhich is the same as before. So same calculation.\n\nSo the distance in S is v * t = v * gamma t'.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nv =6e4 km/s, t'=50 s, gamma \u22481.0206.\n\nSo 6e4 * 50 *1.0206.\n\nWait, 6e4 *50 = 3e6. Multiply by 1.0206: 3e6 * 1.0206 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this exact number. The closest option is D)3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact gamma is a bit different. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 =1 - (0.2)^2 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.979795897.\n\nSo gamma=1/0.979795897 \u22481.020614.\n\nSo t=50 *1.020614=51.0307 seconds.\n\nSo 6e4 km/s *51.0307 s =6e4 *51.0307.\n\nCompute 6e4 *51 = 3,060,000.\n\n6e4 *0.0307=6e4 *0.03=1,800; 6e4 *0.0007=42. So 1,800 +42=1,842.\n\nSo total is 3,060,000 +1,842=3,061,842 km.\n\nWhich is about 3,061,842 km. So the closest option is D)3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but option D is 3,060,000, which is 3.06e6. So 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm, but wait, perhaps I should consider that in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer, and the distance is v multiplied by that time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the velocity addition formula or something else.\n\nWait, another approach: The distance in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. So we need to find t.\n\nThe time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than the time in the ejecta's frame because of time dilation.\n\nSo t = gamma * t'.\n\nWhich gives t=50 * gamma.\n\nThen, distance = v * t = v * gamma * t' = (v gamma) * t'.\n\nv gamma = v * (1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nWait, let me compute v gamma.\n\nv = 6e4 km/s.\n\ngamma = 1.020614.\n\nv gamma =6e4 *1.020614\u224861,236.84 km/s.\n\nWait, but wait, that's not possible because nothing can go faster than c.\n\nWait, no, because v gamma would be v multiplied by gamma, but that's only relevant when considering the product in certain equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing something. Let me think.\n\nWait, the proper way is to compute the distance as v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nSo v =6e4 km/s.\n\nt = gamma * t'.\n\nt =50 *1.020614\u224851.0307 s.\n\nSo distance =6e4 *51.0307\u22483,061,842 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So the closest option is D)3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the time in the Galaxy's frame as the same as the ejecta's frame. But that would be wrong because of time dilation.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I'm in the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving towards me at v. So in my frame, the ejecta's speed is v, and I measure the time as t. The ejecta experiences t' = t / gamma.\n\nWait, no, because if the events are the departure and arrival at two different points, the time experienced in each frame depends on the relative motion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the Lorentz transformation for the coordinates.\n\nIn S' (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity v. So the position of the Galaxy's center in S' is changing.\n\nBut the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in S when t' seconds pass in S'.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The distance in S is v multiplied by the time in S.\n\nBut the time in S is longer than t' because of time dilation. So t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo distance = v * gamma * t'.\n\nWhich is 6e4 km/s *1.020614 *50 s.\n\nWait, 6e4 *50 =3e6. 3e6 *1.020614=3,061,842 km.\n\nSo the closest option is D)3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOption D is 3,060,000 km. So that's 3.06e6 km.\n\nBut my calculation gives about 3,061,800 km, which is 3.0618e6 km. So option D is 3.06e6, which is about 3,060,000. So the correct answer would be D.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in the direction. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy.\n\nSo the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is t.\n\nt is the time in S. So if t' is 50 s in S', then t = gamma * t' \u224851.03 s.\n\nSo distance is 6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that, so perhaps the intended answer is option D:3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to not consider relativity and just multiply v by t', which would be 6e4 *50=3e6 km, which is option B. But that would ignore the time dilation effect, which is significant here because v is 20% of c.\n\nWait, but in reality, we can't ignore relativity here. So the correct approach is to use the time dilation, leading to option D.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe question is: What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame.\n\nSo, the 50 seconds are in S' (ejecta frame). So the time in S (Galaxy frame) is longer.\n\nSo, distance in S is v * t, where t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo, 6e4 km/s * gamma *50 s.\n\nGamma is 1.0206, so 6e4 *1.0206*50 =6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore relativity and just do 6e4 *50=3e6, which is option B.\n\nBut the problem states that both are inertial frames, implying that relativity applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the distance in the ejecta's frame, but that seems unlikely because the question says the ejecta is part of the supernova's ejecta moving towards the center, and the question is about the distance in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the time in S is t = t' * gamma. So 50 *1.0206=51.03 s.\n\nSo distance =v * t=6e4 *51.03=3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this, but option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering length contraction. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nCompute 1 - (v/c)^2 =1 -0.04=0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96)=0.9797959.\n\nGamma=1/0.9797959=1.020614.\n\nSo t=50 *1.020614=51.0307 s.\n\nSo distance=6e4 *51.0307=?\n\n6e4 is 60,000.\n\n60,000 *51 =3,060,000.\n\n60,000 *0.0307=1,842.\n\nTotal=3,060,000 +1,842=3,061,842 km.\n\nSo 3,061,842 km. The options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB)3,000,000 km.\n\nC)2,880,000 km.\n\nD)3,060,000 km.\n\nSo the closest is D)3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait, why is D exactly 3,060,000? Because 6e4 *51=3,060,000.\n\nAh, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, so t=50*1.02=51 s.\n\nSo 6e4 *51=3,060,000 km.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), which is \\( 0.2c \\) (where \\( c = 300,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\)). The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (\\( t' \\)) is \\( 50 \\, \\text{s} \\), and we need to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame (\\( S \\)) during this time.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Relating Time in the Two Frames**:  \n   Since the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, we use special relativity. The time dilation formula relates the time in the Galaxy's frame (\\( t \\)) to the time in the ejecta's frame (\\( t' \\)):\n   \\[\n   t = \\gamma t',\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \\). Substituting \\( v = 0.2c \\):\n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206.\n   \\]\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   t = 1.0206 \\times 50 \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  \n   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = v \\cdot t.\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( t \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = 60,000 \\times 51.03 \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Matching the Closest Option**:  \n   The calculated distance (\\( \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\)) is closest to option \\( D \\), which is \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\). The slight discrepancy arises from rounding \\( \\gamma \\) and \\( t \\) during intermediate steps.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when \\( 50 \\, \\text{s} \\) pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\).\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame over a certain time. \n\nWait, the problem says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Oh right, so that means in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at the same speed, 60,000 km/s, towards the center, right? Because if A sees B moving at v, then B sees A moving at v in the opposite direction, assuming no acceleration and same speed.\n\nBut wait, the question is a bit tricky. It says, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, so time isn't the same in both frames because of time dilation, I think. Because they're moving relative to each other, their time measurements would differ.\n\nSo, I remember that time dilation is part of special relativity. The formula for time dilation is t' = gamma * t, where gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). Wait, but here, the time given is in the ejecta's frame, which is moving relative to the Galaxy. So, from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slower.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think. Suppose in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer, because the Galaxy sees the ejecta moving. So, the time t_galaxy = t_ejecta * gamma. But wait, gamma is greater than 1, so t_galaxy is longer. \n\nWait, but in the problem, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy. Let me compute the gamma factor. First, what's 60,000 km/s in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So, 60,000 is 0.2 times c. So, v = 0.2c.\n\nGamma would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me compute that. The square root of 0.96 is about 0.9798. So 1/0.9798 is approximately 1.0206. So gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nSo, if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (t'), then in the Galaxy's frame (t), it's t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds. Hmm, but wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the time in the moving frame (ejecta) would appear longer or shorter in the Galaxy's frame? I think when you have a moving clock, it ticks slower. So, the time measured in the Galaxy would be longer. So, if t' is 50 seconds in the ejecta, then t = gamma * t' = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, no, actually, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The time measured in the moving frame (ejecta) is t', and the time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy) is t. So, t = gamma * t'. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the time that passes is longer than in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's clarify. The problem is: 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. How much time passes in the Galaxy's frame? It's t = gamma * t' = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Because if the ejecta is moving, then from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slower. So, if 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock, the Galaxy would see more time passing. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer. So, yes, t = gamma * t'. So, the time in the Galaxy is longer.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, the distance is speed multiplied by time, but the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but wait: the speed is 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. Because from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at that speed. So, the distance the ejecta travels is speed * time (in Galaxy's frame).\n\nSo, the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, distance d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s.\n\nLet me compute that: 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000, plus 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800. So total is 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's very close, but perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate gamma. v is 60,000 km/s. c is 300,000 km/s. So v = 0.2c. So, v\u00b2 = (0.2)^2 c\u00b2 = 0.04 c\u00b2. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1/sqrt(0.96) is about 1.0206. So gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.96) accurately.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.96):\n\nWe can approximate it. Let me think, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. So sqrt(0.96) is a little less than 0.98. Let me compute 0.9798^2: (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 = 0.98^2 - 2*0.98*0.0002 + (0.0002)^2 \u2248 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 \u2248 0.960008. Close enough. So sqrt(0.96)=approx 0.9798. So gamma is 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, distance d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03.\n\nLet me compute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000. 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800. So total is 3,061,800 km. But the options don't have that. Option D is 3,060,000, which is close but not exact. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more precisely. Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = t' * gamma, but wait, no. The time in the moving frame (ejecta) is t', and the time in the Galaxy (stationary) frame is t = gamma * t'. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nWait another approach: Let's compute t in Galaxy frame. So, t = gamma * t' = (1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2)) * 50. So,\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = approx 1.020604.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.020604 = 51.0302 seconds.\n\nThen, distance d = v * t = 60,000 * 51.0302 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 * 1.0302 = 60,000 *1 + 60,000 *0.0302 = 60,000 + 1,812 = 61,812.\n\nSo total d = 3,000,000 + 61,812 = 3,061,812 km. Hmm, which is approximately 3,061,812 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D: 3,060,000 km. But wait, option B is 3,000,000, which is the distance at 50 seconds without considering time dilation. So, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding which frame's time to use.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I have the time wrong. Let me think again. The problem states: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. So, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? It's more than 50 seconds, as the Galaxy is stationary and the ejecta is moving.\n\nSo, in the Galaxy's frame, the time is t = gamma * t' = 50 * gamma.\n\nBut wait, wait, I'm getting confused because perhaps the time in the Galaxy's frame is the proper time or not. No, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events happen at the same place. So, in this case, the events are: the start of the time and the end of the time. In the ejecta's frame, these two events (start and end) happen at the same place, so t' is the proper time. In the Galaxy's frame, the events are happening at different places (since the ejecta is moving), so the time is longer. So, t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, the distance would be v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.0302 s \u2248 3,061,812 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me think: perhaps I should compute using exact gamma.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved without considering relativity, which would be a mistake, but perhaps that's the case. Because 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is a significant fraction, so relativity effects are noticeable, but maybe the options approximate.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So, from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching, so the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is assuming that time is the same, which is incorrect, but maybe the intended approach is to use Galilean transformations, ignoring relativity.\n\nWait, if we ignore relativity, then time is the same in both frames. So, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So, the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame is speed * time. So, 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Which is option B.\n\nBut that can't be right, because the problem states that both are inertial frames, so relativity should apply. So, the correct approach must involve relativity.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is designed so that the answer is 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But according to my calculation, it's about 3,061,812 km, which is closest to option D, 3,060,000 km. But why is that option not matching exactly?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96).\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) more precisely.\n\nWe can use a calculator approach:\n\nsqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.979795897.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / 0.979795897 \u2248 1.02060467.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.02060467 = 51.0302335 seconds.\n\nSo, distance d = 60,000 * 51.0302335 = 60,000 * 51.0302335.\n\nCompute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.\n\n60,000 * 0.0302335 = 60,000 * 0.03 is 1,800; 60,000 * 0.0002335 is 13.98.\n\nSo, total d = 3,060,000 + 1,800 + 13.98 = 3,061,813.98 km.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the question is using the velocity addition formula incorrectly. Wait, but no, the problem states that the ejecta and Galaxy are inertial frames, so their velocities are straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the time in the ejecta's frame as the proper time, and the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by t, where t is the Galaxy's time.\n\nWait, but I'm getting the same result as before.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, so when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame? It's longer, as established.\n\nSo, the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 * t_galaxy.\n\nt_galaxy = gamma * t_ejecta = 50 * gamma \u2248 51.0302 seconds.\n\nSo, 60,000 * 51.0302 = 3,061,812 km.\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but why?\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects us to ignore time dilation, which would be wrong, but maybe that's the case. If we ignore time dilation, then t =50 seconds, so d=60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut that's a big oversight, as the speed is 20% of c. So, the time dilation effect is about 2%, leading to a 2% longer distance. So, 3,000,000 *1.0206 is about 3,061,800 km, which is about option D, which is 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects us to use gamma as 1.0206, leading to 3,061,812 km, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is phrased such that the time in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame. But that's only true when the speed is zero, which isn't the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the distance in the ejecta's frame. No, the question says, \"what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nSo, the distance in Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the Galaxy's time, which is gamma * t'.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nBut the options don't have the exact value. So perhaps the intended answer is D, 3,060,000 km, as it's the closest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate the distance in the ejecta's frame, but that doesn't make sense because the question asks about the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using a different method, such as length contraction. But in this case, the distance the ejecta travels is in the direction of motion, so length contraction would affect it.\n\nWait, wait. From the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. The distance the ejecta travels is speed * time, where time is in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is considering that the time in the ejecta's frame is dilated, so t' = t / gamma. Because t' is the proper time, which is the shortest time. So, if t is the Galaxy's time, t' = t / gamma.\n\nWait, so if in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass, then in the Galaxy's frame, t = gamma * t' = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, the distance is 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut again, that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D, 3,060,000 km, which is option D.\n\nWait, looking at the options again:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nSo, D is the closest to the correct calculation.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame over a certain time. \n\nWait, the problem says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Oh right, so that means in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at the same speed, 60,000 km/s, towards the center, right? Because if A sees B moving at v, then B sees A moving at v in the opposite direction, assuming no acceleration and same speed.\n\nBut wait, the question is a bit tricky. It says, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, so time isn't the same in both frames because of time dilation, I think. Because they're moving relative to each other, their time measurements would differ.\n\nSo, I remember that time dilation is part of special relativity. The formula for time dilation is t' = gamma * t, where gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). Wait, but here, the time given is in the ejecta's frame, which is moving relative to the Galaxy. So, from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slower.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think. Suppose in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer, because the Galaxy sees the ejecta moving. So, the time t_galaxy = t_ejecta * gamma. But wait, gamma is greater than 1, so t_galaxy is longer. \n\nWait, but in the problem, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy. Let me compute the gamma factor. First, what's 60,000 km/s in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So, 60,000 is 0.2 times c. So, v = 0.2c.\n\nGamma would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me compute that. The square root of 0.96 is about 0.9798. So 1/0.9798 is approximately 1.0206. So gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nSo, if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (t'), then in the Galaxy's frame (t), it's t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds. Hmm, but wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the time in the moving frame (ejecta) would appear longer or shorter in the Galaxy's frame? I think when you have a moving clock, it ticks slower. So, the time measured in the Galaxy would be longer. So, if t' is 50 seconds in the ejecta, then t = gamma * t' = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, no, actually, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The time measured in the moving frame (ejecta) is t', and the time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy) is t. So, t = gamma * t'. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the time that passes is longer than in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's clarify. The problem is: 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. How much time passes in the Galaxy's frame? It's t = gamma * t' = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Because if the ejecta is moving, then from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slower. So, if 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock, the Galaxy would see more time passing. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer. So, yes, t = gamma * t'. So, the time in the Galaxy is longer.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, the distance is speed multiplied by time, but the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but wait: the speed is 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. Because from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at that speed. So, the distance the ejecta travels is speed * time (in Galaxy's frame).\n\nSo, the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, distance d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s.\n\nLet me compute that: 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000, plus 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800. So total is 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's very close, but perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate gamma. v is 60,000 km/s. c is 300,000 km/s. So v = 0.2c. So, v\u00b2 = (0.2)^2 c\u00b2 = 0.04 c\u00b2. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1/sqrt(0.96) is about 1.0206. So gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.96) accurately.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.96):\n\nWe can approximate it. Let me think, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. So sqrt(0.96) is a little less than 0.98. Let me compute 0.9798^2: (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 = 0.98^2 - 2*0.98*0.0002 + (0.0002)^2 \u2248 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 \u2248 0.960008. Close enough. So sqrt(0.96)=approx 0.9798. So gamma is 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, distance d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03.\n\nLet me compute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000. 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800. So total is 3,061,800 km. But the options don't have that. Option D is 3,060,000, which is close but not exact. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more precisely. Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = t' * gamma, but wait, no. The time in the moving frame (ejecta) is t', and the time in the Galaxy (stationary) frame is t = gamma * t'. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nWait another approach: Let's compute t in Galaxy frame. So, t = gamma * t' = (1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2)) * 50. So,\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = approx 1.020604.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.020604 = 51.0302 seconds.\n\nThen, distance d = v * t = 60,000 * 51.0302 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 * 1.0302 = 60,000 *1 + 60,000 *0.0302 = 60,000 + 1,812 = 61,812.\n\nSo total d = 3,000,000 + 61,812 = 3,061,812 km. Hmm, which is approximately 3,061,812 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D: 3,060,000 km. But wait, option B is 3,000,000, which is the distance at 50 seconds without considering time dilation. So, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding which frame's time to use.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I have the time wrong. Let me think again. The problem states: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. So, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? It's more than 50 seconds, as the Galaxy is stationary and the ejecta is moving.\n\nSo, in the Galaxy's frame, the time is t = gamma * t' = 50 * gamma.\n\nBut wait, wait, I'm getting confused because perhaps the time in the Galaxy's frame is the proper time or not. No, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events happen at the same place. So, in this case, the events are: the start of the time and the end of the time. In the ejecta's frame, these two events (start and end) happen at the same place, so t' is the proper time. In the Galaxy's frame, the events are happening at different places (since the ejecta is moving), so the time is longer. So, t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, the distance would be v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.0302 s \u2248 3,061,812 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me think: perhaps I should compute using exact gamma.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved without considering relativity, which would be a mistake, but perhaps that's the case. Because 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is a significant fraction, so relativity effects are noticeable, but maybe the options approximate.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So, from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching, so the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is assuming that time is the same, which is incorrect, but maybe the intended approach is to use Galilean transformations, ignoring relativity.\n\nWait, if we ignore relativity, then time is the same in both frames. So, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So, the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame is speed * time. So, 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Which is option B.\n\nBut that can't be right, because the problem states that both are inertial frames, so relativity should apply. So, the correct approach must involve relativity.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is designed so that the answer is 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But according to my calculation, it's about 3,061,812 km, which is closest to option D, 3,060,000 km. But why is that option not matching exactly?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96).\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) more precisely.\n\nWe can use a calculator approach:\n\nsqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.979795897.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / 0.979795897 \u2248 1.02060467.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.02060467 = 51.0302335 seconds.\n\nSo, distance d = 60,000 * 51.0302335 = 60,000 * 51.0302335.\n\nCompute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.\n\n60,000 * 0.0302335 = 60,000 * 0.03 is 1,800; 60,000 * 0.0002335 is 13.98.\n\nSo, total d = 3,060,000 + 1,800 + 13.98 = 3,061,813.98 km.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the question is using the velocity addition formula incorrectly. Wait, but no, the problem states that the ejecta and Galaxy are inertial frames, so their velocities are straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the time in the ejecta's frame as the proper time, and the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by t, where t is the Galaxy's time.\n\nWait, but I'm getting the same result as before.\n\nWait, let me think again.

The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but why?\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects us to ignore time dilation, which would be wrong, but maybe that's the case. If we ignore time dilation, then t =50 seconds, so d=60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.\n\nBut that's a big oversight, as the speed is 20% of c. So, the time dilation effect is about 2%, leading to a 2% longer distance. So, 3,000,000 *1.0206 is about 3,061,800 km, which is about option D, which is 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects us to use gamma as 1.0206, leading to 3,061,812 km, but the options don't have that.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to break this down. The question is about relative velocity and how distances change between different reference frames. Alright, let's see.\n\nSo the scenario is that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. That's important because in special relativity, transformations between inertial frames are simpler. So we can probably use the classical velocity addition formula here, but wait\u2014maybe not, because when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects matter. Oh wait, the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me calculate how fast that is compared to the speed of light.\n\nThe speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 1/5th of that. Oh, that's a fifth, which is 0.2c. That's a pretty high speed, so relativistic effects might be non-negligible. But wait, the question is asking about the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So I think we're dealing with time dilation here, or perhaps length contraction.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify the problem. The ejecta's frame is moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards it at that speed. But the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the ejecta part is moving directly towards the center, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s. But wait, no, the problem says the ejecta is part of the supernova, which is in the Galaxy. So maybe the ejecta is moving away from the Galaxy? Or towards it. Wait, the problem says the ejecta is moving towards the center. Oh, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some speed. But in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So the velocity is from the ejecta's frame: the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the relative velocity between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. Now, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass, and we need to find how much distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during that time.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is phrased: \"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nWait, so in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. We need to find the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during that time.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the time would be different due to time dilation. So first, I need to find the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but wait. If the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at speed v (60,000 km/s), then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at speed v. But the time experienced in each frame would depend on the Lorentz factor. So perhaps I can use the Lorentz transformation to find the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but how are the two frames moving relative to each other? Let me clarify the setup. Let's say the Galaxy is at rest in the S frame, and the ejecta is moving in the opposite direction at velocity v. So the ejecta's frame, S', is moving at velocity v relative to S. So in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the center (S's origin) at velocity v. So the relative velocity is v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but in the S' frame (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity v. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, what is the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame?\n\nBut the problem is to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during that time. So the distance would be velocity multiplied by time, but what is the time in the Galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the time dilation factor. The time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer than the ejecta's frame if the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of c.\n\nSo, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let me compute v: 60,000 km/s is 0.2c. So v = 0.2c. Let's compute gamma.\n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.98 \u2248 1.0204.\n\nSo the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t'. Where t' is 50 seconds. So t \u2248 1.0204 * 50 \u2248 51.02 seconds.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. Wait, time dilation occurs when a clock is moving relative to the observer. So in the S frame (Galaxy), the ejecta's clock is running slow. So if the ejecta's frame measures t' =50 seconds, then the Galaxy would measure a longer time, t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo in the Galaxy's frame, the time that passes is longer. So t = gamma * t' \u2248 1.0204 * 50 \u2248 51.02 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by t. So v is 60,000 km/s, t is approximately 51.02 seconds.\n\nSo distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.02 = 3,061,200 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Close enough, considering the approximations. But wait, wait\u2014did I make a mistake in the gamma calculation?\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more accurately. v=0.2c. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2=0.04. 1 - 0.04=0.96. sqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.9798. So 1/0.9798\u22481.0203. So gamma is approximately 1.0203.\n\nSo 50 seconds in the ejecta frame becomes approximately 50 * 1.0203 = 51.015 seconds in the Galaxy frame.\n\nMultiply by velocity (60,000 km/s): 51.015 *60,000 = let's compute that.\n\n51 *60,000 = 3,060,000 km. 0.015 *60,000 = 900 km. So total is 3,060,900 km. So approximately 3,060,900 km. The option D is 3,060,000 km. That's the closest.\n\nWait, but why is this approach correct? Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, so the distance is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the velocity addition formula to find the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame, but wait, in this case, the ejecta is moving at v in the Galaxy's frame, so perhaps I don't need that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Because the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame. So in that frame, the time is 50 seconds as measured in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no\u2014wait, no. The problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, I need to find how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame during those 50 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Maybe the distance is simply v multiplied by t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. So yes, that's what I did.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is intended to be approached without considering relativity. Let me check. If I ignore relativity, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, so in 50 seconds, the distance is 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km. Which is option B. But wait, that's a big discrepancy from the relativistic calculation.\n\nSo which approach is correct? The problem says both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So perhaps we are to use the classical approach. But wait, the speed is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c. At that speed, relativistic effects are significant enough that ignoring them would be incorrect.\n\nWait, but the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. It doesn't say anything about relativity. Hmm. The problem is a bit ambiguous on whether to apply relativity or not. But given that the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, I think the problem expects a relativistic approach.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again about the problem statement. The question is, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v=60,000 km/s. So the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy is closing at that speed, as per the ejecta's perspective. But in reality, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at v=60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. We need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame, then multiply by the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame to get the distance.\n\nSo using time dilation: the proper time is in the ejecta's frame, so t' = 50 s. The Galaxy's frame will see a longer time, t = gamma * t'. Because the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = (1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) * t'.\n\nWait, v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c. So v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 0.04. So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0203.\n\nSo t = 1.0203 * 50 \u2248 51.015 seconds.\n\nDistance in Galaxy frame: v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.015 s \u2248 3,060,900 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D: 3,060,000 km. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps using length contraction. Let me think. In the ejecta's frame, the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy is contracted. Wait, no, the distance is in the direction of motion, so in the ejecta's frame, the length (distance) between them is L' = L / gamma, where L is the proper length in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance the ejecta moves is v multiplied by that longer time.\n\nWait, yes, that's the same as before. So the correct approach is to calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame as longer, leading to a larger distance.\n\nSo the answer would be option D: 3,060,000 km.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see.\n\nThe problem says that the supernova ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, no, wait\u2014wait, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy's center in the galaxy's frame. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at 60,000 km/s. But from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at that speed. So that makes sense because in inertial frames, the relative speed is the same in opposite directions.\n\nThe question is asking: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, so the time given is in the ejecta's frame, and we need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, time dilation comes into play here because the two frames are moving relative to each other. So the time experienced in each frame isn't the same. Oh yeah, special relativity. So I'll need to use the Lorentz factor here.\n\nSo, the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), where v is the relative speed. Let's compute that. The speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that into meters per second for calculation purposes because I remember c is about 3e8 m/s.\n\n60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s, which is 6e7 m/s. Wait, no\u2014wait: 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 60,000 km is 6e4 km. So 6e4 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. But wait, the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 6e7 is 0.2c because 0.2 * 3e8 is 6e7. So v = 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let me calculate that. Sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98, but let me get a more precise value. Let's see, 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is a bit more than 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is bigger than 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is a bit less than 0.98. Let me compute it more accurately. Maybe 0.9798 is a better approximation. Let me compute 0.9798 squared: 0.9798 * 0.9798. Let's calculate: 0.98^2 is 0.9604. Subtract 0.0002*2*0.98, since (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2. Wait, maybe it's easier to use a calculator approach. Hmm, alternatively, maybe I can just use the exact expression for gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately. Let's see, 0.96 is 96/100. The square root of 96 is approximately 9.798, so sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, as I thought. So gamma is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. So gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nNow, the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So in the galaxy's frame, how much time passes? Or wait, wait\u2014no, because the time in the ejecta's frame is the proper time, I think. Wait, no, wait. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. But in this case, the movement is between the two frames. So when an object is moving relative to a frame, the time in that frame is dilated.\n\nWait, but in this case, the ejecta is moving at v relative to the galaxy. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is running slower. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, the time in the galaxy's frame (t) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (t') by t = gamma * t' when the events happen at the same place in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe time measured in the galaxy's frame would be longer than in the ejecta's frame if the events are happening at the same place in the ejecta's frame. Wait, but in this case, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy, so perhaps the time experienced in the galaxy is longer. Wait, no, the time in the galaxy frame is longer because the ejecta is moving relative to the galaxy.\n\nWait, the formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t', where t' is the proper time. But wait, the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame where the two events (start and end of the time interval) happen at the same place. So in this case, the events (ejecta starting its journey and ending it) are happening at different places in the galaxy's frame, so maybe proper time is in the ejecta's frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time in the galaxy's frame (t) is longer than the time in the ejecta's frame (t'), so t = gamma * t'. So if t' is 50 seconds, t would be gamma * 50. But wait, gamma is approximately 1.0206, so t \u2248 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 50.103 seconds. That's a small difference, but perhaps it's necessary.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So if the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame is v = 60,000 km/s, then the distance would be v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but wait. No, because from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the distance it travels is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma * t'?\n\nWait, perhaps. So, distance in galaxy frame is v * t, where t is the time in galaxy frame. So t = gamma * t'. So distance = v * gamma * t'.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me get the correct formula.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v. The time elapsed in the galaxy's frame is t. The time in the ejecta's frame is t' = t / gamma. Because from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at speed v, so their time is dilated. So if t is the time in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's frame time is t' = t / gamma. So t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves for t = gamma * t' seconds, and distance is v * t.\n\nSo substituting, distance = v * gamma * t'.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. v is 6e7 m/s, t' is 50 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, let me make sure about the units. The speed is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second. 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s = 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Oh wait, no: 1 km is 1e3 m, so 60,000 km is 6e4 km. So 6e4 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s.\n\nWait, no, 60,000 km/s is 60,000 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. So yes, v = 6e7 m/s.\n\nGamma is approximately 1.0206, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo t' is 50 seconds. So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo the distance in the galaxy's frame is v * t = 6e7 m/s * 51.03 s.\n\nWait, 6e7 m/s is 60,000 km/s, so perhaps it's easier to compute in km and seconds. Let me think in km.\n\nv is 60,000 km/s. t is 51.03 seconds. So distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km.\n\nCalculating that: 60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000, and 60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Close to 3,061,800. But wait, perhaps my approximation of gamma was too rough.\n\nLet me compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nv = 6e7 m/s, c = 3e8 m/s.\n\nv\u00b2 = (6e7)^2 = 3.6e15 m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nc\u00b2 = (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3.6e15 / 9e16 = 0.04.\n\nSo 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, so gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. So my earlier approximation was correct.\n\nSo the calculation gives 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 3,061,800 km. But the options don't have this. The options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm, so 3,061,800 is closest to option D (3,060,000 km). But perhaps the approximation is causing a slight discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I should think about it differently. Maybe the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, but perhaps the distance is calculated using the time in the ejecta's frame multiplied by the velocity, but adjusted by the Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the distance in the ejecta's frame and then apply length contraction.\n\nWait, no, that might complicate things. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the distance it travels is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nThe time in the galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t'. So the distance is v * gamma * t'.\n\nLet me compute that. v = 6e4 km/s. t' =50 s.\n\nGamma is 1.0206, so t = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nSo distance is 6e4 * 51.03 = 60,000 * 51.03 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800.\n\nSo total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D: 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the answer is D.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely. Let's compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96). Let's use a better approximation.\n\nI know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604. So 0.98^2 is 0.9604. Which is 0.0004 above 0.96.\n\nSo to find sqrt(0.96), perhaps we can use a Taylor expansion or linear approximation around x=0.9604.\n\nLet me think, let x = 0.96, and a = 0.98, a^2 = 0.9604.\n\nWe can approximate sqrt(x) around a^2 = x0=0.9604, so x = x0 - 0.0004.\n\nThe function is f(x) = sqrt(x). The derivative f\u2019(x) = 1/(2 sqrt(x)).\n\nSo f(x) \u2248 f(x0) + f\u2019(x0) (x - x0).\n\nHere, x0 is 0.9604, and x is 0.96. So x - x0 = -0.0004.\n\nf(x0) = sqrt(0.9604) = 0.98.\n\nf\u2019(x0) = 1/(2 * 0.98) = 1/(1.96) \u2248 0.5102.\n\nSo f(x) \u2248 0.98 + 0.5102 * (-0.0004) = 0.98 - 0.00020408 \u2248 0.97979592.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.97979592.\n\nThus, gamma is 1 / 0.97979592 \u2248 1.020623.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020623.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = 1.020623 *50 = 51.03115 seconds.\n\nSo distance in galaxy frame is v * t = 6e4 km/s *51.03115 s.\n\n6e4 is 60,000 km/s.\n\n60,000 *51.03115 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 *50=3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.03115=60,000 *1 =60,000, plus 60,000 *0.03115=1,869.\n\nSo 60,000 + 1,869 =61,869.\n\nSo 3,000,000 +61,869 =3,061,869 km.\n\nHmm, that's 3,061,869 km, which is about 3,061,900 km. So when rounded, that's approximately 3,062,000 km, but the option D is 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should use more precise calculation for gamma.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should compute gamma as 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using more precise calculation for sqrt(0.96).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a calculator, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798 (as I thought earlier), so gamma is 1.0206.\n\nSo with t =50 *1.0206 =51.03 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 km/s *51.03 s = 60,000 *51.03 =3,061,800 km.\n\nSo the closest option is D: 3,060,000 km. But wait, the calculated value is 3,061,800, which is 1,800 km more than option D. Hmm, perhaps the question expects us to neglect the time dilation and simply compute the distance as v * t', which would be 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km. That's option B.\n\nBut wait, that would ignore the time dilation effect, which doesn't make sense because the frames are moving relative to each other. So why would the question present such a scenario if time dilation isn't considered?\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is the proper time, and the galaxy's frame would see the ejecta moving for a longer time. So the distance is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute v * gamma * t'.\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nv =60,000 km/s.\n\ngamma =1.0206.\n\nt' =50 s.\n\nSo distance =60,000 *1.0206 *50.\n\nWait, 60,000 *50 =3,000,000.\n\nThen 3,000,000 *1.0206 =3,061,800 km.\n\nHmm, that's 3,061,800 km, which isn't one of the options exactly. The options are A:2.94e6, B:3e6, C:2.88e6, D:3.06e6.\n\nWait, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is 3.06e6, so 3,060,000 is exactly 3,060,000. So perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation, and the answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the time.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the time in the galaxy's frame. But the question states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So perhaps I should compute the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during the time that the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds. So that would be v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo the calculation would be 60,000 * gamma *50 =60,000 *1.0206 *50.\n\nWait, 60,000 *50=3e6. 3e6 *1.0206=3,061,800 km.\n\nSo that's 3,061,800 km. Which is 3.0618e6 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3.06e6 km, which is 3,060,000 km. So it's very close. Perhaps the problem expects the answer to be rounded to the nearest 10,000 km, or perhaps the exact calculation would lead to 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more precisely.\n\nv =6e7 m/s.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\nv^2/c^2= (6e7)^2/(3e8)^2 = (36e14)/(9e16) )= 36/9e(14-16)=4e-2=0.04.\n\nSo 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2=0.96.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96)= let me compute using a calculator approach. Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nWe can use the Newton-Raphson method to find sqrt(0.96).\n\nLet me guess x0=0.98.\n\nx1 = 0.5*(x0 + 0.96/x0).\n\nx0=0.98.\n\nx1 = 0.5*(0.98 + 0.96/0.98) = 0.5*(0.98 + 0.9795918) = 0.5*(1.9595918) =0.9797959.\n\nNow compute x1 squared: (0.9797959)^2 = ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n(0.9797959)^2 = (approx) 0.9797959 * 0.9797959.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n0.9797959 * 0.9797959.\n\nLet me think of it as (0.98 - 0.0002041)^2.\n\nWhich is 0.98^2 - 2*0.98*0.0002041 + (0.0002041)^2.\n\n0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2 *0.98 *0.0002041 = 0.000400.\n\n(0.0002041)^2 \u22484.16e-8, which is negligible.\n\nSo 0.9604 - 0.0004 = 0.9600.\n\nWhich matches our target of 0.96, so x1 is a good approximation: 0.9797959.\n\nSo gamma is 1/x1 = 1/0.9797959 \u22481.020623.\n\nSo with gamma=1.020623, t=50 *1.020623=51.03115 s.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 km/s *51.03115 s =60,000 *51.03115 =3,061,869 km.\n\nWhich is approximately 3,061,869 km. So the closest option is D:3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an approximate gamma of 1.02, leading to t=50.1 seconds, and distance=60,000 *50.1 =3,006,000 km, which would be 3.006e6 km. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to use the time in the ejecta's frame multiplied by the velocity in the galaxy's frame, but without considering time dilation. That would give 60,000 km/s *50 s=3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would be incorrect because it ignores the time dilation effect. So why would the problem present the scenario if it's not relevant?\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the velocity in the ejecta's frame. But no, because the question says the ejecta's frame is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s, so in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the answer is simply 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km, but that would be ignoring relativity. But since the problem states that both are inertial frames, we have to account for time dilation.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the distance in the galaxy's frame as the product of velocity and time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame, time is longer. So t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo distance = v * t = v * gamma * t'.\n\nSo that's 60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nGamma is approximately 1.0206, so 60,000 *1.0206 =61,236 km/s.\n\n61,236 km/s *50 s =3,061,800 km.\n\nWhich is 3,061,800 km, which is approximately 3,060,000 km (option D).\n\nSo I think the correct answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see.\n\nThe problem says that the supernova ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, no, wait\u2014wait, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy's center in the galaxy's frame. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at 60,000 km/s. But from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at that speed. So that makes sense because in inertial frames, the relative speed is the same in opposite directions.\n\nThe question is asking: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, so the time given is in the ejecta's frame, and we need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, time dilation comes into play here because the two frames are moving relative to each other. So the time experienced in each frame isn't the same. Oh yeah, special relativity. So I'll need to use the Lorentz factor here.\n\nSo, the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), where v is the relative speed. Let's compute that. The speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that into meters per second for calculation purposes because I remember c is about 3e8 m/s.\n\n60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s, which is 6e7 m/s. Wait, no\u2014wait: 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 60,000 km is 6e4 km. So 6e4 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. But wait, the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 6e7 is 0.2c because 0.2 * 3e8 is 6e7. So v = 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let me calculate that. Sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98, but let me get a more precise value. Let's see, 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is a bit more than 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is bigger than 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is a bit less than 0.98. Let me compute it more accurately. Maybe 0.9798 is a better approximation. Let me compute 0.9798 squared: 0.9798 * 0.9798. Let's calculate: 0.98^2 is 0.9604. Subtract 0.0002*2*0.98, since (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2. Wait, maybe it's easier to use a calculator approach. Hmm, alternatively, maybe I can just use the exact expression for gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately. Let's see, 0.96 is 96/100. The square root of 96 is approximately 9.798, so sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, as I thought. So gamma is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. So gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nNow, the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So in the galaxy's frame, how much time passes? Or wait, wait\u2014no, because the time in the ejecta's frame is the proper time, I think. Wait, no, wait. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. But in this case, the movement is between the two frames. So when an object is moving relative to a frame, the time in that frame is dilated.\n\nWait, but in this case, the ejecta is moving at v relative to the galaxy. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is running slower. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame?\n\nWait, the time in the galaxy's frame (t) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (t') by t = gamma * t' when the events happen at the same place in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe time measured in the galaxy's frame would be longer than in the ejecta's frame if the events are happening at the same place in the ejecta's frame. Wait, but in this case, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy, so perhaps the time experienced in the galaxy is longer. Wait, no, the time in the galaxy frame is longer because the ejecta is moving relative to the galaxy.\n\nWait, the formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t', where t' is the proper time. But wait, the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame where the two events (start and end of the time interval) happen at the same place. So in this case, the events (ejecta starting its journey and ending it) are happening at different places in the galaxy's frame, so maybe proper time is in the ejecta's frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time in the galaxy's frame (t) is longer than the time in the ejecta's frame (t'), so t = gamma * t'. So if t' is 50 seconds, t would be gamma * 50. But wait, gamma is approximately 1.0206, so t \u2248 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 50.103 seconds. That's a small difference, but perhaps it's necessary.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So if the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame is v = 60,000 km/s, then the distance would be v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but wait. No, because from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the distance it travels is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma * t'?\n\nWait, perhaps. So, distance in galaxy frame is v * t, where t is the time in galaxy frame. So t = gamma * t'. So distance = v * gamma * t'.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me get the correct formula.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v. The time elapsed in the galaxy's frame is t. The time in the ejecta's frame is t' = t / gamma. Because from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at speed v, so their time is dilated. So if t is the time in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's frame time is t' = t / gamma. So t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves for t = gamma * t' seconds, and distance is v * t.\n\nSo substituting, distance = v * gamma * t'.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. v is 6e7 m/s, t' is 50 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, let me make sure about the units. The speed is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second. 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s = 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Oh wait, no: 1 km is 1e3 m, so 60,000 km is 6e4 km. So 6e4 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s.\n\nWait, no, 60,000 km/s is 60,000 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. So yes, v = 6e7 m/s.\n\nGamma is approximately 1.0206, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo t' is 50 seconds. So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo the distance in the galaxy's frame is v * t = 6e7 m/s * 51.03 s.\n\nWait, 6e7 m/s is 60,000 km/s, so perhaps it's easier to compute in km and seconds. Let me think in km.\n\nv is 60,000 km/s. t is 51.03 seconds. So distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km.\n\nCalculating that: 60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000, and 60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Close to 3,061,800. But wait, perhaps my approximation of gamma was too rough.\n\nLet me compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nv = 6e7 m/s, c = 3e8 m/s.\n\nv\u00b2 = (6e7)^2 = 3.6e15 m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nc\u00b2 = (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3.6e15 / 9e16 = 0.04.\n\nSo 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, so gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. So my earlier approximation was correct.\n\nSo the calculation gives 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 3,061,800 km. But the options don't have this. The options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm, so 3,061,800 is closest to option D (3,060,000 km). But perhaps the approximation is causing a slight discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I should think about it differently. Maybe the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, but perhaps the distance is calculated using the time in the ejecta's frame multiplied by the velocity, but adjusted by the Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the distance in the ejecta's frame and then apply length contraction.\n\nWait, no, that might complicate things. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the distance it travels is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nThe time in the galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t'. So the distance is v * gamma * t'.\n\nLet me compute that. v = 6e4 km/s. t' =50 s.\n\nGamma is 1.0206, so t = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nSo distance is 6e4 * 51.03 = 60,000 * 51.03 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800.\n\nSo total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D: 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the answer is D.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely. Let's compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96). Let's use a better approximation.\n\nI know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604. So 0.98^2 is 0.9604. Which is 0.0004 above 0.96.\n\nSo to find sqrt(0.96), perhaps we can use a Taylor expansion or linear approximation around x=0.9604.\n\nLet me think, let x = 0.96, and a = 0.98, a^2 = 0.9604.\n\nWe can approximate sqrt(x) around a^2 = x0=0.9604, so x = x0 - 0.0004.\n\nThe function is f(x) = sqrt(x). The derivative f\u2019(x) = 1/(2 sqrt(x)).\n\nSo f(x) \u2248 f(x0) + f\u2019(x0) (x - x0).\n\nHere, x0 is 0.9604, and x is 0.96. So x - x0 = -0.0004.\n\nf(x0) = sqrt(0.9604) = 0.98.\n\nf\u2019(x0) = 1/(2 * 0.98) = 1/(1.96) \u2248 0.5102.\n\nSo f(x) \u2248 0.98 + 0.5102 * (-0.0004) = 0.98 - 0.00020408 \u2248 0.97979592.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.97979592.\n\nThus, gamma is 1 / 0.97979592 \u2248 1.020623.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020623.\n\nSo t = gamma * t' = 1.020623 *50 = 51.03115 seconds.\n\nSo distance in galaxy frame is v * t = 6e4 km/s *51.03115 s.\n\n6e4 is 60,000 km/s.\n\n60,000 *51.03115 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 *50=3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.03115=60,000 *1 =60,000, plus 60,000 *0.03115=1,869.\n\nSo 60,000 + 1,869 =61,869.\n\nSo 3,000,000 +61,869 =3,061,869 km.\n\nHmm, that's 3,061,869 km, which is about 3,061,900 km. So when rounded, that's approximately 3,062,000 km, but the option D is 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should use more precise calculation for gamma.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should compute gamma as 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using more precise calculation for sqrt(0.96).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a calculator, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798 (as I thought earlier), so gamma is 1.0206.\n\nSo with t =50 *1.0206 =51.03 seconds.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 km/s *51.03 s = 60,000 *51.03 =3,061,800 km.\n\nSo the closest option is D: 3,060,000 km. But wait, the calculated value is 3,061,800, which is 1,800 km more than option D. Hmm, perhaps the question expects us to neglect the time dilation and simply compute the distance as v * t', which would be 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km. That's option B.\n\nBut wait, that would ignore the time dilation effect, which doesn't make sense because the frames are moving relative to each other. So why would the question present such a scenario if time dilation isn't considered?\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is the proper time, and the galaxy's frame would see the ejecta moving for a longer time. So the distance is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute v * gamma * t'.\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nv =60,000 km/s.\n\ngamma =1.0206.\n\nt' =50 s.\n\nSo distance =60,000 *1.0206 *50.\n\nWait, 60,000 *50 =3,000,000.\n\nThen 3,000,000 *1.0206 =3,061,800 km.\n\nHmm, that's 3,061,800 km, which isn't one of the options exactly. The options are A:2.94e6, B:3e6, C:2.88e6, D:3.06e6.\n\nWait, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is 3.06e6, so 3,060,000 is exactly 3,060,000. So perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation, and the answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the time.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the time in the galaxy's frame. But the question states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So perhaps I should compute the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during the time that the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds. So that would be v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo the calculation would be 60,000 * gamma *50 =60,000 *1.0206 *50.\n\nWait, 60,000 *50=3e6. 3e6 *1.0206=3,061,800 km.\n\nSo that's 3,061,800 km. Which is 3.0618e6 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3.06e6 km, which is 3,060,000 km. So it's very close. Perhaps the problem expects the answer to be rounded to the nearest 10,000 km, or perhaps the exact calculation would lead to 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more precisely.\n\nv =6e7 m/s.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\nv^2/c^2= (6e7)^2/(3e8)^2 = (36e14)/(9e16) )= 36/9e(14-16)=4e-2=0.04.\n\nSo 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2=0.96.\n\nSo sqrt(0.96)= let me compute using a calculator approach. Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nWe can use the Newton-Raphson method to find sqrt(0.96).\n\nLet me guess x0=0.98.\n\nx1 = 0.5*(x0 + 0.96/x0).\n\nx0=0.98.\n\nx1 = 0.5*(0.98 + 0.96/0.98) = 0.5*(0.98 + 0.9795918) = 0.5*(1.9595918) =0.9797959.\n\nNow compute x1 squared: (0.9797959)^2 = ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n(0.9797959)^2 = (approx) 0.9797959 * 0.9797959.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n0.9797959 * 0.9797959.\n\nLet me think of it as (0.98 - 0.0002041)^2.\n\nWhich is 0.98^2 - 2*0.98*0.0002041 + (0.0002041)^2.\n\n0.98^2 = 0.9604.\n\n2 *0.98 *0.0002041 = 0.000400.\n\n(0.0002041)^2 \u22484.16e-8, which is negligible.\n\nSo 0.9604 - 0.0004 = 0.9600.\n\nWhich matches our target of 0.96, so x1 is a good approximation: 0.9797959.\n\nSo gamma is 1/x1 = 1/0.9797959 \u22481.020623.\n\nSo with gamma=1.020623, t=50 *1.020623=51.03115 s.\n\nSo distance is 60,000 km/s *51.03115 s =60,000 *51.03115 =3,061,869 km.\n\nWhich is approximately 3,061,869 km. So the closest option is D:3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an approximate gamma of 1.02, leading to t=50.1 seconds, and distance=60,000 *50.1 =3,006,000 km, which would be 3.006e6 km. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to use the time in the ejecta's frame multiplied by the velocity in the galaxy's frame, but without considering time dilation. That would give 60,000 km/s *50 s=3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would be incorrect because it ignores the time dilation effect. So why would the problem present the scenario if it's not relevant?\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the velocity in the ejecta's frame. But no, because the question says the ejecta's frame is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s, so in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the answer is simply 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km, but that would be ignoring relativity. But since the problem states that both are inertial frames, we have to account for time dilation.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the distance in the galaxy's frame as the product of velocity and time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame, time is longer. So t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo distance = v * t = v * gamma * t'.\n\nSo that's 60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nGamma is approximately 1.0206, so 60,000 *1.0206 =61,236 km/s.\n\n61,236 km/s *50 s =3,061,800 km.\n\nWhich is 3,061,800 km, which is approximately 3,060,000 km (option D).\n\nSo I think the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference, considering special relativity due to the relative velocity between the two frames.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Relative Velocity**: The ejecta moves at \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) (or \\( 6 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)) towards the Galaxy's center.\n2. **Time in Ejecta Frame**: \\( t' = 50 \\, \\text{s} \\).\n3. **Galaxy Frame Time**: Due to time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame is \\( t = \\gamma t' \\), where \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \\).\n4. **Distance in Galaxy Frame**: The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is \\( d = v \\cdot t \\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (\\( \\gamma \\))\nThe Lorentz factor is given by:\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( v = 6 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{m/s} \\) and \\( c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \\frac{(6 \\times 10^7)^2}{(3 \\times 10^8)^2} = \\frac{36 \\times 10^{14}}{9 \\times 10^{16}} = 0.04\n\\]\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Time in Galaxy Frame\nThe time in the Galaxy's frame is:\n\\[\nt = \\gamma t' = 1.0206 \\cdot 50 \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Distance Traveled in Galaxy Frame\nThe distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is:\n\\[\nd = v \\cdot t = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\cdot 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options\nThe calculated distance is approximately \\( 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\), which is closest to option **D: 3,060,000 km**.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe question says that a supernova occurs, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, which means no acceleration involved. So, from the ejecta's frame of reference, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, wait. Oh right, because time can dilate in different frames. So, since the frames are moving relative to each other, the time experienced in each frame isn't the same. I remember something about the Lorentz factor here.\n\nSo, the situation is like this: the ejecta is moving at velocity v relative to the Galaxy. From the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards them at v. But we're given the velocity from the ejecta's frame, so I think I need to find the actual velocity from the Galaxy's frame first.\n\nWait, no, no. Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh, right, the velocity from one frame to another is found using the velocity addition formula. But wait, in this case, the problem states that both are inertial frames. So, maybe I can use the time dilation effect to find the distance.\n\nHmm, okay, let's think. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. Because in Newtonian physics, velocities are opposite, but in relativity, it's a bit more involved. Oh wait, but the problem states that both are inertial, so perhaps we can treat it as a simple velocity.\n\nWait, but the problem says the ejecta part is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. So, from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is v, which is 60,000 km/s towards the center. But from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at that same speed. So, wait, that can't be right because in reality, the relative speed can't exceed the speed of light, but 60,000 km/s is way less than c (which is about 300,000 km/s). So, it's fine.\n\nBut then, the problem is about time. 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame? Because the time in each frame is different due to time dilation.\n\nThe time dilation formula is t' = gamma * t, where t is the time in the other frame. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the events happen at the same place. So, if the ejecta is moving, then the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer than the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, the time experienced in the moving frame (ejecta) would be shorter if the events are happening at different places. Hmm, maybe I should draw a spacetime diagram.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Lorentz transformation equations. The time in the Galaxy's frame (t) and the time in the ejecta's frame (t') are related by t' = gamma (t - (v x)/c\u00b2). But wait, in this case, the x is the distance the ejecta has moved, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of velocity and time.\n\nWait, let's model the situation. Let's say in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v = 60,000 km/s. So, the distance the ejecta travels in time t (Galaxy's frame) is d = v * t.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, I need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame, then compute the distance.\n\nSo, the problem is to find d, the distance in the Galaxy's frame, given that t' (ejecta's time) is 50 seconds. So, I need to find t in the Galaxy's frame, then compute d = v * t.\n\nBut wait, how are t and t' related? Using time dilation, the proper time (which is the time measured in the rest frame of the moving object) is t' = t / gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Or wait, no, the proper time is the smallest time. So, if the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy, the time in the ejecta's frame (t') is the proper time, and the Galaxy's frame (t) would see it as longer.\n\nWait, no, I think I got that wrong. Proper time is the time experienced by the moving clock. So, if the ejecta is moving, the time measured in the ejecta's frame (t') is the proper time, and the Galaxy's frame would see this as t = gamma * t'.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think. Suppose you have two events happening at the same place in the ejecta's frame. So, the proper time is t'. The Galaxy's frame would see these events happening at different places, so the time t would be longer. So, yes, t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nBut wait, let me compute gamma first. v is 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to m/s for calculation, or perhaps keep it in km/s for now.\n\nWait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. The speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. So, v is 0.2c (since 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2). So, v = 0.2c.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is the proper time t' in the ejecta's frame the time between two events at the same location in that frame? In this case, the two events would be the start and end of the 50-second interval in the ejecta's frame. So, from the Galaxy's frame, the time between these events is longer by a factor of gamma.\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, so the distance it covers in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nSo, the distance d = v * t.\n\nv is 60,000 km/s. t is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So, maybe my approximation is a bit off.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s.\n\nSo, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (6e4)^2 / (3e5)^2 = (36e8)/(9e10) ) = 4e-2 = 0.04.\n\nSo, 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 = 51.03 s.\n\nSo, d = 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options are in increments of 60,000 km. So, 3,060,000 is option D.\n\nWait, but why is the calculation not matching exactly? Let me think if I did everything correctly.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps using the velocity addition formula to find the correct velocity in the Galaxy's frame, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.\n\nWait, no, because the problem says that both are inertial frames. So, perhaps the velocity is just 60,000 km/s as measured in the Galaxy's frame. So, the problem is just a straightforward time dilation issue.\n\nWait, but another thought: the problem says the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v, which is 60,000 km/s. So, the distance it travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in that frame, which is t = gamma * t'.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: perhaps the distance in the ejecta's frame is d' = v' * t', where v' is the speed of the Galaxy from the ejecta's frame. But since the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, the distance the ejecta moves in its own frame would be zero, because the ejecta is stationary in its own frame. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it using the Lorentz transformations. Let me try that.\n\nIn the Galaxy's frame (let's call it frame S), the ejecta is moving at velocity v = 60,000 km/s towards the center (so along the negative x-axis, perhaps). So, in frame S, the ejecta's position at time t is x = v * t.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (frame S'), which is moving at velocity v relative to S, the position of the center of the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity v. So, in S', the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s.\n\nBut the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, that suggests that in S', the velocity of the center is u' = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta (i.e., in the negative x' direction). But according to the velocity addition formula, the velocity u of the center in S (Galaxy's frame) is given by u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c^2)).\n\nWait, but u in frame S is the velocity of the center of the Galaxy as seen from S. But wait, in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so the center is stationary, and the ejecta is moving towards it. So, the velocity of the center in S is zero. So, u=0.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me get the velocity addition formula correctly.\n\nThe velocity addition formula is: u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nIn this case, u is the velocity of the center in frame S (Galaxy's frame), and u' is the velocity of the center in frame S' (ejecta's frame). So, u' is given as 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta (which is in the opposite direction of v).\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should set up the coordinate systems correctly.\n\nLet's say in frame S (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving with velocity v = +60,000 km/s (towards the center, which is at x=0, so perhaps the ejecta is moving towards x=0). So, in frame S', the velocity of the center (which is at rest in S) is u' = ?\n\nWait, the velocity addition formula gives u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)). Because S' is moving at velocity v relative to S.\n\nIn S, the center is stationary, so u = 0.\n\nSo, u' = (0 - v) / (1 - (0 * v)/c\u00b2) ) = -v.\n\nSo, u' = -v = -60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the center of the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s, which matches the problem statement. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the problem is about the time experienced in the ejecta's frame. So, 50 seconds in S' pass, and I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S.\n\nIn S, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. So, the distance it travels is v multiplied by the time in S, which is t.\n\nBut t is the time in S corresponding to t' =50 s in S'.\n\nSo, to find t, we can use time dilation.\n\nIn S', the proper time (since the two events\u2014start and end of the time interval\u2014happen at the same place in S') is t' = 50 s. The time in S would be t = gamma * t'.\n\nGamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) \u2248 1.0206 as before.\n\nSo, t \u2248 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nThen, the distance in S is d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So, perhaps the exact calculation would give us that.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.96) precisely.\n\n0.96 is 96/100, so sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96)/10.\n\nsqrt(96) is sqrt(16*6) =4*sqrt(6)\u22484*2.44949\u22489.79796.\n\nSo, 9.79796/10 = 0.979796. So, 1/0.979796 \u2248 1.0206. So, gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.0206 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nNow, d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nHmm, but the options are in increments of 60,000 km. So, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is about 3,061,800. Maybe the exact calculation would round it to 3,060,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation, perhaps using v = 60,000 km/s and t =50 s, but that would give 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's not considering time dilation. Wait, that can't be right because the correct approach is to account for time dilation.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering only the velocity and the time, without considering the time dilation. But that would give 60,000 * 50 =3,000,000 km, option B. But that's incorrect because the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So, the correct answer must be higher than 3 million km, which matches option D (3,060,000 km) and option A (2,940,000 km, which is less, so that's not possible).\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more precisely.\n\nCompute v =60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s.\n\nc =3e5 km/s.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (6e4)^2/(3e5)^2 = (36e8)/(9e10) )= 4e-2 = 0.04.\n\nSo, 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = (sqrt(96))/10 \u2248 9.798/10=0.9798.\n\ngamma =1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nt =50 * 1.0206 =51.03 s.\n\nSo, d=60,000 *51.03 =3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this exact number. The closest is option D:3,060,000 km. So, perhaps the question expects us to compute it without considering higher precision, or perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to use the velocity directly without considering relativistic effects, but that can't be right because the velocity is a significant fraction of c.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to compute the distance in the ejecta's frame and then apply length contraction.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So, perhaps the distance in the ejecta's frame is zero, but that's not the case because the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it using the Lorentz transformation for the distance.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (S'), the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance between the center and the ejecta is changing at that rate.\n\nWait, but in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s, so after 50 seconds, the distance the center has moved towards the ejecta is 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km. So, the ejecta would have moved 3,000,000 km towards the center in the Galaxy's frame. But that's not considering time dilation.\n\nWait, but this approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame. So, perhaps I should think in terms of the proper length.\n\nWait, the proper length is the length measured in the frame where the two objects are at rest. But in this case, the Galaxy is at rest in its own frame, and the ejecta is moving towards it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is gamma multiplied by t'.\n\nSo, t=gamma * t' =1.0206 *50=51.03 s.\n\nSo, d =60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km. So, the closest option is D:3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to not consider the exact value of gamma and approximate it as 1.02, which would make the calculation:\n\ngamma = 1.02 \u2192 t=50 *1.02=51 s.\n\nd=60,000 *51=3,060,000 km, which is exactly option D.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using special relativity.

So, I need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame, then compute the distance.\n\nSo, the problem is to find d, the distance in the Galaxy's frame, given that t' (ejecta's time) is 50 seconds. So, I need to find t in the Galaxy's frame, then compute d = v * t.\n\nBut wait, how are t and t' related? Using time dilation, the proper time (which is the time measured in the rest frame of the moving object) is t' = t / gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Or wait, no, the proper time is the smallest time. So, if the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy, the time in the ejecta's frame (t') is the proper time, and the Galaxy's frame (t) would see it as longer.\n\nWait, no, I think I got that wrong. Proper time is the time experienced by the moving clock. So, if the ejecta is moving, the time measured in the ejecta's frame (t') is the proper time, and the Galaxy's frame would see this as t = gamma * t'.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think. Suppose you have two events happening at the same place in the ejecta's frame. So, the proper time is t'. The Galaxy's frame would see these events happening at different places, so the time t would be longer. So, yes, t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nBut wait, let me compute gamma first. v is 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to m/s for calculation, or perhaps keep it in km/s for now.\n\nWait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. The speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. So, v is 0.2c (since 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2). So, v = 0.2c.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is the proper time t' in the ejecta's frame the time between two events at the same location in that frame? In this case, the two events would be the start and end of the 50-second interval in the ejecta's frame. So, from the Galaxy's frame, the time between these events is longer by a factor of gamma.\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, so the distance it covers in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nSo, the distance d = v * t.\n\nv is 60,000 km/s. t is approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So, maybe my approximation is a bit off.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s.\n\nSo, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (6e4)^2 / (3e5)^2 = (36e8)/(9e10) ) = 4e-2 = 0.04.\n\nSo, 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nSo, gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 = 51.03 s.\n\nSo, d = 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options are in increments of 60,000 km. So, 3,060,000 is option D.\n\nWait, but why is the calculation not matching exactly? Let me think if I did everything correctly.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps using the velocity addition formula to find the correct velocity in the Galaxy's frame, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.\n\nWait, no, because the problem says that both are inertial frames. So, perhaps the velocity is just 60,000 km/s as measured in the Galaxy's frame. So, the problem is just a straightforward time dilation issue.\n\nWait, but another thought: the problem says the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v, which is 60,000 km/s. So, the distance it travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in that frame, which is t = gamma * t'.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: perhaps the distance in the ejecta's frame is d' = v' * t', where v' is the speed of the Galaxy from the ejecta's frame. But since the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, the distance the ejecta moves in its own frame would be zero, because the ejecta is stationary in its own frame. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it using the Lorentz transformations. Let me try that.\n\nIn the Galaxy's frame (let's call it frame S), the ejecta is moving at velocity v = 60,000 km/s towards the center (so along the negative x-axis, perhaps). So, in frame S, the ejecta's position at time t is x = v * t.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (frame S'), which is moving at velocity v relative to S, the position of the center of the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity v. So, in S', the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s.\n\nBut the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, that suggests that in S', the velocity of the center is u' = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta (i.e., in the negative x' direction). But according to the velocity addition formula, the velocity u of the center in S (Galaxy's frame) is given by u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c^2)).\n\nWait, but u in frame S is the velocity of the center of the Galaxy as seen from S. But wait, in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so the center is stationary, and the ejecta is moving towards it. So, the velocity of the center in S is zero. So, u=0.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me get the velocity addition formula correctly.\n\nThe velocity addition formula is: u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c\u00b2)).\n\nIn this case, u is the velocity of the center in frame S (Galaxy's frame), and u' is the velocity of the center in frame S' (ejecta's frame). So, u' is given as 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta (which is in the opposite direction of v).\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should set up the coordinate systems correctly.\n\nLet's say in frame S (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving with velocity v = +60,000 km/s (towards the center, which is at x=0, so perhaps the ejecta is moving towards x=0). So, in frame S', the velocity of the center (which is at rest in S) is u' = ?\n\nWait, the velocity addition formula gives u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c\u00b2)). Because S' is moving at velocity v relative to S.\n\nIn S, the center is stationary, so u = 0.\n\nSo, u' = (0 - v) / (1 - (0 * v)/c\u00b2) ) = -v.\n\nSo, u' = -v = -60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the center of the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s, which matches the problem statement. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the problem is about the time experienced in the ejecta's frame. So, 50 seconds in S' pass, and I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S.\n\nIn S, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. So, the distance it travels is v multiplied by the time in S, which is t.\n\nBut t is the time in S corresponding to t' =50 s in S'.\n\nSo, to find t, we can use time dilation.\n\nIn S', the proper time (since the two events\u2014start and end of the time interval\u2014happen at the same place in S') is t' = 50 s. The time in S would be t = gamma * t'.\n\nGamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) \u2248 1.0206 as before.\n\nSo, t \u2248 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 s.\n\nThen, the distance in S is d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So, perhaps the exact calculation would give us that.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.96) precisely.\n\n0.96 is 96/100, so sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96)/10.\n\nsqrt(96) is sqrt(16*6) =4*sqrt(6)\u22484*2.44949\u22489.79796.\n\nSo, 9.79796/10 = 0.979796. So, 1/0.979796 \u2248 1.0206. So, gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.0206 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nNow, d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nHmm, but the options are in increments of 60,000 km. So, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is about 3,061,800. Maybe the exact calculation would round it to 3,060,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation, perhaps using v = 60,000 km/s and t =50 s, but that would give 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's not considering time dilation. Wait, that can't be right because the correct approach is to account for time dilation.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering only the velocity and the time, without considering the time dilation. But that would give 60,000 * 50 =3,000,000 km, option B. But that's incorrect because the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So, the correct answer must be higher than 3 million km, which matches option D (3,060,000 km) and option A (2,940,000 km, which is less, so that's not possible).\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more precisely.\n\nCompute v =60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s.\n\nc =3e5 km/s.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (6e4)^2/(3e5)^2 = (36e8)/(9e10) )= 4e-2 = 0.04.\n\nSo, 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = (sqrt(96))/10 \u2248 9.798/10=0.9798.\n\ngamma =1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nt =50 * 1.0206 =51.03 s.\n\nSo, d=60,000 *51.03 =3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have this exact number. The closest is option D:3,060,000 km. So, perhaps the question expects us to compute it without considering higher precision, or perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to use the velocity directly without considering relativistic effects, but that can't be right because the velocity is a significant fraction of c.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to compute the distance in the ejecta's frame and then apply length contraction.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So, perhaps the distance in the ejecta's frame is zero, but that's not the case because the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it using the Lorentz transformation for the distance.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (S'), the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance between the center and the ejecta is changing at that rate.\n\nWait, but in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s, so after 50 seconds, the distance the center has moved towards the ejecta is 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km. So, the ejecta would have moved 3,000,000 km towards the center in the Galaxy's frame. But that's not considering time dilation.\n\nWait, but this approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame. So, perhaps I should think in terms of the proper length.\n\nWait, the proper length is the length measured in the frame where the two objects are at rest. But in this case, the Galaxy is at rest in its own frame, and the ejecta is moving towards it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is gamma multiplied by t'.\n\nSo, t=gamma * t' =1.0206 *50=51.03 s.\n\nSo, d =60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km. So, the closest option is D:3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to not consider the exact value of gamma and approximate it as 1.02, which would make the calculation:\n\ngamma = 1.02 \u2192 t=50 *1.02=51 s.\n\nd=60,000 *51=3,060,000 km, which is exactly option D.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using special relativity. The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, and the ejecta is moving at a velocity \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) towards the center of the Galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center appears to move towards it at the same speed. The goal is to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Relating Time in the Two Frames**:  \n   The time dilation formula relates the proper time \\( t' \\) (measured in the ejecta's frame) to the time \\( t \\) (measured in the Galaxy's frame):  \n   \\[\n   t = \\gamma t'\n   \\]  \n   where \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \\).  \n\n   Given \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( c = 300,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), we calculate:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \\frac{(60,000)^2}{(300,000)^2} = 0.04, \\quad \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206.\n   \\]  \n   Thus, the time in the Galaxy's frame is:  \n   \\[\n   t = \\gamma t' = 1.0206 \\times 50 \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  \n   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is given by:  \n   \\[\n   d = v t.\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( t = 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\):  \n   \\[\n   d = 60,000 \\times 51.03 \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Matching the Closest Option**:  \n   The calculated distance \\( 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\) is closest to option **D) 3,060,000 km**. This slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding during intermediate calculations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately **3,060,000 km**.\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think this through. \n\nThe question says that from the ejecta's frame of reference, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, right? Because in inertial frames, velocities are just the negatives of each other. So if the ejecta sees the galaxy moving at +60,000 km/s (towards it), the galaxy sees the ejecta moving at -60,000 km/s. \n\nNow, the problem is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, that's a time dilation issue because of special relativity. Because time would pass differently in each frame.\n\nI remember that time dilation is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But wait, v is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second to see if it's a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh, wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times c. Because 60,000 divided by 300,000 is 0.2. So v is 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2). Let's compute that. (0.2)^2 is 0.04, so 1 - 0.04 is 0.96. The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.98. So 1/0.98 is roughly 1.0204. So gamma is about 1.0204.\n\nWait, but wait, the time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So the time in the galaxy's frame would be longer, right? Because the moving clock (ejecta) would run slower from the galaxy's perspective. Or wait, no, because the time given is in the ejecta's frame, so we need to find the corresponding time in the galaxy's frame. Let me think. \n\nIn special relativity, the time between two events in different frames is related by the Lorentz transformation. The time in the galaxy's frame (t) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (t') by t = gamma * (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2). But wait, I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the proper time.\n\nWait, but in this case, the events are the same in both frames: the start and end of the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So the distance the ejecta moves in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. But what's the time in the galaxy's frame?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about how much time passes in the galaxy's frame for the same duration. Since the ejecta is moving at v relative to the galaxy, the time in the galaxy's frame is longer. So the time t in the galaxy is t = gamma * t' , where t' is 50 seconds.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. The time measured in the galaxy frame (t) is longer than the proper time t' because the proper time is the shortest time between two events. So yes, t = gamma * t'.\n\nWait, but in this case, the events are the same in both frames: the beginning and end of the 50-second interval in the ejecta's frame. So from the galaxy's frame, the time between these events is longer by gamma.\n\nSo gamma is about 1.0204, so t = 50 * 1.0204 \u2248 50 * 1.0204 = 51.02 seconds approximately. \n\nBut wait, wait. Another way: the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame. But the time in the galaxy's frame isn't 50 seconds; it's longer because of time dilation.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the time in the galaxy's frame and then multiply by velocity.\n\nSo, first calculate gamma. v = 0.2c.\n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.02062. Let me compute that more accurately. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, so 1/0.9798 is about 1.02062.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.02062.\n\nThen, the time in the galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = 1.02062 * 50 \u2248 51.031 seconds.\n\nSo the distance is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the units. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Multiply by 51.031 s gives 6e4 * 51.031 = 3,061,860 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close. So that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but why isn't there a length contraction consideration here? Hmm, because the distance is measured in the galaxy's frame, and the motion is along the x-axis. So the distance is just v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. So length contraction might not directly apply here because we're looking at the same distance in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but another way: from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v, so the distance it travels is v multiplied by the time it's moving. The time is longer because of time dilation. So yeah, same conclusion as before.\n\nSo the distance is approximately 3,060,000 km. So the correct answer is D.\n",

Because 60,000 divided by 300,000 is 0.2. So v is 0.2c.\n\nSo gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2). Let's compute that. (0.2)^2 is 0.04, so 1 - 0.04 is 0.96.

The time in the galaxy's frame (t) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (t') by t = gamma * (t' + (v x')/c\u00b2). But wait, I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the proper time.\n\nWait, but in this case, the events are the same in both frames: the start and end of the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So the distance the ejecta moves in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. But what's the time in the galaxy's frame?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about how much time passes in the galaxy's frame for the same duration. Since the ejecta is moving at v relative to the galaxy, the time in the galaxy's frame is longer. So the time t in the galaxy is t = gamma * t' , where t' is 50 seconds.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. The time measured in the galaxy frame (t) is longer than the proper time t' because the proper time is the shortest time between two events. So yes, t = gamma * t'.\n\nWait, but in this case, the events are the same in both frames: the beginning and end of the 50-second interval in the ejecta's frame. So from the galaxy's frame, the time between these events is longer by gamma.\n\nSo gamma is about 1.0204, so t = 50 * 1.0204 \u2248 50 * 1.0204 = 51.02 seconds approximately. \n\nBut wait, wait. Another way: the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame. But the time in the galaxy's frame isn't 50 seconds; it's longer because of time dilation.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the time in the galaxy's frame and then multiply by velocity.\n\nSo, first calculate gamma. v = 0.2c.\n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.02062. Let me compute that more accurately. sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, so 1/0.9798 is about 1.02062.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.02062.\n\nThen, the time in the galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = 1.02062 * 50 \u2248 51.031 seconds.\n\nSo the distance is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the units. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Multiply by 51.031 s gives 6e4 * 51.031 = 3,061,860 km.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close. So that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but why isn't there a length contraction consideration here? Hmm, because the distance is measured in the galaxy's frame, and the motion is along the x-axis. So the distance is just v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. So length contraction might not directly apply here because we're looking at the same distance in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but another way: from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v, so the distance it travels is v multiplied by the time it's moving. The time is longer because of time dilation. So yeah, same conclusion as before.\n\nSo the distance is approximately 3,060,000 km. So the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), which is \\( 0.2c \\) (where \\( c \\) is the speed of light). The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference during a time of \\( t' = 50 \\, \\text{s} \\) in the ejecta's frame.\n\n### Step 1: Time Dilation\nDue to special relativity, time dilation occurs between the two inertial frames. The relationship between the time in the ejecta's frame (\\( t' \\)) and the Galaxy's frame (\\( t \\)) is given by:\n\\[\nt = \\gamma t'\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor:\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( v = 0.2c \\):\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.02062\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nt = \\gamma t' = 1.02062 \\times 50 \\approx 51.031 \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Distance Traveled\nIn the Galaxy's frame, the distance traveled by the ejecta is:\n\\[\nd = v \\cdot t\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( t = 51.031 \\, \\text{s} \\):\n\\[\nd = 60,000 \\times 51.031 \\approx 3,061,860 \\, \\text{km}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Match to Options\nThe closest option to \\( 3,061,860 \\, \\text{km} \\) is \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\), which corresponds to option D.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference is approximately \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\).\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially in relativity, time dilation and length contraction come into play. But wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, in special relativity, if two frames are inertial, they can be considered as non-accelerating and moving at a constant velocity relative to each other.\n\nThe problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how much distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but how do time and distance transform between frames? Let me think. Time dilation means that moving clocks run slower. So, from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is ticking slower. But wait, the question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So, perhaps I should figure out the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame and then multiply by the speed.\n\nAlternatively, I might need to use the Lorentz transformation equations. Let me get the variables straight. Let's denote the Galaxy frame as S and the ejecta frame as S'. In S', the Galaxy is moving at velocity v towards the ejecta. So, from S' perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but the problem says the ejecta part is moving towards the Galaxy. So in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. Alternatively, perhaps I should set up the velocity correctly. Oh, maybe the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is u = 60,000 km/s towards the center. But from the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards it at velocity v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but in relativity, the velocity observed in S is different from S'. No, wait, no\u2014if the relative speed between S and S' is v, then according to relativity, each frame measures the other as moving at v, but due to length contraction and time dilation, the measurements differ. Wait, no, actually, when two objects are moving towards each other, each sees the other approaching at a speed less than c. But in this problem, it's given that in S', the Galaxy's center is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative speed between S and S' is 60,000 km/s.\n\nBut wait, 60,000 km/s is way higher than the speed of light, which is about 300,000 km/s. Oh, wait, 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is 20% the speed of light. So, relativistic effects are significant but not extreme.\n\nThe problem is, in S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. Wait, no, the ejecta is part of the supernova ejecta, which is moving towards the Galaxy. So, from the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in S, the ejecta has velocity u = -60,000 km/s (assuming positive direction is away from the center). But from the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but in S', the time is moving faster or slower? No, the time experienced in each frame depends on the observer's perspective. So, if 50 seconds pass in S' (ejecta's frame), how much time passes in S (Galaxy's frame)?\n\nTime dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). But wait, which frame is which? So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. So, from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, the velocity between the frames is v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nLet me compute that. v is 60,000 km/s. c is 300,000 km/s. So, v = 0.2c.\n\nSo, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04.\n\n1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nHmm, that's about a 2% increase.\n\nSo, if t' is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, then the time in the Galaxy's frame t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So, the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is u = 60,000 km/s. So, the distance would be u * t.\n\nSo, t is about 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, distance d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800.\n\nSo, total is 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but that's not one of the options exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, my calculation gives approximately 3,061,800, which is close to option D (3,060,000). But perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma factor.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.04.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = let's compute more precisely.\n\nWhat is sqrt(0.96)?\n\nWell, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. So, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, as I had before.\n\nSo, gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nt = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, d = 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 * 50 is 3e6, and 60,000 *1.03 is 61,800. So, 3e6 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the option D is 3,060,000 km. Close but not exactly. Perhaps I should be more precise with gamma.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate gamma without approximating so early.\n\nLet me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nCompute sqrt(0.96):\n\n0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25. So, sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.\n\nsqrt(24) is approximately 4.89898.\n\nSo, sqrt(24)/5 = 4.89898 /5 \u2248 0.979796.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / 0.979796 \u2248 1.020616.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.020616 \u2248 51.0308 seconds.\n\nd = 60,000 km/s * 51.0308 s = 60,000 * 51.0308.\n\nCompute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.\n\n60,000 * 0.0308 = 1,848.\n\nSo, total is 3,060,000 + 1,848 = 3,061,848 km.\n\nHmm, that's approximately 3,061,848 km. The option D is 3,060,000, which is 1,848 km less. So, perhaps the question expects a more approximate answer, perhaps using v as 0.2c and gamma as approximately 1.02, leading to a distance of 60,000 * 50 * 1.02 = 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000 km. So that's exactly option D.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm getting the frames wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative speed is v =60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the time is t' =50 s.\n\nBut we want to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame (S). So, the distance is the speed in S multiplied by the time in S.\n\nWait, but in S, the ejecta is moving at u =60,000 km/s.\n\nBut the time in S is longer than in S'. Because in S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy is moving towards it.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think about the setup again.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, from S' perspective, the Galaxy is approaching. The ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it.\n\nBut in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, the situation is that the two frames are moving relative to each other at v=60,000 km/s.\n\nThe question is, when 50 seconds pass in S' (the ejecta's frame), how much distance does the ejecta move in S's frame?\n\nWait, no, the question is phrased as: What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame.\n\nSo, the ejecta's movement in S is u = 60,000 km/s towards the center (so, negative direction if S has positive away from center). But the time in S is longer than in S'.\n\nWait, no, because from S', the time is moving slower in S. So, if 50 seconds pass in S', then in S, the time is t = gamma * t' = 50 * gamma.\n\nSo, the distance in S is u * t.\n\nSo, u =60,000 km/s.\n\nt = gamma * 50.\n\nSo, d = 60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the ejecta is moving at u =60,000 km/s in S.\n\nSo, the time in S is t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo, d = u * t = u * gamma * t'.\n\nWhich is 60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the time in S is longer. So, t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo, the distance the ejecta travels in S is u * t = u * gamma * t'.\n\nBut wait, the velocity u is the same in both frames? No, that's not right. Because in S, the ejecta is moving at u=60,000 km/s. But in S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy is approaching at v=60,000 km/s. So, perhaps I should use the velocity addition formula.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the velocity of the ejecta in S', but that's not needed here. Wait, the problem is just about distance in S when time in S' is 50 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the length contraction formula.\n\nWait, length contraction is about the distance measured in different frames. But in this case, the distance between the ejecta and the center might be contracted, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Because the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame, and from the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, and the distance is the speed multiplied by the longer time.\n\nSo, the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = (1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))) ) * t'.\n\nSo, v is 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\nSo, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.0206.\n\nt = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is u * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D: 3,060,000 km. So, perhaps the exact calculation is expected, but maybe the question expects the answer to be 3,060,000 km, which is 60,000 * 51.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Wait, 50 seconds in S' is the proper time, so in S, the time is longer. So, the distance is u * t, which is 60,000 * (gamma * 50) = 60,000 * 50 * gamma.\n\nWait, 60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000. Multiply by gamma (1.0206), so 3,000,000 * 1.0206 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut none of the options is exactly that. The options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000\n\nB) 3,000,000\n\nC) 2,880,000\n\nD) 3,060,000\n\nSo, 3,061,800 is closest to D, which is 3,060,000. Perhaps the intended answer is D. Alternatively, maybe the question expects a non-relativistic approach.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved without considering relativity. But the question states that both are inertial frames, but the problem involves high speeds, so perhaps relativity is intended.\n\nWait, if I ignore relativity and just use v * t, but I have to account for the time difference between frames.\n\nWait, if I ignore relativity, then in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass, and the ejecta is stationary. So, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame would require knowing the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nBut in reality, without relativity, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be the same as in the ejecta's frame, which isn't the case. So, that approach would be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the velocity as 60,000 km/s, and the time as 50 seconds in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, but the question says 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So, that's where the confusion arises.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question and the distance is simply v * t, but t is 50 seconds in the Galaxy's frame. But no, the question says 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says: from the ejecta's frame, the center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. So, the relative speed is 60,000 km/s. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.\n\nSo, the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s, and the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = (50 s) * gamma.\n\nSo, distance is 60,000 * (50 * gamma).\n\nWhich is 60,000 * (50 * 1.0206) = 60,000 *51.03 \u22483,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So, perhaps the intended approach is to use v =60,000 km/s, t=50 s, and compute distance as v*t, but that would be 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that ignores the time dilation.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer. So, the distance should be more than 3,000,000 km. So, option B is 3,000,000, which would be the distance if t was 50 s in the Galaxy's frame. But the question states that t is 50 s in the ejecta's frame.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the distance as v * t', where t' is 50 s. But that would be 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's the non-relativistic approach. But the problem states that both are inertial frames, implying that relativity is in play.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the scenario again.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it. The ejecta is stationary, so the distance between the ejecta and the center is decreasing at 60,000 km/s. But from the ejecta's perspective, how long does it take for the center to reach it? Well, that's not the question. The question is about how much distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during 50 seconds of the ejecta's time.\n\nWait, maybe the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.\n\n\"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nSo, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds because of time dilation. So, the distance is 60,000 km/s multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame (t).\n\nt is gamma multiplied by t', where t' is 50 s.\n\nSo, t = gamma * 50.\n\nSo, the distance is 60,000 * (gamma *50) = 60,000 *50 * gamma = 3,000,000 * 1.0206 \u22483,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So, perhaps the intended answer is D, 3,060,000 km, which is 60,000 * 51, which is 3,060,000.\n\nWait, 50 * gamma is approximately 51.03, so 51.03 * 60,000 = 3,061,800. The option D is 3,060,000, which is about 1,800 km less. Maybe the question approximates gamma as 1.02, giving t = 50 *1.02=51, so 51 *60,000=3,060,000 km.\n\nSo, the answer would be D.\n",

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially in relativity, time dilation and length contraction come into play. But wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, in special relativity, if two frames are inertial, they can be considered as non-accelerating and moving at a constant velocity relative to each other.\n\nThe problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how much distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, but how do time and distance transform between frames? Let me think. Time dilation means that moving clocks run slower. So, from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is ticking slower. But wait, the question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So, perhaps I should figure out the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame and then multiply by the speed.\n\nAlternatively, I might need to use the Lorentz transformation equations. Let me get the variables straight. Let's denote the Galaxy frame as S and the ejecta frame as S'. In S', the Galaxy is moving at velocity v towards the ejecta. So, from S' perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but the problem says the ejecta part is moving towards the Galaxy. So in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. Alternatively, perhaps I should set up the velocity correctly. Oh, maybe the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is u = 60,000 km/s towards the center. But from the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards it at velocity v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but in relativity, the velocity observed in S is different from S'. No, wait, no\u2014if the relative speed between S and S' is v, then according to relativity, each frame measures the other as moving at v, but due to length contraction and time dilation, the measurements differ. Wait, no, actually, when two objects are moving towards each other, each sees the other approaching at a speed less than c. But in this problem, it's given that in S', the Galaxy's center is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative speed between S and S' is 60,000 km/s.\n\nBut wait, 60,000 km/s is way higher than the speed of light, which is about 300,000 km/s. Oh, wait, 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is 20% the speed of light. So, relativistic effects are significant but not extreme.\n\nThe problem is, in S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. Wait, no, the ejecta is part of the supernova ejecta, which is moving towards the Galaxy. So, from the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in S, the ejecta has velocity u = -60,000 km/s (assuming positive direction is away from the center). But from the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, but in S', the time is moving faster or slower? No, the time experienced in each frame depends on the observer's perspective. So, if 50 seconds pass in S' (ejecta's frame), how much time passes in S (Galaxy's frame)?\n\nTime dilation formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). But wait, which frame is which? So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. So, from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, the velocity between the frames is v = 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nLet me compute that. v is 60,000 km/s. c is 300,000 km/s. So, v = 0.2c.\n\nSo, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04.\n\n1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206.\n\nHmm, that's about a 2% increase.\n\nSo, if t' is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, then the time in the Galaxy's frame t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So, the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is u = 60,000 km/s. So, the distance would be u * t.\n\nSo, t is about 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, distance d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = let's compute that.\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800.\n\nSo, total is 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but that's not one of the options exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nWait, my calculation gives approximately 3,061,800, which is close to option D (3,060,000). But perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma factor.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.04.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nsqrt(0.96) = let's compute more precisely.\n\nWhat is sqrt(0.96)?\n\nWell, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. So, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, as I had before.\n\nSo, gamma is about 1.0206.\n\nt = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 = 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, d = 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 * 50 is 3e6, and 60,000 *1.03 is 61,800. So, 3e6 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut the option D is 3,060,000 km. Close but not exactly. Perhaps I should be more precise with gamma.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate gamma without approximating so early.\n\nLet me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nv = 0.2c.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nCompute sqrt(0.96):\n\n0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25. So, sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.\n\nsqrt(24) is approximately 4.89898.\n\nSo, sqrt(24)/5 = 4.89898 /5 \u2248 0.979796.\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / 0.979796 \u2248 1.020616.\n\nSo, t = 50 * 1.020616 \u2248 51.0308 seconds.\n\nd = 60,000 km/s * 51.0308 s = 60,000 * 51.0308.\n\nCompute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.\n\n60,000 * 0.0308 = 1,848.\n\nSo, total is 3,060,000 + 1,848 = 3,061,848 km.\n\nHmm, that's approximately 3,061,848 km. The option D is 3,060,000, which is 1,848 km less. So, perhaps the question expects a more approximate answer, perhaps using v as 0.2c and gamma as approximately 1.02, leading to a distance of 60,000 * 50 * 1.02 = 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000 km. So that's exactly option D.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm getting the frames wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative speed is v =60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the time is t' =50 s.\n\nBut we want to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame (S). So, the distance is the speed in S multiplied by the time in S.\n\nWait, but in S, the ejecta is moving at u =60,000 km/s.\n\nBut the time in S is longer than in S'. Because in S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy is moving towards it.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think about the setup again.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, from S' perspective, the Galaxy is approaching. The ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it.\n\nBut in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, the situation is that the two frames are moving relative to each other at v=60,000 km/s.\n\nThe question is, when 50 seconds pass in S' (the ejecta's frame), how much distance does the ejecta move in S's frame?\n\nWait, no, the question is phrased as: What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame.\n\nSo, the ejecta's movement in S is u = 60,000 km/s towards the center (so, negative direction if S has positive away from center). But the time in S is longer than in S'.\n\nWait, no, because from S', the time is moving slower in S. So, if 50 seconds pass in S', then in S, the time is t = gamma * t' = 50 * gamma.\n\nSo, the distance in S is u * t.\n\nSo, u =60,000 km/s.\n\nt = gamma * 50.\n\nSo, d = 60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the ejecta is moving at u =60,000 km/s in S.\n\nSo, the time in S is t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo, d = u * t = u * gamma * t'.\n\nWhich is 60,000 * gamma *50.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the time in S is longer. So, t = gamma * t'.\n\nSo, the distance the ejecta travels in S is u * t = u * gamma * t'.\n\nBut wait, the velocity u is the same in both frames? No, that's not right. Because in S, the ejecta is moving at u=60,000 km/s. But in S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy is approaching at v=60,000 km/s. So, perhaps I should use the velocity addition formula.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the velocity of the ejecta in S', but that's not needed here. Wait, the problem is just about distance in S when time in S' is 50 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the length contraction formula.\n\nWait, length contraction is about the distance measured in different frames. But in this case, the distance between the ejecta and the center might be contracted, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Because the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame, and from the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, and the distance is the speed multiplied by the longer time.\n\nSo, the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = (1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))) ) * t'.\n\nSo, v is 60,000 km/s = 0.2c.\n\nSo, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.0206.\n\nt = 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nSo, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is u * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 3,061,800 km.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D: 3,060,000 km. So, perhaps the exact calculation is expected, but maybe the question expects the answer to be 3,060,000 km, which is 60,000 * 51.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Wait, 50 seconds in S' is the proper time, so in S, the time is longer. So, the distance is u * t, which is 60,000 * (gamma * 50) = 60,000 * 50 * gamma.\n\nWait, 60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000. Multiply by gamma (1.0206), so 3,000,000 * 1.0206 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut none of the options is exactly that. The options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000\n\nB) 3,000,000\n\nC) 2,880,000\n\nD) 3,060,000\n\nSo, 3,061,800 is closest to D, which is 3,060,000. Perhaps the intended answer is D. Alternatively, maybe the question expects a non-relativistic approach.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved without considering relativity. But the question states that both are inertial frames, but the problem involves high speeds, so perhaps relativity is intended.\n\nWait, if I ignore relativity and just use v * t, but I have to account for the time difference between frames.\n\nWait, if I ignore relativity, then in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass, and the ejecta is stationary. So, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame would require knowing the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nBut in reality, without relativity, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be the same as in the ejecta's frame, which isn't the case. So, that approach would be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the velocity as 60,000 km/s, and the time as 50 seconds in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, but the question says 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So, that's where the confusion arises.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question and the distance is simply v * t, but t is 50 seconds in the Galaxy's frame. But no, the question says 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says: from the ejecta's frame, the center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. So, the relative speed is 60,000 km/s. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.\n\nSo, the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s, and the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = (50 s) * gamma.\n\nSo, distance is 60,000 * (50 * gamma).\n\nWhich is 60,000 * (50 * 1.0206) = 60,000 *51.03 \u22483,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So, perhaps the intended approach is to use v =60,000 km/s, t=50 s, and compute distance as v*t, but that would be 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that ignores the time dilation.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer. So, the distance should be more than 3,000,000 km. So, option B is 3,000,000, which would be the distance if t was 50 s in the Galaxy's frame. But the question states that t is 50 s in the ejecta's frame.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the distance as v * t', where t' is 50 s. But that would be 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's the non-relativistic approach. But the problem states that both are inertial frames, implying that relativity is in play.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the scenario again.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it. The ejecta is stationary, so the distance between the ejecta and the center is decreasing at 60,000 km/s. But from the ejecta's perspective, how long does it take for the center to reach it? Well, that's not the question. The question is about how much distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during 50 seconds of the ejecta's time.\n\nWait, maybe the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.\n\n\"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nSo, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds because of time dilation. So, the distance is 60,000 km/s multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame (t).\n\nt is gamma multiplied by t', where t' is 50 s.\n\nSo, t = gamma * 50.\n\nSo, the distance is 60,000 * (gamma *50) = 60,000 *50 * gamma = 3,000,000 * 1.0206 \u22483,061,800 km.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So, perhaps the intended answer is D, 3,060,000 km, which is 60,000 * 51, which is 3,060,000.\n\nWait, 50 * gamma is approximately 51.03, so 51.03 * 60,000 = 3,061,800. The option D is 3,060,000, which is about 1,800 km less. Maybe the question approximates gamma as 1.02, giving t = 50 *1.02=51, so 51 *60,000=3,060,000 km.\n\nSo, the answer would be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame. The relative velocity between the two frames is given as \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), which is \\( 0.2c \\) (where \\( c = 300,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\)). Since the problem involves relativistic speeds, we use the time dilation formula to account for the difference in time between the two frames.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Time Dilation**:  \n   The time experienced in the Galaxy's frame (\\( t \\)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\\( t' \\)) by the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\):  \n   \\[\n   t = \\gamma \\cdot t'\n   \\]  \n   where  \n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( v = 0.2c \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206\n   \\]  \n   Thus,  \n   \\[\n   t = 1.0206 \\cdot 50 \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{seconds}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  \n   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is given by:  \n   \\[\n   d = v \\cdot t\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( t = 51.03 \\, \\text{seconds} \\):  \n   \\[\n   d = 60,000 \\cdot 51.03 \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Comparison with Options**:  \n   The calculated distance (\\( \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\)) is closest to option \\( D \\) (\\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\)). The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding approximations in the problem setup.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately \\( 3,060,000 \\, \\text{km} \\).\n\nAnswer: D",
