      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The setup is that there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mention that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the conditions are such that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex. The temperature is 25 degrees Celsius, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand like EDTA, the formation constant K is given by the formula K = [M-EDTA]/([M][EDTA]). So the complex dissociates into the metal ion and the ligand, and K is a measure of how strong the complex is.\n\nWait, but in this case, we have the complex already present in solution. So the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. But we need to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca\u00b2+], in the solution.\n\nSo the formula would be K = ([Ca-EDTA]) / ([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but wait\u2014EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so each EDTA molecule binds to the calcium ion. In the complex, each Ca\u00b2+ is surrounded by EDTA.\n\nBut wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Stoichiometric means that the molar ratio of the reactants is exactly the same as the balanced equation. So if the complex is Ca-EDTA, and assuming the formula is CaEDTA, then the stoichiometry is 1:1.\n\nSo the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. That means when it dissociates, each mole of complex releases one mole of Ca\u00b2+ and one mole of EDTA^4- (assuming it's the deprotonated form). But wait, in reality, the EDTA is in solution as Y^4- (the deprotonated form) when the pH is high enough. Since the pH is ideal, we can consider that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and available as Y^4-.\n\nSo the dissociation would be:\n\nCaEDTA \u21cc Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4-\n\nThe formation constant K is given as 5e10. So K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, the formation constant is usually written as Kf = [M-EDTA]/([M][EDTA]). So yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo in this case, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote [CaEDTA] as 0.02 M.\n\nNow, let's think about the dissociation. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ that dissociates from the complex. So:\n\nAt equilibrium:\n\n[CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 M (since x will be very small compared to 0.02, given that K is large)\n\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n\n[EDTA^4-] = x (since each CaEDTA releases one EDTA^4-)\n\nSo substituting into K:\n\nK = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10\n\nSo,\n\n0.02 / x\u00b2 = 5e10\n\nRearranging for x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that again.\n\n0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.\n\nWait, no: 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * (1e-2 / 1e10) ) = 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13.\n\nSo x squared is 4e-13. Taking square root, x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?\n\nWait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(4e-13) more accurately. 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.1623e-7. So 2 * 3.1623e-7 is 6.3246e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nSo K = [CaEDTA] / ([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA]) = 5e10.\n\nAssuming [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M, and [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA] = x.\n\nSo,\n\n0.02/(x\u00b2) =5e10 \u2192 x\u00b2=0.02/(5e10) \u2192 0.02 is 2e-2.\n\n2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) *1e-12 = 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13.\n\nx = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, no, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Because 6.5 * 2 is 13. So sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7.\n\nSo 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. So that's about 6.3e-7 M.\n\nYes, that's option C.\n",

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2*3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.\n\nSo x \u2248 6.3e-7 M. So the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is about 6.3e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes EDTA exists in different protonated forms, but the question says the pH is ideal. Oh right, so pH is such that EDTA is in the correct form (Y^4\u2212), so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the K given is the stability constant, which includes all the H+ ions, but since pH is ideal, we can proceed as before.\n\nSo yes, the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M, so option C.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca\u00b2\u207a]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation constant \\( K_d \\), which is the reciprocal of the formation constant \\( K_f \\). The formation constant is given as \\( K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10} \\), so:\n\n\\[\nK_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}.\n\\]\n\nThe dissociation reaction is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \\leftrightarrow \\text{Ca}^{2+} + \\text{EDTA}^{4-}.\n\\]\n\nLet the initial concentration of the complex be 0.02 M.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the solution conditions are such that the EDTA is in its active form, ready to complex with the metal ions. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, which I think is standard, so maybe activity coefficients are considered 1 or something like that.\n\nThe given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I think K here refers to the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how strong the complex is. A high K like this means the complex is very stable, so most of the calcium ions are bound by EDTA.\n\nWait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But we need to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca\u00b2+], in solution.\n\nSo, the reaction for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex would be something like: Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc CaEDTA^2\u2212. The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]). \n\nBut wait, in solution, EDTA exists in different forms depending on the pH. Since the pH is ideal, I think it's at a point where most of the EDTA is in the Y^4- form, the deprotonated form that can bind metal ions. So we can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4- is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration minus the complexed part. Hmm, but wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, so that's the concentration of the complex.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. Let me think. The solution has the complex CaEDTA^2\u2212 at 0.02 M. So, the complex dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- according to the equation: CaEDTA^2\u2212 \u21cc Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4-. The K for this reaction would be 1/Kf, since Kf is for the formation. Or wait, no. Wait, Kf is the formation constant, so the reverse reaction would have K = 1/Kf.\n\nWait, the formation constant Kf is for the reaction: Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc CaEDTA^2\u2212. So the Kf is given as 5e10. So the reverse reaction (dissociation) would have K = 1/(5e10) \u2248 2e-11.\n\nBut wait, in this solution, we have the complex already. So if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2\u2212, and it's in equilibrium with some Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nLet me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2\u2212] = 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ that dissociates from the complex. Then, the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- would each be x, because for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of each ion is produced.\n\nSo, the expression for the dissociation constant K (which is 1/Kf) would be:\n\nK = [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2\u2212] \n\nBut wait, since K is 1/Kf, which is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. So,\n\n( x * x ) / (0.02 - x) ) = 2e-11\n\nSince K is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02. So 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo the equation simplifies to x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 2e-11\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13\n\nTaking the square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. Because sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, so 1e-13 is 1e-6.5? Hmm, alternatively, 1e-13 = (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 10^(-6.5).\n\nWait, 10^(-6.5) is the same as 3.16e-7. Because 10^(-7) is 1e-7, and 10^(-6) is 1e-6. 10^(-6.5) is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.\n\nSo x is about 6.3e-7 M. That would be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ ions.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWe have K = 1/Kf = 2e-11.\n\nSet up the equation: x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 2e-11.\n\nx\u00b2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.\n\nx = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to remember.\n\nThe problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25\u00b0C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.\n\nWait, what do I remember about formation constants? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) represents how stable a complex is. It's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions. So, for the reaction Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2-, the Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nBut wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I guess all the calcium is bound into the complex. But in solution, there must be some dissociation happening because the complex can break apart into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nSo the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ ions would be very low because Kf is a large number (5e10), meaning the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal.\n\nLet me set up the variables. Let's let the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ be x. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca\u00b2+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x. The concentration of the complex itself would then be approximately 0.02 M minus x. But since Kf is so large, x is going to be really small, so 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02. That should simplify things.\n\nSo the Kf expression is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nSubstituting the values, 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x) \u2192 5e10 = 0.02 / x\u00b2.\n\nWait, solving for x\u00b2: x\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) \u2192 x\u00b2 = 2e-3 / 5e10 \u2192 wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, right? So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 \u2192 which is 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) \u2192 which is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Hmm, no. Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7 approximately. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. So x is about 6.3e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. So when it dissociates, each mole gives one mole of Ca\u00b2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So the concentrations of both ions are x. The formation constant is 5e10, so plug in:\n\n5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2) \u2192 x^2 = 0.02 / 5e10 \u2192 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 \u2192 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13.\n\nx is sqrt(4e-13) \u2192 2e-6.5 \u2192 wait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, so sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to remember.\n\nThe problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25\u00b0C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.\n\nWait, what do I remember about formation constants? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) represents how stable a complex is. It's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions. So, for the reaction Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2-, the Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nBut wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I guess all the calcium is bound into the complex. But in solution, there must be some dissociation happening because the complex can break apart into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nSo the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ ions would be very low because Kf is a large number (5e10), meaning the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal.\n\nLet me set up the variables. Let's let the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ be x. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca\u00b2+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x. The concentration of the complex itself would then be approximately 0.02 M minus x. But since Kf is so large, x is going to be really small, so 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02. That should simplify things.\n\nSo the Kf expression is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nSubstituting the values, 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x) \u2192 5e10 = 0.02 / x\u00b2.\n\nWait, solving for x\u00b2: x\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) \u2192 x\u00b2 = 2e-3 / 5e10 \u2192 wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, right? So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 \u2192 which is 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) \u2192 which is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Hmm, no. Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7 approximately. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. So x is about 6.3e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. So when it dissociates, each mole gives one mole of Ca\u00b2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So the concentrations of both ions are x. The formation constant is 5e10, so plug in:\n\n5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2) \u2192 x^2 = 0.02 / 5e10 \u2192 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 \u2192 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13.\n\nx is sqrt(4e-13) \u2192 2e-6.5 \u2192 wait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, so sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M. So that's option C. Yep, that makes sense.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca\u00b2\u207a]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \\( K_{\\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \\times 10^{10} \\). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ca}^{2+} + \\text{EDTA}^{4-} \\leftrightarrow \\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}\n\\]\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the formation constant is:\n\n\\[\nK_{\\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \\frac{[\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}\n\\]\n\nLet the concentration of free \\(\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\) ions be \\(x\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. They also mention that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the solution conditions are such that the EDTA is in its correct form to form the complex. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, but I'm not sure if that affects the calculation here.\n\nHmm, I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant (K) tells us about the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so the reaction favors the formation of the complex.\n\nThe formula for the formation constant, K, is probably something like this: K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, no, I think the exact form depends on the stoichiometry. Since it's a 1:1 complex (Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-), the expression should be K = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] / ([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]).\n\nWait, but the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But what about the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-?\n\nI think that when the complex is formed, the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA\u00b2-] is given as 0.02 M. So, the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- before complexation would be higher, but once the complex forms, their concentrations decrease.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Because the complex is formed from the Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-. So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that's the product, and the reactants (Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-) are what we're trying to find.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So, the [Ca\u00b2+] in the solution is what we need to find.\n\nLet me write down the reaction. The formation of the complex is:\n\nCa\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212 \n\nThe formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-])\n\nWe know K is 5e10, and [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] is 0.02 M.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused about the initial concentrations. Let me think. The solution is prepared with the Ca-EDTA complex, so the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, assuming that all the Ca and EDTA are present as the complex, but that's not the case because some dissociation must happen. So, the complex can dissociate into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA salt, which dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- in solution, but in reality, some of it will form the complex. Hmm, perhaps the solution is that the complex is already in solution, and we need to find the free [Ca\u00b2+] given the K.\n\nWait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, perhaps the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the rest is dissociated into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nBut wait, the K is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning that the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. That suggests that the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- will be very low.\n\nSo, let me set up the variables. Let\u2019s denote [Ca\u00b2+] as x. Since the complex dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, assuming that for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of each ion is produced. But wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1, so yes, [Ca\u00b2+] = [EDTA^4-] = x.\n\nBut wait, what about the initial concentration of the complex? The complex is 0.02 M, so the initial concentration before dissociation is 0.02 M. So, when some dissociates, the concentration of the complex decreases by x, but wait, wait. Let me think again.\n\nNo, perhaps it's better to model it this way: the total concentration of all species from the complex should be considered. The total concentration is the sum of the complex and the dissociated ions. But in this case, since K is very large, the amount dissociated (x) will be very small compared to 0.02 M. So, the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 M, and the [Ca\u00b2+] and [EDTA^4-] are both x, which is much smaller than 0.02.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me write the equation properly.\n\nThe formation constant is K = [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.\n\nWe have [CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212] = 0.02 M.\n\nSo, substituting into K:\n\n5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x)\n\nBecause [Ca\u00b2+] = x and [EDTA^4-] = x.\n\nSo, 5e10 = 0.02/(x\u00b2)\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10)\n\nCalculate that:\n\n0.02 is 2e-2.\n\nSo, 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2 /5 ) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) \u2192 2 * 1e-6.5? Wait, no. 1e-13 is 1e-13. The square root is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.\n\nWait, that's about 6.3e-7 M. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, x squared equals 0.02 / (5e10) \u2192 0.02 is 2e-2.\n\nSo 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 \u2192 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13.\n\nSo x squared is 4e-13 \u2192 x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7, which is 6.3e-7 M.\n\nSo that's option C.\n\nBut wait, why is the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ equal to x, and EDTA^4- also x? Because each dissociation of one mole of the complex produces one mole of Ca\u00b2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.\n\nSo, the setup seems correct. The K expression is correctly set up, and the math checks out.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C, 6.3e-7 M.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25\u00b0C. Hmm, okay.\n\nWait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So, the Ca-EDTA complex is a complex ion where EDTA is acting as a ligand. The formation constant, K, tells us about the stability of this complex. A high K means the complex is more stable, so the reaction tends to go to completion.\n\nThe problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. I think the formula for the complex is probably CaY\u00b2-, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. So the reaction would be Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA\u00b2-.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. The complex formation is when Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex. The formation constant K is given by the expression:\n\nK = [CaEDTA\u00b2-] / ( [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-] )\n\nSo, K is 5e10 (5x10^10). And the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The question is, what's the concentration of calcium ions in solution?\n\nWait, but wait. If the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, that implies that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4-.\n\nWait, but since K is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable. So the dissociation won't go far. That means that the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ ions should be very low.\n\nSo, let's model this. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaY] = 0.02 M. Then, when it dissociates, it produces Ca\u00b2+ and Y^4-.\n\nLet\u2019s say the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is x, and the concentration of Y^4- is y. But wait, since the complex dissociates into one Ca\u00b2+ and one Y^4-, the concentrations should be equal. So, [Ca\u00b2+] = x and [Y^4-] = x.\n\nSo the formation constant equation becomes:\n\nK = [CaY\u00b2-] / ( [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4-] )\n\nWhich is:\n\n5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x )\n\nSo, 5e10 = 0.02 / x\u00b2.\n\nWait, that would mean:\n\nx\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10 )\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2)/(5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.\n\nSo, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5.\n\nWait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Because 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 1e-12 would be (1e-6)^2, but 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 2 x 10^-6.5.\n\nWait, 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7, right? Because 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^-6.5 is sqrt(1e-13) = approx 3.16e-7.\n\nSo 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 = about 6.32e-7 M.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That seems to match.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculation.\n\nLet me re-do the math step by step.\n\nGiven:\nK = 5e10 = [CaY\u00b2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4-])\n\nWe assume [CaY\u00b2-] = 0.02 M.\n\nAssuming the dissociation is x = [Ca\u00b2+] = [Y^4-], then:\n\n5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x )\n\nSo, 5e10 = 0.02 / x\u00b2\n\nSolving for x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2)/(5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.\n\nx = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.\n\nWait, 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. So x \u2248 6.3e-7 M. So option C.\n\nHmm, so that's the correct approach. Since K is so large, the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ is very low, which makes sense. The high K means the complex doesn't dissociate much, so [Ca\u00b2+] is small.\n\nWait, but another thought: is the initial assumption correct that [CaY\u00b2-] is 0.02 M? Because when the complex is formed, you might have some dissociation, but perhaps in this case, since K is so large, the dissociation is negligible, but wait, no, because we're given the concentration of the complex. So the complex is 0.02 M, and the solution is at equilibrium with some dissociation. So the approach is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option C, 6.3e-7 M.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25\u00b0C, and the formation constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, okay. So I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium. The complex formed here is Ca-EDTA, and the concentration of that complex is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.\n\nWait, right, the formation constant K is involved. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2\u2212. The K for this reaction is given as 5x10^10.\n\nSo the formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212]). Wait, but wait, I think EDTA is usually in a different form depending on pH. Oh, but the question says pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that. I think that at the ideal pH, EDTA is in its Y^4- form, which is the form that complexes with Ca\u00b2+.\n\nWait, but in reality, EDTA exists in various protonated forms, but since the pH is ideal, I can assume that all EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So the problem simplifies.\n\nSo, the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2\u2212] as 0.02 M. Because the solution is stoichiometric, I think that means the concentration of the complex is equal to the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ added, assuming all Ca\u00b2+ is complexed. But wait, that's not necessarily the case because some might dissociate. But given the high K value, the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ would be really low.\n\nWait, but if the solution is stoichiometric, that suggests that the molar ratio of Ca\u00b2+ to EDTA is 1:1. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that would imply that the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA were each 0.02 M, assuming they completely reacted. But in reality, some might remain as free ions. But with such a large K, the dissociation is minimal, so the free [Ca\u00b2+] would be very low.\n\nSo, using the formation constant expression:\n\nK = [CaEDTA^2\u2212] / ([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212])\n\nI need to find [Ca\u00b2+]. But wait, what about [EDTA^4\u2212]? If all EDTA is in the Y^4- form, then [EDTA^4\u2212] would be equal to the initial concentration minus the amount that formed the complex. But wait, in a stoichiometric solution, the amount of EDTA is just enough to form the complex with all the Ca\u00b2+. Wait, no, because if the solution is stoichiometric, it's just that the moles of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are equal. So, for example, if you have 0.02 M Ca\u00b2+ and 0.02 M EDTA, they form 0.02 M CaEDTA^2\u2212.\n\nBut wait, if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that means that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the total EDTA would be in solution as both free EDTA and the complex. But if the solution is stoichiometric, that would mean that the EDTA is just enough to form the complex without any excess. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is prepared by adding Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA in a 1:1 molar ratio, leading to the formation of the complex. So, the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA would each be 0.02 M, and they form 0.02 M of the complex.\n\nBut in reality, some of the EDTA remains as free EDTA. Let me think. Let's denote the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ as x. Then, the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M, and the concentration of free EDTA would be 0.02 - 0.02 + x? Wait, no, because when Ca\u00b2+ dissociates, it would produce some free Ca\u00b2+ and consume some EDTA^4\u2212.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to set up the variables. Let me define:\n\nLet\u2019s say the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2\u2212] is 0.02 M.\n\nLet\u2019s let [Ca\u00b2+] = x.\n\nThen, since each complex contains one Ca\u00b2+ and one EDTA^4\u2212, the concentration of EDTA^4\u2212 would be [EDTA^4\u2212] = 0.02 - x.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because the initial concentration of EDTA is 0.02 M, but if some dissociates, the free EDTA would be 0.02 - [CaEDTA] + [EDTA from dissociation]. Hmm, maybe I should approach this using the equilibrium expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the total concentration of EDTA is equal to the concentration of free EDTA plus the concentration of the complex. So:\n\nTotal EDTA = [EDTA^4\u2212] + [CaEDTA^2\u2212]\n\nSimilarly, the total Ca\u00b2+ is [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaEDTA^2\u2212].\n\nBut in a stoichiometric solution, the initial moles of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are the same. So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the total Ca\u00b2+ (free + complex) is 0.02 M, and the total EDTA (free + complex) is 0.02 M.\n\nSo, [Ca\u00b2+] = x\n\n[EDTA^4\u2212] = 0.02 - 0.02 + x? No, wait.\n\nWait, the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. So:\n\nTotal EDTA = [EDTA^4\u2212] + [CaEDTA^2\u2212] = 0.02 M.\n\nSimilarly, total Ca\u00b2+ = [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaEDTA^2\u2212] = 0.02 M.\n\nBut [CaEDTA^2\u2212] is 0.02 M, so [Ca\u00b2+] = 0.02 M - 0.02 M = 0? That can't be right because some dissociates.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing stoichiometric. Let me think again.\n\nIf the solution is stoichiometric, that probably means that the molar amounts of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are equal. So, let's say you start with 0.02 M Ca\u00b2+ and 0.02 M EDTA^4\u2212. They form 0.02 M CaEDTA^2\u2212, but some of the CaEDTA might dissociate.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because if all 0.02 M Ca\u00b2+ and 0.02 M EDTA^4\u2212 form 0.02 M complex, then the concentration of the complex would be 0.02 M, and the free Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA would be zero. But that's not possible because K is so large, but wait, K is the formation constant, which is very large, so the complex is almost completely formed.\n\nWait, but K is 5e10, which is a very large number, so the complex is very stable. So, the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ would be very low. So, perhaps x is negligible compared to 0.02.\n\nSo, in that case, [Ca\u00b2+] = x \u2248 0.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Let's write the formation equation:\n\nCa\u00b2+ + EDTA^4\u2212 \u2194 CaEDTA^2\u2212, K = 5e10.\n\nAt equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2\u2212] is 0.02 M.\n\nLet\u2019s let [Ca\u00b2+] = x.\n\nThen, [EDTA^4\u2212] = 0.02 - x.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial concentration of EDTA is the same as the initial concentration of Ca\u00b2+? Or not? Because the solution is stoichiometric, so I think that the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are each 0.02 M. So, when they react, they form 0.02 M of the complex.\n\nWait, but that would imply that all the Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are consumed, which can't be the case because some would dissociate. So, perhaps the initial concentrations are higher, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is made by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, which dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212. But no, that's not correct because the complex is already formed.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it as the solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, which dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212. But in that case, the initial [CaEDTA^2\u2212] is 0.02 M, and the dissociation would give some x of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212.\n\nWait, no, because the complex is formed from Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212, so the reverse reaction would be the dissociation. So, the dissociation equilibrium would be:\n\nCaEDTA^2\u2212 \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4\u2212, with K_dissociation = 1/K_formation = 1/(5e10).\n\nSo, the dissociation constant Kd is 2e-11.\n\nSo, the equilibrium expression is:\n\nKd = [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212] / [CaEDTA^2\u2212]\n\nWe can write:\n\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n\n[EDTA^4\u2212] = x (because for each mole of dissociation, one mole of Ca\u00b2+ and one mole of EDTA^4\u2212 are produced)\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\nKd = (x)(x) / [CaEDTA^2\u2212]\n\nBut [CaEDTA^2\u2212] is 0.02 M, so:\n\n2e-11 = x\u00b2 / 0.02\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx\u00b2 = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13\n\nx = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 \u2248 6.3e-7 M.\n\nWait, because sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.32456e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25\u00b0C, and the formation constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, okay. So I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium. The complex formed here is Ca-EDTA, and the concentration of that complex is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.\n\nWait, right, the formation constant K is involved. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA^2\u2212. The K for this reaction is given as 5x10^10.\n\nSo the formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212]). Wait, but wait, I think EDTA is usually in a different form depending on pH. Oh, but the question says pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that. I think that at the ideal pH, EDTA is in its Y^4- form, which is the form that complexes with Ca\u00b2+.\n\nWait, but in reality, EDTA exists in various protonated forms, but since the pH is ideal, I can assume that all EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So the problem simplifies.\n\nSo, the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2\u2212] as 0.02 M. Because the solution is stoichiometric, I think that means the concentration of the complex is equal to the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ added, assuming all Ca\u00b2+ is complexed. But wait, that's not necessarily the case because some might dissociate. But given the high K value, the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ would be really low.\n\nWait, but if the solution is stoichiometric, that suggests that the molar ratio of Ca\u00b2+ to EDTA is 1:1. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that would imply that the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA were each 0.02 M, assuming they completely reacted. But in reality, some might remain as free ions. But with such a large K, the dissociation is minimal, so the free [Ca\u00b2+] would be very low.\n\nSo, using the formation constant expression:\n\nK = [CaEDTA^2\u2212] / ([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212])\n\nI need to find [Ca\u00b2+]. But wait, what about [EDTA^4\u2212]? If all EDTA is in the Y^4- form, then [EDTA^4\u2212] would be equal to the initial concentration minus the amount that formed the complex. But wait, in a stoichiometric solution, the amount of EDTA is just enough to form the complex with all the Ca\u00b2+. Wait, no, because if the solution is stoichiometric, it's just that the moles of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are equal. So, for example, if you have 0.02 M Ca\u00b2+ and 0.02 M EDTA, they form 0.02 M CaEDTA^2\u2212.\n\nBut wait, if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that means that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the total EDTA would be in solution as both free EDTA and the complex. But if the solution is stoichiometric, that would mean that the EDTA is just enough to form the complex without any excess. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is prepared by adding Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA in a 1:1 molar ratio, leading to the formation of the complex. So, the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA would each be 0.02 M, and they form 0.02 M of the complex.\n\nBut in reality, some of the EDTA remains as free EDTA. Let me think. Let's denote the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ as x. Then, the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M, and the concentration of free EDTA would be 0.02 - 0.02 + x? Wait, no, because when Ca\u00b2+ dissociates, it would produce some free Ca\u00b2+ and consume some EDTA^4\u2212.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to set up the variables. Let me define:\n\nLet\u2019s say the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2\u2212] is 0.02 M.\n\nLet\u2019s let [Ca\u00b2+] = x.\n\nThen, since each complex contains one Ca\u00b2+ and one EDTA^4\u2212, the concentration of EDTA^4\u2212 would be [EDTA^4\u2212] = 0.02 - x.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because the initial concentration of EDTA is 0.02 M, but if some dissociates, the free EDTA would be 0.02 - [CaEDTA] + [EDTA from dissociation]. Hmm, maybe I should approach this using the equilibrium expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the total concentration of EDTA is equal to the concentration of free EDTA plus the concentration of the complex. So:\n\nTotal EDTA = [EDTA^4\u2212] + [CaEDTA^2\u2212]\n\nSimilarly, the total Ca\u00b2+ is [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaEDTA^2\u2212].\n\nBut in a stoichiometric solution, the initial moles of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are the same. So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the total Ca\u00b2+ (free + complex) is 0.02 M, and the total EDTA (free + complex) is 0.02 M.\n\nSo, [Ca\u00b2+] = x\n\n[EDTA^4\u2212] = 0.02 - 0.02 + x? No, wait.\n\nWait, the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. So:\n\nTotal EDTA = [EDTA^4\u2212] + [CaEDTA^2\u2212] = 0.02 M.\n\nSimilarly, total Ca\u00b2+ = [Ca\u00b2+] + [CaEDTA^2\u2212] = 0.02 M.\n\nBut [CaEDTA^2\u2212] is 0.02 M, so [Ca\u00b2+] = 0.02 M - 0.02 M = 0? That can't be right because some dissociates.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing stoichiometric. Let me think again.\n\nIf the solution is stoichiometric, that probably means that the molar amounts of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are equal. So, let's say you start with 0.02 M Ca\u00b2+ and 0.02 M EDTA^4\u2212. They form 0.02 M CaEDTA^2\u2212, but some of the CaEDTA might dissociate.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because if all 0.02 M Ca\u00b2+ and 0.02 M EDTA^4\u2212 form 0.02 M complex, then the concentration of the complex would be 0.02 M, and the free Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA would be zero. But that's not possible because K is so large, but wait, K is the formation constant, which is very large, so the complex is almost completely formed.\n\nWait, but K is 5e10, which is a very large number, so the complex is very stable. So, the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ would be very low. So, perhaps x is negligible compared to 0.02.\n\nSo, in that case, [Ca\u00b2+] = x \u2248 0.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Let's write the formation equation:\n\nCa\u00b2+ + EDTA^4\u2212 \u2194 CaEDTA^2\u2212, K = 5e10.\n\nAt equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2\u2212] is 0.02 M.\n\nLet\u2019s let [Ca\u00b2+] = x.\n\nThen, [EDTA^4\u2212] = 0.02 - x.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial concentration of EDTA is the same as the initial concentration of Ca\u00b2+? Or not? Because the solution is stoichiometric, so I think that the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are each 0.02 M. So, when they react, they form 0.02 M of the complex.\n\nWait, but that would imply that all the Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are consumed, which can't be the case because some would dissociate. So, perhaps the initial concentrations are higher, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is made by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, which dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212. But no, that's not correct because the complex is already formed.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it as the solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, which dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212. But in that case, the initial [CaEDTA^2\u2212] is 0.02 M, and the dissociation would give some x of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212.\n\nWait, no, because the complex is formed from Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212, so the reverse reaction would be the dissociation. So, the dissociation equilibrium would be:\n\nCaEDTA^2\u2212 \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4\u2212, with K_dissociation = 1/K_formation = 1/(5e10).\n\nSo, the dissociation constant Kd is 2e-11.\n\nSo, the equilibrium expression is:\n\nKd = [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4\u2212] / [CaEDTA^2\u2212]\n\nWe can write:\n\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n\n[EDTA^4\u2212] = x (because for each mole of dissociation, one mole of Ca\u00b2+ and one mole of EDTA^4\u2212 are produced)\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\nKd = (x)(x) / [CaEDTA^2\u2212]\n\nBut [CaEDTA^2\u2212] is 0.02 M, so:\n\n2e-11 = x\u00b2 / 0.02\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx\u00b2 = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13\n\nx = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 \u2248 6.3e-7 M.\n\nWait, because sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.32456e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the concentration of Ca\u00b2+.\n\nWait, but wait, why did I assume [Ca\u00b2+] equals [EDTA^4\u2212]? Because each dissociation produces one of each, so yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca\u00b2\u207a]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions when there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex solution. The given concentration is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25\u00b0C.

The reaction is something like Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u2194 CaEDTA\u00b2\u2212. The formation constant, Kf, is given, which is 5e10. That's a pretty large K, so the complex is quite stable.\n\nStoichiometric means that the molar ratio is 1:1. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ as [Ca\u00b2+] and EDTA as [EDTA]. Since the reaction is 1:1, the complex formation would be: [Ca\u00b2+][EDTA] = Kf * [CaEDTA^2-].\n\nBut wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA^2\u2212] is 0.02 M. Because the stoichiometry is 1:1, the dissociation would be such that each mole of complex releases one mole of Ca\u00b2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.\n\nBut wait, in solution, EDTA is usually in different protonated forms, but the problem states that the pH is ideal. So maybe we can assume that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, Y^4\u2212. Or perhaps that's already accounted for in the formation constant. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Wait, the formation constant given is probably for the reaction Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212 \u2194 CaY^2\u2212. So Kf = [CaY^2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]).\n\nIf the solution is at stoichiometric point, that means the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA (Y^4\u2212) are equal because the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio. So let's think about that.\n\nWait, no. The stoichiometric point here refers to the solution containing exactly the complex, so the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA would be such that they completely form the complex. But since the complex is in solution, some of it will dissociate. So the problem is about finding the free [Ca\u00b2+] in solution.\n\nWait, but the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So the initial [CaY^2\u2212] is 0.02 M. Then, the complex can dissociate into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212. Let's set up an ICE table.\n\nLet me denote the dissociation as:\nCaY^2\u2212 \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212.\n\nAt initial, [CaY^2\u2212] = 0.02 M.

Then, [Ca\u00b2+] increases by x, and [Y^4\u2212] increases by x.\n\nAt equilibrium:\n[CaY^2\u2212] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since x is likely very small, given that Kf is large).\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n[Y^4\u2212] = x\n\nSo the formation constant Kf is [CaY^2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]) = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the formation constant is for the formation of the complex. So the reaction is:\n\nCa\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212 \u2194 CaY^2\u2212, Kf = 5e10.\n\nSo the reverse reaction, which is the dissociation, has a K equal to 1/Kf, which is 2e-11.\n\nSo for the dissociation:\n\nKd = [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]/[CaY^2\u2212] = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.\n\nSo, in the solution, [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [Y^4\u2212] = x, [CaY^2\u2212] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo Kd = (x * x) / 0.02 = x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 2e-11.\n\nSolving for x: x\u00b2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?

So Kf = [CaY^2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]).\n\nIf the solution is at stoichiometric point, that means the concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA (Y^4\u2212) are equal because the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio. So let's think about that.\n\nWait, no. The stoichiometric point here refers to the solution containing exactly the complex, so the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA would be such that they completely form the complex. But since the complex is in solution, some of it will dissociate. So the problem is about finding the free [Ca\u00b2+] in solution.\n\nWait, but the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So the initial [CaY^2\u2212] is 0.02 M. Then, the complex can dissociate into Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4\u2212. Let's set up an ICE table.\n\nLet me denote the dissociation as:\nCaY^2\u2212 \u2194 Ca\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212.\n\nAt initial, [CaY^2\u2212] = 0.02 M. [Ca\u00b2+] and [Y^4\u2212] are 0.\n\nChange: Let x be the change in [CaY^2\u2212], so it decreases by x. Then, [Ca\u00b2+] increases by x, and [Y^4\u2212] increases by x.\n\nAt equilibrium:\n[CaY^2\u2212] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since x is likely very small, given that Kf is large).\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n[Y^4\u2212] = x\n\nSo the formation constant Kf is [CaY^2\u2212]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]) = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the formation constant is for the formation of the complex. So the reaction is:\n\nCa\u00b2+ + Y^4\u2212 \u2194 CaY^2\u2212, Kf = 5e10.\n\nSo the reverse reaction, which is the dissociation, has a K equal to 1/Kf, which is 2e-11.\n\nSo for the dissociation:\n\nKd = [Ca\u00b2+][Y^4\u2212]/[CaY^2\u2212] = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.\n\nSo, in the solution, [Ca\u00b2+] = x, [Y^4\u2212] = x, [CaY^2\u2212] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo Kd = (x * x) / 0.02 = x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 2e-11.\n\nSolving for x: x\u00b2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) \u2192 which is 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-7 is 1e-7. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the answer. So the concentration of calcium ions is about 6.3e-7 M.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca\u00b2\u207a]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY\u00b2\u207b), we use the dissociation equilibrium:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CaY}^{2-} \\leftrightarrow \\text{Ca}^{2+} + \\text{Y}^{4-}\n\\]\n\nThe formation constant for the reaction is given as \\( K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10} \\). The dissociation constant \\( K_d \\), which is the reciprocal of \\( K_f \\), is:\n\n\\[\nK_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}.\n\\]\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are related by:\n\n\\[\nK_d = \\frac{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\\text{CaY}^{2-}]}.\n\\]\n\nLet the concentration of dissociated calcium ions be \\( x \\). Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, the concentration of EDTA (\\( [\\text{Y}^{4-}] \\)) is also \\( x \\), and the concentration of the complex (\\( [\\text{CaY}^{2-}] \\)) is approximately \\( 0.02 \\, \\text{M} \\) (assuming \\( x \\) is small compared to 0.02 M). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:\n\n\\[\nK_d = \\frac{x^2}{0.02}.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 = K_d \\cdot 0.02 = (2 \\times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \\times 10^{-13}.\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the concentration of calcium ions in solution is approximately \\( 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M} \\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**C) \\( 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M} \\)**.\n\nAnswer: C",
