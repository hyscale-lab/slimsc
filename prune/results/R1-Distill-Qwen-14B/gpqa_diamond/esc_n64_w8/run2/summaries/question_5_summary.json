      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. They provide the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by \u0127/2. So, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.\n\nFirst, I should remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when the corresponding observable is measured. The eigenvalues are the possible results of that measurement.\n\nThe operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. The direction n is in the x-z plane, which probably means it's in the x-y-z space but not in the y direction. Wait, no, the x-z plane is the plane where y=0. So any direction n in the x-z plane can be represented by angles \u03b8 and \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the angle in the x-y plane, but since it's in the x-z plane, maybe \u03c6 is 0 or something? Wait, no, actually, in the standard spherical coordinate system, the polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is measured in the x-y plane. But if the direction is in the x-z plane, that would mean \u03c6=0 or \u03c6=\u03c0, because the projection onto the y-axis is zero. So, the direction vector n would have components (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). But since it's in the x-z plane, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 must be zero. That implies either sin\u03b8=0 (which would mean along z-axis) or sin\u03c6=0, which implies \u03c6=0 or \u03c0. So the direction is either along the x or z axis, or some combination in between.\n\nWait, but the operator P is a vector operator, so P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. So when the operator is along a direction n, the operator we're considering is P\u00b7n, which would be the component of P in the direction of n.\n\nSo the operator in question is P\u00b7n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.\n\nBut since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So the operator simplifies to P\u00b7n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.\n\nOur task is to find the eigenvector of this operator for the eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n...\" Hmm, maybe I should think about the general approach.\n\nFirst, I need to write down the matrix form of the operator P\u00b7n. Let me write each component's matrix:\n\nGiven:\n- P_x = (\u0127/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n- P_y = (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n- P_z = (\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo, the operator P\u00b7n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z), since n_y = 0.\n\nLet me denote n_x = a, n_z = c. Since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, P\u00b7n = a*(\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + c*(\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n= (\u0127/2) [ [c, a], [a, -c] ]\n\nSo the matrix is [[c, a], [a, -c]] multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nWe are to find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:\n\n(P\u00b7n) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2)|\u03c8>\n\nWhich in matrix terms is:\n\n(\u0127/2) [[c, a], [a, -c]] * [\u03c81, \u03c82]^T = (\u0127/2) [\u03c81, \u03c82]^T\n\nDivide both sides by \u0127/2:\n\n[[c, a], [a, -c]] * [\u03c81, \u03c82]^T = [\u03c81, \u03c82]^T\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nc \u03c81 + a \u03c82 = \u03c81  \na \u03c81 - c \u03c82 = \u03c82\n\nLet me write these two equations:\n\n1. c \u03c81 + a \u03c82 = \u03c81  \n2. a \u03c81 - c \u03c82 = \u03c82\n\nSimplify equation 1:\n\n(c -1) \u03c81 + a \u03c82 = 0\n\nEquation 2:\n\na \u03c81 + (-c -1) \u03c82 =0\n\nSo we have a system of equations:\n\n(c-1) \u03c81 + a \u03c82 = 0  \na \u03c81 + (-c -1) \u03c82 = 0\n\nSince the eigenvector is non-trivial, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. Alternatively, the two equations should be linearly dependent, so we can find the ratio \u03c81/\u03c82.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: (c -1) \u03c81 = - a \u03c82  \nEquation 2: a \u03c81 = (c +1) \u03c82\n\nFrom equation 1: \u03c81 = [ -a/(c-1) ] \u03c82  \nFrom equation 2: \u03c81 = [ (c+1)/a ] \u03c82\n\nSet them equal:\n\n[ -a/(c-1) ] \u03c82 = [ (c+1)/a ] \u03c82\n\nAssuming \u03c82 is not zero (else trivial solution), we can divide both sides by \u03c82:\n\n- a/(c-1) = (c+1)/a\n\nMultiply both sides by a (c-1):\n\n- a^2 = (c+1)(c-1)\n\nSimplify the right side: c\u00b2 -1\n\nSo:\n\n- a\u00b2 = c\u00b2 -1  \nBut since a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =1 (because n is a unit vector), let's substitute a\u00b2 = 1 - c\u00b2.\n\nThen:\n\n- (1 - c\u00b2) = c\u00b2 -1  \nLeft side: -1 + c\u00b2  \nRight side: c\u00b2 -1  \nSo -1 + c\u00b2 = c\u00b2 -1, which is true. So the equations are consistent, and the ratio is valid.\n\nSo from equation 2: \u03c81 = ( (c+1)/a ) \u03c82\n\nLet me express \u03c81 in terms of \u03c82. Let me denote \u03c82 as some variable, say, x. So \u03c81 = ( (c+1)/a ) x.\n\nNow, the eigenvector is proportional to [ (c+1)/a, 1 ].\n\nBut let's compute (c+1)/a. Since a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =1, we can express a as sqrt(1 - c\u00b2), but the sign might matter. Wait, a is the x-component of the unit vector n in the x-z plane. So a = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, and n is in x-z plane, so \u03c6=0. So a = sin\u03b8, c=cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, actually, if \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis, then n_x = sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, n_z = cos\u03b8. But since n is in the x-z plane, \u03c6=0, so n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z=cos\u03b8.\n\nSo a = sin\u03b8, c=cos\u03b8.\n\nSo (c+1)/a = (cos\u03b8 +1)/sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can simplify this. Let's recall that (1 + cos\u03b8) = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo (cos\u03b8 +1)/sin\u03b8 = [2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ) = [cos(\u03b8/2)] / [sin(\u03b8/2)] ) = cot(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo \u03c81 = cot(\u03b8/2) * \u03c82.\n\nLet me represent the eigenvector as a vector [\u03c81, \u03c82]^T = \u03c82 [ cot(\u03b8/2), 1 ]^T.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(\u03b8/2), 1 ].\n\nBut wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can be represented up to a phase, and we usually normalize them.\n\nSo let's compute the normalization factor.\n\nThe norm squared is |\u03c81|^2 + |\u03c82|^2 = |cot(\u03b8/2)|^2 + 1.\n\nBut since \u03b8 is an angle, \u03b8/2 is between 0 and \u03c0, so cot(\u03b8/2) is real. So we can write:\n\nNorm squared = cot\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + 1 = csc\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1 / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(\u03b8/2), 1 ] multiplied by sin(\u03b8/2), since 1 / sqrt( csc\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) = sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n\u03c81 = cot(\u03b8/2) * sin(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)\n\u03c82 = 1 * sin(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo the components are [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nWait, but wait. Because in the earlier step, we have the matrix (P\u00b7n) with elements scaled by \u0127/2. The eigenvalue equation is (P\u00b7n)|\u03c8> = (\u0127/2)|\u03c8>. So the eigenvector is correct as [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nBut looking at the options, let's see:\n\nOption C: (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), but in terms of the components. But wait, the options include factors with \u0127.\n\nWait, the eigenvectors are usually dimensionless, right? Because the operator is in terms of \u0127. So the options might have some scaling with \u0127.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption C says (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)).\n\nOption D: (\u221a(2/3) \u0127 cos(\u03b8/2), \u221a(1/3) \u0127 sin(\u03b8/2)).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the options have components like sqrt(2/3) \u0127, etc. But the eigenvectors are typically normalized, so the components should have magnitude 1. However, the options include factors of \u0127, which is confusing because \u0127 has units of energy times time, etc. But in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are normalized, so the components should be dimensionless. So maybe the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the scaling. Because the operator P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) times some matrix. So when we found the eigenvector, perhaps the eigenvalue is (\u0127/2) times the eigenvalue. Wait no, the eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. So the equation is:\n\nP\u00b7n |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nWhich we already used. So the eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). But wait, the problem says 'the elements of the normalized eigenvector.' So that would fit option C.\n\nBut let me check the other options.\n\nOption B: (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). That looks like spherical harmonics, but I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nOption D: sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(\u03b8/2), etc. The presence of \u0127 is confusing because the eigenvectors are dimensionless.\n\nWait, perhaps the operator is scaled with \u0127/2, but the eigenvectors are still unit vectors. So the options including \u0127 must be incorrect.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: The X-component, P_x of the operator P is \u0127/2 times a 2x2 matrix. So P_x is (\u0127/2) multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the matrix for P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) multiplied by [ [c, a], [a, -c] ].\n\nBut when we write the eigenvalue equation, we have (P\u00b7n)|\u03c8> = (\u0127/2)|\u03c8>. So the matrix times |\u03c8> equals (\u0127/2)|\u03c8>, but when we divided both sides by \u0127/2, we got [[c, a],[a, -c]] |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ], which is option C.\n\nBut wait, the question says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So, for example, if n is along the z-axis (\u03b8=0), then the eigenvector would be [1,0], which is correct for P_z eigenstate +\u0127/2.\n\nIf n is along the x-axis (\u03b8= \u03c0/2), then the eigenvector would be [0,1], which makes sense because P_x's eigenstate with eigenvalue +\u0127/2 is [0,1].\n\nSo option C seems correct.\n\nLooking again at the options:\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))\n\nBut wait, the operator's eigenvector depends on the direction. So for a general direction, the eigenvector is as I found.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.

Alternatively, the two equations should be linearly dependent, so we can find the ratio \u03c81/\u03c82.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: (c -1) \u03c81 = - a \u03c82  \nEquation 2: a \u03c81 = (c +1) \u03c82\n\nFrom equation 1: \u03c81 = [ -a/(c-1) ] \u03c82  \nFrom equation 2: \u03c81 = [ (c+1)/a ] \u03c82\n\nSet them equal:\n\n[ -a/(c-1) ] \u03c82 = [ (c+1)/a ] \u03c82\n\nAssuming \u03c82 is not zero (else trivial solution), we can divide both sides by \u03c82:\n\n- a/(c-1) = (c+1)/a\n\nMultiply both sides by a (c-1):\n\n- a^2 = (c+1)(c-1)\n\nSimplify the right side: c\u00b2 -1\n\nSo:\n\n- a\u00b2 = c\u00b2 -1  \nBut since a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =1 (because n is a unit vector), let's substitute a\u00b2 = 1 - c\u00b2.\n\nThen:\n\n- (1 - c\u00b2) = c\u00b2 -1  \nLeft side: -1 + c\u00b2  \nRight side: c\u00b2 -1  \nSo -1 + c\u00b2 = c\u00b2 -1, which is true. So the equations are consistent, and the ratio is valid.\n\nSo from equation 2: \u03c81 = ( (c+1)/a ) \u03c82\n\nLet me express \u03c81 in terms of \u03c82. Let me denote \u03c82 as some variable, say, x. So \u03c81 = ( (c+1)/a ) x.\n\nNow, the eigenvector is proportional to [ (c+1)/a, 1 ].\n\nBut let's compute (c+1)/a. Since a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =1, we can express a as sqrt(1 - c\u00b2), but the sign might matter. Wait, a is the x-component of the unit vector n in the x-z plane. So a = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, and n is in x-z plane, so \u03c6=0. So a = sin\u03b8, c=cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, actually, if \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis, then n_x = sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, n_z = cos\u03b8. But since n is in the x-z plane, \u03c6=0, so n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z=cos\u03b8.\n\nSo a = sin\u03b8, c=cos\u03b8.\n\nSo (c+1)/a = (cos\u03b8 +1)/sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can simplify this. Let's recall that (1 + cos\u03b8) = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo (cos\u03b8 +1)/sin\u03b8 = [2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ) = [cos(\u03b8/2)] / [sin(\u03b8/2)] ) = cot(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo \u03c81 = cot(\u03b8/2) * \u03c82.\n\nLet me represent the eigenvector as a vector [\u03c81, \u03c82]^T = \u03c82 [ cot(\u03b8/2), 1 ]^T.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(\u03b8/2), 1 ].\n\nBut wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can be represented up to a phase, and we usually normalize them.\n\nSo let's compute the normalization factor.\n\nThe norm squared is |\u03c81|^2 + |\u03c82|^2 = |cot(\u03b8/2)|^2 + 1.\n\nBut since \u03b8 is an angle, \u03b8/2 is between 0 and \u03c0, so cot(\u03b8/2) is real. So we can write:\n\nNorm squared = cot\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + 1 = csc\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1 / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(\u03b8/2), 1 ] multiplied by sin(\u03b8/2), since 1 / sqrt( csc\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) = sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n\u03c81 = cot(\u03b8/2) * sin(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)\n\u03c82 = 1 * sin(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo the components are [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nWait, but wait. Because in the earlier step, we have the matrix (P\u00b7n) with elements scaled by \u0127/2. The eigenvalue equation is (P\u00b7n)|\u03c8> = (\u0127/2)|\u03c8>. So the eigenvector is correct as [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nBut looking at the options, let's see:\n\nOption C: (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), but in terms of the components. But wait, the options include factors with \u0127.\n\nWait, the eigenvectors are usually dimensionless, right? Because the operator is in terms of \u0127. So the options might have some scaling with \u0127.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption C says (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)).\n\nOption D: (\u221a(2/3) \u0127 cos(\u03b8/2), \u221a(1/3) \u0127 sin(\u03b8/2)).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the options have components like sqrt(2/3) \u0127, etc. But the eigenvectors are typically normalized, so the components should have magnitude 1. However, the options include factors of \u0127, which is confusing because \u0127 has units of energy times time, etc. But in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are normalized, so the components should be dimensionless. So maybe the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the scaling. Because the operator P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) times some matrix. So when we found the eigenvector, perhaps the eigenvalue is (\u0127/2) times the eigenvalue. Wait no, the eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. So the equation is:\n\nP\u00b7n |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nWhich we already used. So the eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). But wait, the problem says 'the elements of the normalized eigenvector.' So that would fit option C.\n\nBut let me check the other options.\n\nOption B: (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). That looks like spherical harmonics, but I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nOption D: sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(\u03b8/2), etc. The presence of \u0127 is confusing because the eigenvectors are dimensionless.\n\nWait, perhaps the operator is scaled with \u0127/2, but the eigenvectors are still unit vectors. So the options including \u0127 must be incorrect.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: The X-component, P_x of the operator P is \u0127/2 times a 2x2 matrix. So P_x is (\u0127/2) multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the matrix for P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) multiplied by [ [c, a], [a, -c] ].\n\nBut when we write the eigenvalue equation, we have (P\u00b7n)|\u03c8> = (\u0127/2)|\u03c8>. So the matrix times |\u03c8> equals (\u0127/2)|\u03c8>, but when we divided both sides by \u0127/2, we got [[c, a],[a, -c]] |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ], which is option C.\n\nBut wait, the question says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So, for example, if n is along the z-axis (\u03b8=0), then the eigenvector would be [1,0], which is correct for P_z eigenstate +\u0127/2.\n\nIf n is along the x-axis (\u03b8= \u03c0/2), then the eigenvector would be [0,1], which makes sense because P_x's eigenstate with eigenvalue +\u0127/2 is [0,1].\n\nSo option C seems correct.\n\nLooking again at the options:\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))\n\nBut wait, the operator's eigenvector depends on the direction. So for a general direction, the eigenvector is as I found.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are expressed as $2 \\times 2$ matrices scaled by $\\hbar/2$. Since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $y$-component of $\\vec{n}$ is zero, and the operator simplifies to $P \\cdot \\vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\n### Step 1: Matrix representation of $P \\cdot \\vec{n}$\nThe matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are given as:\n- $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n- $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n- $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSince $n_y = 0$, the operator $P \\cdot \\vec{n}$ becomes:\n\\[\nP \\cdot \\vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Eigenvalue equation\nThe eigenvalue equation is:\n\\[\n(P \\cdot \\vec{n}) |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} |\\psi\\rangle.\n\\]\nDividing through by $\\hbar/2$, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\psi_1 \\\\ \\psi_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\psi_1 \\\\ \\psi_2 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nThis leads to the system of equations:\n\\[\nn_z \\psi_1 + n_x \\psi_2 = \\psi_1, \\quad n_x \\psi_1 - n_z \\psi_2 = \\psi_2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solving for the eigenvector\nFrom the first equation:\n\\[\n(n_z - 1)\\psi_1 + n_x \\psi_2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\psi_1 = \\frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} \\psi_2.\n\\]\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[\nn_x \\psi_1 + (-n_z - 1)\\psi_2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\psi_1 = \\frac{n_z + 1}{n_x} \\psi_2.\n\\]\nEquating the two expressions for $\\psi_1$:\n\\[\n\\frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} = \\frac{n_z + 1}{n_x}.\n\\]\nCross-multiplying and simplifying:\n\\[\nn_x^2 = (1 - n_z)(n_z + 1) = 1 - n_z^2.\n\\]\nSince $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$, this is consistent. Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\psi_1 \\\\ \\psi_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\propto \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Normalization\nThe normalization condition is:\n\\[\n|\\psi_1|^2 + |\\psi_2|^2 = 1.\n\\]\nSubstituting $\\psi_1 = \\frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} \\psi_2$:\n\\[\n\\left|\\frac{n_x}{1 - n_z}\\right|^2 |\\psi_2|^2 + |\\psi_2|^2 = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad |\\psi_2|^2 \\left|\\frac{n_x}{1 - n_z}\\right|^2 + |\\psi_2|^2 = 1.\n\\]\nFactoring out $|\\psi_2|^2$:\n\\[\n|\\psi_2|^2 \\left(\\left|\\frac{n_x}{1 - n_z}\\right|^2 + 1\\right) = 1.\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n|\\psi_2|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\left|\\frac{n_x}{1 - n_z}\\right|^2 + 1}.\n\\]\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\psi_1 \\\\ \\psi_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{bmatrix},\n\\]\nwhere $\\theta$ is the polar angle of $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing the options\n- **Option A**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ includes factors of $\\hbar$, which is inconsistent with the normalization of eigenvectors.\n- **Option B**: $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin(\\theta))$ does not match the derived eigenvector components.\n- **Option C**: $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.\n- **Option D**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin(\\theta/2))$ includes incorrect normalization factors and $\\hbar$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **Option C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a specific operator. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says that we have a quantum mechanical operator P, which is a vector operator. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. The direction is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait, so n is in the x-z plane, which means the angle \u03b8 (from the z-axis) is between 0 and \u03c0/2, right? Because in the x-z plane, the projection along y is zero.\n\nThe operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is given as \u0127/2 times a 2x2 matrix. So I should probably write each of these matrices down.\n\nLet me jot them down:\n\nPx is (\u0127/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nPy is (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nPz is (\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nWait, the eigenvalue equation for a vector operator when considering the direction n is something like P \u00b7 n |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>, since the eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. So I think the operator we're interested in is the component of P in the direction of n, which is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.\n\nBut since the direction n is in the x-z plane, n_y must be zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1. Oh wait, but the direction is arbitrary, so maybe we can parametrize it using angles. Let me think: in the x-z plane, the angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis. So n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8, and n_y = 0. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the operator P_n becomes (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Substituting the values, that would be:\n\nP_n = (sin\u03b8)(Px) + (cos\u03b8)(Pz)\n\nSo let's write that out:\n\nP_n = (sin\u03b8)(\u0127/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + (cos\u03b8)(\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nLet me compute this matrix. Let's factor out \u0127/2:\n\nP_n = (\u0127/2) [ sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nMultiplying the matrices inside:\n\nFirst term: [[0*sin\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, 0]]\nSecond term: [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8]]\nAdding them together:\n\n[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nSo P_n is (\u0127/2) * [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvector of this matrix with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (+\u0127/2) |v>\n\nLet me write the matrix equation:\n\n(\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n          [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] \n * [v1; v2] = (\u0127/2) [v1; v2]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2/\u0127 to eliminate the factor:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] \n * [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]\n\nSo the matrix equation becomes:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 ] = v1\n[ sin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 ] = v2\n\nLet me write these as two equations:\n\n1. cos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1\n2. sin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 - v1 = 0\nv1 (cos\u03b8 -1) + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nEquation 2:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 - v2 = 0\nsin\u03b8 v1 - v2 (cos\u03b8 +1) = 0\n\nHmm, so equation 2 can be written as:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = v2 (cos\u03b8 +1)\n\nWe can solve for v2 in terms of v1.\n\nv2 = [ sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 +1) ] v1\n\nLet me compute sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 + 1). Hmm, perhaps using some trigonometric identities. I remember that (cos\u03b8 + 1) = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).\n\nSo sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 +1) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 cos^2(theta/2)] ] = tan(theta/2)\n\nSo v2 = tan(theta/2) v1\n\nSo v2 = tan(theta/2) v1\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [v1; v2] = v1 [1; tan(theta/2)]\n\nLet me let v1 = 1 for simplicity (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar). Then v2 = tan(theta/2).\n\nBut we need to normalize the eigenvector. The normalization condition is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = 1.\n\nSo |1|^2 + |tan(theta/2)|^2 = 1 + tan\u00b2(theta/2) = sec\u00b2(theta/2) = 1/(cos\u00b2(theta/2))\n\nSo the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1 + tan\u00b2(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2).\n\nWait, because 1 + tan\u00b2 x = sec\u00b2 x, so sqrt(1 + tan\u00b2x) = |sec x| = 1/|cos x|.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector components would be:\n\nv1 = cos(theta/2)\nv2 = sin(theta/2) [since tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so v2 = tan(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) = sin(theta/2) ]\n\nWait, because v2 = tan(theta/2) * v1, and v1 is cos(theta/2). So v2 = [sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2)] * cos(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2))\n\nWait, no, the options don't have hbar in them. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the options are given as the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvector is a vector in the Hilbert space, and each component should be a complex number (possibly), but in this case, our eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].\n\nBut wait, let me think about the operator again. Since the operator is Hermitian, its eigenvectors should be real or complex conjugates? Wait, the components of P are Hermitian, so yes, P_n is Hermitian, so the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors are either real or can be made real by choice of basis.\n\nWait, but in our case, the eigenvector came out as real, right? So the components are real numbers.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical coordinates but not necessarily the same as our solution.\n\nWait, but the problem says the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So in that case, the option B would become (cos(theta), sin(theta)), but that's not the same as our eigenvector.\n\nHmm. So why is option C the correct one?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: The operator P_n is the component along n. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvectors of the Pauli matrices are known. The eigenvectors for sigma \u00b7 n are (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).\n\nWait, that's right! Because the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices for spin in direction n are |+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T and |-> = [ -i sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nBut in this problem, the operator P is given by (\u0127/2) sigma, where sigma is the Pauli vector. So the eigenstates would be the same as for sigma \u00b7 n, scaled by \u0127/2.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector for eigenvalue +\u0127/2 is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nBut wait, in our case, phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane. So phi = 0. So e^{i phi} becomes 1. So the eigenvector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nWhich matches option C.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is different. So why is that? Oh because option B is using theta and phi in a different way. Wait, perhaps the angles are different.\n\nWait, no. Let me think about the parametrization again. The direction n is given in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So the eigenvector would be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nWhich is exactly option C. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is about the eigenvector of P, which is (\u0127/2) sigma. So the actual operator is (\u0127/2) sigma \u00b7 n. So the eigenvector is the same as for sigma \u00b7 n, except scaled by a factor. But the eigenvector is normalized, so the scaling factor doesn't affect the components. So the components are still (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nSo looking at the options, option C matches this.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a specific operator. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says that we have a quantum mechanical operator P, which is a vector operator. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. The direction is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait, so n is in the x-z plane, which means the angle \u03b8 (from the z-axis) is between 0 and \u03c0/2, right? Because in the x-z plane, the projection along y is zero.\n\nThe operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is given as \u0127/2 times a 2x2 matrix. So I should probably write each of these matrices down.\n\nLet me jot them down:\n\nPx is (\u0127/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nPy is (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nPz is (\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nWait, the eigenvalue equation for a vector operator when considering the direction n is something like P \u00b7 n |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>, since the eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. So I think the operator we're interested in is the component of P in the direction of n, which is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.\n\nBut since the direction n is in the x-z plane, n_y must be zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1. Oh wait, but the direction is arbitrary, so maybe we can parametrize it using angles. Let me think: in the x-z plane, the angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis. So n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8, and n_y = 0. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the operator P_n becomes (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Substituting the values, that would be:\n\nP_n = (sin\u03b8)(Px) + (cos\u03b8)(Pz)\n\nSo let's write that out:\n\nP_n = (sin\u03b8)(\u0127/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + (cos\u03b8)(\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nLet me compute this matrix. Let's factor out \u0127/2:\n\nP_n = (\u0127/2) [ sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nMultiplying the matrices inside:\n\nFirst term: [[0*sin\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, 0]]\nSecond term: [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8]]\nAdding them together:\n\n[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nSo P_n is (\u0127/2) * [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvector of this matrix with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (+\u0127/2) |v>\n\nLet me write the matrix equation:\n\n(\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n          [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] \n * [v1; v2] = (\u0127/2) [v1; v2]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2/\u0127 to eliminate the factor:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] \n * [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]\n\nSo the matrix equation becomes:\n\n[ cos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 ] = v1\n[ sin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 ] = v2\n\nLet me write these as two equations:\n\n1. cos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1\n2. sin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 - v1 = 0\nv1 (cos\u03b8 -1) + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nEquation 2:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 - v2 = 0\nsin\u03b8 v1 - v2 (cos\u03b8 +1) = 0\n\nHmm, so equation 2 can be written as:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = v2 (cos\u03b8 +1)\n\nWe can solve for v2 in terms of v1.\n\nv2 = [ sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 +1) ] v1\n\nLet me compute sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 + 1). Hmm, perhaps using some trigonometric identities. I remember that (cos\u03b8 + 1) = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).\n\nSo sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 +1) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 cos^2(theta/2)] ] = tan(theta/2)\n\nSo v2 = tan(theta/2) v1\n\nSo v2 = tan(theta/2) v1\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [v1; v2] = v1 [1; tan(theta/2)]\n\nLet me let v1 = 1 for simplicity (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar). Then v2 = tan(theta/2).\n\nBut we need to normalize the eigenvector. The normalization condition is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = 1.\n\nSo |1|^2 + |tan(theta/2)|^2 = 1 + tan\u00b2(theta/2) = sec\u00b2(theta/2) = 1/(cos\u00b2(theta/2))\n\nSo the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1 + tan\u00b2(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2).\n\nWait, because 1 + tan\u00b2 x = sec\u00b2 x, so sqrt(1 + tan\u00b2x) = |sec x| = 1/|cos x|.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector components would be:\n\nv1 = cos(theta/2)\nv2 = sin(theta/2) [since tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so v2 = tan(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) = sin(theta/2) ]\n\nWait, because v2 = tan(theta/2) * v1, and v1 is cos(theta/2). So v2 = [sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2)] * cos(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2))\n\nWait, no, the options don't have hbar in them. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the options are given as the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvector is a vector in the Hilbert space, and each component should be a complex number (possibly), but in this case, our eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].\n\nBut wait, let me think about the operator again. Since the operator is Hermitian, its eigenvectors should be real or complex conjugates? Wait, the components of P are Hermitian, so yes, P_n is Hermitian, so the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors are either real or can be made real by choice of basis.\n\nWait, but in our case, the eigenvector came out as real, right? So the components are real numbers.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical coordinates but not necessarily the same as our solution.\n\nWait, but the problem says the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So in that case, the option B would become (cos(theta), sin(theta)), but that's not the same as our eigenvector.\n\nHmm. So why is option C the correct one?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: The operator P_n is the component along n. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvectors of the Pauli matrices are known. The eigenvectors for sigma \u00b7 n are (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).\n\nWait, that's right! Because the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices for spin in direction n are |+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T and |-> = [ -i sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nBut in this problem, the operator P is given by (\u0127/2) sigma, where sigma is the Pauli vector. So the eigenstates would be the same as for sigma \u00b7 n, scaled by \u0127/2.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector for eigenvalue +\u0127/2 is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nBut wait, in our case, phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane. So phi = 0. So e^{i phi} becomes 1. So the eigenvector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nWhich matches option C.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is different. So why is that? Oh because option B is using theta and phi in a different way. Wait, perhaps the angles are different.\n\nWait, no. Let me think about the parametrization again. The direction n is given in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So the eigenvector would be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nWhich is exactly option C. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but wait, the question is about the eigenvector of P, which is (\u0127/2) sigma. So the actual operator is (\u0127/2) sigma \u00b7 n. So the eigenvector is the same as for sigma \u00b7 n, except scaled by a factor. But the eigenvector is normalized, so the scaling factor doesn't affect the components. So the components are still (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nSo looking at the options, option C matches this.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The components of $\\vec{P}$ are given as follows:\n\n- $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$  \n- $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$  \n- $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$  \n\nSince $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parametrized as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\vec{n}$ and the z-axis.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvectors and operators. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +\u0127/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P often relate to angular momentum. Oh right! The operator P is probably the angular momentum operator, and since we're dealing with a muon, which is a lepton like an electron, it has spin-\u00bd. So the eigenvectors would correspond to spin-up or spin-down states along a certain direction.\n\nThe problem gives me the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. Let me write them down.\n\nPx is (\u0127/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nPy is (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix times \u0127/2.\n\nPz is (\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix times \u0127/2.\n\nWait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be written as (x, 0, z), right? Because it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the direction is some angle \u03b8 from the z-axis, I think. Or maybe \u03b8 from the x-axis? Wait, in spherical coordinates, \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis. So the direction n would be (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, 0, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6) but since it's in x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 or 180? Wait, no, because for the x-z plane, the angle \u03c6 would be 0 or \u03c0, so the direction is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) perhaps. Wait, no, the polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis. So a vector in x-z plane would have \u03c6 = 0 or \u03c6 = \u03c0. So n would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) if \u03c6=0, and (-sin\u03b8,0, cos\u03b8) if \u03c6=\u03c0. But I'm not sure if that matters yet.\n\nThe operator P is along this direction n, so the operator we should be considering is the dot product of P with n. So P\u00b7n = Px * nx + Py * ny + Pz * nz. But since n is in x-z plane, ny is zero. So P\u00b7n = nx Px + nz Pz.\n\nWait, no, because the operator components are already scaled by \u0127/2. So let me think: the operator P\u00b7n would be (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) multiplied by \u0127/2, right? Because each component (P_x, P_y, P_z) is (\u0127/2) multiplied by their respective matrices.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The operator P is the angular momentum operator, which for spin-\u00bd particles is \u0127/2 times the Pauli matrices. So the total angular momentum in direction n is given by (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z) * \u0127/2, where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices.\n\nSo the operator we're interested in is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) * (\u0127/2), since n_y is zero.\n\nBut wait, the question says the eigenvector is for operator P along direction n. So we need to find the eigenstates of the operator P\u00b7n, which is a 2x2 matrix.\n\nThe eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. So the equation is (P\u00b7n) |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>.\n\nWait, but actually, the eigenvalue equation is (P\u00b7n) |v> = \u03bb |v>, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue. In this case, \u03bb is given as +\u0127/2.\n\nSo, (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>.\n\nWait, but P_x is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_x, P_z is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z. So substituting:\n\n(n_x (\u0127/2 \u03c3_x) + n_z (\u0127/2 \u03c3_z) ) |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>.\n\nDivide both sides by \u0127/2:\n\n( n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) |v> = |v>.\n\nSo the matrix equation is [n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z] |v> = 1 * |v>.\n\nHmm, so the eigenvalue is 1 for the matrix n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z.\n\nWait, \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the matrix is:\n\nn_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].\n\nSo the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector for this matrix with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T.\n\nWhich gives two equations:\n\n1) (n_z a + n_x b) = a\n2) (n_x a - n_z b) = b\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1:\n\nn_z a + n_x b = a \u2192 (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.\n\nEquation 2:\n\nn_x a - n_z b = b \u2192 n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0.\n\nSo now we have a system of two equations:\n\n(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0\nn_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n( (n_z -1) ) a + (n_x) b = 0\n(n_x) a + ( - (n_z +1) ) b = 0\n\nWe can write this in matrix form:\n\n[ (n_z -1), n_x ] [a]   = [0]\n[ n_x, -(n_z +1) ] [b]     [0]\n\nFor a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.\n\nSo determinant:\n\n(n_z -1)(- (n_z +1)) - (n_x)^2 = 0\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n= -(n_z -1)(n_z +1) - n_x^2\n= -(n_z^2 -1) - n_x^2\n= -n_z^2 +1 -n_x^2\n= -(n_x^2 + n_z^2) +1\n\nBut since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So substituting:\n\n= -(1) +1 = 0. Which holds true. So any solution is valid, but we have to find the eigenvectors.\n\nLet me assume that a is not zero, so we can express b in terms of a.\n\nFrom equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 \u2192 b = [ (1 - n_z) a ] / n_x\n\nWait, but n_x could be zero. Let me think. If n_x is zero, then the direction is along z. So let me handle the case when n_x is zero separately.\n\nCase 1: n_x \u2260 0.\n\nThen, b = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] a.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [1, (1-n_z)/n_x ].\n\nBut wait, for a spin-\u00bd particle, the eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along the direction n.\n\nWait, the eigenvalue is 1, which would correspond to the spin-up state. The other eigenvalue would be -1, but the question specifies +\u0127/2 as the eigenvalue.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the eigenvalue equation for the matrix n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z is 1, but let me think about the actual eigenvalues.\n\nThe eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [b, -a]] (which is what our matrix is, with a = n_z and b = n_x) are sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) and -sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). But wait, in our case, since n is a unit vector, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = n_z\u00b2 + n_x\u00b2 = 1 - n_y\u00b2. Wait, n is in x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1. So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So our matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11. So the eigenvalue 1 corresponds to the +1 state, which is spin-up along n.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [a, b] where a and b satisfy the equation [ (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 ].\n\nLet me express this as (n_z -1) a = -n_x b \u2192 a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b.\n\nWait, but maybe I should express b in terms of a.\n\nFrom equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 \u2192 n_x b = (1 - n_z) a \u2192 b = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] a.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [a, ( (1 - n_z)/n_x ) a ]^T.\n\nWe can write it as a * [1, (1 - n_z)/n_x ]^T.\n\nBut this is only when n_x is not zero. Let me think about the normalization.\n\nThe eigenvector must be normalized, so |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.\n\nSubstituting b: |a|^2 + | (1 - n_z)/n_x a |^2 = 1.\n\nWhich is |a|^2 [ 1 + ( (1 - n_z)^2 )/(n_x^2) ) ] =1.\n\nLet me compute 1 + (1 - n_z)^2 / n_x^2.\n\nBut n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, since n is a unit vector.\n\nHmm, let me compute (1 - n_z)^2 + n_x^2.\n\n(1 - n_z)^2 = 1 - 2 n_z + n_z^2.\n\nAdding n_x^2: 1 - 2 n_z + n_z^2 + n_x^2 = 1 - 2 n_z + (n_x^2 + n_z^2) ) = 1 - 2 n_z +1 = 2 (1 - n_z).\n\nSo 1 + (1 - n_z)^2 / n_x^2 = [n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2 ] / n_x^2 = [2(1 - n_z)] / n_x^2.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 1 + ( (1 - n_z)^2 ) / n_x^2 = [n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2 ] / n_x^2.\n\nBut n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.\n\nSo n_x^2 = (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z).\n\nSo [n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2 ] = (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) + (1 -n_z)^2 = (1 -n_z) [ (1 +n_z) + (1 -n_z) ] = (1 -n_z)(2) ) = 2 (1 -n_z).\n\nSo the denominator is n_x^2 = (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z).\n\nSo [n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2 ] / n_x^2 = [2(1 -n_z)] / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ] = 2/(1 +n_z).\n\nSo |a|^2 * [ 2/(1 +n_z) ) ] =1 \u2192 |a|^2 = (1 +n_z)/(2).\n\nSo a = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) * e^{i\u03b8}, but since the eigenvector can be multiplied by any phase, we can take a as real positive.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the phase doesn't matter because global phase doesn't affect the state. So let's take a as positive real.\n\nSo a = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), and b = [ (1 -n_z)/n_x ] * a.\n\nSo b = [ (1 -n_z) / n_x ] * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nBut let's compute n_x in terms of n_z.\n\nSince n_x^2 = 1 -n_z^2 \u2192 n_x = sqrt(1 -n_z^2). But the sign of n_x depends on the direction in x-z plane. So if the direction is in the positive x direction, n_x is positive; if in negative, it's negative. But since the eigenvector can be multiplied by a phase, perhaps we can take n_x positive without loss of generality.\n\nWait, but in the x-z plane, n can point in any direction, but the eigenvector might have different forms depending on that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenvector can be written in terms of spherical coordinates.\n\nWait, since the direction is in the x-z plane, we can parameterize n_z as cos\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, n_z = cos\u03b8, and n_x = sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6. But since it's in x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0, so n_x = sin\u03b8 or -sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: if the vector is in the x-z plane, then the angle \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0. So for \u03c6=0, n_x is sin\u03b8, and n_z is cos\u03b8. For \u03c6=\u03c0, n_x is -sin\u03b8, and n_z is cos\u03b8.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider \u03b8 as the angle between the direction n and the z-axis. So n_z = cos\u03b8, n_x = sin\u03b8, but with the possibility of n_x being positive or negative, depending on \u03c6.\n\nWait, but in this case, since n is arbitrary in x-z plane, perhaps the eigenvector can be written in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6. But looking at the options, some have theta and phi, others don't.\n\nLet me think about the form of the eigenvector.\n\nSo the eigenvector components are a and b.\n\na = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nb = [ (1 -n_z) / n_x ] * a\n\nSubstituting n_z = cos\u03b8, n_x = sin\u03b8 (assuming \u03c6=0 for simplicity), then:\n\na = sqrt( (1 + cos\u03b8)/2 )\n\nWhich is sqrt( cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) \u2192 cos(\u03b8/2), since \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0, so \u03b8/2 is between 0 and \u03c0/2, and cos is positive.\n\nSimilarly, b = [ (1 - cos\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] * a.\n\nBut 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo [ (2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) / (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) ] = [ sin(\u03b8/2) / cos(\u03b8/2) ) ] = tan(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo b = tan(\u03b8/2) * a.\n\nBut a is cos(\u03b8/2), so b = sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the eigenvector components are [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but wait. Because in the case where n_x is positive, that's when \u03c6=0, so n_x = sin\u03b8. But if \u03c6=\u03c0, n_x would be negative. So in that case, how would that affect b?\n\nWait, if n_x is negative, then [ (1 -n_z)/n_x ] would have a negative sign. Let me see.\n\nWait, n_z is cos\u03b8, and if n_x is negative, say n_x = -sin\u03b8 (for \u03c6=\u03c0), then:\n\nb = (1 - cos\u03b8) / (-sin\u03b8) * a.\n\nWhich would be - [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] a.\n\nWhich is - tan(\u03b8/2) a.\n\nSo the eigenvector would be [a, - tan(\u03b8/2) a ]^T.\n\nBut wait, what's a in this case?\n\na = sqrt( (1 + cos\u03b8)/2 ) = cos(\u03b8/2), same as before.\n\nSo the components would be [ cos(\u03b8/2), - sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nWait, because tan(\u03b8/2) is sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2), so if n_x is negative, the second component becomes negative.\n\nBut in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have a global phase, so perhaps the sign doesn't matter. So the eigenvector could be written as [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T, where \u03c6 is the angle around the z-axis. But since the operator is along a direction in the x-z plane (so \u03c6=0 or \u03c0), perhaps the phase is either 0 or \u03c0.\n\nWait, but the operator is along n, which is in the x-z plane, so the state would have a definite m_s along n. So the eigenvector can be written as [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T, where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle of n.\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, when n_x is positive, \u03c6=0, so e^{i\u03c6}=1, so the second component is sin(theta/2). When n_x is negative, phi=pi, so e^{i pi}=-1, so the second component becomes - sin(theta/2). Which matches the earlier result.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches the real case when phi=0. But option B is written as cos(theta), which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parameterization.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the eigenvector in terms of the direction vector n. Let me think again.\n\nThe eigenvector components are:\n\na = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nb = (1 - n_z)/(n_x) * a\n\nBut if I express in terms of theta, where n_z = cos(theta), and n_x = sin(theta) (assuming phi=0), then:\n\na = sqrt( (1 + cos(theta))/2 ) = cos(theta/2)\n\nb = (1 - cos(theta)) / sin(theta) * cos(theta/2 )\n\nWhich is [ (2 sin\u00b2(theta/2)) / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) ] * cos(theta/2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ sin(theta/2) / cos(theta/2) ] * cos(theta/2 )\n\n= sin(theta/2 )\n\nSo the components are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBut when phi is not zero, say phi = phi0, then n_x = sin(theta) cos(phi0), n_z = cos(theta).\n\nSo the same steps would give:\n\na = cos(theta/2)\n\nb = [ (1 - cos(theta)) / (sin(theta) cos(phi0)) ) ] * cos(theta/2 )\n\nBut 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2), sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)\n\nSo [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) cos(phi0) ) ] = [ sin(theta/2) ] / [ cos(theta/2) cos(phi0) ) ]\n\n= [ tan(theta/2) ] / cos(phi0 )\n\nWait, but this seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the general form of the eigenvector.\n\nThe general form for the eigenstate of spin in direction (theta, phi) is:\n\n[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nSo that's exactly option B, except option B is (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta). So that's not matching.\n\nWait, no. Option B says (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which would correspond to theta being twice the angle I'm using. Because in my case, it's theta/2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parameterization. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the state is |+> along direction (theta, phi), which is:\n\n|+> = cos(theta/2) |up> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |down>.\n\nSo in vector form, it's [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this when phi=0.\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is not the same as what I have here. So perhaps option C is correct, but only when phi=0.\n\nBut the question states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so phi could be 0 or pi.\n\nWait, but the options don't include theta/2 in all of them except C and D. So option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is correct for phi=0, but what about when phi=pi?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct general form is option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but I'm not seeing how that connects. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's express the eigenvector in terms of the direction vector n.\n\nThe eigenvector for spin-up along n is given by the state:\n\n|+n> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nWhich matches option C when phi=0, but in general, it's option B if theta is the polar angle, but in my calculation, I have theta/2. So perhaps the correct option is C, but only when phi=0.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, which would have a general phi, but looking at the options, only option B includes phi, but it uses theta instead of theta/2.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption A: (\u221a(2/3) \u0127, \u221a(1/3) \u0127 )\n\nOption B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))\n\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) \u0127 sin(theta/2))\n\nWait, the problem states that the eigenvector is normalized. So the vectors in the options must be normalized.\n\nIn my calculation, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWhich is normalized because cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) =1.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is this case when phi=0, but the problem allows for any phi in the x-z plane. So option B includes phi, but the first component is cos(theta), not cos(theta/2).\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, but in option B, the components are cos(theta) and e^{i phi} sin(theta). The sum of squares would be cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) =1, so it's normalized.\n\nBut wait, the eigenstate for spin along (theta, phi) is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo option B would correspond to a different parameterization, perhaps with theta being twice the polar angle.\n\nWait, perhaps the eigenvector in option B is written in terms of the angle theta measured differently.\n\nWait, if the direction is along (theta, phi), then the state is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBut option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is the same as [ cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ].\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to match any known parameterization. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using a different convention. Let me think about the spin matrices again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the eigenvectors for a general direction in x-z plane.\n\nLet me pick a specific direction to test the options.\n\nCase 1: Direction along +z axis (theta=0, phi=0).\n\nThen, the eigenvector for +\u0127/2 should be [1, 0], since spin-up along z is (1,0).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: cos(0/2) =1, sin(0/2)=0 \u2192 (1,0). Correct.\n\nOption B: cos(0)=1, e^{i 0} sin(0)=0 \u2192 (1,0). Also correct.\n\nOption D: sqrt(2/3) \u0127 * cos(0) = sqrt(2/3) \u0127, which is not 1. So D is incorrect.\n\nSo both option B and C give correct answer when theta=0 and phi=0.\n\nAnother test case: direction along +x (theta=90 degrees, phi=0).\n\nThe eigenvector should be [0,1], because spin-up along x is (0,1).\n\nOption C: cos(90/2)=cos(45)=\u221a2/2, sin(45)=\u221a2/2 \u2192 (\u221a2/2, \u221a2/2). This is not (0,1).\n\nOption B: cos(90)=0, e^{i0} sin(90)=1 \u2192 (0,1). Correct.\n\nSo for theta=90 degrees, option B gives the correct result, but option C doesn't.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that option B is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation said the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)].\n\nBut in this test case, when theta=90, the eigenvector is [0,1], which would correspond to [cos(45), sin(45)] \u2192 [\u221a2/2, \u221a2/2], but that's not [0,1].\n\nSo that's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait! I think I made a mistake in the direction.\n\nWait, when the direction is along +x, the polar angle theta is 90 degrees from the z-axis. So theta=90 degrees, phi=0.\n\nBut the spin-up state along +x is (0,1), not (1,0). So what's the correct eigenvector?\n\nWait, the spin-up along x is the eigenstate with eigenvalue +\u0127/2 for the Pauli X matrix.\n\nThe Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and its eigenstates are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2). Wait, no, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So the eigenstate for +1 is (1,1)/sqrt(2), and for -1 is (1,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that's not matching. Because when I apply the X matrix to (1,1), I get (1,1), so the eigenstate for +1 is (1,1)/sqrt(2).\n\nBut that's not the same as (0,1). So I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the direction. When the direction is along x, the spin-up state is |+x> = (|\u2191> + |\u2193>)/sqrt(2) = (1,1)/sqrt(2).\n\nBut that's different from the state I derived earlier.\n\nSo perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the spin matrices. Let's re-express the operator P\u00b7n.\n\nP\u00b7n = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z )\n\nGiven that P_x is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_x, P_z is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z.\n\nSo P\u00b7n = (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) * \u0127/2.\n\nWe are to find the eigenvalue +\u0127/2, so the eigenvalue equation is:\n\n(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) |v> = |v>.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the matrix (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) are \u00b11.\n\nSo for eigenvalue 1, the eigenvector is as before.\n\nWait, but when the direction is along +x, n_x=1, n_z=0.\n\nSo the matrix becomes \u03c3_x.\n\nThe eigenstates are (1,1) and (1,-1), with eigenvalues +1 and -1.\n\nSo the eigenvector for +1 is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo in this case, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but theta=90 degrees.\n\nWait, cos(theta/2) = cos(45)= sqrt(2)/2, and sin(theta/2)=sqrt(2)/2. So the state is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which matches the eigenstate for +1 when direction is along +x.\n\nBut in that case, the eigenvector would be [1,1]/sqrt(2), which is what I just calculated.\n\nSo in that case, option C would give [cos(45), sin(45)] = [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which is correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought the eigenvector for +x is (0,1), that's not correct. The correct spin-up state along x is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], as per option C.\n\nWait, so in this case, option C gives the correct result when theta=90 degrees, phi=0.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought the spin-up state along x is (0,1), I was wrong. So the correct state is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is given by option C when theta=90 degrees, phi=0.\n\nSo that aligns with option C.\n\nAnother test case: direction along +z (theta=0, phi=0).\n\nThe eigenvector should be (1,0), which option C gives: cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0. So correct.\n\nAnother test case: direction along -z (theta=180 degrees, phi=0).\n\nThe eigenvector should be (1,0) as well, but wait, no. The eigenvalue for direction -z would have the same eigenvector (1,0), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, the eigenvalue equation for P\u00b7n is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) |v> = |v>.\n\nIf n is along -z, n_z=-1, n_x=0.\n\nSo the matrix becomes -\u03c3_z.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is (-\u03c3_z) |v> = 1 |v> \u2192 -\u03c3_z |v> = |v> \u2192 \u03c3_z |v> = -|v>.\n\nSo the eigenstate is the spin-down state along z, which is (0,1).\n\nSo the eigenvector is (0,1), which would be [cos(180/2), sin(180/2)] = [cos(90), sin(90)] = [0,1]. Which matches.\n\nBut according to option C, it would be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] where theta=180 degrees. So cos(90)=0, sin(90)=1. So the vector is (0,1), correct.\n\nWait, but the eigenvalue in this case is +\u0127/2, but the eigenvalue equation for P\u00b7n is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) |v> = |v> \u2192 the eigenvalue is 1. So for n along -z, the eigenvalue is 1, but the state is (0,1), which is the spin-down state along z.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because when n is along -z, the eigenvalue equation would have eigenvalue -1 for the spin-up state along -z.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nThe operator is P\u00b7n = (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) * \u0127/2.\n\nSo when n is along -z, n_z = -1, n_x=0.\n\nSo P\u00b7n = (-\u03c3_z) * \u0127/2.\n\nThe eigenvalues of P\u00b7n are \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nSo the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 would correspond to the eigenstate of (-\u03c3_z) with eigenvalue +1.\n\nBut \u03c3_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So (-\u03c3_z) has eigenvalues -1 and +1.\n\nSo the eigenstate for eigenvalue +1 is the state where \u03c3_z has eigenvalue -1, which is (0,1).\n\nSo when n is along -z, the eigenstate is (0,1), which is correct as per option C when theta=180 degrees.\n\nSo in all these test cases, option C seems to give the correct result.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the general case, I thought that the eigenvector would involve e^{i phi} in the second component. So perhaps option B is the correct one.\n\nBut in the test case of direction along +x, the eigenvector is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is [ cos(45), sin(45) ], which is option C when theta=90 degrees. So in this case, option C is correct.\n\nBut when I look at option B, it's written as (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)). So when theta=90, phi=0, it's (0,1), which is not the correct state.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the correct state for theta=90, phi=0 is (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), not (0,1).\n\nSo option B can't be correct in this case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the state for spin-up along direction (theta, phi) is given by:\n\n|+n> = cos(theta/2) |\u2191> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |\u2193>.\n\nWhich in vector form is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo for theta=90 degrees, phi=0, it's [ cos(45), sin(45) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nWhich matches option C.\n\nSo option C is correct for this case.\n\nBut when theta=0, phi=0, option C gives [1,0], which is correct.\n\nWhen theta=180 degrees, phi=0, option C gives [0,1], which is correct.\n\nSo option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement, the options are:\n\nA) (sqrt(2/3) \u0127, sqrt(1/3) \u0127)\nB) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))\nC) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))\nD) (sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) \u0127 sin(theta/2))\n\nWait, but option C doesn't include the phase factor e^{i phi}, which is present in the general case. So why is option C correct?\n\nAh, because the question states that the direction is in the x-z plane, which implies that phi=0 or phi=pi, so the phase factor is either +1 or -1. But the eigenvector can be multiplied by a global phase, so it doesn't affect the state.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, which would have a phi value, but the eigenvector's second component can have a phase. So the general form includes phi, but none of the options except B include phi.\n\nWait, but in option C, the second component is sin(theta/2), which doesn't include the phase. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in terms of theta, not theta/2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parameterization. Let me think again.\n\nIf the direction is along (theta, phi), then the state is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo the components are cos(theta/2) and e^{i phi} sin(theta/2).\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Option B has cos(theta) and e^{i phi} sin(theta), which would be for a different parameterization.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle theta in option B is twice the polar angle I'm using. Let me think.\n\nIf in option B, theta is the same as the polar angle, then the components would be cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta), which doesn't match the correct eigenvector.\n\nBut if theta in option B is twice the polar angle, then cos(theta) would be cos(2 theta/2) = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem defines theta differently, such as the angle between the direction and the x-axis. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the test cases I've tried, option C seems to correctly represent the eigenvector for spin-up along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvectors and operators. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +\u0127/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P often relate to angular momentum. Oh right! The operator P is probably the angular momentum operator, and since we're dealing with a muon, which is a lepton like an electron, it has spin-\u00bd. So the eigenvectors would correspond to spin-up or spin-down states along a certain direction.\n\nThe problem gives me the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. Let me write them down.\n\nPx is (\u0127/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nPy is (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix times \u0127/2.\n\nPz is (\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix times \u0127/2.\n\nWait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be written as (x, 0, z), right? Because it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the direction is some angle \u03b8 from the z-axis, I think. Or maybe \u03b8 from the x-axis? Wait, in spherical coordinates, \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis. So the direction n would be (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, 0, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6) but since it's in x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 or 180? Wait, no, because for the x-z plane, the angle \u03c6 would be 0 or \u03c0, so the direction is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) perhaps. Wait, no, the polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis. So a vector in x-z plane would have \u03c6 = 0 or \u03c6 = \u03c0. So n would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) if \u03c6=0, and (-sin\u03b8,0, cos\u03b8) if \u03c6=\u03c0. But I'm not sure if that matters yet.\n\nThe operator P is along this direction n, so the operator we should be considering is the dot product of P with n. So P\u00b7n = Px * nx + Py * ny + Pz * nz. But since n is in x-z plane, ny is zero. So P\u00b7n = nx Px + nz Pz.\n\nWait, no, because the operator components are already scaled by \u0127/2. So let me think: the operator P\u00b7n would be (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) multiplied by \u0127/2, right? Because each component (P_x, P_y, P_z) is (\u0127/2) multiplied by their respective matrices.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The operator P is the angular momentum operator, which for spin-\u00bd particles is \u0127/2 times the Pauli matrices. So the total angular momentum in direction n is given by (n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z) * \u0127/2, where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices.\n\nSo the operator we're interested in is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) * (\u0127/2), since n_y is zero.\n\nBut wait, the question says the eigenvector is for operator P along direction n. So we need to find the eigenstates of the operator P\u00b7n, which is a 2x2 matrix.\n\nThe eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. So the equation is (P\u00b7n) |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>.\n\nWait, but actually, the eigenvalue equation is (P\u00b7n) |v> = \u03bb |v>, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue. In this case, \u03bb is given as +\u0127/2.\n\nSo, (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>.\n\nWait, but P_x is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_x, P_z is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z. So substituting:\n\n(n_x (\u0127/2 \u03c3_x) + n_z (\u0127/2 \u03c3_z) ) |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>.\n\nDivide both sides by \u0127/2:\n\n( n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) |v> = |v>.\n\nSo the matrix equation is [n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z] |v> = 1 * |v>.\n\nHmm, so the eigenvalue is 1 for the matrix n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z.\n\nWait, \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the matrix is:\n\nn_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].\n\nSo the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector for this matrix with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T.\n\nWhich gives two equations:\n\n1) (n_z a + n_x b) = a\n2) (n_x a - n_z b) = b\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1:\n\nn_z a + n_x b = a \u2192 (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.\n\nEquation 2:\n\nn_x a - n_z b = b \u2192 n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0.\n\nSo now we have a system of two equations:\n\n(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0\nn_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n( (n_z -1) ) a + (n_x) b = 0\n(n_x) a + ( - (n_z +1) ) b = 0\n\nWe can write this in matrix form:\n\n[ (n_z -1), n_x ] [a]   = [0]\n[ n_x, -(n_z +1) ] [b]     [0]\n\nFor a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.\n\nSo determinant:\n\n(n_z -1)(- (n_z +1)) - (n_x)^2 = 0\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n= -(n_z -1)(n_z +1) - n_x^2\n= -(n_z^2 -1) - n_x^2\n= -n_z^2 +1 -n_x^2\n= -(n_x^2 + n_z^2) +1\n\nBut since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So substituting:\n\n= -(1) +1 = 0. Which holds true. So any solution is valid, but we have to find the eigenvectors.\n\nLet me assume that a is not zero, so we can express b in terms of a.\n\nFrom equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 \u2192 b = [ (1 - n_z) a ] / n_x\n\nWait, but n_x could be zero. Let me think. If n_x is zero, then the direction is along z. So let me handle the case when n_x is zero separately.\n\nCase 1: n_x \u2260 0.\n\nThen, b = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] a.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [1, (1-n_z)/n_x ].\n\nBut wait, for a spin-\u00bd particle, the eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along the direction n.\n\nWait, the eigenvalue is 1, which would correspond to the spin-up state. The other eigenvalue would be -1, but the question specifies +\u0127/2 as the eigenvalue.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the eigenvalue equation for the matrix n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z is 1, but let me think about the actual eigenvalues.\n\nThe eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [b, -a]] (which is what our matrix is, with a = n_z and b = n_x) are sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) and -sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). But wait, in our case, since n is a unit vector, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = n_z\u00b2 + n_x\u00b2 = 1 - n_y\u00b2. Wait, n is in x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1. So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So our matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11. So the eigenvalue 1 corresponds to the +1 state, which is spin-up along n.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [a, b] where a and b satisfy the equation [ (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 ].\n\nLet me express this as (n_z -1) a = -n_x b \u2192 a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b.\n\nWait, but maybe I should express b in terms of a.\n\nFrom equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 \u2192 n_x b = (1 - n_z) a \u2192 b = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] a.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [a, ( (1 - n_z)/n_x ) a ]^T.\n\nWe can write it as a * [1, (1 - n_z)/n_x ]^T.\n\nBut this is only when n_x is not zero. Let me think about the normalization.\n\nThe eigenvector must be normalized, so |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.\n\nSubstituting b: |a|^2 + | (1 - n_z)/n_x a |^2 = 1.\n\nWhich is |a|^2 [ 1 + ( (1 - n_z)^2 )/(n_x^2) ) ] =1.\n\nLet me compute 1 + (1 - n_z)^2 / n_x^2.\n\nBut n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, since n is a unit vector.\n\nHmm, let me compute (1 - n_z)^2 + n_x^2.\n\n(1 - n_z)^2 = 1 - 2 n_z + n_z^2.\n\nAdding n_x^2: 1 - 2 n_z + n_z^2 + n_x^2 = 1 - 2 n_z + (n_x^2 + n_z^2) ) = 1 - 2 n_z +1 = 2 (1 - n_z).\n\nSo 1 + (1 - n_z)^2 / n_x^2 = [n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2 ] / n_x^2 = [2(1 - n_z)] / n_x^2.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 1 + ( (1 - n_z)^2 ) / n_x^2 = [n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2 ] / n_x^2.\n\nBut n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.\n\nSo n_x^2 = (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z).\n\nSo [n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2 ] = (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) + (1 -n_z)^2 = (1 -n_z) [ (1 +n_z) + (1 -n_z) ] = (1 -n_z)(2) ) = 2 (1 -n_z).\n\nSo the denominator is n_x^2 = (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z).\n\nSo [n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2 ] / n_x^2 = [2(1 -n_z)] / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ] = 2/(1 +n_z).\n\nSo |a|^2 * [ 2/(1 +n_z) ) ] =1 \u2192 |a|^2 = (1 +n_z)/(2).\n\nSo a = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) * e^{i\u03b8}, but since the eigenvector can be multiplied by any phase, we can take a as real positive.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the phase doesn't matter because global phase doesn't affect the state. So let's take a as positive real.\n\nSo a = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), and b = [ (1 -n_z)/n_x ] * a.\n\nSo b = [ (1 -n_z) / n_x ] * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nBut let's compute n_x in terms of n_z.\n\nSince n_x^2 = 1 -n_z^2 \u2192 n_x = sqrt(1 -n_z^2). But the sign of n_x depends on the direction in x-z plane. So if the direction is in the positive x direction, n_x is positive; if in negative, it's negative. But since the eigenvector can be multiplied by a phase, perhaps we can take n_x positive without loss of generality.\n\nWait, but in the x-z plane, n can point in any direction, but the eigenvector might have different forms depending on that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenvector can be written in terms of spherical coordinates.\n\nWait, since the direction is in the x-z plane, we can parameterize n_z as cos\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, n_z = cos\u03b8, and n_x = sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6. But since it's in x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0, so n_x = sin\u03b8 or -sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: if the vector is in the x-z plane, then the angle \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0. So for \u03c6=0, n_x is sin\u03b8, and n_z is cos\u03b8. For \u03c6=\u03c0, n_x is -sin\u03b8, and n_z is cos\u03b8.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider \u03b8 as the angle between the direction n and the z-axis. So n_z = cos\u03b8, n_x = sin\u03b8, but with the possibility of n_x being positive or negative, depending on \u03c6.\n\nWait, but in this case, since n is arbitrary in x-z plane, perhaps the eigenvector can be written in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6. But looking at the options, some have theta and phi, others don't.\n\nLet me think about the form of the eigenvector.\n\nSo the eigenvector components are a and b.\n\na = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nb = [ (1 -n_z) / n_x ] * a\n\nSubstituting n_z = cos\u03b8, n_x = sin\u03b8 (assuming \u03c6=0 for simplicity), then:\n\na = sqrt( (1 + cos\u03b8)/2 )\n\nWhich is sqrt( cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) \u2192 cos(\u03b8/2), since \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0, so \u03b8/2 is between 0 and \u03c0/2, and cos is positive.\n\nSimilarly, b = [ (1 - cos\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] * a.\n\nBut 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo [ (2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) / (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) ] = [ sin(\u03b8/2) / cos(\u03b8/2) ) ] = tan(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo b = tan(\u03b8/2) * a.\n\nBut a is cos(\u03b8/2), so b = sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the eigenvector components are [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but wait. Because in the case where n_x is positive, that's when \u03c6=0, so n_x = sin\u03b8. But if \u03c6=\u03c0, n_x would be negative. So in that case, how would that affect b?\n\nWait, if n_x is negative, then [ (1 -n_z)/n_x ] would have a negative sign. Let me see.\n\nWait, n_z is cos\u03b8, and if n_x is negative, say n_x = -sin\u03b8 (for \u03c6=\u03c0), then:\n\nb = (1 - cos\u03b8) / (-sin\u03b8) * a.\n\nWhich would be - [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] a.\n\nWhich is - tan(\u03b8/2) a.\n\nSo the eigenvector would be [a, - tan(\u03b8/2) a ]^T.\n\nBut wait, what's a in this case?\n\na = sqrt( (1 + cos\u03b8)/2 ) = cos(\u03b8/2), same as before.\n\nSo the components would be [ cos(\u03b8/2), - sin(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nWait, because tan(\u03b8/2) is sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2), so if n_x is negative, the second component becomes negative.\n\nBut in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have a global phase, so perhaps the sign doesn't matter. So the eigenvector could be written as [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T, where \u03c6 is the angle around the z-axis. But since the operator is along a direction in the x-z plane (so \u03c6=0 or \u03c0), perhaps the phase is either 0 or \u03c0.\n\nWait, but the operator is along n, which is in the x-z plane, so the state would have a definite m_s along n. So the eigenvector can be written as [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T, where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle of n.\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, when n_x is positive, \u03c6=0, so e^{i\u03c6}=1, so the second component is sin(theta/2). When n_x is negative, phi=pi, so e^{i pi}=-1, so the second component becomes - sin(theta/2). Which matches the earlier result.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches the real case when phi=0. But option B is written as cos(theta), which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parameterization.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the eigenvector in terms of the direction vector n. Let me think again.\n\nThe eigenvector components are:\n\na = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nb = (1 - n_z)/(n_x) * a\n\nBut if I express in terms of theta, where n_z = cos(theta), and n_x = sin(theta) (assuming phi=0), then:\n\na = sqrt( (1 + cos(theta))/2 ) = cos(theta/2)\n\nb = (1 - cos(theta)) / sin(theta) * cos(theta/2 )\n\nWhich is [ (2 sin\u00b2(theta/2)) / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) ] * cos(theta/2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ sin(theta/2) / cos(theta/2) ] * cos(theta/2 )\n\n= sin(theta/2 )\n\nSo the components are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBut when phi is not zero, say phi = phi0, then n_x = sin(theta) cos(phi0), n_z = cos(theta).\n\nSo the same steps would give:\n\na = cos(theta/2)\n\nb = [ (1 - cos(theta)) / (sin(theta) cos(phi0)) ) ] * cos(theta/2 )\n\nBut 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2), sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)\n\nSo [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) cos(phi0) ) ] = [ sin(theta/2) ] / [ cos(theta/2) cos(phi0) ) ]\n\n= [ tan(theta/2) ] / cos(phi0 )\n\nWait, but this seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the general form of the eigenvector.\n\nThe general form for the eigenstate of spin in direction (theta, phi) is:\n\n[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nSo that's exactly option B, except option B is (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta). So that's not matching.\n\nWait, no. Option B says (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which would correspond to theta being twice the angle I'm using. Because in my case, it's theta/2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parameterization. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the state is |+> along direction (theta, phi), which is:\n\n|+> = cos(theta/2) |up> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |down>.\n\nSo in vector form, it's [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this when phi=0.\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is not the same as what I have here. So perhaps option C is correct, but only when phi=0.\n\nBut the question states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so phi could be 0 or pi.\n\nWait, but the options don't include theta/2 in all of them except C and D. So option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is correct for phi=0, but what about when phi=pi?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct general form is option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but I'm not seeing how that connects. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's express the eigenvector in terms of the direction vector n.\n\nThe eigenvector for spin-up along n is given by the state:\n\n|+n> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nWhich matches option C when phi=0, but in general, it's option B if theta is the polar angle, but in my calculation, I have theta/2. So perhaps the correct option is C, but only when phi=0.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, which would have a general phi, but looking at the options, only option B includes phi, but it uses theta instead of theta/2.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption A: (\u221a(2/3) \u0127, \u221a(1/3) \u0127 )\n\nOption B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))\n\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) \u0127 sin(theta/2))\n\nWait, the problem states that the eigenvector is normalized. So the vectors in the options must be normalized.\n\nIn my calculation, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWhich is normalized because cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) =1.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is this case when phi=0, but the problem allows for any phi in the x-z plane. So option B includes phi, but the first component is cos(theta), not cos(theta/2).\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, but in option B, the components are cos(theta) and e^{i phi} sin(theta). The sum of squares would be cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) =1, so it's normalized.\n\nBut wait, the eigenstate for spin along (theta, phi) is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo option B would correspond to a different parameterization, perhaps with theta being twice the polar angle.\n\nWait, perhaps the eigenvector in option B is written in terms of the angle theta measured differently.\n\nWait, if the direction is along (theta, phi), then the state is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBut option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is the same as [ cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ].\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to match any known parameterization. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using a different convention. Let me think about the spin matrices again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the eigenvectors for a general direction in x-z plane.\n\nLet me pick a specific direction to test the options.\n\nCase 1: Direction along +z axis (theta=0, phi=0).\n\nThen, the eigenvector for +\u0127/2 should be [1, 0], since spin-up along z is (1,0).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: cos(0/2) =1, sin(0/2)=0 \u2192 (1,0). Correct.\n\nOption B: cos(0)=1, e^{i 0} sin(0)=0 \u2192 (1,0). Also correct.\n\nOption D: sqrt(2/3) \u0127 * cos(0) = sqrt(2/3) \u0127, which is not 1. So D is incorrect.\n\nSo both option B and C give correct answer when theta=0 and phi=0.\n\nAnother test case: direction along +x (theta=90 degrees, phi=0).\n\nThe eigenvector should be [0,1], because spin-up along x is (0,1).\n\nOption C: cos(90/2)=cos(45)=\u221a2/2, sin(45)=\u221a2/2 \u2192 (\u221a2/2, \u221a2/2). This is not (0,1).\n\nOption B: cos(90)=0, e^{i0} sin(90)=1 \u2192 (0,1). Correct.\n\nSo for theta=90 degrees, option B gives the correct result, but option C doesn't.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that option B is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation said the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)].\n\nBut in this test case, when theta=90, the eigenvector is [0,1], which would correspond to [cos(45), sin(45)] \u2192 [\u221a2/2, \u221a2/2], but that's not [0,1].\n\nSo that's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait! I think I made a mistake in the direction.\n\nWait, when the direction is along +x, the polar angle theta is 90 degrees from the z-axis. So theta=90 degrees, phi=0.\n\nBut the spin-up state along +x is (0,1), not (1,0). So what's the correct eigenvector?\n\nWait, the spin-up along x is the eigenstate with eigenvalue +\u0127/2 for the Pauli X matrix.\n\nThe Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and its eigenstates are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2). Wait, no, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So the eigenstate for +1 is (1,1)/sqrt(2), and for -1 is (1,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that's not matching. Because when I apply the X matrix to (1,1), I get (1,1), so the eigenstate for +1 is (1,1)/sqrt(2).\n\nBut that's not the same as (0,1). So I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the direction. When the direction is along x, the spin-up state is |+x> = (|\u2191> + |\u2193>)/sqrt(2) = (1,1)/sqrt(2).\n\nBut that's different from the state I derived earlier.\n\nSo perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the spin matrices. Let's re-express the operator P\u00b7n.\n\nP\u00b7n = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z )\n\nGiven that P_x is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_x, P_z is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z.\n\nSo P\u00b7n = (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) * \u0127/2.\n\nWe are to find the eigenvalue +\u0127/2, so the eigenvalue equation is:\n\n(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) |v> = |v>.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the matrix (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) are \u00b11.\n\nSo for eigenvalue 1, the eigenvector is as before.\n\nWait, but when the direction is along +x, n_x=1, n_z=0.\n\nSo the matrix becomes \u03c3_x.\n\nThe eigenstates are (1,1) and (1,-1), with eigenvalues +1 and -1.\n\nSo the eigenvector for +1 is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo in this case, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but theta=90 degrees.\n\nWait, cos(theta/2) = cos(45)= sqrt(2)/2, and sin(theta/2)=sqrt(2)/2. So the state is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which matches the eigenstate for +1 when direction is along +x.\n\nBut in that case, the eigenvector would be [1,1]/sqrt(2), which is what I just calculated.\n\nSo in that case, option C would give [cos(45), sin(45)] = [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which is correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought the eigenvector for +x is (0,1), that's not correct. The correct spin-up state along x is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], as per option C.\n\nWait, so in this case, option C gives the correct result when theta=90 degrees, phi=0.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought the spin-up state along x is (0,1), I was wrong. So the correct state is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is given by option C when theta=90 degrees, phi=0.\n\nSo that aligns with option C.\n\nAnother test case: direction along +z (theta=0, phi=0).\n\nThe eigenvector should be (1,0), which option C gives: cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0. So correct.\n\nAnother test case: direction along -z (theta=180 degrees, phi=0).\n\nThe eigenvector should be (1,0) as well, but wait, no. The eigenvalue for direction -z would have the same eigenvector (1,0), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, the eigenvalue equation for P\u00b7n is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) |v> = |v>.\n\nIf n is along -z, n_z=-1, n_x=0.\n\nSo the matrix becomes -\u03c3_z.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is (-\u03c3_z) |v> = 1 |v> \u2192 -\u03c3_z |v> = |v> \u2192 \u03c3_z |v> = -|v>.\n\nSo the eigenstate is the spin-down state along z, which is (0,1).\n\nSo the eigenvector is (0,1), which would be [cos(180/2), sin(180/2)] = [cos(90), sin(90)] = [0,1]. Which matches.\n\nBut according to option C, it would be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] where theta=180 degrees. So cos(90)=0, sin(90)=1. So the vector is (0,1), correct.\n\nWait, but the eigenvalue in this case is +\u0127/2, but the eigenvalue equation for P\u00b7n is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) |v> = |v> \u2192 the eigenvalue is 1. So for n along -z, the eigenvalue is 1, but the state is (0,1), which is the spin-down state along z.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because when n is along -z, the eigenvalue equation would have eigenvalue -1 for the spin-up state along -z.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nThe operator is P\u00b7n = (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z ) * \u0127/2.\n\nSo when n is along -z, n_z = -1, n_x=0.\n\nSo P\u00b7n = (-\u03c3_z) * \u0127/2.\n\nThe eigenvalues of P\u00b7n are \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nSo the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 would correspond to the eigenstate of (-\u03c3_z) with eigenvalue +1.\n\nBut \u03c3_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So (-\u03c3_z) has eigenvalues -1 and +1.\n\nSo the eigenstate for eigenvalue +1 is the state where \u03c3_z has eigenvalue -1, which is (0,1).\n\nSo when n is along -z, the eigenstate is (0,1), which is correct as per option C when theta=180 degrees.\n\nSo in all these test cases, option C seems to give the correct result.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the general case, I thought that the eigenvector would involve e^{i phi} in the second component. So perhaps option B is the correct one.\n\nBut in the test case of direction along +x, the eigenvector is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is [ cos(45), sin(45) ], which is option C when theta=90 degrees. So in this case, option C is correct.\n\nBut when I look at option B, it's written as (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)). So when theta=90, phi=0, it's (0,1), which is not the correct state.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the correct state for theta=90, phi=0 is (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), not (0,1).\n\nSo option B can't be correct in this case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the state for spin-up along direction (theta, phi) is given by:\n\n|+n> = cos(theta/2) |\u2191> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |\u2193>.\n\nWhich in vector form is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo for theta=90 degrees, phi=0, it's [ cos(45), sin(45) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ].\n\nWhich matches option C.\n\nSo option C is correct for this case.\n\nBut when theta=0, phi=0, option C gives [1,0], which is correct.\n\nWhen theta=180 degrees, phi=0, option C gives [0,1], which is correct.\n\nSo option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement, the options are:\n\nA) (sqrt(2/3) \u0127, sqrt(1/3) \u0127)\nB) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))\nC) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))\nD) (sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) \u0127 sin(theta/2))\n\nWait, but option C doesn't include the phase factor e^{i phi}, which is present in the general case. So why is option C correct?\n\nAh, because the question states that the direction is in the x-z plane, which implies that phi=0 or phi=pi, so the phase factor is either +1 or -1. But the eigenvector can be multiplied by a global phase, so it doesn't affect the state.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, which would have a phi value, but the eigenvector's second component can have a phase. So the general form includes phi, but none of the options except B include phi.\n\nWait, but in option C, the second component is sin(theta/2), which doesn't include the phase. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in terms of theta, not theta/2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parameterization. Let me think again.\n\nIf the direction is along (theta, phi), then the state is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo the components are cos(theta/2) and e^{i phi} sin(theta/2).\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Option B has cos(theta) and e^{i phi} sin(theta), which would be for a different parameterization.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle theta in option B is twice the polar angle I'm using. Let me think.\n\nIf in option B, theta is the same as the polar angle, then the components would be cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta), which doesn't match the correct eigenvector.\n\nBut if theta in option B is twice the polar angle, then cos(theta) would be cos(2 theta/2) = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem defines theta differently, such as the angle between the direction and the x-axis. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the test cases I've tried, option C seems to correctly represent the eigenvector for spin-up along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Operator along $\\vec{n}$**: The operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ is constructed as:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z \\right),\n   \\]\n   where $n_x = \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi$ and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$.\n\n2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is:\n   \\[\n   \\left( n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z \\right) |v\\rangle = |v\\rangle,\n   \\]\n   where the eigenvalue is $1$ (after factoring out $\\hbar/2$). The matrix representation of $n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   n_z & n_x \\\\\n   n_x & -n_z\n   \\end{bmatrix}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Eigenvector Calculation**: Solving the eigenvalue equation yields the eigenvector:\n   \\[\n   |v\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ e^{i\\phi} \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{bmatrix}.\n   \\]\n   This eigenvector is normalized, as $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector and lacks the angular dependence.\n   - **Option B**: $(\\cos\\theta, e^{i\\phi}\\sin\\theta)$ is incorrect because the components involve $\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$.\n   - **Option C**: $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ matches the derived eigenvector for $\\phi = 0$. It is correct for arbitrary $\\phi$ up to a global phase, which does not affect the state.\n   - **Option D**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin(\\theta/2))$ introduces incorrect normalization factors and is inconsistent with the derived eigenvector.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**, which matches the derived result for arbitrary $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ in the x-z plane.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me start by understanding what's given and what I need to find.\n\nThe operator is P, and it's a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as (\u0127/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. The question is about finding the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.\n\nHmm, wait. The operator P is a vector, so the direction is important. Since the direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane, I think it can be represented using spherical coordinates. The direction vector n can be written as (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, 0, sin\u03b8), because it's in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. But wait, since the direction is arbitrary, maybe I don't need to worry about \u03c6 here because the problem is symmetric around the y-axis? Or maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, no. The operator P is a vector operator, so when we're looking for eigenstates along a direction n, we're probably considering the component P\u00b7n. Because the eigenvalue equation would be (P\u00b7n) |\u03c8> = \u03bb |\u03c8>, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue. Oh wait, but in this question, the eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. So the operator in question is P\u00b7n, right?\n\nSo I need to construct the matrix for P\u00b7n and then find its eigenvectors.\n\nWait, but the question says \"calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\" So P is the vector operator, and the direction is n. So the operator is P\u00b7n, which would be a scalar operator. The eigenvalue is +\u0127/2.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: the operator P is a vector, so the components are P_x, P_y, P_z. The operator in the direction of n is P\u00b7n, which would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. So yes, P\u00b7n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.\n\nSince n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P\u00b7n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.\n\nSo I need to construct the matrix for P\u00b7n. Let me first write down the matrices for each component.\n\nGiven:\nP_x = (\u0127/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nP_y = (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nP_z = (\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo, P\u00b7n = (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z), where \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z are the Pauli matrices.\n\nWait, because each component is (\u0127/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So P\u00b7n would be (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z). So the matrix would be (\u0127/2) times [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].\n\nWait, let me compute it. Let's write out each term.\n\nn_x is sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, and n_z is cos\u03b8, since n is in the x-z plane.\n\nWait, no. Because the direction in the x-z plane would typically be described by polar angles \u03b8 from the z-axis and \u03c6 from the x-axis. So the direction vector would be (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, 0, cos\u03b8). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, a point on the unit sphere is (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). But since the direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So \u03c6 must be 0 or \u03c0? Wait, no. Wait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0. Because in spherical coordinates, \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0, meaning that the direction is along the x-axis (\u03c6=0) or along the negative x-axis (\u03c6=\u03c0), but wait, no. Wait, in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 (along +x) or \u03c0/2 (along +z) or \u03c0 (along -x) or 3\u03c0/2 (along -z). Wait, no, because in spherical coordinates, \u03c6 is the angle in the x-y plane from the x-axis. So for the x-z plane, the direction can be any angle where the y-component is zero. So the unit vector would have components (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8) but with sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = 0. So either sin\u03b8=0 (meaning \u03b8=0 or \u03c0, which would be along z) or sin\u03c6=0, which implies \u03c6=0 or \u03c0, meaning along x. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a direction in the x-z plane can be represented as (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the x-axis to the direction in the x-z plane. So for example, \u03b8=0 is along +x, \u03b8=\u03c0/2 is along +z, \u03b8=\u03c0 is along -x, \u03b8=3\u03c0/2 is along -z. That makes sense. So the direction vector is (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8). But since it's a unit vector, cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo n_x = cos\u03b8, n_z = sin\u03b8. But wait, that would mean that when \u03b8=0, n is along +x, and when \u03b8=\u03c0/2, it's along +z. Hmm, but in that case, the angle \u03b8 is measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis. Alternatively, sometimes it's measured from the z-axis. Wait, perhaps I should clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the direction n in terms of an angle \u03b8 from the z-axis and \u03c6=0. Because n is in the x-z plane, so \u03c6=0, meaning the direction is in the x-z plane, not the y-z or x-y. So the direction vector would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis. So when \u03b8=0, it's along +z; \u03b8=\u03c0/2, it's along +x; \u03b8=\u03c0, it's along -z; etc.\n\nSo then, n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nSo P\u00b7n would be (\u0127/2) [sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z].\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nThe Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So:\n\nsin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x = [[0, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, 0]]\ncos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z = [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nThen, multiply by \u0127/2. So the matrix for P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) * [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]].\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\n[ [ (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8, (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ],\n  [ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ] ]\n\nWe're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is (P\u00b7n - \u03bb I) |v> = 0, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue.\n\nSo \u03bb = \u0127/2.\n\nSo substituting, the matrix becomes:\n\n[ (\u0127/2 cos\u03b8 - \u0127/2), (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8) ],\n[ (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8 ), ( - \u0127/2 cos\u03b8 - \u0127/2 ) ]\n\nSimplify each element by factoring out \u0127/2:\n\n[ (cos\u03b8 -1) , sin\u03b8 ],\n[ sin\u03b8, -(cos\u03b8 +1) ]\n\nWait, because each element is multiplied by \u0127/2, so when we subtract \u03bb=\u0127/2, it's:\n\nFirst row, first element: (\u0127/2 cos\u03b8) - (\u0127/2) = (\u0127/2)(cos\u03b8 -1)\nFirst row, second element: (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8) - 0 = (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8)\nSecond row, first element: (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8) - 0 = (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8)\nSecond row, second element: -(\u0127/2 cos\u03b8) - (\u0127/2) = -(\u0127/2)(cos\u03b8 +1)\n\nSo the matrix is (\u0127/2) times the matrix:\n\n[ (cos\u03b8 -1), sin\u03b8 ]\n[ sin\u03b8, -(cos\u03b8 +1) ]\n\nBut when solving the eigenvalue equation, we can factor out (\u0127/2) from each row, so the equation becomes:\n\n(\u0127/2) [ (cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0,\n          sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0 ]\n\nWhere a and b are the components of the eigenvector. Since (\u0127/2) is a scalar factor, we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the ratio of a and b.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\nsin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nWe can write the first equation as (cos\u03b8 -1) a = - sin\u03b8 b \u2192 a = [ - sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 -1) ] b\n\nBut (cos\u03b8 -1) is equal to -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 is 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So let me compute this ratio.\n\na = [ - sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 -1) ] b\n= [ - (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) / ( -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) ] b\n= [ (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) / ( 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) ] b\n= [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] b\n= cot(\u03b8/2) * b\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2) * b\n\nLet me choose b = sin(\u03b8/2), then a = cot(\u03b8/2) * sin(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the eigenvector components would be a = cos(\u03b8/2), b = sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I can just choose b like that. Let me check.\n\nWait, the eigenvector can be any non-zero scalar multiple of the solution. So the ratio a/b is cot(\u03b8/2), so a = [cot(\u03b8/2)] b.\n\nSo we can write the eigenvector as (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)) up to normalization.\n\nWait, but let me verify this solution with the equations.\n\nSubstituting a = cos(\u03b8/2), b = sin(\u03b8/2) into the first equation:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = ?\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\ncos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) -1 \u2192 cos\u03b8 -1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) -1 -1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) -2 = 2 (cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) -1) = -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo (cos\u03b8 -1) a = (-2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) * cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo sin\u03b8 * b = (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) * sin(\u03b8/2) = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo the first equation becomes:\n\n(-2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) + 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ) = 0 \u2192 yes, it holds.\n\nNow the second equation: sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = ?\n\nsin\u03b8 a = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) * cos(\u03b8/2) = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\ncos\u03b8 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\nSo (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) * sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) - 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) sin(\u03b8/2) ) = 0 \u2192 yes, it holds.\n\nSo the solution a = cos(\u03b8/2), b = sin(\u03b8/2) works.\n\nBut wait, I should check the normalization. The eigenvector should be normalized, so |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.\n\nCompute |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1. So yes, it's already normalized.\n\nWait, but in the given options, the answers have terms with sqrt(2/3) \u0127 and so on. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering the components correctly. Because in the problem statement, the operator P is given, but when you construct P\u00b7n, you might have to consider that the eigenvalue equation is (P\u00b7n)|v> = (\u0127/2)|v>.\n\nWait, but the matrix I constructed earlier is (\u0127/2) times [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ].\n\nWait, let me re-express the matrix P\u00b7n as (\u0127/2) * [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8, but perhaps I got that mixed up. Let me clarify the direction vector again.\n\nWait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, and we're using spherical coordinates where \u03c6=0, then the direction vector is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Because for the standard spherical coordinates, the unit vector is (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). But in this case, since it's in the x-z plane, \u03c6=0, so the vector is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). So n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nSo P\u00b7n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z = (\u0127/2) [ \u03c3_x sin\u03b8 + \u03c3_z cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\n(\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nWait, no. Let me compute \u03c3_x sin\u03b8 + \u03c3_z cos\u03b8.\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplied by sin\u03b8 gives [[0, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, 0]]\n\n\u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], multiplied by cos\u03b8 gives [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nAdding them: [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nSo P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) multiplied by that matrix.\n\nSo when we set up the eigenvalue equation (P\u00b7n - \u03bb I)|v> = 0, with \u03bb = \u0127/2.\n\nSo (P\u00b7n) = [[ (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8, (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ],\n            [ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ] ]\n\nSubtracting \u03bb I (which is [[\u0127/2, 0], [0, \u0127/2]]) gives:\n\n[ [ (\u0127/2 cos\u03b8 - \u0127/2), (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8) ],\n  [ (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8), -(\u0127/2 cos\u03b8) - \u0127/2 ) ] ]\n\nFactor out \u0127/2:\n\n= \u0127/2 [ [ cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8 ],\n          [ sin\u03b8, -(cos\u03b8 + 1) ] ]\n\nSo the equations become:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\nsin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nAs before, the ratio a/b = [ (cos\u03b8 +1) ] / [ sin\u03b8 ]\n\nWait, wait. Let me solve the first equation:\n\n(cos\u03b8 - 1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0 \u2192 (1 - cos\u03b8) a = sin\u03b8 b \u2192 a = [ sin\u03b8 / (1 - cos\u03b8) ] b\n\nBut 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So:\n\na = [ 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ) / ( 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) ] b\n= [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] b\n= cot(\u03b8/2) b\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2) b.\n\nNow, substitute into the second equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nSubstitute a = cot(\u03b8/2) b:\n\nsin\u03b8 * cot(\u03b8/2) b - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nFactor out b:\n\n[ sin\u03b8 cot(\u03b8/2) - (cos\u03b8 +1) ] b = 0\n\nSo we need to check if the term inside the brackets is zero.\n\nCompute sin\u03b8 cot(\u03b8/2):\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\ncot(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2)\nSo sin\u03b8 cot(\u03b8/2) = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) * [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo:\n\n2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) - (cos\u03b8 +1 )\n\nBut cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) -1.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) -1 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) - 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 0. So yes, the equation holds.\n\nThus, the ratio a = cot(\u03b8/2) b is correct.\n\nSo the eigenvector components are proportional to a = cos(\u03b8/2), b = sin(\u03b8/2), as earlier.\n\nWait, but why? Because when you choose b = sin(\u03b8/2), then a = cos(\u03b8/2). So the eigenvector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)).\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused because the options don't seem to directly match this. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but in our case, phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane. So B becomes (cos(theta), sin(theta)), but that doesn't match our result.\n\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2))\n\nHmm, why would there be hbar in the components? Because eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? Because operators have units of \u0127 (since they're angular momentum operators), but the eigenvectors are state vectors, which are dimensionless. So the options with \u0127 might be incorrect, unless they're using some scaling. Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the components of P have \u0127/2 factors. So perhaps the eigenvectors are written in terms of that.\n\nWait, but the eigenvector is a state vector, so it's normalized and has no units. So the options with \u0127 in them (like options A and D) can't be correct, because state vectors are unit vectors, not scaled by \u0127. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the components correctly. The eigenvalue is \u0127/2, so the operator P\u00b7n has eigenvalue \u0127/2. The eigenvector |v> is a spin-1/2 state, which has two components. The eigenvector we found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nWait, but looking back, perhaps the eigenvector is written in terms of some spinor. Let me think about the standard spin-1/2 states. The eigenstates of S\u00b7n are (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)) for spin-up and the conjugate for spin-down. But in our case, since we're in the x-z plane, phi=0, so the state becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut in our problem, the operator is P, which is analogous to spin, but scaled by \u0127/2. So the eigenvector would be the same as the spin eigenstate, but perhaps scaled. Wait, but the eigenvector is a normalized vector, so the scaling factor would be 1, as we found earlier.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what we have. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which would be for theta from the z-axis, but in our case, the direction is along (sin theta, 0, cos theta), so perhaps I'm getting the angles mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in the angle definitions. Let me think again: the direction n is in the x-z plane, so n is (sin theta, 0, cos theta), where theta is measured from the x-axis. So when theta=0, n is along +x; theta=pi/2, along +z.\n\nWait, but in the standard spin state, the state |+n> is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)), where theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle. But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So the state becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nWait, but if the direction is defined by theta from the x-axis, then the standard spin state would have a different expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused about the angle definitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result. So that's probably the correct answer.\n\nWait, but why is option B an option? It looks like a general spherical coordinate expression, but perhaps in our case, since phi is zero, it reduces to (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which doesn't match our solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nYes, that's what we derived.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"the normalized eigenvector\". So our solution is already normalized, as cos\u00b2(theta/2) + sin\u00b2(theta/2) =1.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n",

Subtracting $\\lambda I$ from the matrix of $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} - \\lambda I = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} \n\\cos\\theta - 1 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \n\\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta - 1 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nFactoring out $\\hbar/2$, the equations become:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases} \n(\\cos\\theta - 1)a + \\sin\\theta b = 0, \\\\\n\\sin\\theta a - (\\cos\\theta + 1)b = 0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation, we find the ratio $a/b = \\cot(\\theta/2)$. Choosing $b = \\sin(\\theta/2)$, we find $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector components are:\n\n\\[\na = \\cos(\\theta/2), \\quad b = \\sin(\\theta/2).\n\\]\n\nThis eigenvector is already normalized, as $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing with the options:\n\n- **Option A**: Includes $\\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.\n- **Option B**: Represents a general spherical coordinate expression, but it does not match the derived result for the x-z plane case.\n- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n- **Option D**: Includes $\\hbar$ in the components and modifies the normalization, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me start by understanding what's given and what I need to find.\n\nThe operator is P, and it's a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as (\u0127/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. The question is about finding the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.\n\nHmm, wait. The operator P is a vector, so the direction is important. Since the direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane, I think it can be represented using spherical coordinates. The direction vector n can be written as (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, 0, sin\u03b8), because it's in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. But wait, since the direction is arbitrary, maybe I don't need to worry about \u03c6 here because the problem is symmetric around the y-axis? Or maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, no. The operator P is a vector operator, so when we're looking for eigenstates along a direction n, we're probably considering the component P\u00b7n. Because the eigenvalue equation would be (P\u00b7n) |\u03c8> = \u03bb |\u03c8>, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue. Oh wait, but in this question, the eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. So the operator in question is P\u00b7n, right?\n\nSo I need to construct the matrix for P\u00b7n and then find its eigenvectors.\n\nWait, but the question says \"calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\" So P is the vector operator, and the direction is n. So the operator is P\u00b7n, which would be a scalar operator. The eigenvalue is +\u0127/2.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: the operator P is a vector, so the components are P_x, P_y, P_z. The operator in the direction of n is P\u00b7n, which would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. So yes, P\u00b7n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.\n\nSince n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P\u00b7n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.\n\nSo I need to construct the matrix for P\u00b7n. Let me first write down the matrices for each component.\n\nGiven:\nP_x = (\u0127/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\nP_y = (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\nP_z = (\u0127/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo, P\u00b7n = (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z), where \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z are the Pauli matrices.\n\nWait, because each component is (\u0127/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So P\u00b7n would be (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z). So the matrix would be (\u0127/2) times [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].\n\nWait, let me compute it. Let's write out each term.\n\nn_x is sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, and n_z is cos\u03b8, since n is in the x-z plane.\n\nWait, no. Because the direction in the x-z plane would typically be described by polar angles \u03b8 from the z-axis and \u03c6 from the x-axis. So the direction vector would be (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, 0, cos\u03b8). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, a point on the unit sphere is (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). But since the direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So \u03c6 must be 0 or \u03c0? Wait, no. Wait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0. Because in spherical coordinates, \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0, meaning that the direction is along the x-axis (\u03c6=0) or along the negative x-axis (\u03c6=\u03c0), but wait, no. Wait, in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 (along +x) or \u03c0/2 (along +z) or \u03c0 (along -x) or 3\u03c0/2 (along -z). Wait, no, because in spherical coordinates, \u03c6 is the angle in the x-y plane from the x-axis. So for the x-z plane, the direction can be any angle where the y-component is zero. So the unit vector would have components (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8) but with sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = 0. So either sin\u03b8=0 (meaning \u03b8=0 or \u03c0, which would be along z) or sin\u03c6=0, which implies \u03c6=0 or \u03c0, meaning along x. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a direction in the x-z plane can be represented as (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the x-axis to the direction in the x-z plane. So for example, \u03b8=0 is along +x, \u03b8=\u03c0/2 is along +z, \u03b8=\u03c0 is along -x, \u03b8=3\u03c0/2 is along -z. That makes sense. So the direction vector is (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8). But since it's a unit vector, cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo n_x = cos\u03b8, n_z = sin\u03b8. But wait, that would mean that when \u03b8=0, n is along +x, and when \u03b8=\u03c0/2, it's along +z. Hmm, but in that case, the angle \u03b8 is measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis. Alternatively, sometimes it's measured from the z-axis. Wait, perhaps I should clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the direction n in terms of an angle \u03b8 from the z-axis and \u03c6=0. Because n is in the x-z plane, so \u03c6=0, meaning the direction is in the x-z plane, not the y-z or x-y. So the direction vector would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis. So when \u03b8=0, it's along +z; \u03b8=\u03c0/2, it's along +x; \u03b8=\u03c0, it's along -z; etc.\n\nSo then, n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nSo P\u00b7n would be (\u0127/2) [sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z].\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nThe Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So:\n\nsin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x = [[0, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, 0]]\ncos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z = [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nThen, multiply by \u0127/2. So the matrix for P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) * [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]].\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\n[ [ (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8, (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ],\n  [ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ] ]\n\nWe're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is (P\u00b7n - \u03bb I) |v> = 0, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue.\n\nSo \u03bb = \u0127/2.\n\nSo substituting, the matrix becomes:\n\n[ (\u0127/2 cos\u03b8 - \u0127/2), (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8) ],\n[ (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8 ), ( - \u0127/2 cos\u03b8 - \u0127/2 ) ]\n\nSimplify each element by factoring out \u0127/2:\n\n[ (cos\u03b8 -1) , sin\u03b8 ],\n[ sin\u03b8, -(cos\u03b8 +1) ]\n\nWait, because each element is multiplied by \u0127/2, so when we subtract \u03bb=\u0127/2, it's:\n\nFirst row, first element: (\u0127/2 cos\u03b8) - (\u0127/2) = (\u0127/2)(cos\u03b8 -1)\nFirst row, second element: (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8) - 0 = (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8)\nSecond row, first element: (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8) - 0 = (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8)\nSecond row, second element: -(\u0127/2 cos\u03b8) - (\u0127/2) = -(\u0127/2)(cos\u03b8 +1)\n\nSo the matrix is (\u0127/2) times the matrix:\n\n[ (cos\u03b8 -1), sin\u03b8 ]\n[ sin\u03b8, -(cos\u03b8 +1) ]\n\nBut when solving the eigenvalue equation, we can factor out (\u0127/2) from each row, so the equation becomes:\n\n(\u0127/2) [ (cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0,\n          sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0 ]\n\nWhere a and b are the components of the eigenvector. Since (\u0127/2) is a scalar factor, we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the ratio of a and b.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\nsin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nWe can write the first equation as (cos\u03b8 -1) a = - sin\u03b8 b \u2192 a = [ - sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 -1) ] b\n\nBut (cos\u03b8 -1) is equal to -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 is 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So let me compute this ratio.\n\na = [ - sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 -1) ] b\n= [ - (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) / ( -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) ] b\n= [ (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) / ( 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) ] b\n= [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] b\n= cot(\u03b8/2) * b\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2) * b\n\nLet me choose b = sin(\u03b8/2), then a = cot(\u03b8/2) * sin(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the eigenvector components would be a = cos(\u03b8/2), b = sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I can just choose b like that. Let me check.\n\nWait, the eigenvector can be any non-zero scalar multiple of the solution. So the ratio a/b is cot(\u03b8/2), so a = [cot(\u03b8/2)] b.\n\nSo we can write the eigenvector as (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)) up to normalization.\n\nWait, but let me verify this solution with the equations.\n\nSubstituting a = cos(\u03b8/2), b = sin(\u03b8/2) into the first equation:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = ?\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\ncos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) -1 \u2192 cos\u03b8 -1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) -1 -1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) -2 = 2 (cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) -1) = -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo (cos\u03b8 -1) a = (-2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) * cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo sin\u03b8 * b = (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) * sin(\u03b8/2) = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo the first equation becomes:\n\n(-2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) + 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ) = 0 \u2192 yes, it holds.\n\nNow the second equation: sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = ?\n\nsin\u03b8 a = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) * cos(\u03b8/2) = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\ncos\u03b8 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\nSo (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) * sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) - 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) sin(\u03b8/2) ) = 0 \u2192 yes, it holds.\n\nSo the solution a = cos(\u03b8/2), b = sin(\u03b8/2) works.\n\nBut wait, I should check the normalization. The eigenvector should be normalized, so |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.\n\nCompute |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1. So yes, it's already normalized.\n\nWait, but in the given options, the answers have terms with sqrt(2/3) \u0127 and so on. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering the components correctly. Because in the problem statement, the operator P is given, but when you construct P\u00b7n, you might have to consider that the eigenvalue equation is (P\u00b7n)|v> = (\u0127/2)|v>.\n\nWait, but the matrix I constructed earlier is (\u0127/2) times [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ].\n\nWait, let me re-express the matrix P\u00b7n as (\u0127/2) * [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8, but perhaps I got that mixed up. Let me clarify the direction vector again.\n\nWait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, and we're using spherical coordinates where \u03c6=0, then the direction vector is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Because for the standard spherical coordinates, the unit vector is (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). But in this case, since it's in the x-z plane, \u03c6=0, so the vector is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). So n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nSo P\u00b7n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z = (\u0127/2) [ \u03c3_x sin\u03b8 + \u03c3_z cos\u03b8 ]\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\n(\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nWait, no. Let me compute \u03c3_x sin\u03b8 + \u03c3_z cos\u03b8.\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplied by sin\u03b8 gives [[0, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, 0]]\n\n\u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], multiplied by cos\u03b8 gives [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nAdding them: [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nSo P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) multiplied by that matrix.\n\nSo when we set up the eigenvalue equation (P\u00b7n - \u03bb I)|v> = 0, with \u03bb = \u0127/2.\n\nSo (P\u00b7n) = [[ (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8, (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ],\n            [ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ] ]\n\nSubtracting \u03bb I (which is [[\u0127/2, 0], [0, \u0127/2]]) gives:\n\n[ [ (\u0127/2 cos\u03b8 - \u0127/2), (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8) ],\n  [ (\u0127/2 sin\u03b8), -(\u0127/2 cos\u03b8) - \u0127/2 ) ] ]\n\nFactor out \u0127/2:\n\n= \u0127/2 [ [ cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8 ],\n          [ sin\u03b8, -(cos\u03b8 + 1) ] ]\n\nSo the equations become:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0\nsin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nAs before, the ratio a/b = [ (cos\u03b8 +1) ] / [ sin\u03b8 ]\n\nWait, wait. Let me solve the first equation:\n\n(cos\u03b8 - 1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0 \u2192 (1 - cos\u03b8) a = sin\u03b8 b \u2192 a = [ sin\u03b8 / (1 - cos\u03b8) ] b\n\nBut 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So:\n\na = [ 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ) / ( 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) ] b\n= [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] b\n= cot(\u03b8/2) b\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2) b.\n\nNow, substitute into the second equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nSubstitute a = cot(\u03b8/2) b:\n\nsin\u03b8 * cot(\u03b8/2) b - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nFactor out b:\n\n[ sin\u03b8 cot(\u03b8/2) - (cos\u03b8 +1) ] b = 0\n\nSo we need to check if the term inside the brackets is zero.\n\nCompute sin\u03b8 cot(\u03b8/2):\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\ncot(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2)\nSo sin\u03b8 cot(\u03b8/2) = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) * [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo:\n\n2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) - (cos\u03b8 +1 )\n\nBut cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) -1.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) -1 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) - 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 0. So yes, the equation holds.\n\nThus, the ratio a = cot(\u03b8/2) b is correct.\n\nSo the eigenvector components are proportional to a = cos(\u03b8/2), b = sin(\u03b8/2), as earlier.\n\nWait, but why? Because when you choose b = sin(\u03b8/2), then a = cos(\u03b8/2). So the eigenvector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)).\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused because the options don't seem to directly match this. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but in our case, phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane. So B becomes (cos(theta), sin(theta)), but that doesn't match our result.\n\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2))\n\nHmm, why would there be hbar in the components? Because eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? Because operators have units of \u0127 (since they're angular momentum operators), but the eigenvectors are state vectors, which are dimensionless. So the options with \u0127 might be incorrect, unless they're using some scaling. Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the components of P have \u0127/2 factors. So perhaps the eigenvectors are written in terms of that.\n\nWait, but the eigenvector is a state vector, so it's normalized and has no units. So the options with \u0127 in them (like options A and D) can't be correct, because state vectors are unit vectors, not scaled by \u0127. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the components correctly. The eigenvalue is \u0127/2, so the operator P\u00b7n has eigenvalue \u0127/2. The eigenvector |v> is a spin-1/2 state, which has two components. The eigenvector we found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nWait, but looking back, perhaps the eigenvector is written in terms of some spinor. Let me think about the standard spin-1/2 states. The eigenstates of S\u00b7n are (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)) for spin-up and the conjugate for spin-down. But in our case, since we're in the x-z plane, phi=0, so the state becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut in our problem, the operator is P, which is analogous to spin, but scaled by \u0127/2. So the eigenvector would be the same as the spin eigenstate, but perhaps scaled. Wait, but the eigenvector is a normalized vector, so the scaling factor would be 1, as we found earlier.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what we have. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which would be for theta from the z-axis, but in our case, the direction is along (sin theta, 0, cos theta), so perhaps I'm getting the angles mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in the angle definitions. Let me think again: the direction n is in the x-z plane, so n is (sin theta, 0, cos theta), where theta is measured from the x-axis. So when theta=0, n is along +x; theta=pi/2, along +z.\n\nWait, but in the standard spin state, the state |+n> is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)), where theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle. But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So the state becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nWait, but if the direction is defined by theta from the x-axis, then the standard spin state would have a different expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused about the angle definitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result. So that's probably the correct answer.\n\nWait, but why is option B an option? It looks like a general spherical coordinate expression, but perhaps in our case, since phi is zero, it reduces to (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which doesn't match our solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nYes, that's what we derived.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"the normalized eigenvector\". So our solution is already normalized, as cos\u00b2(theta/2) + sin\u00b2(theta/2) =1.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each represented as a $2 \\times 2$ matrix multiplied by $\\hbar/2$. The direction $\\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so it can be expressed as $(\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle measured from the x-axis.\n\nThe operator $\\vec{P}$ in the direction of $\\vec{n}$ is given by $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z$. Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we construct the matrix for $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} \n\\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \n\\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is $(\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} - \\lambda I)|v\\rangle = 0$, where $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. Subtracting $\\lambda I$ from the matrix of $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} - \\lambda I = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} \n\\cos\\theta - 1 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \n\\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta - 1 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nFactoring out $\\hbar/2$, the equations become:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases} \n(\\cos\\theta - 1)a + \\sin\\theta b = 0, \\\\\n\\sin\\theta a - (\\cos\\theta + 1)b = 0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation, we find the ratio $a/b = \\cot(\\theta/2)$. Choosing $b = \\sin(\\theta/2)$, we find $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector components are:\n\n\\[\na = \\cos(\\theta/2), \\quad b = \\sin(\\theta/2).\n\\]\n\nThis eigenvector is already normalized, as $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing with the options:\n\n- **Option A**: Includes $\\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.\n- **Option B**: Represents a general spherical coordinate expression, but it does not match the derived result for the x-z plane case.\n- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n- **Option D**: Includes $\\hbar$ in the components and modifies the normalization, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvalues and eigenvectors are related to operators in quantum mechanics, where the eigenvector is the state vector and the eigenvalue is the possible outcome when measuring that observable.\n\nSo the operator P is along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. That means the direction has components in x and z, but not in y. So n can be represented as (something, 0, something), right? Or wait, no, the direction is in x-z, so it's (nx, 0, nz), but since it's a direction, the magnitude should be 1. So nx\u00b2 + nz\u00b2 =1. But I'm not sure if I need to use that right now.\n\nThe components of the operator P are given for X, Y, and Z. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. Let me write them down:\n\nP_x is (\u0127/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by \u0127/2.\n\nP_y is (\u0127/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled similarly.\n\nP_z is (\u0127/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix scaled.\n\nWait, but the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n. So I think P is the vector operator, and the component along n would be P \u00b7 n, right? So P = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, since the operator is along n, the operator is P = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z), since n is in x-z plane and n_y=0.\n\nWait, but the direction n is arbitrary in x-z plane, so n is (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, 0, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6) or something like that. Wait, no, wait. The standard spherical coordinates have \u03b8 from the z-axis. So any direction in x-z plane would have \u03c6=0 or \u03c0, because the y-component is zero. Or maybe not, perhaps \u03c6 is 0 for x direction, 90 for z, but no, wait, in standard spherical coordinates, \u03c6 is the angle in the xy-plane. So if direction is in x-z plane, perhaps \u03c6 is 0, meaning along x, or 90, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of \u03b8 being the angle from the z-axis. So if n is in the x-z plane, the direction can be represented with \u03b8 as the polar angle, and \u03c6=0. So n_x = sin\u03b8 * cos\u03c6, but since \u03c6=0, n_x = sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to think of n as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), because when \u03b8 is 0, it's along z, and \u03b8=90 is along x. So for a general direction in x-z plane, n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Because the unit vector would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. So substituting, P = sin\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Let me compute that matrix.\n\nCompute each component:\n\nFirst, for P_x: (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]\nP_z: (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]\nSo P = sin\u03b8 * P_x + cos\u03b8 * P_z.\n\nSo combining the two, the matrix becomes:\n\n[ [ (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8, (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ],\n  [ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ] ]\n\nWait, let me compute each element:\n\nTop-left element: (\u0127/2) * (0 * sin\u03b8 + 1 * cos\u03b8) )? No, no. Wait, when you add the matrices, each element is added.\n\nWait, P_x matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]] multiplied by \u0127/2, so each element is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix elements.\n\nSimilarly for P_z: [[1,0],[0,-1]] times \u0127/2.\n\nSo when you add sin\u03b8*P_x + cos\u03b8*P_z, you get:\n\nEach element:\n\nTop-left: sin\u03b8 * (0)*(\u0127/2) + cos\u03b8 * (1)*(\u0127/2) \u2192 (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8\nTop-right: sin\u03b8 * (1)*(\u0127/2) + cos\u03b8 * (0)*(\u0127/2) \u2192 (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8\nBottom-left: same as top-right, because the P_x is symmetric \u2192 (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8\nBottom-right: sin\u03b8 * (0) + cos\u03b8 * (-1)*(\u0127/2) \u2192 -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\n[ [ (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8, (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ],\n  [ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ] ]\n\nNow, the eigenvalue equation is P |\u03c8> = \u03bb |\u03c8>, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue. We're given \u03bb = +\u0127/2.\n\nSo substituting, the equation is:\n\n[ [ (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8, (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ],\n  [ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ] ]\n *\n [ a ]\n [ b ]\n=\n (\u0127/2) [ a ]\n        [ b ]\n\nSo the matrix equation is:\n\n( (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ) a + ( (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ) b = (\u0127/2) a \u2192 equation (1)\n( (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ) a + ( -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ) b = (\u0127/2) b \u2192 equation (2)\n\nWe can divide both sides by \u0127/2 to simplify:\n\nEquation (1): cos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b = a\nEquation (2): sin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b = b\n\nLet me rearrange equation (1):\n\ncos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b = a \u2192 cos\u03b8 a - a + sin\u03b8 b = 0 \u2192 a (cos\u03b8 - 1) + b sin\u03b8 = 0 \u2192 equation (1a)\n\nEquation (2): sin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b = b \u2192 sin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b - b = 0 \u2192 sin\u03b8 a - b (cos\u03b8 + 1) = 0 \u2192 equation (2a)\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1) a (cos\u03b8 - 1) + b sin\u03b8 = 0\n2) a sin\u03b8 - b (cos\u03b8 +1 ) = 0\n\nWe can write this as a system:\n\nEquation (1a): (cos\u03b8 -1) a + (sin\u03b8) b = 0\nEquation (2a): (sin\u03b8) a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nTo solve this system, we can write it in matrix form and find non-trivial solutions (since eigenvectors can't be zero vectors). So the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n| (cos\u03b8 -1)   sin\u03b8        |\n| sin\u03b8        -(cos\u03b8 +1) |\n\nSo determinant D = (cos\u03b8 -1)(-cos\u03b8 -1) - (sin\u03b8)(sin\u03b8)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1)(-cos\u03b8 -1) = -(cos\u03b8 -1)(cos\u03b8 +1) = -(cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 1) = - ( - sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nAnd (sin\u03b8)(sin\u03b8) = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo D = sin\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 0. Which makes sense because the two equations are dependent; the system is consistent.\n\nSo to find the eigenvectors, we can take one equation and express a in terms of b or vice versa.\n\nLet me take equation (1a):\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0 \u2192 a = [ - sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 -1) ] b\n\nWait, but cos\u03b8 -1 is negative of (1 - cos\u03b8), which is 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2). Hmm, perhaps we can simplify this expression.\n\nWait, let me note that cos\u03b8 -1 = - 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo substituting:\n\na = [ - (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) / ( -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) ] b\n\nThe negatives cancel, and 2 cancels. So:\n\na = [ (sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) / ( sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) ] b = [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] b = cot(\u03b8/2) b\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2) b.\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as a = [cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2)] b.\n\nSo, the eigenvector can be written as (a, b) = ( cot(\u03b8/2) b, b )\n\nBut for simplicity, let's set b = 1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar). Then a = cot(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ cot(\u03b8/2), 1 ].\n\nBut wait, we need to normalize it. The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.\n\nSo let's compute:\n\n|a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(\u03b8/2)|^2 + 1 = [ (cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) / ( sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) ] + 1 = [ cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ] / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) = 1 / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2 )\n\nSo the normalization factor is sqrt( sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) = |sin(\u03b8/2)|. Since \u03b8 is an angle in quantum mechanics, I think it's between 0 and \u03c0, so sin(\u03b8/2) is non-negative. So normalization factor is sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(\u03b8/2) * sin(\u03b8/2), 1 * sin(\u03b8/2) ]\n\nSimplify each component:\n\nFirst component: cot(\u03b8/2) * sin(\u03b8/2) = [ cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] * sin(\u03b8/2) ) = cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSecond component: sin(\u03b8/2 )\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(\u03b8/2 ), sin(\u03b8/2 ) )\n\nWait, but wait a second. The operator P is in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. So in the eigenstate, the spin is up along direction n.\n\nBut let me double-check the direction. Let's think about when \u03b8 is 0, which is along the z-axis. Then the eigenvector should be (0,1), since P_z has eigenvalue +\u0127/2 when the state is |\u2191z\u27e9.\n\nWait, let me compute for \u03b8=0. Then the eigenvector would be (cos(0/2), sin(0/2)) ) = (cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0). But that's (1,0), which is the eigenstate for P_z with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Wait, no, because for P_z, the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2 for (1,0) and -\u0127/2 for (0,1). Oh wait, wait! Wait a minute, perhaps I got the eigenvalue wrong.\n\nWait, in our case, the operator P is in the x-z direction, and the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. So when \u03b8=0, n is along z, so P=P_z. The eigenstate for +\u0127/2 is (1,0), which would correspond to our solution when \u03b8=0: cos(0/2) =1, sin(0/2)=0. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but when \u03b8=90 degrees (\u03c0/2 radians), the direction is along x. So the eigenvector should be (1,1)/sqrt(2), because P_x eigenstates are (1,0) and (0,1), but scaled by 1/sqrt(2), perhaps. Wait, no, let's see. For P_x, the eigenstates are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2.\n\nSo for \u03b8=90 degrees, cos(\u03b8/2)= cos(45)= sqrt(2)/2, sin(theta/2)= sqrt(2)/2. So the eigenvector would be (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2) ), which is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is correct. So that's correct.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C says ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ), which seems more general but perhaps for a different scenario, like spherical coordinates in 3D.\n\nOption D is a combination involving sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which I don't think is correct unless the direction has specific angles.\n\nWait, but the problem says the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero, so perhaps the answer is in terms of theta only, which would match option C.\n\nWait, but wait. The given options have the elements with hbar in them, like option A has sqrt(2/3) hbar. But our solution doesn't have hbar because it's a normalized vector. Because eigenvectors are normalized, their elements don't have hbar unless the question is scaled in some way. Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nThe question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the elements should be dimensionless, because they're components of a vector in a 2D Hilbert space. So options A and D have hbar in them, which doesn't make sense. So those can be eliminated.\n\nThat leaves options B, C, and perhaps others. So looking at option C: ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )\n\nWait, but the problem is about a muon, but I don't think that affects the spin calculation because muons have spin-1/2, same as electrons.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C. Let me look again at the options.\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )\n\nYes, that matches what I derived.\n",

Alternatively, since the operator is along n, the operator is P = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z), since n is in x-z plane and n_y=0.\n\nWait, but the direction n is arbitrary in x-z plane, so n is (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, 0, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6) or something like that. Wait, no, wait. The standard spherical coordinates have \u03b8 from the z-axis. So any direction in x-z plane would have \u03c6=0 or \u03c0, because the y-component is zero. Or maybe not, perhaps \u03c6 is 0 for x direction, 90 for z, but no, wait, in standard spherical coordinates, \u03c6 is the angle in the xy-plane. So if direction is in x-z plane, perhaps \u03c6 is 0, meaning along x, or 90, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of \u03b8 being the angle from the z-axis. So if n is in the x-z plane, the direction can be represented with \u03b8 as the polar angle, and \u03c6=0. So n_x = sin\u03b8 * cos\u03c6, but since \u03c6=0, n_x = sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to think of n as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), because when \u03b8 is 0, it's along z, and \u03b8=90 is along x. So for a general direction in x-z plane, n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Because the unit vector would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. So substituting, P = sin\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Let me compute that matrix.\n\nCompute each component:\n\nFirst, for P_x: (\u0127/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]\nP_z: (\u0127/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]\nSo P = sin\u03b8 * P_x + cos\u03b8 * P_z.\n\nSo combining the two, the matrix becomes:\n\n[ [ (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8, (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ],\n  [ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ] ]\n\nWait, let me compute each element:\n\nTop-left element: (\u0127/2) * (0 * sin\u03b8 + 1 * cos\u03b8) )? No, no. Wait, when you add the matrices, each element is added.\n\nWait, P_x matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]] multiplied by \u0127/2, so each element is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix elements.\n\nSimilarly for P_z: [[1,0],[0,-1]] times \u0127/2.\n\nSo when you add sin\u03b8*P_x + cos\u03b8*P_z, you get:\n\nEach element:\n\nTop-left: sin\u03b8 * (0)*(\u0127/2) + cos\u03b8 * (1)*(\u0127/2) \u2192 (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8\nTop-right: sin\u03b8 * (1)*(\u0127/2) + cos\u03b8 * (0)*(\u0127/2) \u2192 (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8\nBottom-left: same as top-right, because the P_x is symmetric \u2192 (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8\nBottom-right: sin\u03b8 * (0) + cos\u03b8 * (-1)*(\u0127/2) \u2192 -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\n[ [ (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8, (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ],\n  [ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ] ]\n\nNow, the eigenvalue equation is P |\u03c8> = \u03bb |\u03c8>, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue. We're given \u03bb = +\u0127/2.\n\nSo substituting, the equation is:\n\n[ [ (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8, (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ],\n  [ (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8, -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ] ]\n *\n [ a ]\n [ b ]\n=\n (\u0127/2) [ a ]\n        [ b ]\n\nSo the matrix equation is:\n\n( (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ) a + ( (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ) b = (\u0127/2) a \u2192 equation (1)\n( (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 ) a + ( -(\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 ) b = (\u0127/2) b \u2192 equation (2)\n\nWe can divide both sides by \u0127/2 to simplify:\n\nEquation (1): cos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b = a\nEquation (2): sin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b = b\n\nLet me rearrange equation (1):\n\ncos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b = a \u2192 cos\u03b8 a - a + sin\u03b8 b = 0 \u2192 a (cos\u03b8 - 1) + b sin\u03b8 = 0 \u2192 equation (1a)\n\nEquation (2): sin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b = b \u2192 sin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b - b = 0 \u2192 sin\u03b8 a - b (cos\u03b8 + 1) = 0 \u2192 equation (2a)\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1) a (cos\u03b8 - 1) + b sin\u03b8 = 0\n2) a sin\u03b8 - b (cos\u03b8 +1 ) = 0\n\nWe can write this as a system:\n\nEquation (1a): (cos\u03b8 -1) a + (sin\u03b8) b = 0\nEquation (2a): (sin\u03b8) a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b = 0\n\nTo solve this system, we can write it in matrix form and find non-trivial solutions (since eigenvectors can't be zero vectors). So the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n| (cos\u03b8 -1)   sin\u03b8        |\n| sin\u03b8        -(cos\u03b8 +1) |\n\nSo determinant D = (cos\u03b8 -1)(-cos\u03b8 -1) - (sin\u03b8)(sin\u03b8)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1)(-cos\u03b8 -1) = -(cos\u03b8 -1)(cos\u03b8 +1) = -(cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 1) = - ( - sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nAnd (sin\u03b8)(sin\u03b8) = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo D = sin\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 0. Which makes sense because the two equations are dependent; the system is consistent.\n\nSo to find the eigenvectors, we can take one equation and express a in terms of b or vice versa.\n\nLet me take equation (1a):\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) a + sin\u03b8 b = 0 \u2192 a = [ - sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 -1) ] b\n\nWait, but cos\u03b8 -1 is negative of (1 - cos\u03b8), which is 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2). Hmm, perhaps we can simplify this expression.\n\nWait, let me note that cos\u03b8 -1 = - 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo substituting:\n\na = [ - (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) / ( -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) ] b\n\nThe negatives cancel, and 2 cancels. So:\n\na = [ (sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) / ( sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) ] b = [ cos(\u03b8/2) / sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] b = cot(\u03b8/2) b\n\nSo a = cot(\u03b8/2) b.\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as a = [cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2)] b.\n\nSo, the eigenvector can be written as (a, b) = ( cot(\u03b8/2) b, b )\n\nBut for simplicity, let's set b = 1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar). Then a = cot(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ cot(\u03b8/2), 1 ].\n\nBut wait, we need to normalize it. The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.\n\nSo let's compute:\n\n|a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(\u03b8/2)|^2 + 1 = [ (cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) / ( sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) ] + 1 = [ cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ] / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) = 1 / sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2 )\n\nSo the normalization factor is sqrt( sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) ) = |sin(\u03b8/2)|. Since \u03b8 is an angle in quantum mechanics, I think it's between 0 and \u03c0, so sin(\u03b8/2) is non-negative. So normalization factor is sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(\u03b8/2) * sin(\u03b8/2), 1 * sin(\u03b8/2) ]\n\nSimplify each component:\n\nFirst component: cot(\u03b8/2) * sin(\u03b8/2) = [ cos(\u03b8/2)/sin(\u03b8/2) ) ] * sin(\u03b8/2) ) = cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSecond component: sin(\u03b8/2 )\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(\u03b8/2 ), sin(\u03b8/2 ) )\n\nWait, but wait a second. The operator P is in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. So in the eigenstate, the spin is up along direction n.\n\nBut let me double-check the direction. Let's think about when \u03b8 is 0, which is along the z-axis. Then the eigenvector should be (0,1), since P_z has eigenvalue +\u0127/2 when the state is |\u2191z\u27e9.\n\nWait, let me compute for \u03b8=0. Then the eigenvector would be (cos(0/2), sin(0/2)) ) = (cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0). But that's (1,0), which is the eigenstate for P_z with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Wait, no, because for P_z, the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2 for (1,0) and -\u0127/2 for (0,1). Oh wait, wait! Wait a minute, perhaps I got the eigenvalue wrong.\n\nWait, in our case, the operator P is in the x-z direction, and the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. So when \u03b8=0, n is along z, so P=P_z. The eigenstate for +\u0127/2 is (1,0), which would correspond to our solution when \u03b8=0: cos(0/2) =1, sin(0/2)=0. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but when \u03b8=90 degrees (\u03c0/2 radians), the direction is along x. So the eigenvector should be (1,1)/sqrt(2), because P_x eigenstates are (1,0) and (0,1), but scaled by 1/sqrt(2), perhaps. Wait, no, let's see. For P_x, the eigenstates are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2.\n\nSo for \u03b8=90 degrees, cos(\u03b8/2)= cos(45)= sqrt(2)/2, sin(theta/2)= sqrt(2)/2. So the eigenvector would be (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2) ), which is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is correct. So that's correct.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C says ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )\n\nOption B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ), which seems more general but perhaps for a different scenario, like spherical coordinates in 3D.\n\nOption D is a combination involving sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which I don't think is correct unless the direction has specific angles.\n\nWait, but the problem says the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero, so perhaps the answer is in terms of theta only, which would match option C.\n\nWait, but wait. The given options have the elements with hbar in them, like option A has sqrt(2/3) hbar. But our solution doesn't have hbar because it's a normalized vector. Because eigenvectors are normalized, their elements don't have hbar unless the question is scaled in some way. Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nThe question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the elements should be dimensionless, because they're components of a vector in a 2D Hilbert space. So options A and D have hbar in them, which doesn't make sense. So those can be eliminated.\n\nThat leaves options B, C, and perhaps others. So looking at option C: ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )\n\nWait, but the problem is about a muon, but I don't think that affects the spin calculation because muons have spin-1/2, same as electrons.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C. Let me look again at the options.\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )\n\nYes, that matches what I derived.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is expressed as $\\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are given as $2 \\times 2$ matrices scaled by $\\hbar/2$. Since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $n_y = 0$, and the direction can be parameterized as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.\n\nThe matrix representation of $\\vec{P}$ along $\\vec{n}$ is derived as:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\\n\\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is $P | \\psi \\rangle = \\lambda | \\psi \\rangle$, where $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. Substituting $\\lambda$ into the eigenvalue equation and solving the resulting system of equations yields the eigenvector components. After normalization, the eigenvector is found to be:\n\n\\[\n| \\psi \\rangle = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\\n\\sin(\\theta/2)\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThis result is consistent with the eigenstates of spin-1/2 systems along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. The eigenvector components are dimensionless, as required for normalized quantum states.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **Option A**: Includes $\\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are normalized and dimensionless.\n- **Option B**: Represents a general spherical coordinate system but includes $\\phi$, which is irrelevant since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane (i.e., $\\phi = 0$).\n- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector components $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ and is consistent with the problem setup.\n- **Option D**: Includes additional scaling factors like $\\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not supported by the derivation.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **Option C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. \n\nHmm, let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details. The operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. \n\nSo, P_x is (\u0127/2) times a matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). That's the Pauli X matrix, right? Similarly, P_y is (\u0127/2) times a matrix with first row (0,-i) and second row (i,0), which is the Pauli Y matrix. And P_z is (\u0127/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix.\n\nThe operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, that means the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), because it's in the x-z plane. So, the operator we're looking at is P = nx P_x + nz P_z, since the y-component is zero. Oh wait, but wait\u2014no, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the operator would be proportional to nx P_x + nz P_z. But since n is a unit vector, nx^2 + nz^2 =1.\n\nBut the problem is to find the eigenvector of the operator P corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2. So, the eigenvector equation is P|v> = (\u0127/2)|v>. \n\nWait, but P is nx P_x + nz P_z. So, let me write that down. P = nx P_x + nz P_z. \n\nEach of these P_x, P_y, P_z are (\u0127/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So, substituting, P becomes (nx (\u0127/2) \u03c3_x) + (nz (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z). So, P = (\u0127/2)( nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z ).\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>. Because the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2.\n\nSo, substituting P, we have (\u0127/2)( nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z ) |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>. We can divide both sides by (\u0127/2), so (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z ) |v> = |v>. \n\nSo, the matrix (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z) has to have |v> as an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. \n\nWait, but the Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_z, etc. So, let's compute that matrix. \n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, the matrix nx \u03c3_x is [[0, nx],[nx, 0]], and nz \u03c3_z is [[nz, 0],[0, -nz]]. Adding them together: [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].\n\nSo, the matrix M = [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]. The equation is M |v> = |v>.\n\nSo, let's write the eigenvalue equation. Let |v> be a column vector [a; b], where a and b are the components. \n\nSo, M |v> = [nz a + nx b, nx a - nz b]^T. And this equals |v> = [a; b].\n\nSo, the equations are:\n1. nz a + nx b = a\n2. nx a - nz b = b\n\nLet me rearrange these equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: (nz -1) a + nx b = 0\nFrom equation 2: nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0\n\nSo, we have a system:\n\n(nz - 1) a + nx b = 0\nnx a + (-nz -1) b = 0\n\nThis is a homogeneous system. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.\n\nThe determinant D is (nz -1)(-nz -1) - (nx^2) = [ (nz^2 -1) ) ] - nx^2.\n\nWait, (nz -1)(-nz -1) = -(nz-1)(nz+1) ) = -(nz^2 -1) = -nz^2 +1. Then subtract nx^2: D = (-nz^2 +1) - nx^2.\n\nBut since n is a unit vector, nx^2 + nz^2 =1. So, substituting, D = (-nz^2 +1) - (1 - nz^2) ) = (-nz^2 +1) -1 + nz^2 = 0.\n\nSo, determinant is zero, which is consistent because we're looking for eigenvectors, so the system has non-trivial solutions.\n\nBut to find the eigenvector, we can solve the equations.\n\nLet's take equation 1: (nz -1) a + nx b = 0.\n\nSo, (nz -1) a = -nx b \u2192 a = [ (-nx) / (nz -1) ] b.\n\nHmm, but let me think about the eigenvector components. Let me express a in terms of b.\n\nLet me denote b = 1 for simplicity, then a = [ (-nx) / (nz -1) ].\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to find a ratio between a and b. Let me write a = k b, where k is a constant.\n\nSo, substituting a = k b into equation 1:\n\n(nz -1) k b + nx b = 0 \u2192 [ (nz-1) k + nx ] b = 0.\n\nSince b isn't zero (otherwise trivial solution), we have (nz-1)k + nx =0 \u2192 k = -nx/(nz -1).\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: nx a + (-nz -1) b =0 \u2192 nx k b + (-nz -1) b =0 \u2192 [nx k - (nz +1) ] b =0.\n\nSo, nx k - (nz +1) =0 \u2192 k = (nz +1)/nx.\n\nWait, but from equation 1, k is -nx/(nz -1), and from equation 2, k is (nz +1)/nx.\n\nSo, setting them equal: -nx/(nz -1) = (nz +1)/nx.\n\nMultiply both sides by (nz -1) * nx:\n\n-nx^2 = (nz +1)(nz -1).\n\nWhich is -nx^2 = nz^2 -1.\n\nBut we know that nx^2 + nz^2 =1. So, substituting, nx^2 = 1 - nz^2.\n\nSo, left side: -(1 - nz^2) = -1 + nz^2.\n\nRight side: nz^2 -1.\n\nSo, -1 + nz^2 = nz^2 -1. Which is the same on both sides. So, the two expressions for k are consistent.\n\nSo, we can pick either expression for k.\n\nLet me take equation 1: k = -nx/(nz -1).\n\nSo, a = [ -nx/(nz -1) ] b.\n\nWe can write the eigenvector as [a, b] = [ (-nx/(nz -1) ) b, b ].\n\nWe can factor out b: b [ -nx/(nz -1), 1 ].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to parametrize in terms of an angle since the direction is in the x-z plane. Let me think.\n\nSince the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, let me define the angle \u03b8 such that nx = cos\u03b8 and nz = sin\u03b8. Because for a unit vector, n^2x + n^2z =1, so \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis to the x direction. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, if I imagine the x-z plane, then \u03b8 could be the angle from the z-axis towards the x-axis. So, nx = cos\u03b8, nz = sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, wait, let me get that right. In spherical coordinates, for a point on the unit sphere, \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle. So, the components would be (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so \u03c6 is zero. So, the components are (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Wait, no, that's for the position vector. Wait, wait, no, the direction vector in the x-z plane would be (nx, 0, nz), with nx^2 + nz^2 =1. So, I can set nx = cos\u03b8, nz = sin\u03b8, with \u03b8 being the angle from the z-axis to the x direction. So, \u03b8 would be 0 when the direction is along +z, and \u03b8=90 degrees when along +x.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes it's the other way around, with \u03b8 being the angle from the x-axis. But regardless, perhaps I can express the eigenvector in terms of \u03b8.\n\nSo, nx = cos\u03b8, nz = sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to parameterize the direction vector. So, let's say the direction is (nx, 0, nz), with nx = cos\u03b8, nz = sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, substituting into the expression for k.\n\nk = -nx/(nz -1) = -cos\u03b8/(sin\u03b8 -1).\n\nHmm, but that might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvector in terms of \u03b8.\n\nLet me think about the general case. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices along an arbitrary direction are the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction. The eigenvectors are usually written in terms of spherical harmonics or using angles.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find the eigenvector without getting into too much trigonometry.\n\nWait, another approach: The eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 of the matrix M is the spin-up state along direction n. Because M is (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z), and the eigenvalues are \u00b11.\n\nWait, no, because the matrix M is (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z), and when you have \u03c3 \u00b7 n, the eigenvalues are \u00b11. So, the eigenvalue equation for M is (\u03c3 \u00b7 n) |v> = \u03bb |v>, with \u03bb=\u00b11.\n\nSo, in our case, M is (\u03c3 \u00b7 n), so the eigenvalues are \u00b11, and the corresponding eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along n.\n\nSo, the eigenvector |v> for \u03bb=1 is the state with spin up along n.\n\nThe general form for the spin-up state along a direction (nx, 0, nz) can be written as:\n\n|v> = [ e^{-i \u03c6/2} cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6/2} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nBut in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so \u03c6=0. So, the state simplifies.\n\nWait, no, wait. The spin-up state along direction (nx, 0, nz) can be expressed using the angles \u03b8 and \u03c6, where \u03b8 is the polar angle (angle from z-axis) and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle (around z-axis). But since our direction is in the x-z plane, \u03c6=0.\n\nWait, wait, the direction vector is (nx, 0, nz). So, in spherical coordinates, \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis, so \u03b8 is such that nx = sin\u03b8 * cos\u03c6, and nz = cos\u03b8. But since \u03c6=0 (because the direction is in the x-z plane), so nx = sin\u03b8 * 1 = sin\u03b8, and nz = cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, so for our case, the direction vector is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), but wait, wait, that can't be right because the components would be (nx, 0, nz) = (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), but the sum of squares is sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1, which is correct.\n\nSo, the spin-up state is:\n\n|v> = [ e^{-i \u03c6/2} cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6/2} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nBut since \u03c6=0, this becomes:\n\n[ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nWait, but wait a second. I thought the spin-up state along direction (nx, 0, nz) (with \u03c6=0) is [ cos\u03b8', sin\u03b8' e^{i 0} ]^T, but perhaps I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spin-up state is given by:\n\n[ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nBut since \u03c6=0, it's [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but wait, that doesn't seem right because the eigenvector depends on the direction. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: the eigenstates of S\u00b7n are |+> and |->, where |+> is the spin-up along n.\n\nThe general form of the spin-up state can be written as:\n\n|+> = [ e^{-i \u03c6/2} cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6/2} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nSince our direction is in the x-z plane, \u03c6=0, so this simplifies to:\n\n|+> = [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nWait, but wait, let's think about \u03b8. In the standard convention, \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. So, the direction vector (nx, 0, nz) would have nx = sin\u03b8, nz = cos\u03b8. Because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, but \u03c6=0, so x = sin\u03b8, z=cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, substituting into the spin-up state:\n\n|+> = [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nBut wait, that seems too simple. Let me check with specific cases.\n\nCase 1: n is along z-axis (\u03b8=0, so nz=1, nx=0).\n\nThen, the spin-up state should be [1, 0]^T, which matches, because cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0.\n\nCase 2: n is along x-axis (\u03b8=90 degrees, so \u03b8=\u03c0/2 radians. Then, nx=1, nz=0.\n\nThen, the spin-up state is [ cos(\u03c0/4), sin(\u03c0/4) ]^T = [\u221a2/2, \u221a2/2]^T, which is correct for the spin-up along x.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in general, the spin-up state is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T, where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the eigenvector should be normalized. The given options have expressions like sqrt(2/3) hbar, etc. Wait, but our current state is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].\n\nWait, but let me think about the options. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but without any factors. Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), etc. Hmm, but wait, the eigenvector elements are just the components, so perhaps the question is asking for the normalized eigenvector. So, the state I'm thinking of is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, which is already normalized because cos^2 + sin^2 =1.\n\nSo, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but option D has those terms multiplied by sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar. Hmm, but I'm not sure where the hbar comes in here because the eigenvectors are dimensionless (they are vectors in Hilbert space, not physical quantities with units). So, the presence of hbar in the options is confusing. Wait, but the problem statement says the eigenvector is of the operator P, which has components scaled by \u0127/2, but the eigenvector itself is a vector in the Hilbert space and should be dimensionless. So, perhaps the options have some scaling factors that don't belong. Alternatively, perhaps the options are not normalized correctly.\n\nWait, looking back, the eigenvector equation is (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z) |v> = |v>, and the eigenvector |v> is [a, b]^T. So, the solution we found is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is normalized.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. But wait, the problem is about a muon, but muons have spin-1/2 just like electrons, so that shouldn't affect the calculation.\n\nWait, but wait the problem statement says the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. Oh, wait a minute. Because the operator P is (\u0127/2)(nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z ), so when I set up the eigenvalue equation, I have P |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>, which is why the matrix M is (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z ), which then has eigenvalues \u00b11, leading to |v> having eigenvalue +1 for M.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the operator P is given as a vector operator, and the question is to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>.\n\nSo, perhaps the matrix M is (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z ), and when multiplied by \u0127/2, the eigenvalue is (\u0127/2) * 1 = \u0127/2.\n\nSo, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is option C.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our conclusion. \n\nBut wait, the other options: option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like the spherical harmonics for l=1, but perhaps not the correct form for the spin state. Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), etc., which I'm not sure about.\n\nWait, but I'm confident that the correct normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. So, the correct option would be option C.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Another way to find the eigenvector is to write out the matrix and find its eigenvectors.\n\nLet me re-express the matrix M = nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z. Substituting nx= cos\u03b8, nz= sin\u03b8, as earlier.\n\nSo, M = cos\u03b8 \u03c3_x + sin\u03b8 \u03c3_z.\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nSo, M = [[sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8], [cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8]].\n\nThe eigenvalues are the solutions to det(M - \u03bb I ) = 0.\n\ndet( [[sin\u03b8 - \u03bb, cos\u03b8], [cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 - \u03bb] ]) = 0.\n\nSo, (sin\u03b8 - \u03bb)(-sin\u03b8 - \u03bb) - cos^2\u03b8 = 0.\n\nExpanding: (-sin\u03b8 sin\u03b8 - \u03bb sin\u03b8 + \u03bb sin\u03b8 + \u03bb^2) - cos^2\u03b8 =0.\n\nWait, no: (sin\u03b8 - \u03bb)(-sin\u03b8 -\u03bb) = -(sin\u03b8)(sin\u03b8) - sin\u03b8 \u03bb + \u03bb sin\u03b8 + \u03bb^2 = -sin\u00b2\u03b8 + \u03bb^2.\n\nSo, the determinant equation is (-sin\u00b2\u03b8 + \u03bb\u00b2) - cos\u00b2\u03b8 =0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1 \u2192 \u03bb= \u00b11.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1, as expected.\n\nFor \u03bb=1, the eigenvector equation is (M - I)|v> =0.\n\nM -I = [[sin\u03b8 -1, cos\u03b8], [cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 -1]]\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n(sin\u03b8 -1) a + cos\u03b8 b =0\n\ncos\u03b8 a + (-sin\u03b8 -1) b =0\n\nLet me take the first equation:\n\n(sin\u03b8 -1) a + cos\u03b8 b =0 \u2192 (1 - sin\u03b8) a = cos\u03b8 b \u2192 a = [ cos\u03b8 / (1 - sin\u03b8) ] b.\n\nWe can write a as [ cos\u03b8/(1 - sin\u03b8) ] b.\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sin\u03b8):\n\na = [ cos\u03b8 (1 + sin\u03b8) ] / [ (1 - sin\u03b8)(1 + sin\u03b8) ) ] * b.\n\nDenominator is 1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, a = [ cos\u03b8 (1 + sin\u03b8) ] / cos\u00b2\u03b8 * b \u2192 a = [ (1 + sin\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 ] b.\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + sin\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 ] b.\n\nBut 1 + sin\u03b8 over cos\u03b8 is equal to [ (1 + sin\u03b8) ] / cos\u03b8 = [ 1/cos\u03b8 + tan\u03b8 ].\n\nAlternatively, this can be written as tan(\u03b8/2 + \u03c0/4 ), but perhaps it's better to express in terms of half-angles.\n\nWait, using the identity:\n\n(1 + sin\u03b8) = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, 1 + sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4 )^2? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps I can proceed differently.\n\nExpress a in terms of b:\n\na = [ (1 + sin\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 ] b.\n\nWe can factor out cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2):\n\nLet me write 1 + sin\u03b8 as 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4 )^2, but perhaps a better approach is to use the identity:\n\n1 + sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4 )^2. Hmm, perhaps not the easiest way.\n\nAlternatively, let me express 1 + sin\u03b8 as 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4 )^2. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write in terms of tan(theta/2).\n\nUsing the identity:\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 tan(theta/2) / (1 + tan\u00b2(theta/2)).\n\nBut perhaps that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, let me write 1 + sin\u03b8 as [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]\u00b2.\n\nWait, [sin(a) + cos(a)]\u00b2 = sin\u00b2a + 2 sin a cos a + cos\u00b2a = 1 + sin(2a). Hmm, not exactly matching 1 + sin\u03b8, but perhaps if a = theta/2, then 2a = theta. So, [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]\u00b2 = 1 + sin(theta). Oh, right! Because 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) = sin(theta).\n\nSo, [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]^2 = sin\u00b2(theta/2) + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + cos\u00b2(theta/2) = 1 + sin(theta).\n\nSo, 1 + sin(theta) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2.\n\nSimilarly, cos(theta) = cos\u00b2(theta/2) - sin\u00b2(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)] [cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)].\n\nSo, [ cos(theta) ] = [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ]\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + sin\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 ] b = [ ( [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2 ) / ( [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ][ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] ) ) ] b.\n\nThe denominator is [cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)][cos(theta/2)+sin(theta/2)] = cos\u00b2(theta/2) - sin\u00b2(theta/2) = cos(theta).\n\nSo, substituting back, a = [ [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2 / [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ][ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] ] * b.\n\nWhich simplifies to [ [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2 ] / [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2))(cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ) ] * b.\n\nBut the denominator is cos(theta), as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor out [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] from numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, numerator is [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ]^2, denominator has [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo, a = [ (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ] / [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ) ] * b.\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + tan(theta/2)) ] / [ (1 - tan(theta/2)) ] * b.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as [ (1 + tan(theta/2)) / (1 - tan(theta/2)) ] * b.\n\nWhich is the same as [ (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) / (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ) ] * b.\n\nWe can write this as [ (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ] / [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ] = [1 + tan(theta/2)] / [1 - tan(theta/2)].\n\nWait, but maybe a better approach is to factor out cos(theta/2) from numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + tan(theta/2)) / (1 - tan(theta/2)) ] * b.\n\nLet me set t = tan(theta/2).\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + t) / (1 - t) ] b.\n\nNow, to find a in terms of b, perhaps I can express this as a ratio.\n\nLet me write a = [ (1 + t) / (1 - t) ] b.\n\nBut perhaps this isn't leading me anywhere. Let's think differently.\n\nLet me assume that b=1 (for simplicity), then a = [ (1 + sin\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 ].\n\nBut wait, from earlier, [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ]^2 =1 + sin\u03b8, and [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] = cos(theta).\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + sin\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 ] * b = [ ( [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ]^2 ) / ( [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ][ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] ) ) ] * b = [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ) / ( cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ) ] * b.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as [ (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) / (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ) ] * b.\n\nLet me factor out cos(theta/2) from numerator and denominator:\n\n[ cos(theta/2) (1 + tan(theta/2)) ) / ( cos(theta/2) (1 - tan(theta/2)) ) ) ] = [ (1 + tan(theta/2)) / (1 - tan(theta/2)) ) ].\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + tan(theta/2)) / (1 - tan(theta/2)) ) ] * b.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps I can express this as e^{i phi} times some trigonometric function.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write a = e^{i phi} [ cos(theta/2) ], and b = e^{i phi} [ sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBecause when I did that earlier, it worked for the specific cases. So, perhaps the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is option C.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nYes, that matches. So, the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again:\n\nOption C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what I have.\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. So, option C is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. \n\nHmm, let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details. The operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. \n\nSo, P_x is (\u0127/2) times a matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). That's the Pauli X matrix, right? Similarly, P_y is (\u0127/2) times a matrix with first row (0,-i) and second row (i,0), which is the Pauli Y matrix. And P_z is (\u0127/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix.\n\nThe operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, that means the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), because it's in the x-z plane. So, the operator we're looking at is P = nx P_x + nz P_z, since the y-component is zero. Oh wait, but wait\u2014no, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the operator would be proportional to nx P_x + nz P_z. But since n is a unit vector, nx^2 + nz^2 =1.\n\nBut the problem is to find the eigenvector of the operator P corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2. So, the eigenvector equation is P|v> = (\u0127/2)|v>. \n\nWait, but P is nx P_x + nz P_z. So, let me write that down. P = nx P_x + nz P_z. \n\nEach of these P_x, P_y, P_z are (\u0127/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So, substituting, P becomes (nx (\u0127/2) \u03c3_x) + (nz (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z). So, P = (\u0127/2)( nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z ).\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>. Because the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2.\n\nSo, substituting P, we have (\u0127/2)( nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z ) |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>. We can divide both sides by (\u0127/2), so (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z ) |v> = |v>. \n\nSo, the matrix (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z) has to have |v> as an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. \n\nWait, but the Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_z, etc. So, let's compute that matrix. \n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, the matrix nx \u03c3_x is [[0, nx],[nx, 0]], and nz \u03c3_z is [[nz, 0],[0, -nz]]. Adding them together: [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].\n\nSo, the matrix M = [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]. The equation is M |v> = |v>.\n\nSo, let's write the eigenvalue equation. Let |v> be a column vector [a; b], where a and b are the components. \n\nSo, M |v> = [nz a + nx b, nx a - nz b]^T. And this equals |v> = [a; b].\n\nSo, the equations are:\n1. nz a + nx b = a\n2. nx a - nz b = b\n\nLet me rearrange these equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: (nz -1) a + nx b = 0\nFrom equation 2: nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0\n\nSo, we have a system:\n\n(nz - 1) a + nx b = 0\nnx a + (-nz -1) b = 0\n\nThis is a homogeneous system. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.\n\nThe determinant D is (nz -1)(-nz -1) - (nx^2) = [ (nz^2 -1) ) ] - nx^2.\n\nWait, (nz -1)(-nz -1) = -(nz-1)(nz+1) ) = -(nz^2 -1) = -nz^2 +1. Then subtract nx^2: D = (-nz^2 +1) - nx^2.\n\nBut since n is a unit vector, nx^2 + nz^2 =1. So, substituting, D = (-nz^2 +1) - (1 - nz^2) ) = (-nz^2 +1) -1 + nz^2 = 0.\n\nSo, determinant is zero, which is consistent because we're looking for eigenvectors, so the system has non-trivial solutions.\n\nBut to find the eigenvector, we can solve the equations.\n\nLet's take equation 1: (nz -1) a + nx b = 0.\n\nSo, (nz -1) a = -nx b \u2192 a = [ (-nx) / (nz -1) ] b.\n\nHmm, but let me think about the eigenvector components. Let me express a in terms of b.\n\nLet me denote b = 1 for simplicity, then a = [ (-nx) / (nz -1) ].\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to find a ratio between a and b. Let me write a = k b, where k is a constant.\n\nSo, substituting a = k b into equation 1:\n\n(nz -1) k b + nx b = 0 \u2192 [ (nz-1) k + nx ] b = 0.\n\nSince b isn't zero (otherwise trivial solution), we have (nz-1)k + nx =0 \u2192 k = -nx/(nz -1).\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: nx a + (-nz -1) b =0 \u2192 nx k b + (-nz -1) b =0 \u2192 [nx k - (nz +1) ] b =0.\n\nSo, nx k - (nz +1) =0 \u2192 k = (nz +1)/nx.\n\nWait, but from equation 1, k is -nx/(nz -1), and from equation 2, k is (nz +1)/nx.\n\nSo, setting them equal: -nx/(nz -1) = (nz +1)/nx.\n\nMultiply both sides by (nz -1) * nx:\n\n-nx^2 = (nz +1)(nz -1).\n\nWhich is -nx^2 = nz^2 -1.\n\nBut we know that nx^2 + nz^2 =1. So, substituting, nx^2 = 1 - nz^2.\n\nSo, left side: -(1 - nz^2) = -1 + nz^2.\n\nRight side: nz^2 -1.\n\nSo, -1 + nz^2 = nz^2 -1. Which is the same on both sides. So, the two expressions for k are consistent.\n\nSo, we can pick either expression for k.\n\nLet me take equation 1: k = -nx/(nz -1).\n\nSo, a = [ -nx/(nz -1) ] b.\n\nWe can write the eigenvector as [a, b] = [ (-nx/(nz -1) ) b, b ].\n\nWe can factor out b: b [ -nx/(nz -1), 1 ].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to parametrize in terms of an angle since the direction is in the x-z plane. Let me think.\n\nSince the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, let me define the angle \u03b8 such that nx = cos\u03b8 and nz = sin\u03b8. Because for a unit vector, n^2x + n^2z =1, so \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis to the x direction. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, if I imagine the x-z plane, then \u03b8 could be the angle from the z-axis towards the x-axis. So, nx = cos\u03b8, nz = sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, wait, let me get that right. In spherical coordinates, for a point on the unit sphere, \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle. So, the components would be (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so \u03c6 is zero. So, the components are (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Wait, no, that's for the position vector. Wait, wait, no, the direction vector in the x-z plane would be (nx, 0, nz), with nx^2 + nz^2 =1. So, I can set nx = cos\u03b8, nz = sin\u03b8, with \u03b8 being the angle from the z-axis to the x direction. So, \u03b8 would be 0 when the direction is along +z, and \u03b8=90 degrees when along +x.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes it's the other way around, with \u03b8 being the angle from the x-axis. But regardless, perhaps I can express the eigenvector in terms of \u03b8.\n\nSo, nx = cos\u03b8, nz = sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to parameterize the direction vector. So, let's say the direction is (nx, 0, nz), with nx = cos\u03b8, nz = sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, substituting into the expression for k.\n\nk = -nx/(nz -1) = -cos\u03b8/(sin\u03b8 -1).\n\nHmm, but that might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvector in terms of \u03b8.\n\nLet me think about the general case. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices along an arbitrary direction are the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction. The eigenvectors are usually written in terms of spherical harmonics or using angles.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find the eigenvector without getting into too much trigonometry.\n\nWait, another approach: The eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 of the matrix M is the spin-up state along direction n. Because M is (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z), and the eigenvalues are \u00b11.\n\nWait, no, because the matrix M is (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z), and when you have \u03c3 \u00b7 n, the eigenvalues are \u00b11. So, the eigenvalue equation for M is (\u03c3 \u00b7 n) |v> = \u03bb |v>, with \u03bb=\u00b11.\n\nSo, in our case, M is (\u03c3 \u00b7 n), so the eigenvalues are \u00b11, and the corresponding eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along n.\n\nSo, the eigenvector |v> for \u03bb=1 is the state with spin up along n.\n\nThe general form for the spin-up state along a direction (nx, 0, nz) can be written as:\n\n|v> = [ e^{-i \u03c6/2} cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6/2} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nBut in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so \u03c6=0. So, the state simplifies.\n\nWait, no, wait. The spin-up state along direction (nx, 0, nz) can be expressed using the angles \u03b8 and \u03c6, where \u03b8 is the polar angle (angle from z-axis) and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle (around z-axis). But since our direction is in the x-z plane, \u03c6=0.\n\nWait, wait, the direction vector is (nx, 0, nz). So, in spherical coordinates, \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis, so \u03b8 is such that nx = sin\u03b8 * cos\u03c6, and nz = cos\u03b8. But since \u03c6=0 (because the direction is in the x-z plane), so nx = sin\u03b8 * 1 = sin\u03b8, and nz = cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, so for our case, the direction vector is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), but wait, wait, that can't be right because the components would be (nx, 0, nz) = (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), but the sum of squares is sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1, which is correct.\n\nSo, the spin-up state is:\n\n|v> = [ e^{-i \u03c6/2} cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6/2} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nBut since \u03c6=0, this becomes:\n\n[ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nWait, but wait a second. I thought the spin-up state along direction (nx, 0, nz) (with \u03c6=0) is [ cos\u03b8', sin\u03b8' e^{i 0} ]^T, but perhaps I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spin-up state is given by:\n\n[ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nBut since \u03c6=0, it's [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T.\n\nWait, but wait, that doesn't seem right because the eigenvector depends on the direction. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: the eigenstates of S\u00b7n are |+> and |->, where |+> is the spin-up along n.\n\nThe general form of the spin-up state can be written as:\n\n|+> = [ e^{-i \u03c6/2} cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i \u03c6/2} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nSince our direction is in the x-z plane, \u03c6=0, so this simplifies to:\n\n|+> = [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nWait, but wait, let's think about \u03b8. In the standard convention, \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. So, the direction vector (nx, 0, nz) would have nx = sin\u03b8, nz = cos\u03b8. Because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, but \u03c6=0, so x = sin\u03b8, z=cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, substituting into the spin-up state:\n\n|+> = [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T\n\nBut wait, that seems too simple. Let me check with specific cases.\n\nCase 1: n is along z-axis (\u03b8=0, so nz=1, nx=0).\n\nThen, the spin-up state should be [1, 0]^T, which matches, because cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0.\n\nCase 2: n is along x-axis (\u03b8=90 degrees, so \u03b8=\u03c0/2 radians. Then, nx=1, nz=0.\n\nThen, the spin-up state is [ cos(\u03c0/4), sin(\u03c0/4) ]^T = [\u221a2/2, \u221a2/2]^T, which is correct for the spin-up along x.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in general, the spin-up state is [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T, where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the eigenvector should be normalized. The given options have expressions like sqrt(2/3) hbar, etc. Wait, but our current state is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].\n\nWait, but let me think about the options. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but without any factors. Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), etc. Hmm, but wait, the eigenvector elements are just the components, so perhaps the question is asking for the normalized eigenvector. So, the state I'm thinking of is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, which is already normalized because cos^2 + sin^2 =1.\n\nSo, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but option D has those terms multiplied by sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar. Hmm, but I'm not sure where the hbar comes in here because the eigenvectors are dimensionless (they are vectors in Hilbert space, not physical quantities with units). So, the presence of hbar in the options is confusing. Wait, but the problem statement says the eigenvector is of the operator P, which has components scaled by \u0127/2, but the eigenvector itself is a vector in the Hilbert space and should be dimensionless. So, perhaps the options have some scaling factors that don't belong. Alternatively, perhaps the options are not normalized correctly.\n\nWait, looking back, the eigenvector equation is (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z) |v> = |v>, and the eigenvector |v> is [a, b]^T. So, the solution we found is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is normalized.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. But wait, the problem is about a muon, but muons have spin-1/2 just like electrons, so that shouldn't affect the calculation.\n\nWait, but wait the problem statement says the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. Oh, wait a minute. Because the operator P is (\u0127/2)(nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z ), so when I set up the eigenvalue equation, I have P |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>, which is why the matrix M is (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z ), which then has eigenvalues \u00b11, leading to |v> having eigenvalue +1 for M.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the operator P is given as a vector operator, and the question is to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>.\n\nSo, perhaps the matrix M is (nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z ), and when multiplied by \u0127/2, the eigenvalue is (\u0127/2) * 1 = \u0127/2.\n\nSo, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is option C.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our conclusion. \n\nBut wait, the other options: option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like the spherical harmonics for l=1, but perhaps not the correct form for the spin state. Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), etc., which I'm not sure about.\n\nWait, but I'm confident that the correct normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. So, the correct option would be option C.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Another way to find the eigenvector is to write out the matrix and find its eigenvectors.\n\nLet me re-express the matrix M = nx \u03c3_x + nz \u03c3_z. Substituting nx= cos\u03b8, nz= sin\u03b8, as earlier.\n\nSo, M = cos\u03b8 \u03c3_x + sin\u03b8 \u03c3_z.\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nSo, M = [[sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8], [cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8]].\n\nThe eigenvalues are the solutions to det(M - \u03bb I ) = 0.\n\ndet( [[sin\u03b8 - \u03bb, cos\u03b8], [cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 - \u03bb] ]) = 0.\n\nSo, (sin\u03b8 - \u03bb)(-sin\u03b8 - \u03bb) - cos^2\u03b8 = 0.\n\nExpanding: (-sin\u03b8 sin\u03b8 - \u03bb sin\u03b8 + \u03bb sin\u03b8 + \u03bb^2) - cos^2\u03b8 =0.\n\nWait, no: (sin\u03b8 - \u03bb)(-sin\u03b8 -\u03bb) = -(sin\u03b8)(sin\u03b8) - sin\u03b8 \u03bb + \u03bb sin\u03b8 + \u03bb^2 = -sin\u00b2\u03b8 + \u03bb^2.\n\nSo, the determinant equation is (-sin\u00b2\u03b8 + \u03bb\u00b2) - cos\u00b2\u03b8 =0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1 \u2192 \u03bb= \u00b11.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1, as expected.\n\nFor \u03bb=1, the eigenvector equation is (M - I)|v> =0.\n\nM -I = [[sin\u03b8 -1, cos\u03b8], [cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8 -1]]\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n(sin\u03b8 -1) a + cos\u03b8 b =0\n\ncos\u03b8 a + (-sin\u03b8 -1) b =0\n\nLet me take the first equation:\n\n(sin\u03b8 -1) a + cos\u03b8 b =0 \u2192 (1 - sin\u03b8) a = cos\u03b8 b \u2192 a = [ cos\u03b8 / (1 - sin\u03b8) ] b.\n\nWe can write a as [ cos\u03b8/(1 - sin\u03b8) ] b.\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sin\u03b8):\n\na = [ cos\u03b8 (1 + sin\u03b8) ] / [ (1 - sin\u03b8)(1 + sin\u03b8) ) ] * b.\n\nDenominator is 1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, a = [ cos\u03b8 (1 + sin\u03b8) ] / cos\u00b2\u03b8 * b \u2192 a = [ (1 + sin\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 ] b.\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + sin\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 ] b.\n\nBut 1 + sin\u03b8 over cos\u03b8 is equal to [ (1 + sin\u03b8) ] / cos\u03b8 = [ 1/cos\u03b8 + tan\u03b8 ].\n\nAlternatively, this can be written as tan(\u03b8/2 + \u03c0/4 ), but perhaps it's better to express in terms of half-angles.\n\nWait, using the identity:\n\n(1 + sin\u03b8) = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, 1 + sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4 )^2? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps I can proceed differently.\n\nExpress a in terms of b:\n\na = [ (1 + sin\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 ] b.\n\nWe can factor out cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2):\n\nLet me write 1 + sin\u03b8 as 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4 )^2, but perhaps a better approach is to use the identity:\n\n1 + sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4 )^2. Hmm, perhaps not the easiest way.\n\nAlternatively, let me express 1 + sin\u03b8 as 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4 )^2. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write in terms of tan(theta/2).\n\nUsing the identity:\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 tan(theta/2) / (1 + tan\u00b2(theta/2)).\n\nBut perhaps that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, let me write 1 + sin\u03b8 as [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]\u00b2.\n\nWait, [sin(a) + cos(a)]\u00b2 = sin\u00b2a + 2 sin a cos a + cos\u00b2a = 1 + sin(2a). Hmm, not exactly matching 1 + sin\u03b8, but perhaps if a = theta/2, then 2a = theta. So, [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]\u00b2 = 1 + sin(theta). Oh, right! Because 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) = sin(theta).\n\nSo, [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]^2 = sin\u00b2(theta/2) + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + cos\u00b2(theta/2) = 1 + sin(theta).\n\nSo, 1 + sin(theta) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2.\n\nSimilarly, cos(theta) = cos\u00b2(theta/2) - sin\u00b2(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)] [cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)].\n\nSo, [ cos(theta) ] = [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ]\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + sin\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 ] b = [ ( [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2 ) / ( [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ][ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] ) ) ] b.\n\nThe denominator is [cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)][cos(theta/2)+sin(theta/2)] = cos\u00b2(theta/2) - sin\u00b2(theta/2) = cos(theta).\n\nSo, substituting back, a = [ [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2 / [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ][ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] ] * b.\n\nWhich simplifies to [ [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2 ] / [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2))(cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ) ] * b.\n\nBut the denominator is cos(theta), as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor out [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] from numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, numerator is [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ]^2, denominator has [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo, a = [ (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ] / [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ) ] * b.\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + tan(theta/2)) ] / [ (1 - tan(theta/2)) ] * b.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this as [ (1 + tan(theta/2)) / (1 - tan(theta/2)) ] * b.\n\nWhich is the same as [ (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) / (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ) ] * b.\n\nWe can write this as [ (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) ] / [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ] = [1 + tan(theta/2)] / [1 - tan(theta/2)].\n\nWait, but maybe a better approach is to factor out cos(theta/2) from numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + tan(theta/2)) / (1 - tan(theta/2)) ] * b.\n\nLet me set t = tan(theta/2).\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + t) / (1 - t) ] b.\n\nNow, to find a in terms of b, perhaps I can express this as a ratio.\n\nLet me write a = [ (1 + t) / (1 - t) ] b.\n\nBut perhaps this isn't leading me anywhere. Let's think differently.\n\nLet me assume that b=1 (for simplicity), then a = [ (1 + sin\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 ].\n\nBut wait, from earlier, [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ]^2 =1 + sin\u03b8, and [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] = cos(theta).\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + sin\u03b8) / cos\u03b8 ] * b = [ ( [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ]^2 ) / ( [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ][ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ] ) ) ] * b = [ cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) ) / ( cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ) ] * b.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as [ (cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2)) / (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ) ] * b.\n\nLet me factor out cos(theta/2) from numerator and denominator:\n\n[ cos(theta/2) (1 + tan(theta/2)) ) / ( cos(theta/2) (1 - tan(theta/2)) ) ) ] = [ (1 + tan(theta/2)) / (1 - tan(theta/2)) ) ].\n\nSo, a = [ (1 + tan(theta/2)) / (1 - tan(theta/2)) ) ] * b.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps I can express this as e^{i phi} times some trigonometric function.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write a = e^{i phi} [ cos(theta/2) ], and b = e^{i phi} [ sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBecause when I did that earlier, it worked for the specific cases. So, perhaps the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is option C.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nYes, that matches. So, the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again:\n\nOption C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what I have.\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. So, option C is correct.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is given with its $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ components, each expressed as $\\hbar/2$ times a 2x2 matrix. The direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so the operator can be written as $\\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is $\\vec{P} |v\\rangle = (\\hbar/2) |v\\rangle$. Substituting $\\vec{P} = \\hbar/2 (n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z)$, the equation simplifies to $(n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z) |v\\rangle = |v\\rangle$, where $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +\u0127/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each represented by 2x2 matrices multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nHmm. Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states when that observable is measured. So, the eigenvector here will correspond to a state where the component of the angular momentum along direction n is \u0127/2. Oh wait, but wait, the operator P might not be the angular momentum operator. Let me check the components.\n\nThe given components are Px, Py, Pz. Each is (\u0127/2) multiplied by some matrix. Let me write them down.\n\nPx is (\u0127/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. That looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix times \u0127/2. Similarly, Py is (\u0127/2)*[[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix times \u0127/2. And Pz is (\u0127/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix times \u0127/2. So each component is (\u0127/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix.\n\nSo the operator P is a vector operator where each component is (\u0127/2)\u03c3_i, where \u03c3_i are the Pauli matrices. Wait, but actually, the operator for spin in the direction n would be (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrices dotted with n. Oh, right! The spin operator in direction n is S = (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z). But wait, in this case, the operator given is P, which is written as having components Px, Py, Pz as given. So perhaps P is the spin operator in the direction n.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the operator is P, and we're looking for the eigenvector along direction n. So the operator we should consider is the projection of P onto n. Or wait, perhaps the operator for the component along n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n lies in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), because y-component is zero. So n is (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx\u00b2 + nz\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo the operator we're interested in is P_n = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because n has no y-component, so Py doesn't contribute.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is P_n |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>, because the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2.\n\nWait, but P_x, P_y, P_z are each (\u0127/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So substituting, P_n would be (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z). Because P_x is (\u0127/2)\u03c3_x, so when you multiply by n_x, you get (\u0127/2) n_x \u03c3_x, and similarly for P_z.\n\nSo the operator P_n is (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z). And we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is:\n\n( (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) ) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nDivide both sides by \u0127/2, we get:\n\n(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>\n\nSo the matrix for (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) is:\n\nn_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nWhich gives:\n\n[[n_z, n_x],\n [n_x, -n_z]]\n\nWait, no. Let me compute each element:\n\nThe diagonal elements would be (n_z)*1 (from \u03c3_z) for (1,1) and (n_z)*(-1) for (2,2). The off-diagonal terms are n_x *1 each.\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\n[ [n_z, n_x],\n  [n_x, -n_z] ]\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nSo when you have a linear combination a \u03c3_x + b \u03c3_z, the matrix is:\n\na*[[0,1],[1,0]] + b*[[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[b, a], [a, -b]]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the matrix is [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]].\n\nWe're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = [a; b]\n\nWhich gives two equations:\n\n1. n_z a + n_x b = a\n2. n_x a - n_z b = b\n\nLet me write these as:\n\n(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0\nn_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0\n\nWait, let me rearrange the equations.\n\nEquation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0\nEquation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0\n\nThese are two homogeneous equations. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.\n\nBut since we're looking for non-trivial solutions, perhaps we can express one variable in terms of the other.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n(n_z -1) a = -n_x b\n\nAssuming b is not zero, we can write a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b\n\nWait, but let's see if that's possible. Let me plug a into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0\nSubstituting a:\n\nn_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) b ] + (-n_z -1) b =0\n\nFactor out b:\n\n[ (-n_x\u00b2)/(n_z -1) ) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0\n\nMultiply through by (n_z -1) to eliminate denominator:\n\n-n_x\u00b2 + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = 0\n\nLet me compute (-n_z -1)(n_z -1):\n\n= (-n_z)(n_z -1) -1*(n_z -1)\n= -n_z\u00b2 +n_z -n_z +1\n= -n_z\u00b2 + 0 +1\n= 1 -n_z\u00b2\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n-n_x\u00b2 + (1 -n_z\u00b2) = 0\n\nBut wait, since n is a unit vector in x-z plane, n_x\u00b2 +n_z\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo 1 -n_z\u00b2 =n_x\u00b2.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n-n_x\u00b2 + (n_x\u00b2) =0 \u2192 0=0, which is always true. So the two equations are dependent, and any a and b satisfying equation 1 will satisfy equation 2.\n\nSo from equation 1, a = [ (1 -n_z)/n_x ] b.\n\nWait, because (n_z -1) a = -n_x b \u2192 a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ) ] b \u2192 a = [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [ (n_x/(1 -n_z)) b; b ].\n\nWe can factor out b, so the eigenvector is proportional to [n_x/(1 -n_z), 1]^T.\n\nBut we need to normalize this vector.\n\nLet me compute the normalization factor.\n\nThe vector is [n_x/(1-n_z), 1], so the squared magnitude is (n_x^2)/( (1-n_z)^2 ) + 1.\n\nFactor out 1/(1-n_z)^2:\n\n[ n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2 ] / (1 -n_z)^2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nn_x^2 + (1 - 2n_z + n_z^2 )\n\nBut since n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1, substitute:\n\n1 - 2n_z +1 \u2192 Wait, no:\n\nWait, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So the numerator becomes:\n\n(n_x^2) + (1 - 2n_z + n_z^2) = (n_x^2 +n_z^2) ) +1 - 2n_z \u2192 1 +1 -2n_z = 2(1 -n_z)\n\nSo the squared magnitude is [2(1 -n_z)] / (1 -n_z)^2 ) = 2/(1 -n_z)\n\nSo the normalization factor is sqrt( (1 -n_z) / 2 )\n\nWait, because the squared magnitude is 2/(1-n_z), so the magnitude is sqrt(2/(1-n_z)).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the squared magnitude is [2(1 -n_z)] / (1 -n_z)^2 ) \u2192 2/(1 -n_z).\n\nSo to make the vector a unit vector, we divide each component by sqrt(2/(1-n_z)).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ (n_x/(1-n_z)) / sqrt(2/(1-n_z)), 1 / sqrt(2/(1-n_z)) ]\n\nSimplify each component.\n\nFirst component:\n\n(n_x/(1-n_z)) * sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) ) = n_x * sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) / (1-n_z) )\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n= (n_x) / (1-n_z) ) * sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 )\n= n_x * sqrt( (1-n_z)/(2*(1-n_z)^2) ) )\n= n_x * sqrt(1/( 2 (1-n_z) )) )\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to write the normalization factor as 1/sqrt( 2/(1-n_z) ) ) = sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ).\n\nSo the first component is [n_x/(1-n_z)] * sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) = n_x * sqrt( (1-n_z)/(2*(1-n_z)^2) ) ) = n_x * sqrt(1/(2(1-n_z))) )\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me compute each component:\n\nComponent 1: [n_x/(1-n_z)] / sqrt(2/(1-n_z)) ) = (n_x/(1-n_z)) * sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) ) = n_x * sqrt( (1-n_z) ) / ( (1-n_z) sqrt(2) ) ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to n_x * 1/( sqrt(2(1-n_z)) )\n\nSimilarly, component 2: 1 / sqrt(2/(1-n_z)) ) = sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 )\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ n_x / sqrt( 2(1-n_z) ), sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can write this in terms of angles. Since the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, let's parameterize it using polar coordinates. Let me think about this. Let\u2019s say the angle from the z-axis is \u03b8. So n_x = sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, but wait, in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is zero or pi or something? Wait, no, the x-z plane is \u03c6=0 for the x-axis, and \u03c6=pi/2 would be the z-axis. Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, the polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the positive z-axis. So for a direction in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle \u03c6 would be 0 or \u03c0, right? Because the direction is along x (\u03c6=0), or opposite x (\u03c6=\u03c0), but in any case, the components are (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) or (\u2212sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) depending on \u03c6.\n\nBut wait, for our purposes, maybe we can just write n_z as cos\u03b8, and n_x as sin\u03b8, since in the x-z plane, n is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), assuming \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis.\n\nSo substituting, n_z = cos\u03b8, n_x = sin\u03b8.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector becomes:\n\n[ sin\u03b8 / sqrt( 2(1 - cos\u03b8) ), sqrt( (1 - cos\u03b8)/2 ) ]\n\nWait, 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(theta/2), right? Because 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo sqrt(2(1 - cos\u03b8)) = sqrt(4 sin\u00b2(theta/2)) ) = 2 |sin(theta/2)|. Assuming theta is between 0 and pi, sin(theta/2) is positive, so sqrt(2(1 - cos\u03b8))=2 sin(theta/2).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - cos\u03b8)/2 = sin\u00b2(theta/2), so sqrt( (1 - cos\u03b8)/2 ) = |sin(theta/2)| = sin(theta/2), since theta is between 0 and pi.\n\nSo substituting back, the components become:\n\nsin\u03b8 / (2 sin(theta/2)) ) and sin(theta/2).\n\nWait, let's compute sin\u03b8 in terms of theta/2.\n\nWe know that sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).\n\nSo sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).\n\nSo the first component is [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / (2 sin(theta/2) ) ) = cos(theta/2).\n\nThe second component is sin(theta/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me recheck that.\n\nBecause the first component was sin\u03b8 / (2 sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).\n\nSo sin\u03b8/(2 sin(theta/2)) ) = (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / (2 sin(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, but wait, the options are given in terms of hbar, but our calculation here doesn't include hbar. Because the eigenvectors in quantum mechanics are defined up to a scalar, but the normalization doesn't include factors of hbar. Because the operator is in terms of hbar/2, but the eigenvector is a unit vector, so the components are dimensionless.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found.\n\nBut let me check the options again.\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nOption B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).\n\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)).\n\nWait, but wait, the components I found are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBut let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C says exactly that. So that's the eigenvector.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The operator P is along the direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So the eigenvectors of the spin operator S_n (which is the component of spin along n) would have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nThe eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along n. The spin-up state is given by [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBut in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi would be zero or pi, because in the x-z plane, the direction is along the x or -x axis. Wait, no, in the x-z plane, the angle phi is 0 or pi. So the azimuthal angle phi would be zero if it's along the x-axis, and pi if it's along the -x direction. But in our case, n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so phi could be any angle, but for the eigenvector, the components don't depend on phi if we're taking the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Wait, no, actually, the spin-up state in the direction n would have components that depend on theta and phi.\n\nWait, but in our calculation, we found the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] without any exponential term. But that's only the case when phi is zero. Hmm, perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe because in our initial setup, n is in the x-z plane, but when we write the eigenvector, it's in the basis of the Pauli matrices, which are for the z-axis. So perhaps the actual eigenvector depends on the angle theta from the z-axis.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the standard spin-1/2 representation.\n\nThe spin-up state along direction n (theta, phi) is given by:\n\n|+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |\u2212z>\n\nSo the components are (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut in our case, since n lies in the x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi, depending on whether n is in the x>0 or x<0 direction.\n\nWait, but the problem says n is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, which would have phi = 0 or pi, but in our earlier calculation, we found the eigenvector as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nSo perhaps the correct option would be option C, which has (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but without the exponential.\n\nWait, but option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me go back. Our initial approach was to find the eigenvector of the operator P_n = nx P_x + nz P_z.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to note that for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvectors of the spin in direction n are given by the standard spherical harmonics. So the spin-up state along n has components (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).\n\nWait, but in our case, the operator P is the spin operator, so the eigenvectors should be in that form.\n\nBut in our calculation, when we derived the eigenvector, we found [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].\n\nSo which option matches this? Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), without any phase factor. So that would be correct if phi is zero.\n\nBut the problem states that n is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So phi can be any angle, but for the eigenvector, we have an exponential term in the second component.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B has (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which doesn't match the form we derived. Our result has theta/2, not theta.\n\nOption C has theta/2, which matches our result.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again. Because when the direction is along x, theta is 90 degrees, so theta/2 is 45 degrees. The eigenvector would be (cos(45), sin(45)), which is (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), which is correct for spin-up along x.\n\nBut in that case, the eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), which is option A if hbar is considered, but option A has hbar multiplied, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says the eigenvector is normalized. So the hbar can't be a factor in the components because hbar has units of J\u00b7s, and the components should be dimensionless.\n\nLooking at the options, option C has only theta/2, and the components are cos and sin of theta/2, which matches our result.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n",

Let me write them down.\n\nPx is (\u0127/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. That looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix times \u0127/2. Similarly, Py is (\u0127/2)*[[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix times \u0127/2. And Pz is (\u0127/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix times \u0127/2. So each component is (\u0127/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix.\n\nSo the operator P is a vector operator where each component is (\u0127/2)\u03c3_i, where \u03c3_i are the Pauli matrices. Wait, but actually, the operator for spin in the direction n would be (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrices dotted with n. Oh, right! The spin operator in direction n is S = (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z). But wait, in this case, the operator given is P, which is written as having components Px, Py, Pz as given. So perhaps P is the spin operator in the direction n.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the operator is P, and we're looking for the eigenvector along direction n. So the operator we should consider is the projection of P onto n. Or wait, perhaps the operator for the component along n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n lies in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), because y-component is zero. So n is (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx\u00b2 + nz\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo the operator we're interested in is P_n = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because n has no y-component, so Py doesn't contribute.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is P_n |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>, because the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2.\n\nWait, but P_x, P_y, P_z are each (\u0127/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So substituting, P_n would be (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z). Because P_x is (\u0127/2)\u03c3_x, so when you multiply by n_x, you get (\u0127/2) n_x \u03c3_x, and similarly for P_z.\n\nSo the operator P_n is (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z). And we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is:\n\n( (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) ) |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>\n\nDivide both sides by \u0127/2, we get:\n\n(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>\n\nSo the matrix for (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) is:\n\nn_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nWhich gives:\n\n[[n_z, n_x],\n [n_x, -n_z]]\n\nWait, no. Let me compute each element:\n\nThe diagonal elements would be (n_z)*1 (from \u03c3_z) for (1,1) and (n_z)*(-1) for (2,2). The off-diagonal terms are n_x *1 each.\n\nSo the matrix is:\n\n[ [n_z, n_x],\n  [n_x, -n_z] ]\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nSo when you have a linear combination a \u03c3_x + b \u03c3_z, the matrix is:\n\na*[[0,1],[1,0]] + b*[[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[b, a], [a, -b]]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the matrix is [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]].\n\nWe're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = [a; b]\n\nWhich gives two equations:\n\n1. n_z a + n_x b = a\n2. n_x a - n_z b = b\n\nLet me write these as:\n\n(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0\nn_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0\n\nWait, let me rearrange the equations.\n\nEquation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0\nEquation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0\n\nThese are two homogeneous equations. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.\n\nBut since we're looking for non-trivial solutions, perhaps we can express one variable in terms of the other.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n(n_z -1) a = -n_x b\n\nAssuming b is not zero, we can write a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b\n\nWait, but let's see if that's possible. Let me plug a into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0\nSubstituting a:\n\nn_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) b ] + (-n_z -1) b =0\n\nFactor out b:\n\n[ (-n_x\u00b2)/(n_z -1) ) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0\n\nMultiply through by (n_z -1) to eliminate denominator:\n\n-n_x\u00b2 + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = 0\n\nLet me compute (-n_z -1)(n_z -1):\n\n= (-n_z)(n_z -1) -1*(n_z -1)\n= -n_z\u00b2 +n_z -n_z +1\n= -n_z\u00b2 + 0 +1\n= 1 -n_z\u00b2\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n-n_x\u00b2 + (1 -n_z\u00b2) = 0\n\nBut wait, since n is a unit vector in x-z plane, n_x\u00b2 +n_z\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo 1 -n_z\u00b2 =n_x\u00b2.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n-n_x\u00b2 + (n_x\u00b2) =0 \u2192 0=0, which is always true. So the two equations are dependent, and any a and b satisfying equation 1 will satisfy equation 2.\n\nSo from equation 1, a = [ (1 -n_z)/n_x ] b.\n\nWait, because (n_z -1) a = -n_x b \u2192 a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ) ] b \u2192 a = [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [ (n_x/(1 -n_z)) b; b ].\n\nWe can factor out b, so the eigenvector is proportional to [n_x/(1 -n_z), 1]^T.\n\nBut we need to normalize this vector.\n\nLet me compute the normalization factor.\n\nThe vector is [n_x/(1-n_z), 1], so the squared magnitude is (n_x^2)/( (1-n_z)^2 ) + 1.\n\nFactor out 1/(1-n_z)^2:\n\n[ n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2 ] / (1 -n_z)^2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nn_x^2 + (1 - 2n_z + n_z^2 )\n\nBut since n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1, substitute:\n\n1 - 2n_z +1 \u2192 Wait, no:\n\nWait, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So the numerator becomes:\n\n(n_x^2) + (1 - 2n_z + n_z^2) = (n_x^2 +n_z^2) ) +1 - 2n_z \u2192 1 +1 -2n_z = 2(1 -n_z)\n\nSo the squared magnitude is [2(1 -n_z)] / (1 -n_z)^2 ) = 2/(1 -n_z)\n\nSo the normalization factor is sqrt( (1 -n_z) / 2 )\n\nWait, because the squared magnitude is 2/(1-n_z), so the magnitude is sqrt(2/(1-n_z)).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the squared magnitude is [2(1 -n_z)] / (1 -n_z)^2 ) \u2192 2/(1 -n_z).\n\nSo to make the vector a unit vector, we divide each component by sqrt(2/(1-n_z)).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ (n_x/(1-n_z)) / sqrt(2/(1-n_z)), 1 / sqrt(2/(1-n_z)) ]\n\nSimplify each component.\n\nFirst component:\n\n(n_x/(1-n_z)) * sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) ) = n_x * sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) / (1-n_z) )\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n= (n_x) / (1-n_z) ) * sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 )\n= n_x * sqrt( (1-n_z)/(2*(1-n_z)^2) ) )\n= n_x * sqrt(1/( 2 (1-n_z) )) )\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to write the normalization factor as 1/sqrt( 2/(1-n_z) ) ) = sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ).\n\nSo the first component is [n_x/(1-n_z)] * sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) = n_x * sqrt( (1-n_z)/(2*(1-n_z)^2) ) ) = n_x * sqrt(1/(2(1-n_z))) )\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me compute each component:\n\nComponent 1: [n_x/(1-n_z)] / sqrt(2/(1-n_z)) ) = (n_x/(1-n_z)) * sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) ) = n_x * sqrt( (1-n_z) ) / ( (1-n_z) sqrt(2) ) ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to n_x * 1/( sqrt(2(1-n_z)) )\n\nSimilarly, component 2: 1 / sqrt(2/(1-n_z)) ) = sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 )\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ n_x / sqrt( 2(1-n_z) ), sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can write this in terms of angles. Since the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, let's parameterize it using polar coordinates. Let me think about this. Let\u2019s say the angle from the z-axis is \u03b8. So n_x = sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, but wait, in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is zero or pi or something? Wait, no, the x-z plane is \u03c6=0 for the x-axis, and \u03c6=pi/2 would be the z-axis. Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, the polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the positive z-axis. So for a direction in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle \u03c6 would be 0 or \u03c0, right? Because the direction is along x (\u03c6=0), or opposite x (\u03c6=\u03c0), but in any case, the components are (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) or (\u2212sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) depending on \u03c6.\n\nBut wait, for our purposes, maybe we can just write n_z as cos\u03b8, and n_x as sin\u03b8, since in the x-z plane, n is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), assuming \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis.\n\nSo substituting, n_z = cos\u03b8, n_x = sin\u03b8.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector becomes:\n\n[ sin\u03b8 / sqrt( 2(1 - cos\u03b8) ), sqrt( (1 - cos\u03b8)/2 ) ]\n\nWait, 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(theta/2), right? Because 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo sqrt(2(1 - cos\u03b8)) = sqrt(4 sin\u00b2(theta/2)) ) = 2 |sin(theta/2)|. Assuming theta is between 0 and pi, sin(theta/2) is positive, so sqrt(2(1 - cos\u03b8))=2 sin(theta/2).\n\nSimilarly, (1 - cos\u03b8)/2 = sin\u00b2(theta/2), so sqrt( (1 - cos\u03b8)/2 ) = |sin(theta/2)| = sin(theta/2), since theta is between 0 and pi.\n\nSo substituting back, the components become:\n\nsin\u03b8 / (2 sin(theta/2)) ) and sin(theta/2).\n\nWait, let's compute sin\u03b8 in terms of theta/2.\n\nWe know that sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).\n\nSo sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).\n\nSo the first component is [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / (2 sin(theta/2) ) ) = cos(theta/2).\n\nThe second component is sin(theta/2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me recheck that.\n\nBecause the first component was sin\u03b8 / (2 sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).\n\nSo sin\u03b8/(2 sin(theta/2)) ) = (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / (2 sin(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, but wait, the options are given in terms of hbar, but our calculation here doesn't include hbar. Because the eigenvectors in quantum mechanics are defined up to a scalar, but the normalization doesn't include factors of hbar. Because the operator is in terms of hbar/2, but the eigenvector is a unit vector, so the components are dimensionless.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found.\n\nBut let me check the options again.\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nOption B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).\n\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)).\n\nWait, but wait, the components I found are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBut let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C says exactly that. So that's the eigenvector.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The operator P is along the direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So the eigenvectors of the spin operator S_n (which is the component of spin along n) would have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2.\n\nThe eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along n. The spin-up state is given by [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBut in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi would be zero or pi, because in the x-z plane, the direction is along the x or -x axis. Wait, no, in the x-z plane, the angle phi is 0 or pi. So the azimuthal angle phi would be zero if it's along the x-axis, and pi if it's along the -x direction. But in our case, n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so phi could be any angle, but for the eigenvector, the components don't depend on phi if we're taking the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Wait, no, actually, the spin-up state in the direction n would have components that depend on theta and phi.\n\nWait, but in our calculation, we found the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] without any exponential term. But that's only the case when phi is zero. Hmm, perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe because in our initial setup, n is in the x-z plane, but when we write the eigenvector, it's in the basis of the Pauli matrices, which are for the z-axis. So perhaps the actual eigenvector depends on the angle theta from the z-axis.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the standard spin-1/2 representation.\n\nThe spin-up state along direction n (theta, phi) is given by:\n\n|+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |\u2212z>\n\nSo the components are (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut in our case, since n lies in the x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi, depending on whether n is in the x>0 or x<0 direction.\n\nWait, but the problem says n is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, which would have phi = 0 or pi, but in our earlier calculation, we found the eigenvector as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nSo perhaps the correct option would be option C, which has (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but without the exponential.\n\nWait, but option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me go back. Our initial approach was to find the eigenvector of the operator P_n = nx P_x + nz P_z.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to note that for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvectors of the spin in direction n are given by the standard spherical harmonics. So the spin-up state along n has components (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).\n\nWait, but in our case, the operator P is the spin operator, so the eigenvectors should be in that form.\n\nBut in our calculation, when we derived the eigenvector, we found [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].\n\nSo which option matches this? Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), without any phase factor. So that would be correct if phi is zero.\n\nBut the problem states that n is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So phi can be any angle, but for the eigenvector, we have an exponential term in the second component.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B has (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which doesn't match the form we derived. Our result has theta/2, not theta.\n\nOption C has theta/2, which matches our result.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again. Because when the direction is along x, theta is 90 degrees, so theta/2 is 45 degrees. The eigenvector would be (cos(45), sin(45)), which is (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), which is correct for spin-up along x.\n\nBut in that case, the eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), which is option A if hbar is considered, but option A has hbar multiplied, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says the eigenvector is normalized. So the hbar can't be a factor in the components because hbar has units of J\u00b7s, and the components should be dimensionless.\n\nLooking at the options, option C has only theta/2, and the components are cos and sin of theta/2, which matches our result.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The components are:\n\n- $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli X matrix),\n- $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Y matrix),\n- $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Z matrix).\n\nSince $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis. The operator $\\vec{P}$ in the direction of $\\vec{n}$ is given by:\n\n\\[\nP_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z \\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere $n_x = \\sin\\theta$ and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$. Substituting the Pauli matrices, the operator becomes:\n\n\\[\nP_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is:\n\n\\[\nP_n | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} | \\psi \\rangle.\n\\]\n\nDividing through by $\\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThis gives the system of equations:\n\n1. $(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0$,\n2. $n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0$.\n\nThese equations are consistent, and solving for $a$ and $b$ yields the eigenvector:\n\n\\[\n| \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThis eigenvector is normalized and corresponds to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The components of the eigenvector depend on $\\theta/2$, where $\\theta$ is the angle of $\\vec{n}$ from the z-axis.\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n- **Option A**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ \u2014 This does not match the derived eigenvector and includes $\\hbar$, which is inconsistent with the normalization of eigenvectors in quantum mechanics.\n- **Option B**: $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin(\\theta))$ \u2014 This form does not match the derived eigenvector, as the components depend on $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$.\n- **Option C**: $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ \u2014 This matches the derived eigenvector exactly.\n- **Option D**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin(\\theta/2))$ \u2014 This includes incorrect normalization factors and the presence of $\\hbar$ is inconsistent with the normalization of eigenvectors.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**: $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.\n\nAlright, the operator is P, which is a vector operator, right? So it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The question is about finding the eigenvector of P along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +\u0127/2.\n\nWait, so I'm dealing with a spin-\u00bd system because the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u0127/2. The operator P must be the spin operator, probably the Pauli matrices scaled by \u0127/2.\n\nLet me jot down the given components:\n\nP_x is (\u0127/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]].\nP_y is (\u0127/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]].\nP_z is (\u0127/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nSo, each component is (\u0127/2) multiplied by the respective Pauli matrix.\n\nThe operator along an arbitrary direction n can be written as P\u00b7n, which is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. Since n is in the x-z plane, it doesn't have a y-component. So n has components (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, 0, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6?), wait no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, a direction vector n can be represented as (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8), but since it's in the x-z plane, \u03c6 must be 0 or \u03c0? Wait, no, wait. If the direction is in the x-z plane, that means the angle \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0, because the y-component is zero. So, the direction vector would be (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8) if \u03c6=0, or (-cos\u03b8,0,sin\u03b8) if \u03c6=\u03c0. Hmm, but the problem says an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so \u03c6 can be 0 or \u03c0, but perhaps the exact value isn't necessary here.\n\nBut wait, the eigenvector for P\u00b7n with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. So, I need to find the eigenvector equation (P\u00b7n)|\u03c8> = (\u0127/2)|\u03c8>.\n\nAlternatively, the operator can be written as (P\u00b7n) = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). And because it's a unit vector, n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, P\u00b7n becomes n_x P_x + n_z P_z.\n\nLet me write out the matrices for P_x and P_z.\n\nP_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], multiplied by \u0127/2. Similarly, P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]] multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nSo, n_x P_x is (\u0127/2) * n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] and n_z P_z is (\u0127/2) * n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nAdding these together, the matrix for P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nn_x P_x = (\u0127/2) * n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]]\nn_z P_z = (\u0127/2) * n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]\nAdding them:\n\n(\u0127/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].\n\nSo the operator matrix is (\u0127/2) times that matrix.\n\nWe need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSo, the eigenvalue equation is [ (\u0127/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] ] |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>.\n\nDivide both sides by \u0127/2 to simplify:\n\n[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>.\n\nSo, the matrix equation is:\n\n|n_z a + n_x b| = a\n|n_x a - n_z b| = b\n\nWhere a and b are the components of the eigenvector |\u03c8> = [a, b]^T.\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n1) n_z a + n_x b = a\n2) n_x a - n_z b = b\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1:\n\nn_z a + n_x b - a = 0 => a (n_z -1) + n_x b = 0.\n\nEquation 2:\n\nn_x a - n_z b - b = 0 => n_x a - b(n_z + 1) = 0.\n\nSo, equation 2: n_x a = b (n_z + 1).\n\nWe can express a from equation 2 as a = [b (n_z +1)] / n_x.\n\nWait, but since n is a unit vector in x-z plane, n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 =1. So, let me denote n_x = cos\u03b8, n_z = sin\u03b8, because for a direction in x-z plane, the angle \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. So, for example, \u03b8=0 is along +z, \u03b8=\u03c0/2 is along +x, \u03b8=\u03c0 is along -z, etc.\n\nWait, but wait: when you have a unit vector in x-z plane, the components are (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis. So, n_x = cos\u03b8, n_z = sin\u03b8. Because in spherical coordinates, x = r sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, y= r sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, z= r cos\u03b8. But since the vector is in x-z plane, \u03c6=0 or \u03c0, but for simplicity, let's take \u03c6=0, so x= sin\u03b8, z= cos\u03b8? Wait no, wait. Wait, if \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis, then for a point in x-z plane, the coordinates would be (x, 0, z) = (r sin\u03b8, 0, r cos\u03b8). Since it's a unit vector, r=1. So, n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Wait, no, wait: no, if \u03b8 is the polar angle (from the positive z-axis), then the x component would be sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, and z is cos\u03b8. Since the vector is in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0, so x is sin\u03b8 * cos(0) = sin\u03b8 * 1 = sin\u03b8, and z is cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when \u03b8=0, the point is at (0,0,1), so z=1, x=0. If \u03b8=90 degrees (\u03c0/2), then z=0, x=1. So, yeah, n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, so n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. In spherical coordinates, the position vector is:\n\nx = r sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6\n\ny = r sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nz = r cos\u03b8\n\nSo, for a vector in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0. Let's take \u03c6=0 for simplicity.\n\nSo, x = r sin\u03b8, z = r cos\u03b8.\n\nSince it's a unit vector, r=1.\n\nSo, n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, but that's only when \u03c6=0. If the direction is at \u03c6=\u03c0, then n_x = -sin\u03b8, but for eigenvectors, perhaps the sign doesn't matter because the eigenvectors are up to a phase.\n\nBut for this problem, perhaps the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, so \u03b8 can be any angle from 0 to \u03c0, and \u03c6=0.\n\nSo, I can write n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, but sometimes polar angles are measured from the positive z-axis, so \u03b8=0 is up, \u03b8=\u03c0/2 is in x-z plane, etc. So, yeah, n_x = sin\u03b8 * cos\u03c6, but since \u03c6=0, it's sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, now, back to the equations.\n\nEquation 2: n_x a = b (n_z +1)\n\nSo, a = [b (n_z +1)] / n_x.\n\nSubstituting n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8,\n\na = [b (cos\u03b8 +1)] / sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, let's substitute a into equation 1.\n\nEquation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0.\n\nSubstituting a:\n\n(n_z -1) [b (n_z +1)/n_x ] + n_x b = 0.\n\nFactor out b:\n\nb [ (n_z -1)(n_z +1)/n_x + n_x ] = 0.\n\nSimplify the term inside:\n\n(n_z^2 -1)/n_x + n_x.\n\nBecause (n_z -1)(n_z +1) = n_z^2 -1.\n\nSo, (n_z\u00b2 -1)/n_x + n_x = [n_z\u00b2 -1 + n_x\u00b2]/n_x.\n\nBut n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 =1, so n_z\u00b2 = 1 - n_x\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n[ (1 - n_x\u00b2) -1 + n_x\u00b2 ] / n_x = [ (1 - n_x^2 -1 + n_x^2 ) ] / n_x = [0]/n_x =0.\n\nSo, the equation reduces to 0 =0, which is always true. So, this doesn't give any new information.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that equation 1 doesn't add any new constraints beyond equation 2, which gives a in terms of b.\n\nSo, the eigenvector can be written as [a, b]^T, where a = [b (n_z +1)] / n_x.\n\nBut since the eigenvector is determined up to a scalar multiple, we can set b = 1 for simplicity, then a = (n_z +1)/n_x.\n\nWait, but wait, if b=1, then a = (n_z +1)/n_x.\n\nSo, the vector is [ (n_z+1)/n_x, 1 ].\n\nBut we have to normalize it.\n\nSo, the norm squared is [ (n_z+1)^2 / n_x^2 ] + 1.\n\nWhich is [ (n_z+1)^2 + n_x^2 ] / n_x^2.\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n(n_z +1)^2 + n_x^2 = n_z\u00b2 + 2 n_z +1 + n_x^2.\n\nBut n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 =1, so this becomes 1 + 2 n_z +1 = 2 (1 + n_z).\n\nSo, the norm squared is 2(1 +n_z) / n_x\u00b2.\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ] multiplied by sqrt( n_x\u00b2 / [2(1 +n_z)] ) ), which is 1/sqrt( 2(1 +n_z) ) ) * [ (n_z+1), n_x ].\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write this in terms of \u03b8.\n\nSince n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, substituting,\n\na = [ (cos\u03b8 +1 ) / sin\u03b8 ] * b.\n\nLet me write the vector as [ (cos\u03b8 +1 ) / sin\u03b8 , 1 ].\n\nThe norm squared is [ (cos\u03b8 +1)^2 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n= ( (cos\u03b8 +1)^2 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) / sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nExpanding numerator:\n\ncos\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 cos\u03b8 +1 + sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\n= (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8) + 2 cos\u03b8 +1\n\n= 1 + 2 cos\u03b8 +1 = 2(1 + cos\u03b8)\n\nSo, norm squared is 2(1+cos\u03b8) / sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWait, 2(1 + cos\u03b8) = 4 cos\u00b2(theta/2), because 1 + cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nAnd sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), so sin\u00b2theta =4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo, the norm squared becomes [4 cos\u00b2(theta/2)] / [4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2)] ) ] = [ cos\u00b2(theta/2) ] / [ sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2) ] ].\n\nWait, wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Let me compute the denominator.\n\nWait, 2(1 + cos\u03b8) / sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWait, 1 + cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).\n\nSo, sin\u00b2\u03b8 =4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n2*(2 cos\u00b2(theta/2)) ) / [4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2) ) ].\n\nWhich is 4 cos\u00b2(theta/2) / [4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2) ) ].\n\nThe 4 and cos\u00b2 cancel out, leaving 1/sin\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo, the norm is sqrt(1/sin\u00b2(theta/2)) ) = 1/|sin(theta/2)|.\n\nBut since theta is between 0 and \u03c0, sin(theta/2) is positive, so 1/sin(theta/2).\n\nSo, the normalized vector is [ (cos\u03b8 +1)/(sin\u03b8), 1 ] multiplied by sin(theta/2).\n\nWait, let's compute (cos\u03b8 +1)/(sin\u03b8) = [2 cos\u00b2(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ) ].\n\nWhich simplifies to [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] = cot(theta/2).\n\nSo, the components are:\n\na = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2).\n\nb = 1 * sin(theta/2).\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, but wait, let's check:\n\nThe vector before normalization is [a, b] = [ (cos\u03b8 +1)/sin\u03b8, 1 ].\n\nAfter normalization, each component is multiplied by sin(theta/2).\n\nSo,\n\na_normalized = [ (cos\u03b8 +1)/sin\u03b8 ] * sin(theta/2 )\n\n= [ 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) ) / ( 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ) ] * sin(theta/2 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n= [ cos\u00b2(theta/2) / ( sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ) ] * sin(theta/2 )\n\n= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] * sin(theta/2 )\n\n= cos(theta/2 )\n\nSimilarly, b_normalized = 1 * sin(theta/2 )\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].\n\nWait, but wait, in the initial substitution, we set b=1, but when we normalized, it's scaled by sin(theta/2). So, the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].\n\nLooking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.\n\nBut wait, the options also have options with hbar. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))\n\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2))\n\nBut in our solution, the components are just cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), without any factors of hbar. So, perhaps I made a mistake in units.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the X-component, P_x, is (\u0127/2) times the matrix. So, the operator matrices have elements scaled by \u0127/2.\n\nBut when I found the eigenvector, I didn't include any factors of \u0127, because the eigenvectors are dimensionless. Because the operator is in units of \u0127/2, but the eigenvector is a vector in Hilbert space, so it's a dimensionless vector.\n\nWait, but the options have hbar in them. Hmm. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: (sqrt(2/3) \u0127, sqrt(1/3) \u0127 )\n\nOption B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )\n\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) \u0127 sin(theta/2) )\n\nSo, the eigenvector I found is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C.\n\nBut why do some options have \u0127? Because the problem states that the eigenvector is for the operator P, which is given in terms of \u0127/2 times matrices. But the eigenvector is a vector in Hilbert space; the components don't carry units of \u0127. So, perhaps options with \u0127 are incorrect.\n\nWait, but the options are written as the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Wait, but the eigenvectors are normalized, so the sum of squares should be 1.\n\nLet me compute the sum of squares for option C: cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) =1. So, it's normalized.\n\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(theta/2) )^2 + ( sqrt(1/3) \u0127 sin(theta/2) )^2 ) = (2/3 \u0127\u00b2)(cos^2) + (1/3 \u0127\u00b2)(sin^2) ) = \u0127\u00b2 [ (2/3 cos^2 + 1/3 sin^2 ) ]\n\nWhich is not 1 unless \u0127=1, which is not the case here. So, the vectors in option D are not normalized unless scaled properly.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is about the components of the eigenvector multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization step.\n\nWait, let me double-check the normalization. The initial vector I found is [ a, b ] = [ (cos\u03b8 +1)/ sin\u03b8 , 1 ].\n\nThen, I found that the norm is 1/sin(theta/2).\n\nSo, the normalized vector is [ (cos\u03b8+1)/ sin\u03b8 , 1 ] multiplied by sin(theta/2).\n\nWhich gives [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the problem asks for the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. The components I found are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is independent of the direction, which doesn't make sense. Wait, because the direction is arbitrary, the eigenvector should depend on theta.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the direction n is in x-z plane, so n = (n_x, 0, n_z) = (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), perhaps? Or is it (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8)? I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, no, the standard spherical coordinates have theta as the polar angle from the positive z-axis. So, the x component is sin(theta) cos(phi), and z is cos(theta).\n\nSo, for the direction in the x-z plane, phi=0, so x= sin(theta), z= cos(theta).\n\nWait, but when theta is 0, the direction is along +z. When theta is pi/2, direction is along +x.\n\nSo, n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).\n\nSo, in the previous steps, n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).\n\nSo, when I substitute into a = [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] * b.\n\nThat becomes [ (cos(theta) +1 ) / sin(theta) ] * b.\n\nSo, the vector is [ (cos(theta)+1)/ sin(theta) , 1 ] times some normalization factor.\n\nWait, let's compute that expression.\n\n( cos(theta) +1 ) / sin(theta ) = [ 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo, a = cot(theta/2).\n\nSo, the vector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].\n\nSo, to normalize, compute the norm squared: cot\u00b2(theta/2) + 1 = csc\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo, the norm is csc(theta/2).\n\nSo, the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWhich is option C.\n\nSo, the answer should be option C.\n",

Since n is in the x-z plane, it doesn't have a y-component. So n has components (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, 0, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6?), wait no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, a direction vector n can be represented as (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8), but since it's in the x-z plane, \u03c6 must be 0 or \u03c0? Wait, no, wait. If the direction is in the x-z plane, that means the angle \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0, because the y-component is zero. So, the direction vector would be (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8) if \u03c6=0, or (-cos\u03b8,0,sin\u03b8) if \u03c6=\u03c0. Hmm, but the problem says an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so \u03c6 can be 0 or \u03c0, but perhaps the exact value isn't necessary here.\n\nBut wait, the eigenvector for P\u00b7n with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. So, I need to find the eigenvector equation (P\u00b7n)|\u03c8> = (\u0127/2)|\u03c8>.\n\nAlternatively, the operator can be written as (P\u00b7n) = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). And because it's a unit vector, n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, P\u00b7n becomes n_x P_x + n_z P_z.\n\nLet me write out the matrices for P_x and P_z.\n\nP_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], multiplied by \u0127/2. Similarly, P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]] multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nSo, n_x P_x is (\u0127/2) * n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] and n_z P_z is (\u0127/2) * n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]].\n\nAdding these together, the matrix for P\u00b7n is (\u0127/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nn_x P_x = (\u0127/2) * n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]]\nn_z P_z = (\u0127/2) * n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]\nAdding them:\n\n(\u0127/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].\n\nSo the operator matrix is (\u0127/2) times that matrix.\n\nWe need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSo, the eigenvalue equation is [ (\u0127/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] ] |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) |\u03c8>.\n\nDivide both sides by \u0127/2 to simplify:\n\n[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |\u03c8> = |\u03c8>.\n\nSo, the matrix equation is:\n\n|n_z a + n_x b| = a\n|n_x a - n_z b| = b\n\nWhere a and b are the components of the eigenvector |\u03c8> = [a, b]^T.\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n1) n_z a + n_x b = a\n2) n_x a - n_z b = b\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1:\n\nn_z a + n_x b - a = 0 => a (n_z -1) + n_x b = 0.\n\nEquation 2:\n\nn_x a - n_z b - b = 0 => n_x a - b(n_z + 1) = 0.\n\nSo, equation 2: n_x a = b (n_z + 1).\n\nWe can express a from equation 2 as a = [b (n_z +1)] / n_x.\n\nWait, but since n is a unit vector in x-z plane, n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 =1. So, let me denote n_x = cos\u03b8, n_z = sin\u03b8, because for a direction in x-z plane, the angle \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. So, for example, \u03b8=0 is along +z, \u03b8=\u03c0/2 is along +x, \u03b8=\u03c0 is along -z, etc.\n\nWait, but wait: when you have a unit vector in x-z plane, the components are (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis. So, n_x = cos\u03b8, n_z = sin\u03b8. Because in spherical coordinates, x = r sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, y= r sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, z= r cos\u03b8. But since the vector is in x-z plane, \u03c6=0 or \u03c0, but for simplicity, let's take \u03c6=0, so x= sin\u03b8, z= cos\u03b8? Wait no, wait. Wait, if \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis, then for a point in x-z plane, the coordinates would be (x, 0, z) = (r sin\u03b8, 0, r cos\u03b8). Since it's a unit vector, r=1. So, n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Wait, no, wait: no, if \u03b8 is the polar angle (from the positive z-axis), then the x component would be sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, and z is cos\u03b8. Since the vector is in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0, so x is sin\u03b8 * cos(0) = sin\u03b8 * 1 = sin\u03b8, and z is cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when \u03b8=0, the point is at (0,0,1), so z=1, x=0. If \u03b8=90 degrees (\u03c0/2), then z=0, x=1. So, yeah, n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, so n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. In spherical coordinates, the position vector is:\n\nx = r sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6\n\ny = r sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nz = r cos\u03b8\n\nSo, for a vector in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0. Let's take \u03c6=0 for simplicity.\n\nSo, x = r sin\u03b8, z = r cos\u03b8.\n\nSince it's a unit vector, r=1.\n\nSo, n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, but that's only when \u03c6=0. If the direction is at \u03c6=\u03c0, then n_x = -sin\u03b8, but for eigenvectors, perhaps the sign doesn't matter because the eigenvectors are up to a phase.\n\nBut for this problem, perhaps the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, so \u03b8 can be any angle from 0 to \u03c0, and \u03c6=0.\n\nSo, I can write n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, but sometimes polar angles are measured from the positive z-axis, so \u03b8=0 is up, \u03b8=\u03c0/2 is in x-z plane, etc. So, yeah, n_x = sin\u03b8 * cos\u03c6, but since \u03c6=0, it's sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, now, back to the equations.\n\nEquation 2: n_x a = b (n_z +1)\n\nSo, a = [b (n_z +1)] / n_x.\n\nSubstituting n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8,\n\na = [b (cos\u03b8 +1)] / sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, let's substitute a into equation 1.\n\nEquation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0.\n\nSubstituting a:\n\n(n_z -1) [b (n_z +1)/n_x ] + n_x b = 0.\n\nFactor out b:\n\nb [ (n_z -1)(n_z +1)/n_x + n_x ] = 0.\n\nSimplify the term inside:\n\n(n_z^2 -1)/n_x + n_x.\n\nBecause (n_z -1)(n_z +1) = n_z^2 -1.\n\nSo, (n_z\u00b2 -1)/n_x + n_x = [n_z\u00b2 -1 + n_x\u00b2]/n_x.\n\nBut n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 =1, so n_z\u00b2 = 1 - n_x\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n[ (1 - n_x\u00b2) -1 + n_x\u00b2 ] / n_x = [ (1 - n_x^2 -1 + n_x^2 ) ] / n_x = [0]/n_x =0.\n\nSo, the equation reduces to 0 =0, which is always true. So, this doesn't give any new information.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that equation 1 doesn't add any new constraints beyond equation 2, which gives a in terms of b.\n\nSo, the eigenvector can be written as [a, b]^T, where a = [b (n_z +1)] / n_x.\n\nBut since the eigenvector is determined up to a scalar multiple, we can set b = 1 for simplicity, then a = (n_z +1)/n_x.\n\nWait, but wait, if b=1, then a = (n_z +1)/n_x.\n\nSo, the vector is [ (n_z+1)/n_x, 1 ].\n\nBut we have to normalize it.\n\nSo, the norm squared is [ (n_z+1)^2 / n_x^2 ] + 1.\n\nWhich is [ (n_z+1)^2 + n_x^2 ] / n_x^2.\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\n(n_z +1)^2 + n_x^2 = n_z\u00b2 + 2 n_z +1 + n_x^2.\n\nBut n_x\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 =1, so this becomes 1 + 2 n_z +1 = 2 (1 + n_z).\n\nSo, the norm squared is 2(1 +n_z) / n_x\u00b2.\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ] multiplied by sqrt( n_x\u00b2 / [2(1 +n_z)] ) ), which is 1/sqrt( 2(1 +n_z) ) ) * [ (n_z+1), n_x ].\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write this in terms of \u03b8.\n\nSince n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, substituting,\n\na = [ (cos\u03b8 +1 ) / sin\u03b8 ] * b.\n\nLet me write the vector as [ (cos\u03b8 +1 ) / sin\u03b8 , 1 ].\n\nThe norm squared is [ (cos\u03b8 +1)^2 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) ] + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n= ( (cos\u03b8 +1)^2 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) / sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nExpanding numerator:\n\ncos\u00b2\u03b8 + 2 cos\u03b8 +1 + sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\n= (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8) + 2 cos\u03b8 +1\n\n= 1 + 2 cos\u03b8 +1 = 2(1 + cos\u03b8)\n\nSo, norm squared is 2(1+cos\u03b8) / sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWait, 2(1 + cos\u03b8) = 4 cos\u00b2(theta/2), because 1 + cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nAnd sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), so sin\u00b2theta =4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo, the norm squared becomes [4 cos\u00b2(theta/2)] / [4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2)] ) ] = [ cos\u00b2(theta/2) ] / [ sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2) ] ].\n\nWait, wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Let me compute the denominator.\n\nWait, 2(1 + cos\u03b8) / sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWait, 1 + cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).\n\nSo, sin\u00b2\u03b8 =4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n2*(2 cos\u00b2(theta/2)) ) / [4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2) ) ].\n\nWhich is 4 cos\u00b2(theta/2) / [4 sin\u00b2(theta/2) cos\u00b2(theta/2) ) ].\n\nThe 4 and cos\u00b2 cancel out, leaving 1/sin\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo, the norm is sqrt(1/sin\u00b2(theta/2)) ) = 1/|sin(theta/2)|.\n\nBut since theta is between 0 and \u03c0, sin(theta/2) is positive, so 1/sin(theta/2).\n\nSo, the normalized vector is [ (cos\u03b8 +1)/(sin\u03b8), 1 ] multiplied by sin(theta/2).\n\nWait, let's compute (cos\u03b8 +1)/(sin\u03b8) = [2 cos\u00b2(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ) ].\n\nWhich simplifies to [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] = cot(theta/2).\n\nSo, the components are:\n\na = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2).\n\nb = 1 * sin(theta/2).\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, but wait, let's check:\n\nThe vector before normalization is [a, b] = [ (cos\u03b8 +1)/sin\u03b8, 1 ].\n\nAfter normalization, each component is multiplied by sin(theta/2).\n\nSo,\n\na_normalized = [ (cos\u03b8 +1)/sin\u03b8 ] * sin(theta/2 )\n\n= [ 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) ) / ( 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ) ] * sin(theta/2 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n= [ cos\u00b2(theta/2) / ( sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ) ] * sin(theta/2 )\n\n= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] * sin(theta/2 )\n\n= cos(theta/2 )\n\nSimilarly, b_normalized = 1 * sin(theta/2 )\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].\n\nWait, but wait, in the initial substitution, we set b=1, but when we normalized, it's scaled by sin(theta/2). So, the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].\n\nLooking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).\n\nBut wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.\n\nBut wait, the options also have options with hbar. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))\n\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2))\n\nBut in our solution, the components are just cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), without any factors of hbar. So, perhaps I made a mistake in units.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the X-component, P_x, is (\u0127/2) times the matrix. So, the operator matrices have elements scaled by \u0127/2.\n\nBut when I found the eigenvector, I didn't include any factors of \u0127, because the eigenvectors are dimensionless. Because the operator is in units of \u0127/2, but the eigenvector is a vector in Hilbert space, so it's a dimensionless vector.\n\nWait, but the options have hbar in them. Hmm. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: (sqrt(2/3) \u0127, sqrt(1/3) \u0127 )\n\nOption B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )\n\nOption C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )\n\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) \u0127 sin(theta/2) )\n\nSo, the eigenvector I found is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C.\n\nBut why do some options have \u0127? Because the problem states that the eigenvector is for the operator P, which is given in terms of \u0127/2 times matrices. But the eigenvector is a vector in Hilbert space; the components don't carry units of \u0127. So, perhaps options with \u0127 are incorrect.\n\nWait, but the options are written as the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Wait, but the eigenvectors are normalized, so the sum of squares should be 1.\n\nLet me compute the sum of squares for option C: cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) =1. So, it's normalized.\n\nOption D: (sqrt(2/3) \u0127 cos(theta/2) )^2 + ( sqrt(1/3) \u0127 sin(theta/2) )^2 ) = (2/3 \u0127\u00b2)(cos^2) + (1/3 \u0127\u00b2)(sin^2) ) = \u0127\u00b2 [ (2/3 cos^2 + 1/3 sin^2 ) ]\n\nWhich is not 1 unless \u0127=1, which is not the case here. So, the vectors in option D are not normalized unless scaled properly.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is about the components of the eigenvector multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization step.\n\nWait, let me double-check the normalization. The initial vector I found is [ a, b ] = [ (cos\u03b8 +1)/ sin\u03b8 , 1 ].\n\nThen, I found that the norm is 1/sin(theta/2).\n\nSo, the normalized vector is [ (cos\u03b8+1)/ sin\u03b8 , 1 ] multiplied by sin(theta/2).\n\nWhich gives [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the problem asks for the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. The components I found are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is independent of the direction, which doesn't make sense. Wait, because the direction is arbitrary, the eigenvector should depend on theta.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the direction n is in x-z plane, so n = (n_x, 0, n_z) = (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), perhaps? Or is it (cos\u03b8, 0, sin\u03b8)? I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, no, the standard spherical coordinates have theta as the polar angle from the positive z-axis. So, the x component is sin(theta) cos(phi), and z is cos(theta).\n\nSo, for the direction in the x-z plane, phi=0, so x= sin(theta), z= cos(theta).\n\nWait, but when theta is 0, the direction is along +z. When theta is pi/2, direction is along +x.\n\nSo, n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).\n\nSo, in the previous steps, n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).\n\nSo, when I substitute into a = [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] * b.\n\nThat becomes [ (cos(theta) +1 ) / sin(theta) ] * b.\n\nSo, the vector is [ (cos(theta)+1)/ sin(theta) , 1 ] times some normalization factor.\n\nWait, let's compute that expression.\n\n( cos(theta) +1 ) / sin(theta ) = [ 2 cos\u00b2(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ].\n\nSo, a = cot(theta/2).\n\nSo, the vector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].\n\nSo, to normalize, compute the norm squared: cot\u00b2(theta/2) + 1 = csc\u00b2(theta/2).\n\nSo, the norm is csc(theta/2).\n\nSo, the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nWhich is option C.\n\nSo, the answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The operator $\\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $\\hbar/2$ times the respective Pauli matrices. The direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.\n\n### Step 1: Construct the operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$\nThe operator $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ is given by:\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z\n\\]\nSubstituting $n_x = \\sin\\theta$ and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$, and using the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the matrix representation of $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ becomes:\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation\nThe eigenvalue equation is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\right) \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nSubstituting the matrix for $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$, this becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nDividing through by $\\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\\\ n_x & -n_z \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis gives the system of equations:\n\\[\nn_z a + n_x b = a \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n_x a - n_z b = b\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for the eigenvector components\nFrom the second equation, $n_x a = b (n_z + 1)$, which can be rearranged to:\n\\[\na = \\frac{b (n_z + 1)}{n_x}\n\\]\nSubstituting $n_x = \\sin\\theta$ and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$, we get:\n\\[\na = \\frac{b (\\cos\\theta + 1)}{\\sin\\theta}\n\\]\nThe eigenvector can thus be written as:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = b \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\cos\\theta + 1}{\\sin\\theta} \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector\nThe norm of the eigenvector is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{\\cos\\theta + 1}{\\sin\\theta} \\right)^2 + 1}\n\\]\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\cos\\theta + 1}{\\sin\\theta} \\right)^2 + 1 = \\frac{(\\cos\\theta + 1)^2 + \\sin^2\\theta}{\\sin^2\\theta}\n\\]\nExpanding $(\\cos\\theta + 1)^2$ and using $\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta = 1$:\n\\[\n(\\cos\\theta + 1)^2 + \\sin^2\\theta = \\cos^2\\theta + 2\\cos\\theta + 1 + \\sin^2\\theta = 2(1 + \\cos\\theta)\n\\]\nThus, the norm becomes:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2(1 + \\cos\\theta)}{\\sin^2\\theta}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\cos^2(\\theta/2)}{4\\sin^2(\\theta/2)\\cos^2(\\theta/2)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\theta/2)}\n\\]\nThe normalized eigenvector is therefore:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\sin(\\theta/2) \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\cos\\theta + 1}{\\sin\\theta} \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nSimplifying further:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos\\theta + 1}{\\sin\\theta} = \\cot(\\theta/2)\n\\]\nSo, the normalized eigenvector becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the options\n- **Option A**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ \u2014 Incorrect, as the components do not depend on $\\theta$ and include unnecessary factors of $\\hbar$.\n- **Option B**: $(\\cos\\theta, e^{i\\phi}\\sin\\theta)$ \u2014 Incorrect, as the eigenvector components depend on $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$.\n- **Option C**: $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ \u2014 Correct, matches the derived normalized eigenvector.\n- **Option D**: $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin(\\theta/2))$ \u2014 Incorrect, as the components are scaled by unnecessary factors of $\\hbar$ and $\\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\\sqrt{1/3}$.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe normalized eigenvector is $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.\n\n**Answer: C**",
