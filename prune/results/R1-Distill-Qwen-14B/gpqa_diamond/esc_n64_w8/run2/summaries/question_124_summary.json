      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. So, particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types and they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, which means their Lorentz factor is high. The problem states that the average Lorentz factor is around 20. \n\nRight, Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). And since they're ultra-relativistic, v is very close to c, so gamma is much greater than 1. Got it.\n\nNow, the problem says that on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. Wait, so only 1/3 make it to the walls. I'm guessing this has to do with how far the particles travel before decaying. Because if they decay quickly, they might not reach the walls.\n\nThe detector's radius is 30 meters. So the distance from the center to the wall is 30 meters. The particles are starting from the center, so their maximum possible travel distance is 30 meters. If they decay before that, they won't reach the wall. So the fraction that reaches the wall depends on their lifetime and speed.\n\nWait, right. The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau). So the particles' lifetime is longer due to time dilation. The time they take to reach the wall is t = distance / speed. Since they're moving at speed v close to c, t \u2248 R/(c). \n\nSo the proper lifetime tau is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lab lifetime is gamma tau. So for a particle to reach the wall, the lab lifetime must be longer than the time it takes to reach the wall. \n\nThe probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)). Or wait, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-t/(gamma tau)). So the probability it reaches the wall is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no, the decay probability is P = 1 - e^(-t/(tau_lab)), since the mean lifetime is tau_lab = gamma tau. So the probability that a particle doesn't decay (reaches the wall) is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, but in the problem, when the Lorentz factor is ~20, the fraction reaching the walls is 1/3. So for gamma =20, the probability is 1/3. So e^(-t/(20 tau)) = 1/3.\n\nBut wait, t is the time it takes to reach the wall. Since they start from the center, the time t is R/(v). But since gamma is large, v is approximately c, so t \u2248 R/(c). R is 30 meters, c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So t \u2248 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds, which is 1e-7 s.\n\nSo for gamma=20, the probability is 1/3. So e^(- (1e-7) / (20 tau)) ) = 1/3.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\ne^(- t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3.\n\nTaking natural logs on both sides:\n\n- t/(gamma tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3).\n\nSo t/(gamma tau) = ln(3). \n\nWhich gives tau = t/(gamma ln(3)).\n\nBut wait, in the first scenario, gamma is 20, and the fraction reaching the walls is 1/3. So we can calculate tau based on that.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the same setup is being considered for a different gamma. The question is: what gamma is needed so that two-thirds of the particles reach the walls. So now the probability is 2/3. So e^(-t/(gamma tau)) = 2/3.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait the first case: when gamma is 20, the probability of reaching the wall is 1/3. So e^(-t/(20 tau)) = 1/3.\n\nIn the second case, we need e^(-t/(gamma_new tau)) = 2/3.\n\nSo let's set up the two equations.\n\nFirst equation: e^(- t/(20 tau)) = 1/3.\n\nSecond equation: e^(- t/(gamma tau)) = 2/3.\n\nWe can take the ratio of these equations.\n\nLet me write equation 1 as:\n\ne^(- t/(20 tau)) = 1/3.\n\nEquation 2:\n\ne^(- t/(gamma tau)) = 2/3.\n\nTake equation 2 divided by equation 1:\n\n[e^(- t/(gamma tau))] / [e^(- t/(20 tau))] ) = (2/3)/(1/3) = 2.\n\nWhich is:\n\ne^[ t/(20 tau) - t/(gamma tau) ] = 2.\n\nFactor out t/(tau):\n\ne^[ t/(tau) (1/20 - 1/gamma) ] = 2.\n\nTake natural log of both sides:\n\nt/(tau) (1/20 - 1/gamma) ) = ln(2).\n\nBut from equation 1, t/(20 tau) = ln(3), because equation 1 was e^(- t/(20 tau)) = 1/3 \u2192 -t/(20 tau) = ln(1/3) \u2192 t/(20 tau) = ln(3).\n\nSo, t/(tau) = 20 ln(3).\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n20 ln(3) (1/20 - 1/gamma) ) = ln(2).\n\nSimplify:\n\nln(3) (1/20 - 1/gamma) ) = ln(2)/20.\n\nMultiply both sides by 20:\n\nln(3) (1 - 20/gamma) ) = ln(2).\n\nSo,\n\n1 - 20/gamma = ln(2)/ln(3).\n\nCalculate ln(2) \u22480.6931, ln(3)\u22481.0986.\n\nSo ln(2)/ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 / 1.0986 \u22480.6309.\n\nSo,\n\n1 - 20/gamma = 0.6309 \u2192 20/gamma = 1 -0.6309 = 0.3691.\n\nSo gamma = 20 / 0.3691 \u2248 54.23.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me read it again.\n\nSo the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.\n\nNow, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.\n\nWait, okay, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). But I'm not sure how that relates to the particles reaching the detector walls.\n\nOh right! When particles move at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So, the time it takes for them to reach the detector's walls depends on their speed. If they're moving faster, the time they have before decaying might be longer, allowing them to reach the walls.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the Lorentz factor is about 20, one third reach the walls. We need to find the gamma when two-thirds reach. So maybe it's about the time they have before decaying. If a particle decays before reaching the wall, it doesn't contribute to the detection.\n\nSo, the decay length must be considered. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. For a particle with proper lifetime tau, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. So the average path length is c * gamma * tau.\n\nBut wait, the detector radius is 30 meters. So the particles need to travel at most 30 meters before decaying. If the decay length is longer than 30 meters, then the particles will reach the wall. If it's shorter, they decay before.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when gamma is 20, one third reach the walls. So that implies that the decay length is such that only a third make it. So, perhaps the decay length is equal to the radius for when gamma is 20? Or maybe it's a different relation.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's model this. Suppose that the particles are produced at the center of the detector. The maximum distance they can travel is 30 meters. If the decay length is L = c * gamma * tau, then the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that its decay happens after traveling 30 meters. So, the fraction that reach the wall would be the fraction of particles whose decay length is greater than 30 meters.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that a particle decays after time t is exp(-t/tau'), where tau' is the lifetime in the lab frame (gamma tau). So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nThe time it takes to reach the wall is t = R/(v), since R is the distance (30 m) and v is the velocity. For ultra-relativistic particles, v \u2248 c. So t \u2248 R/(c) = 30 / (3e8) seconds. Which is 1e-7 seconds. Wait, but maybe for precise calculation, v isn't exactly c. But since the problem states ultra-relativistic, v is approximately c. So we can approximate v \u2248 c.\n\nSo the time to reach the wall is t = R/(c) = 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds.\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo the fraction of particles reaching the wall is P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the walls. So P = 1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau)).\n\nWe can solve for t/(20 tau) = ln(3). Because exp(-x) = 1/3 \u2192 x = ln(3). So t/(20 tau) = ln(3).\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because when gamma is 20, the fraction is 1/3. So:\n\n1/3 = exp(- t/(20 tau)).\n\nTaking natural logs on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nln(3) = t/(20 tau).\n\nSo t = 20 tau ln(3).\n\nWait, but t is the time it takes to reach the wall, which is R/c. So,\n\nR/c = 20 tau ln(3).\n\nWait, but then if we want to find the gamma when the fraction is two-thirds (P=2/3), then:\n\n2/3 = exp(- t/(gamma tau)).\n\nTaking ln:\n\nln(2/3) = - t/(gamma tau).\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\nln(3/2) = t/(gamma tau).\n\nSo, t = gamma tau ln(3/2).\n\nBut wait, t is the same in both cases because the detector radius doesn't change. So,\n\nFrom the first case, t = R/c = 20 tau ln(3).\n\nFrom the second case, t = gamma tau ln(3/2).\n\nSo setting them equal:\n\n20 tau ln(3) = gamma tau ln(3/2).\n\nTau cancels out:\n\n20 ln(3) = gamma ln(3/2).\n\nSolve for gamma:\n\ngamma = [20 ln(3)] / [ln(3/2)].\n\nHmm, let me calculate that.\n\nCalculate ln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nln(3/2) = ln(1.5) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma \u2248 [20 * 1.0986 ] / 0.4055.\n\n20 *1.0986 is approximately 21.972.\n\nDivided by 0.4055: 21.972 / 0.4055 \u2248 let's see.\n\n21.972 / 0.4 is about 54.93. But since denominator is 0.4055, it's a bit less.\n\nLet me compute it accurately.\n\n0.4055 * 54 = 54 * 0.4 is 21.6, 54 * 0.0055 = 0.297, so 21.6 +0.297=21.897. Hmm, 54 would give 21.897. But we have 21.972. So 54 gives 21.897, which is a little less. So 54 * 0.4055=21.897. The numerator is 21.972. So difference is 21.972 -21.897=0.075. How much more is needed.\n\nEach 1 in gamma would add 0.4055. So 0.075 / 0.4055 \u2248 0.185.\n\nSo gamma \u224854.185. So approximately 54.2.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my equations. Because I'm a bit unsure about whether the time t is the same for both cases.\n\nWait, the time t is R/c, which is fixed. So in both cases, t is the same.\n\nWait, but in the first scenario, gamma is 20, and the fraction is 1/3. So:\n\nP = exp( - t/(gamma tau) ) = 1/3.\n\nIn the second scenario, same t, so:\n\nP = exp( - t/(gamma' tau) ) = 2/3.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau).\n\nln(2/3) = - t/(gamma' tau).\n\nDividing the two equations:\n\n[ln(2/3)] / [ln(1/3)] = [ - t/(gamma' tau) ] / [ - t/(20 tau) ) ].\n\nSimplify: [ln(2/3)/ln(1/3)] = (20)/(gamma').\n\nBecause the t and tau terms cancel out.\n\nSo,\n\nln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 -1.0986 = -0.4055.\n\nln(1/3)= -1.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n[ (-0.4055) ] / [ (-1.0986) ] = (20)/(gamma').\n\nSo,\n\n0.4055 / 1.0986 \u2248 0.369 \u2248 20 / gamma'.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' \u2248 20 / 0.369 \u2248 54.18.\n\nSo, about 54.18. So the closest option is A)54.\n\nWait, but wait. The question says that when gamma is ~20, one third reach the walls. So when gamma is higher, the fraction would be higher? Because with higher gamma, the particles live longer in the lab frame, so more would reach the walls.\n\nYes, because higher gamma means longer lifetime, so more particles would have time to reach the wall. So when gamma increases from 20 to 54, the fraction increases from 1/3 to 2/3. That makes sense.\n\nSo the correct answer should be around 54, which is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me read it again.\n\nSo the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.\n\nNow, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.\n\nWait, okay, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). But I'm not sure how that relates to the particles reaching the detector walls.\n\nOh right! When particles move at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So, the time it takes for them to reach the detector's walls depends on their speed. If they're moving faster, the time they have before decaying might be longer, allowing them to reach the walls.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the Lorentz factor is about 20, one third reach the walls. We need to find the gamma when two-thirds reach. So maybe it's about the time they have before decaying. If a particle decays before reaching the wall, it doesn't contribute to the detection.\n\nSo, the decay length must be considered. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. For a particle with proper lifetime tau, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. So the average path length is c * gamma * tau.\n\nBut wait, the detector radius is 30 meters. So the particles need to travel at most 30 meters before decaying. If the decay length is longer than 30 meters, then the particles will reach the wall. If it's shorter, they decay before.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when gamma is 20, one third reach the walls. So that implies that the decay length is such that only a third make it. So, perhaps the decay length is equal to the radius for when gamma is 20? Or maybe it's a different relation.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's model this. Suppose that the particles are produced at the center of the detector. The maximum distance they can travel is 30 meters. If the decay length is L = c * gamma * tau, then the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that its decay happens after traveling 30 meters. So, the fraction that reach the wall would be the fraction of particles whose decay length is greater than 30 meters.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that a particle decays after time t is exp(-t/tau'), where tau' is the lifetime in the lab frame (gamma tau). So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nThe time it takes to reach the wall is t = R/(v), since R is the distance (30 m) and v is the velocity. For ultra-relativistic particles, v \u2248 c. So t \u2248 R/(c) = 30 / (3e8) seconds. Which is 1e-7 seconds. Wait, but maybe for precise calculation, v isn't exactly c. But since the problem states ultra-relativistic, v is approximately c. So we can approximate v \u2248 c.\n\nSo the time to reach the wall is t = R/(c) = 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds.\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo the fraction of particles reaching the wall is P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the walls. So P = 1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau)).\n\nWe can solve for t/(20 tau) = ln(3). Because exp(-x) = 1/3 \u2192 x = ln(3). So t/(20 tau) = ln(3).\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because when gamma is 20, the fraction is 1/3. So:\n\n1/3 = exp(- t/(20 tau)).\n\nTaking natural logs on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nln(3) = t/(20 tau).\n\nSo t = 20 tau ln(3).\n\nWait, but t is the time it takes to reach the wall, which is R/c. So,\n\nR/c = 20 tau ln(3).\n\nWait, but then if we want to find the gamma when the fraction is two-thirds (P=2/3), then:\n\n2/3 = exp(- t/(gamma tau)).\n\nTaking ln:\n\nln(2/3) = - t/(gamma tau).\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\nln(3/2) = t/(gamma tau).\n\nSo, t = gamma tau ln(3/2).\n\nBut wait, t is the same in both cases because the detector radius doesn't change. So,\n\nFrom the first case, t = R/c = 20 tau ln(3).\n\nFrom the second case, t = gamma tau ln(3/2).\n\nSo setting them equal:\n\n20 tau ln(3) = gamma tau ln(3/2).\n\nTau cancels out:\n\n20 ln(3) = gamma ln(3/2).\n\nSolve for gamma:\n\ngamma = [20 ln(3)] / [ln(3/2)].\n\nHmm, let me calculate that.\n\nCalculate ln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nln(3/2) = ln(1.5) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma \u2248 [20 * 1.0986 ] / 0.4055.\n\n20 *1.0986 is approximately 21.972.\n\nDivided by 0.4055: 21.972 / 0.4055 \u2248 let's see.\n\n21.972 / 0.4 is about 54.93. But since denominator is 0.4055, it's a bit less.\n\nLet me compute it accurately.\n\n0.4055 * 54 = 54 * 0.4 is 21.6, 54 * 0.0055 = 0.297, so 21.6 +0.297=21.897. Hmm, 54 would give 21.897. But we have 21.972. So 54 gives 21.897, which is a little less. So 54 * 0.4055=21.897. The numerator is 21.972. So difference is 21.972 -21.897=0.075. How much more is needed.\n\nEach 1 in gamma would add 0.4055. So 0.075 / 0.4055 \u2248 0.185.\n\nSo gamma \u224854.185. So approximately 54.2.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my equations. Because I'm a bit unsure about whether the time t is the same for both cases.\n\nWait, the time t is R/c, which is fixed. So in both cases, t is the same.\n\nWait, but in the first scenario, gamma is 20, and the fraction is 1/3. So:\n\nP = exp( - t/(gamma tau) ) = 1/3.\n\nIn the second scenario, same t, so:\n\nP = exp( - t/(gamma' tau) ) = 2/3.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau).\n\nln(2/3) = - t/(gamma' tau).\n\nDividing the two equations:\n\n[ln(2/3)] / [ln(1/3)] = [ - t/(gamma' tau) ] / [ - t/(20 tau) ) ].\n\nSimplify: [ln(2/3)/ln(1/3)] = (20)/(gamma').\n\nBecause the t and tau terms cancel out.\n\nSo,\n\nln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 -1.0986 = -0.4055.\n\nln(1/3)= -1.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n[ (-0.4055) ] / [ (-1.0986) ] = (20)/(gamma').\n\nSo,\n\n0.4055 / 1.0986 \u2248 0.369 \u2248 20 / gamma'.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' \u2248 20 / 0.369 \u2248 54.18.\n\nSo, about 54.18. So the closest option is A)54.\n\nWait, but wait. The question says that when gamma is ~20, one third reach the walls. So when gamma is higher, the fraction would be higher? Because with higher gamma, the particles live longer in the lab frame, so more would reach the walls.\n\nYes, because higher gamma means longer lifetime, so more particles would have time to reach the wall. So when gamma increases from 20 to 54, the fraction increases from 1/3 to 2/3. That makes sense.\n\nSo the correct answer should be around 54, which is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the decay length, and the probability of reaching the walls.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Decay Length and Probability**:  \n   The decay length is given by \\( L = \\gamma \\tau c \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor, \\( \\tau \\) is the proper lifetime, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe question is about particles being collided in a detector. The setup is that these particles are produced and then travel at ultra-relativistic velocities. Their Lorentz factor is about 20 on average. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector, and the radius is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector walls.\n\nHmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor (gamma) is related to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. But how does that tie into particles reaching the detector walls?\n\nWait, particles are produced at the center of the detector. So they have to travel a certain distance to reach the walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters, so the distance from the center is 30 meters. \n\nI think the key here is the time it takes for the particles to reach the walls. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is important. Because if the particles decay before reaching the walls, they won't be detected.\n\nOh right! The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. But in the lab frame, due to time dilation, the lifetime is longer by gamma times tau. So the particles' lifetime in the lab is gamma * tau.\n\nBut how does that affect whether they reach the detector walls? Well, the particles have to travel the 30 meters before decaying. So the time they have is their lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma * tau.\n\nThe distance they travel is velocity * time. Let me think about the velocity. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So the distance D = velocity * time \u2248 c * gamma tau.\n\nWait, but wait. The velocity is related to gamma. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So maybe I can express the velocity in terms of gamma. Oh right, for ultra-relativistic speeds, gamma is approximately equal to energy over rest mass energy, and v is approximately c. But perhaps I can find a relation between gamma and the distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the proper time (tau) is the time the particle experiences. So the particle's lifetime is tau, and the lab sees it as gamma tau. The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by the velocity. So time t = D / v.\n\nBut since the particle decays after time t, for the particle to reach the wall without decaying, t must be less than or equal to tau, the proper lifetime. Wait, no. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. So the time t must be less than gamma tau. Wait, no. Because from the lab's perspective, the particle's lifetime is longer, so it can travel further. So if t is the time taken to reach the wall, the condition is t <= gamma tau. Because if the particle's lifetime in the lab is gamma tau, then it can only reach up to distance v * gamma tau. Wait, but the actual distance is 30 meters.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that the particle's lifetime is sufficient to reach the detector walls. So the time taken to reach the wall is D/(v) must be less than or equal to gamma tau. So D/(v) = gamma tau. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the frames. Let me think again.\n\nThe particle's lifetime in its own frame is tau. So in the lab frame, it's gamma tau. The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = D / v. So for the particle to reach the wall before decaying, t must be less than or equal to gamma tau. So D/(v) <= gamma tau.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that on average, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So I think that the average number of particles that reach the walls is proportional to the fraction where their lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the walls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the particles are moving at speed v, and in the lab frame, the distance they can travel before decaying is v multiplied by gamma tau. So the maximum distance they can go is v gamma tau. If the detector radius is 30 meters, then 30 meters must be equal to v gamma tau.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the condition is 30 meters = v gamma tau.\n\nBut the problem says that at gamma ~20, only one third of the particles reach the walls. Hmm. So in that case, perhaps the average distance they can travel is 30 meters when gamma is 20, but only one third reach the walls. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the particles have a certain proper lifetime tau, and in the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma tau. The time it takes for them to reach the walls is t = 30 m / (v). For them to reach the walls without decaying, t must be less than their lifetime in the lab frame. So 30 / v <= gamma tau.\n\nBut since gamma is a function of v, perhaps I can relate gamma and v.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the concept of the decay length. Decay length L is given by L = gamma v tau c, but I might be mixing units here.\n\nWait, let me think about the decay length formula. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. It's given by L = gamma * v * tau, where v is the particle's velocity, gamma is the Lorentz factor, and tau is the proper lifetime.\n\nSo if the decay length is equal to the detector radius (30 meters), then 30 = gamma * v * tau. But wait, in the first scenario, when gamma is 20, only one third of the particles reach the walls. So perhaps in that case, the decay length is three times the radius, so 90 meters. Because if the decay length is 90 meters, then on average, only one third of the particles would travel less than 30 meters, so they would be detected. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the opposite. If the decay length is L, then the probability that a particle decays before reaching a certain distance x is x/L. So if x is the detector radius (30 m), then the probability of decaying before x is x/(L). So the fraction that decay before reaching x is x/(L), and the fraction that reach the detector is 1 - x/(L).\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The decay length is the average distance before decay. So the probability that a particle has decayed by distance x is roughly x / L, assuming x << L. But when x is comparable to L, the approximation isn't as good.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the survival probability is exp(-x/L). Because the decay follows an exponential distribution. So the probability that a particle hasn't decayed after traveling x is exp(-x/(gamma v tau)).\n\nBut wait, in the given problem, when gamma is 20, the fraction reaching the walls is one third. So the survival probability is 1/3. So 1/3 = exp(-30/(gamma v tau)).\n\nBut wait, gamma is 20, so 1/3 = exp(-30/(20 v tau)).\n\nHmm, but I don't know the value of v or tau. Maybe I can relate v and gamma. Because for a given gamma, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). But since gamma is 20, which is large, v \u2248 c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps v \u2248 c for large gamma. So for gamma =20, v is very close to c, so v \u2248 c.\n\nSo, substituting v \u2248 c, then:\n\n1/3 = exp( -30/(20 * c * tau) )\n\nWait, but I don't know tau. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that for the initial case (gamma=20), the decay length is 30 meters times 3, because only one third reach the walls. So decay length L = 90 meters.\n\nBecause, if the decay length is 90 meters, then the average distance a particle travels is 90 m. So the probability that a particle travels less than 30 m is 30/90 = 1/3. Hence, the fraction that reach the walls (i.e., haven't decayed by 30 m) is 1 - (30/90) = 2/3. Wait, no, that can't be right because the survival probability is actually exp(-x/L), not x/L. So maybe that's a wrong approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using a linear approximation, assuming that the number of particles reaching the detector is proportional to (1 - x/L), where x is the distance to the wall. So if L is the decay length, then the fraction reaching is (1 - x/L). \n\nIn the first scenario, when gamma is 20, the fraction reaching is 1/3. So 1/3 = 1 - 30/(gamma * v tau). But if gamma is 20, and v \u2248 c, then 30/(20 * c tau) = 2/3, so 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. That fits.\n\nSo, in that case, the decay length L = gamma * v tau = 20 * c tau. And since 30 = L * (1/3), because 1/3 of the particles reach the wall. So L = 90 meters.\n\nSo L = gamma * v tau = 90 m.\n\nNow, when we want the fraction reaching the wall to be two-thirds, which is 2/3, that would mean 2/3 = 1 - (30/L_new). So 30/L_new = 1/3, so L_new = 90 meters. Wait, that can't be right because that would mean the same gamma as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Wait, the initial condition is that one third reach the walls, so two-thirds decay before reaching. So when gamma is 20, L = gamma * v tau = 90 meters. Because 30 meters is one third of 90.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the decay length is L, then the probability that a particle hasn't decayed beyond x is (1 - x/L) for small x compared to L. But when x is a significant fraction of L, this approximation isn't valid.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the survival probability as P = exp(-x/L), where L is the decay length. So in the initial case, when gamma is 20, L = gamma * v tau.\n\nAt gamma=20, the fraction that reach the walls is 1/3, so:\n\n1/3 = exp( -30/(gamma * v tau) )\n\nBut if gamma is 20, then 30/(20 v tau) = 30/(20 c tau) (since v \u2248 c). So,\n\n1/3 = exp( - (30)/(20 c tau) )\n\nTaking natural log on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - (30)/(20 c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n- ln(3) = - (30)/(20 c tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1,\n\nln(3) = 30/(20 c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n20 c tau = 30 / ln(3 )\n\nSo,\n\nc tau = (30)/(20 ln(3 )) = (3)/(2 ln(3 )) \n\nNow, when the Lorentz factor is gamma', we want the fraction reaching the walls to be 2/3.\n\nSo,\n\n2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma' * v' tau ) )\n\nBut v' is approximately c for large gamma', so:\n\n2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma' c tau ) )\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(gamma' c tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n- ln(2/3) = 30/(gamma' c tau )\n\nBut from earlier, we have c tau = 3/(2 ln(3)), so substitute:\n\n- ln(2/3) = 30/( gamma' * (3/(2 ln(3))) )\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\ngamma' * (3/(2 ln(3))) = (3 gamma')/(2 ln(3) )\n\nSo,\n\n- ln(2/3) = 30 * (2 ln(3)) )/(3 gamma' )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n30 * 2 =60, 60 ln(3) /3 =20 ln(3 )\n\nSo,\n\n- ln(2/3) = (20 ln(3 )) / gamma'\n\nMultiply both sides by gamma':\n\ngamma' * (- ln(2/3)) = 20 ln(3 )\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = [20 ln(3 ) ] / [ - ln(2/3) ]\n\nBut ln(2/3) is negative because 2/3 <1.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe question is about particles being collided in a detector. The setup is that these particles are produced and then travel at ultra-relativistic velocities. Their Lorentz factor is about 20 on average. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector, and the radius is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector walls.\n\nHmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor (gamma) is related to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. But how does that tie into particles reaching the detector walls?\n\nWait, particles are produced at the center of the detector. So they have to travel a certain distance to reach the walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters, so the distance from the center is 30 meters. \n\nI think the key here is the time it takes for the particles to reach the walls. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is important. Because if the particles decay before reaching the walls, they won't be detected.\n\nOh right! The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. But in the lab frame, due to time dilation, the lifetime is longer by gamma times tau. So the particles' lifetime in the lab is gamma * tau.\n\nBut how does that affect whether they reach the detector walls? Well, the particles have to travel the 30 meters before decaying. So the time they have is their lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma * tau.\n\nThe distance they travel is velocity * time. Let me think about the velocity. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So the distance D = velocity * time \u2248 c * gamma tau.\n\nWait, but wait. The velocity is related to gamma. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So maybe I can express the velocity in terms of gamma. Oh right, for ultra-relativistic speeds, gamma is approximately equal to energy over rest mass energy, and v is approximately c. But perhaps I can find a relation between gamma and the distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the proper time (tau) is the time the particle experiences. So the particle's lifetime is tau, and the lab sees it as gamma tau. The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by the velocity. So time t = D / v.\n\nBut since the particle decays after time t, for the particle to reach the wall without decaying, t must be less than or equal to tau, the proper lifetime. Wait, no. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. So the time t must be less than gamma tau. Wait, no. Because from the lab's perspective, the particle's lifetime is longer, so it can travel further. So if t is the time taken to reach the wall, the condition is t <= gamma tau. Because if the particle's lifetime in the lab is gamma tau, then it can only reach up to distance v * gamma tau. Wait, but the actual distance is 30 meters.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that the particle's lifetime is sufficient to reach the detector walls. So the time taken to reach the wall is D/(v) must be less than or equal to gamma tau. So D/(v) = gamma tau. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the frames. Let me think again.\n\nThe particle's lifetime in its own frame is tau. So in the lab frame, it's gamma tau. The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = D / v. So for the particle to reach the wall before decaying, t must be less than or equal to gamma tau. So D/(v) <= gamma tau.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that on average, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So I think that the average number of particles that reach the walls is proportional to the fraction where their lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the walls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the particles are moving at speed v, and in the lab frame, the distance they can travel before decaying is v multiplied by gamma tau. So the maximum distance they can go is v gamma tau. If the detector radius is 30 meters, then 30 meters must be equal to v gamma tau.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the condition is 30 meters = v gamma tau.\n\nBut the problem says that at gamma ~20, only one third of the particles reach the walls. Hmm. So in that case, perhaps the average distance they can travel is 30 meters when gamma is 20, but only one third reach the walls. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the particles have a certain proper lifetime tau, and in the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma tau. The time it takes for them to reach the walls is t = 30 m / (v). For them to reach the walls without decaying, t must be less than their lifetime in the lab frame. So 30 / v <= gamma tau.\n\nBut since gamma is a function of v, perhaps I can relate gamma and v.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the concept of the decay length. Decay length L is given by L = gamma v tau c, but I might be mixing units here.\n\nWait, let me think about the decay length formula. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. It's given by L = gamma * v * tau, where v is the particle's velocity, gamma is the Lorentz factor, and tau is the proper lifetime.\n\nSo if the decay length is equal to the detector radius (30 meters), then 30 = gamma * v * tau. But wait, in the first scenario, when gamma is 20, only one third of the particles reach the walls. So perhaps in that case, the decay length is three times the radius, so 90 meters. Because if the decay length is 90 meters, then on average, only one third of the particles would travel less than 30 meters, so they would be detected. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the opposite. If the decay length is L, then the probability that a particle decays before reaching a certain distance x is x/L. So if x is the detector radius (30 m), then the probability of decaying before x is x/(L). So the fraction that decay before reaching x is x/(L), and the fraction that reach the detector is 1 - x/(L).\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The decay length is the average distance before decay. So the probability that a particle has decayed by distance x is roughly x / L, assuming x << L. But when x is comparable to L, the approximation isn't as good.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the survival probability is exp(-x/L). Because the decay follows an exponential distribution. So the probability that a particle hasn't decayed after traveling x is exp(-x/(gamma v tau)).\n\nBut wait, in the given problem, when gamma is 20, the fraction reaching the walls is one third. So the survival probability is 1/3. So 1/3 = exp(-30/(gamma v tau)).\n\nBut wait, gamma is 20, so 1/3 = exp(-30/(20 v tau)).\n\nHmm, but I don't know the value of v or tau. Maybe I can relate v and gamma. Because for a given gamma, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). But since gamma is 20, which is large, v \u2248 c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps v \u2248 c for large gamma. So for gamma =20, v is very close to c, so v \u2248 c.\n\nSo, substituting v \u2248 c, then:\n\n1/3 = exp( -30/(20 * c * tau) )\n\nWait, but I don't know tau. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that for the initial case (gamma=20), the decay length is 30 meters times 3, because only one third reach the walls. So decay length L = 90 meters.\n\nBecause, if the decay length is 90 meters, then the average distance a particle travels is 90 m. So the probability that a particle travels less than 30 m is 30/90 = 1/3. Hence, the fraction that reach the walls (i.e., haven't decayed by 30 m) is 1 - (30/90) = 2/3. Wait, no, that can't be right because the survival probability is actually exp(-x/L), not x/L. So maybe that's a wrong approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using a linear approximation, assuming that the number of particles reaching the detector is proportional to (1 - x/L), where x is the distance to the wall. So if L is the decay length, then the fraction reaching is (1 - x/L). \n\nIn the first scenario, when gamma is 20, the fraction reaching is 1/3. So 1/3 = 1 - 30/(gamma * v tau). But if gamma is 20, and v \u2248 c, then 30/(20 * c tau) = 2/3, so 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. That fits.\n\nSo, in that case, the decay length L = gamma * v tau = 20 * c tau. And since 30 = L * (1/3), because 1/3 of the particles reach the wall. So L = 90 meters.\n\nSo L = gamma * v tau = 90 m.\n\nNow, when we want the fraction reaching the wall to be two-thirds, which is 2/3, that would mean 2/3 = 1 - (30/L_new). So 30/L_new = 1/3, so L_new = 90 meters. Wait, that can't be right because that would mean the same gamma as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Wait, the initial condition is that one third reach the walls, so two-thirds decay before reaching. So when gamma is 20, L = gamma * v tau = 90 meters. Because 30 meters is one third of 90.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the decay length is L, then the probability that a particle hasn't decayed beyond x is (1 - x/L) for small x compared to L. But when x is a significant fraction of L, this approximation isn't valid.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the survival probability as P = exp(-x/L), where L is the decay length. So in the initial case, when gamma is 20, L = gamma * v tau.\n\nAt gamma=20, the fraction that reach the walls is 1/3, so:\n\n1/3 = exp( -30/(gamma * v tau) )\n\nBut if gamma is 20, then 30/(20 v tau) = 30/(20 c tau) (since v \u2248 c). So,\n\n1/3 = exp( - (30)/(20 c tau) )\n\nTaking natural log on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = - (30)/(20 c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n- ln(3) = - (30)/(20 c tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1,\n\nln(3) = 30/(20 c tau )\n\nSo,\n\n20 c tau = 30 / ln(3 )\n\nSo,\n\nc tau = (30)/(20 ln(3 )) = (3)/(2 ln(3 )) \n\nNow, when the Lorentz factor is gamma', we want the fraction reaching the walls to be 2/3.\n\nSo,\n\n2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma' * v' tau ) )\n\nBut v' is approximately c for large gamma', so:\n\n2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma' c tau ) )\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(gamma' c tau )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n- ln(2/3) = 30/(gamma' c tau )\n\nBut from earlier, we have c tau = 3/(2 ln(3)), so substitute:\n\n- ln(2/3) = 30/( gamma' * (3/(2 ln(3))) )\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\ngamma' * (3/(2 ln(3))) = (3 gamma')/(2 ln(3) )\n\nSo,\n\n- ln(2/3) = 30 * (2 ln(3)) )/(3 gamma' )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n30 * 2 =60, 60 ln(3) /3 =20 ln(3 )\n\nSo,\n\n- ln(2/3) = (20 ln(3 )) / gamma'\n\nMultiply both sides by gamma':\n\ngamma' * (- ln(2/3)) = 20 ln(3 )\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = [20 ln(3 ) ] / [ - ln(2/3) ]\n\nBut ln(2/3) is negative because 2/3 <1. So,\n\ngamma' = [20 ln(3 ) ] / [ | ln(2/3) | ]\n\nCompute the denominator:\n\nln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 - 1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055\n\nSo |ln(2/3)| = 0.4055.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n20 * ln(3) \u224820 * 1.0986 \u224821.972.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' \u2248 21.972 / 0.4055 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n21.972 / 0.4055 \u2248 about 54.15.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54. So the Lorentz factor needed is approximately 54.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps. Did I mix up anything?\n\nWait, in the first part, when gamma is 20, the fraction reaching is 1/3. So:\n\n1/3 = exp( -30/(20 c tau) )\n\nWhich gives:\n\n30/(20 c tau) = ln(3)\n\nSo,\n\nc tau = 30/(20 ln(3 )) = 3/(2 ln(3)).\n\nIn the second case, 2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma' c tau) )\n\nSo,\n\n30/(gamma' c tau) = ln(3/2)\n\nBecause ln(2/3) is negative, so the equation becomes:\n\n- ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) = 30/(gamma' c tau )\n\nWait, wait. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, when I take the natural log of 2/3, it's ln(2/3) = negative number.\n\nSo, 2/3 = exp( -x ), where x is 30/(gamma' c tau )\n\nSo,\n\nln(2/3) = -x \u2192 x = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2)\n\nSo,\n\n30/(gamma' c tau ) = ln(3/2)\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' c tau = 30 / ln(3/2 )\n\nBut we know that c tau = 3/(2 ln(3 )) from earlier.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' * (3/(2 ln(3 )) ) = 30 / ln(3/2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by (2 ln(3 )) /3:\n\ngamma' = [30 / ln(3/2 ) ] * [ 2 ln(3 ) /3 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\ngamma' = (30 * 2 ln(3 )) / (3 ln(3/2 )) )\n\n30 *2 =60, 60/3=20.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = 20 ln(3 ) / ln(3/2 )\n\nCompute this:\n\nln(3) \u22481.0986,\n\nln(3/2)= ln(1.5)\u22480.4055.\n\nSo,\n\n20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 \u2248 (21.972) / 0.4055 \u224854.15.\n\nSo the gamma' is approximately 54.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and a detector. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about Lorentz factors and how particles reach the detector walls. \n\nAlright, so the setup: particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly. They travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds reach the walls.\n\nWait, so the initial situation is that with a Lorentz factor (gamma) of 20, one third of the particles make it to the inner walls. We need to find the gamma that would make two-thirds reach the walls.\n\nHmm, I remember that Lorentz factor relates to time dilation and length contraction. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame would be gamma times their proper lifetime. So, the lifetime of the particle is longer in the lab frame, which allows them to travel further before decaying.\n\nThe detector's radius is 30 meters, so the maximum distance a particle can travel before hitting the wall is 30 meters. So, the particles that reach the wall must have a lifetime (from the lab frame) such that they can travel 30 meters at their speed.\n\nWait, but the particles are moving from the center, so the distance to the wall is 30 meters. So, the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is distance divided by speed. Since the speed is close to c (since they're ultra-relativistic), we can approximate it as c.\n\nSo, the time to reach the wall, t_wall, is 30 meters / (speed). But since the speed is roughly c, t_wall \u2248 30 / (3e8 m/s) \u2248 1e-7 seconds or something like that.\n\nBut wait, the proper lifetime of the particle is tau. The lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. So, for the particle to reach the wall, gamma * tau must be greater than t_wall. Otherwise, the particle decays before reaching the wall.\n\nSo, the probability that a particle reaches the wall depends on whether gamma * tau > t_wall. But in this case, the problem states that on average one third reach the walls. So, maybe it's about the ratio of particles that have gamma tau exceeding t_wall. But wait, the problem says \"on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls.\" Hmm, perhaps the decay follows an exponential distribution based on the proper lifetime.\n\nWait, maybe it's a matter of the decay length. The average distance a particle travels before decaying is c * gamma * tau. So, if the average decay length is longer than 30 meters, more particles would reach the wall. So, the fraction that reaches the wall would be the probability that the decay length is greater than 30 meters.\n\nWait, the decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So, the probability that a particle's decay length is greater than 30 meters would be e^(-30/(c gamma tau)). Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula here.\n\nLet me think again. The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle decays after traveling distance x is P(x) = e^(-x/(c gamma tau)). So, the fraction that reaches the wall (x=30 m) is P(30) = e^(-30/(c gamma tau)).\n\nIn the initial scenario, gamma is 20, and the fraction reaching the wall is 1/3. So, 1/3 = e^(-30/(c * 20 * tau)).\n\nWe can solve for the term 30/(c * 20 * tau) = ln(1/(1/3)) = ln(3) \u2248 1.0986.\n\nSo, 30/(20 * c * tau) = 1.0986 / 1 \u2248 1.0986.\n\nWait, maybe I should rearrange this. Let me denote L as the decay length, which is c * gamma * tau. The average decay length is L = c gamma tau. The probability that the decay occurs after distance x is e^(-x/L). So, the fraction that reaches the wall is e^(-x/L).\n\nIn the initial case, x=30 m, gamma=20, and fraction is 1/3. So,\n\n1/3 = e^(-30/(c * 20 * tau)).\n\nTaking natural logs,\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 * tau).\n\nln(1/3) is about -1.0986, so:\n\n-1.0986 = -30/(c * 20 * tau).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1,\n\n1.0986 = 30/(c * 20 * tau).\n\nSo,\n\nc * 20 * tau = 30 / 1.0986 \u2248 27.3 meters.\n\nSo, c * gamma * tau = 27.3 m when gamma is 20.\n\nBut wait, what's gamma for the other case? Let's say we need the fraction reaching the wall to be two-thirds, 2/3.\n\nSo,\n\n2/3 = e^(-30/(c gamma' tau)).\n\nTake natural log,\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(c gamma' tau).\n\nln(2/3) is approximately -0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\n-0.4055 = -30/(c gamma' tau).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1,\n\n0.4055 = 30/(c gamma' tau).\n\nSo,\n\nc gamma' tau = 30 / 0.4055 \u2248 74.04 meters.\n\nBut wait, earlier we found that when gamma is 20, c gamma tau is 27.3 m. Wait, that doesn't make sense because in the initial case, with gamma=20, the decay length is 27.3 m, so the average distance they travel is 27.3 m. But the detector is 30 m radius, so on average, they wouldn't reach the wall. Hmm, but the problem says one third reach the wall. Wait, so the decay length is 27.3 m, but the wall is at 30 m. So, 30 m is a bit further than the average decay length, which explains why only a third reach the wall.\n\nNow, when we increase gamma, the decay length increases, so the average distance they travel is longer. So, to get two-thirds reaching the wall, the decay length needs to be longer than 30 m, so that the probability of traveling 30 m is higher.\n\nWait, let's think again. The decay length is c gamma tau. So, when gamma increases, the decay length increases, meaning the particles live longer and can travel further.\n\nSo, in the initial case, decay length L1 = c * 20 * tau =27.3 m.\n\nWe need to find gamma' such that the decay length L2 = c * gamma' * tau, and the probability of traveling 30 m is 2/3.\n\nSo, the probability is e^(-30 / L2) = 2/3.\n\nTaking ln,\n\n-30/L2 = ln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\n30/L2 = 0.4055 \u2192 L2 =30 / 0.4055 \u224874.04 m.\n\nSo, L2 = c gamma' tau =74.04 m.\n\nBut since L1 = c gamma tau =27.3 m,\n\ngamma' tau = L2 /c =74.04 m /c,\n\ngamma tau =27.3 m /c.\n\nSo, gamma' = (74.04 m) / (27.3 m) * gamma.\n\nBecause gamma' tau = (74.04/27.3) (gamma tau).\n\nSo,\n\ngamma' = (74.04 /27.3) * 20 \u2248 (2.712) *20 \u224854.24.\n\nSo, the Lorentz factor needed is approximately 54.24, which is close to option A) 54.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCompute 74.04 / 27.3:\n\n27.3 * 2 =54.6; 74.04-54.6=19.44.\n\nSo 2.7 (because 27.3 * 0.7=19.11, which is close to 19.44).\n\nWait, 27.3 *2.7= 27.3*(2 +0.7)=54.6 +19.11=73.71. Close to 74.04, so 2.71.\n\nSo, 2.71 *20=54.2.\n\nSo, gamma' is approximately 54.2, which is option A) 54.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the fraction is inverted. Because when the decay length is longer than the detector radius, more particles reach the wall. So, perhaps I should compute the ratio correctly.\n\nWait, the initial condition: when gamma is 20, the fraction reaching the wall is 1/3. So, 1/3 = e^(-30/(c gamma tau)).\n\nWe found that c gamma tau = 27.3 m.\n\nSo, when gamma increases to gamma', c gamma' tau = 74.04 m.\n\nSo, gamma' = (74.04 /27.3) *20 \u224854.2.\n\nWhich is option A)54.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and a detector. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about Lorentz factors and how particles reach the detector walls. \n\nAlright, so the setup: particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly. They travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds reach the walls.\n\nWait, so the initial situation is that with a Lorentz factor (gamma) of 20, one third of the particles make it to the inner walls. We need to find the gamma that would make two-thirds reach the walls.\n\nHmm, I remember that Lorentz factor relates to time dilation and length contraction. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame would be gamma times their proper lifetime. So, the lifetime of the particle is longer in the lab frame, which allows them to travel further before decaying.\n\nThe detector's radius is 30 meters, so the maximum distance a particle can travel before hitting the wall is 30 meters.

Since the speed is close to c (since they're ultra-relativistic), we can approximate it as c.\n\nSo, the time to reach the wall, t_wall, is 30 meters / (speed). But since the speed is roughly c, t_wall \u2248 30 / (3e8 m/s) \u2248 1e-7 seconds or something like that.\n\nBut wait, the proper lifetime of the particle is tau.

The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle decays after traveling distance x is P(x) = e^(-x/(c gamma tau)). So, the fraction that reaches the wall (x=30 m) is P(30) = e^(-30/(c gamma tau)).\n\nIn the initial scenario, gamma is 20, and the fraction reaching the wall is 1/3.

Let me denote L as the decay length, which is c * gamma * tau. The average decay length is L = c gamma tau. The probability that the decay occurs after distance x is e^(-x/L).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because in the initial case, with gamma=20, the decay length is 27.3 m, so the average distance they travel is 27.3 m. But the detector is 30 m radius, so on average, they wouldn't reach the wall. Hmm, but the problem says one third reach the wall. Wait, so the decay length is 27.3 m, but the wall is at 30 m. So, 30 m is a bit further than the average decay length, which explains why only a third reach the wall.\n\nNow, when we increase gamma, the decay length increases, so the average distance they travel is longer.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly, but they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.\n\nHmm. So the main thing here is probably figuring out how the Lorentz factor affects the distance a particle travels before decaying. Because if a higher Lorentz factor allows the particle to travel farther, then more of them would reach the detector walls.\n\nWait, so the initial scenario is that with a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third reach the walls. We want to find a higher Lorentz factor (since we want more particles to reach the walls\u2014two-thirds instead of one third) so that more of them make it. So the distance each particle can travel before decaying must be longer.\n\nI remember that the proper lifetime (tau) of a particle is the average lifetime in its rest frame. The observed lifetime from our frame (lab frame) is gamma times tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So the lifetime increases with gamma.\n\nThe distance a particle travels before decaying is the product of its velocity and the time it lives. Since it's ultra-relativistic, we can approximate the velocity as the speed of light, c. So the distance L is approximately gamma * c * tau. But wait, actually, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the distance is v * (gamma tau). Since v is approximately c, that becomes gamma c tau.\n\nSo the maximum distance the particle can travel is L = gamma * c * tau.\n\nIn the given problem, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the detector walls. That suggests that the average distance they travel is about the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. Wait, no, not necessarily the average. Because it's a decay process, the probability of reaching a certain distance depends on the exponential decay law.\n\nWait, right. The number of particles that reach a distance L is given by N = N0 * exp(-L/(gamma c tau)). Because the decay follows an exponential law. So the probability P that a particle reaches a distance L is exp(-L/(gamma c tau)).\n\nSo in the initial case, when gamma is 20, one third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector walls, which are at L=30 meters. So the probability is 1/3.\n\nSo, 1/3 = exp(-30/(20 c tau)).\n\nWait, but I don't know the actual value of c tau. Hmm. Let me think. Let's denote c tau as a constant. Let me call it beta, just for notation. So beta = c tau.\n\nSo the initial equation is:\n\n1/3 = exp(-30/(20 beta)).\n\nTaking natural logs on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(20 beta)\n\nln(1/3) is negative, so:\n\nln(1/3) = - (30)/(20 beta)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nln(3) = 30/(20 beta)\n\nSo 20 beta = 30 / ln(3)\n\nWait, let me compute ln(3). ln(3) is approximately 1.0986.\n\nSo 20 beta = 30 / 1.0986 \u2248 30 / 1.0986 \u2248 let's calculate that. 30 divided by 1.1 is about 27.27, but more accurately, 30 \u00f7 1.0986 is about 27.3.\n\nSo 20 beta \u2248 27.3 \u2192 beta \u2248 27.3 /20 \u2248 1.365.\n\nBut beta is c tau. So c tau \u2248 1.365 meters.\n\nWait, that seems small. Because c is about 3e8 m/s, and tau would be around 1.365 / (3e8) seconds, which is roughly 4.55e-9 seconds.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly, but they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.\n\nHmm. So the main thing here is probably figuring out how the Lorentz factor affects the distance a particle travels before decaying. Because if a higher Lorentz factor allows the particle to travel farther, then more of them would reach the detector walls.\n\nWait, so the initial scenario is that with a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third reach the walls. We want to find a higher Lorentz factor (since we want more particles to reach the walls\u2014two-thirds instead of one third) so that more of them make it. So the distance each particle can travel before decaying must be longer.\n\nI remember that the proper lifetime (tau) of a particle is the average lifetime in its rest frame. The observed lifetime from our frame (lab frame) is gamma times tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So the lifetime increases with gamma.\n\nThe distance a particle travels before decaying is the product of its velocity and the time it lives. Since it's ultra-relativistic, we can approximate the velocity as the speed of light, c. So the distance L is approximately gamma * c * tau. But wait, actually, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the distance is v * (gamma tau). Since v is approximately c, that becomes gamma c tau.\n\nSo the maximum distance the particle can travel is L = gamma * c * tau.\n\nIn the given problem, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the detector walls. That suggests that the average distance they travel is about the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. Wait, no, not necessarily the average. Because it's a decay process, the probability of reaching a certain distance depends on the exponential decay law.\n\nWait, right. The number of particles that reach a distance L is given by N = N0 * exp(-L/(gamma c tau)). Because the decay follows an exponential law. So the probability P that a particle reaches a distance L is exp(-L/(gamma c tau)).\n\nSo in the initial case, when gamma is 20, one third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector walls, which are at L=30 meters. So the probability is 1/3.\n\nSo, 1/3 = exp(-30/(20 c tau)).\n\nWait, but I don't know the actual value of c tau. Hmm. Let me think. Let's denote c tau as a constant. Let me call it beta, just for notation. So beta = c tau.\n\nSo the initial equation is:\n\n1/3 = exp(-30/(20 beta)).\n\nTaking natural logs on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(20 beta)\n\nln(1/3) is negative, so:\n\nln(1/3) = - (30)/(20 beta)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nln(3) = 30/(20 beta)\n\nSo 20 beta = 30 / ln(3)\n\nWait, let me compute ln(3). ln(3) is approximately 1.0986.\n\nSo 20 beta = 30 / 1.0986 \u2248 30 / 1.0986 \u2248 let's calculate that. 30 divided by 1.1 is about 27.27, but more accurately, 30 \u00f7 1.0986 is about 27.3.\n\nSo 20 beta \u2248 27.3 \u2192 beta \u2248 27.3 /20 \u2248 1.365.\n\nBut beta is c tau. So c tau \u2248 1.365 meters.\n\nWait, that seems small. Because c is about 3e8 m/s, and tau would be around 1.365 / (3e8) seconds, which is roughly 4.55e-9 seconds. Seems plausible for a fast-decaying particle.\n\nNow, the question is asking for a Lorentz factor gamma such that two-thirds (2/3) of the particles reach the detector walls. So the probability P is now 2/3.\n\nSo, 2/3 = exp(-30/(gamma beta)).\n\nTake ln on both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(gamma beta)\n\nAgain, ln(2/3) is negative, so:\n\nln(2/3) = - (30)/(gamma beta)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n- ln(2/3) = 30/(gamma beta)\n\nBut wait, ln(2/3) is ln(2) - ln(3), which is approximately 0.6931 - 1.0986 = -0.4055. So -ln(2/3) is 0.4055.\n\nSo 0.4055 = 30/(gamma beta)\n\nWe know from earlier that beta \u22481.365, so substituting:\n\n0.4055 = 30/(gamma * 1.365 )\n\nMultiply both sides by gamma * 1.365:\n\n0.4055 * gamma * 1.365 = 30\n\nSo gamma = 30 / (0.4055 * 1.365 )\n\nCompute denominator: 0.4055 *1.365 \u2248 let's compute 0.4 *1.365=0.546, 0.0055 *1.365\u22480.0075.

Let's read the question again.\n\nSo, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead of one third.\n\nHmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their gamma values are significant. But how does this connect to how many reach the detector walls?\n\nWait, maybe it's about the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls. If the particles are moving fast, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame would be longer due to time dilation. So, the particles would have a longer time to travel before decaying.\n\nOh, right! The proper lifetime (proper time) of the particle is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma. So, the time they have to reach the detector's walls is t = gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.\n\nNow, the particles are moving from the center of the sphere to the wall. The distance they need to cover is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. The speed is close to the speed of light, but since we're given the Lorentz factor, maybe we can use v \u2248 c for simplicity. Wait, but actually, the velocity can be expressed in terms of gamma. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Hmm, but maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can approximate v as c. Because at ultra-relativistic speeds, v is very close to c.\n\nSo, if v \u2248 c, then the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = distance / speed = R / c. So, R is 30 meters, c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So t \u2248 30 / 3e8 = 1e-7 seconds. But wait, that's just the time for the particle to reach the wall. If the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau, then the probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall is based on whether t is less than the mean lifetime.\n\nWait, I think the probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall is given by the exponential decay formula. The decay probability is P = 1 - exp(-t/(tau_lab)), where tau_lab is the mean lifetime in the lab frame. But tau_lab is gamma * tau_rest, where tau_rest is the proper lifetime.\n\nWait, actually, the number of particles that decay before reaching the wall is proportional to (1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)) ). So, the fraction that reach the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab is gamma tau_rest. So, the fraction that reach the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nIn the initial scenario, gamma is 20, and one third of the particles reach the wall. So, 1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau)).\n\nWe need to find a new gamma such that two-thirds reach the wall. So, 2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma_new tau)).\n\nBut wait, t is the same in both cases, right? Because the distance and speed are the same. So t is fixed. Let me compute t in terms of R and c.\n\nt = R/(v). Since v = beta c, so t = R/(beta c). But beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). Hmm, perhaps it's better to express beta in terms of gamma.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should express t in terms of gamma and tau. Let's see. We have t = (R)/(beta c) = (R c)/(beta c^2) )= R/(beta c). But beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Therefore, t = R / (c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2)) )\n\nWait, perhaps that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can find a relation between the two scenarios.\n\nLet me denote the original gamma as gamma1 =20, and the new gamma as gamma2 (which we need to find). The fraction reaching the wall is F = exp(-t/(gamma tau)). \n\nIn the first case, F1 = 1/3 = exp(-t/(gamma1 tau)). In the second case, F2 = 2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma2 tau)).\n\nWe can take the ratio of F2 to F1.\n\nF2/F1 = (2/3)/(1/3) )= 2 = exp( [ -t/(gamma2 tau) + t/(gamma1 tau) ] )\n\nSo, ln(2) = [ t/(gamma1 tau) - t/(gamma2 tau) ] \n\n= t/(tau) [1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2 ]\n\nBut t is R/(v), which is R/(beta c). So, t = R/(beta c) = R/(sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) c )\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express t in terms of gamma. Since for each gamma, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2), so t = R/( c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) )\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can find t in terms of gamma and tau.\n\nWait, in the first scenario, t is fixed because the detector's radius is fixed. So, for gamma1, the time taken is t = R/(beta1 c) = R/( (v1/c) c ) )= R/(v1). \n\nBut v1 = beta1 c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1\u00b2) c. So, t = R/( sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1\u00b2) c ) * c = R/( sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1\u00b2) ) / c? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by expressing t in terms of gamma1. Let's see.\n\nt = R/(v) = R/(beta c) = R/( sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2) c )\n\nBut gamma1 is 20, so beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/(20)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/400) = sqrt(399/400) = sqrt(399)/20 \u2248 19.975/20 \u2248 0.99875. So v1 \u2248 0.99875 c.\n\nSo, t \u2248 30 m / (0.99875 * 3e8 m/s) \u2248 30/(3e8) * (1/0.99875) \u2248 1e-7 seconds * 1.000 something.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read the question again.\n\nSo, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead of one third.\n\nHmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their gamma values are significant. But how does this connect to how many reach the detector walls?\n\nWait, maybe it's about the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls. If the particles are moving fast, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame would be longer due to time dilation. So, the particles would have a longer time to travel before decaying.\n\nOh, right! The proper lifetime (proper time) of the particle is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma. So, the time they have to reach the detector's walls is t = gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.\n\nNow, the particles are moving from the center of the sphere to the wall. The distance they need to cover is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. The speed is close to the speed of light, but since we're given the Lorentz factor, maybe we can use v \u2248 c for simplicity. Wait, but actually, the velocity can be expressed in terms of gamma. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Hmm, but maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can approximate v as c. Because at ultra-relativistic speeds, v is very close to c.\n\nSo, if v \u2248 c, then the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = distance / speed = R / c. So, R is 30 meters, c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So t \u2248 30 / 3e8 = 1e-7 seconds. But wait, that's just the time for the particle to reach the wall. If the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau, then the probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall is based on whether t is less than the mean lifetime.\n\nWait, I think the probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall is given by the exponential decay formula. The decay probability is P = 1 - exp(-t/(tau_lab)), where tau_lab is the mean lifetime in the lab frame. But tau_lab is gamma * tau_rest, where tau_rest is the proper lifetime.\n\nWait, actually, the number of particles that decay before reaching the wall is proportional to (1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)) ). So, the fraction that reach the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab is gamma tau_rest. So, the fraction that reach the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nIn the initial scenario, gamma is 20, and one third of the particles reach the wall. So, 1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau)).\n\nWe need to find a new gamma such that two-thirds reach the wall. So, 2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma_new tau)).\n\nBut wait, t is the same in both cases, right? Because the distance and speed are the same. So t is fixed. Let me compute t in terms of R and c.\n\nt = R/(v). Since v = beta c, so t = R/(beta c). But beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). Hmm, perhaps it's better to express beta in terms of gamma.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should express t in terms of gamma and tau. Let's see. We have t = (R)/(beta c) = (R c)/(beta c^2) )= R/(beta c). But beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Therefore, t = R / (c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2)) )\n\nWait, perhaps that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can find a relation between the two scenarios.\n\nLet me denote the original gamma as gamma1 =20, and the new gamma as gamma2 (which we need to find). The fraction reaching the wall is F = exp(-t/(gamma tau)). \n\nIn the first case, F1 = 1/3 = exp(-t/(gamma1 tau)). In the second case, F2 = 2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma2 tau)).\n\nWe can take the ratio of F2 to F1.\n\nF2/F1 = (2/3)/(1/3) )= 2 = exp( [ -t/(gamma2 tau) + t/(gamma1 tau) ] )\n\nSo, ln(2) = [ t/(gamma1 tau) - t/(gamma2 tau) ] \n\n= t/(tau) [1/gamma1 - 1/gamma2 ]\n\nBut t is R/(v), which is R/(beta c). So, t = R/(beta c) = R/(sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) c )\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express t in terms of gamma. Since for each gamma, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2), so t = R/( c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) )\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can find t in terms of gamma and tau.\n\nWait, in the first scenario, t is fixed because the detector's radius is fixed. So, for gamma1, the time taken is t = R/(beta1 c) = R/( (v1/c) c ) )= R/(v1). \n\nBut v1 = beta1 c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1\u00b2) c. So, t = R/( sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1\u00b2) c ) * c = R/( sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1\u00b2) ) / c? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by expressing t in terms of gamma1. Let's see.\n\nt = R/(v) = R/(beta c) = R/( sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2) c )\n\nBut gamma1 is 20, so beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/(20)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/400) = sqrt(399/400) = sqrt(399)/20 \u2248 19.975/20 \u2248 0.99875. So v1 \u2248 0.99875 c.\n\nSo, t \u2248 30 m / (0.99875 * 3e8 m/s) \u2248 30/(3e8) * (1/0.99875) \u2248 1e-7 seconds * 1.000 something. So approximately 1e-7 seconds.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute t exactly using gamma1.\n\nWait, in the first scenario, F1 = exp( -t/(gamma1 tau) ) = 1/3.\n\nSo, ln(1/3) = - t/(gamma1 tau) \u2192 t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(3) \u2192 t = gamma1 tau ln(3).\n\nIn the second scenario, F2 = exp( -t/(gamma2 tau) ) = 2/3.\n\nSo, ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma2 tau ) \u2192 t/(gamma2 tau ) = ln(3/2 )\n\nSo, from the first equation, t = gamma1 tau ln(3).\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\n(gamma1 tau ln(3)) / (gamma2 tau ) ) = ln(3/2 )\n\nThe tau cancels out, so:\n\ngamma1 ln(3) / gamma2 = ln(3/2 )\n\nSo, gamma2 = gamma1 ln(3) / ln(3/2 )\n\nCompute ln(3) \u2248 1.0986, ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nSo gamma2 \u2248 (20 * 1.0986 ) / 0.4055 \u2248 (21.972) / 0.4055 \u2248 approximately 54.15.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.\n\nWait, let me compute this more precisely.\n\nCompute ln(3) \u2248 1.098612289.\n\nln(3/2) is ln(1.5) \u2248 0.4054651081.\n\nSo, gamma2 = 20 * (1.098612289) / 0.4054651081\n\nCompute numerator: 20 * 1.098612289 \u2248 21.97224578.\n\nDivide by 0.4054651081: 21.97224578 / 0.4054651081 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n0.4054651081 is about 0.4055.\n\n21.97224578 / 0.4055 \u2248 54.16.\n\nSo approximately 54.16, which rounds to 54.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and detectors. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nSo the problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and move at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the walls?\n\nWait, I remember that the Lorentz factor is gamma, which is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). And since these are ultra-relativistic, v is very close to c. So gamma is much larger than 1.\n\nBut how does the Lorentz factor relate to the particles reaching the detector walls? Oh right, time dilation and length contraction come into play here. Because from the lab frame (the detector's frame), the particles are moving very fast, but their lifetime is affected by time dilation. So the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is multiplied by gamma to get the lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nSo the particles are created at the center, so the maximum distance they can travel is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. The time they have to reach the wall is the time it takes for the particle to move from the center to the wall, which is 30 meters divided by their speed.\n\nWait, but since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their speed is approximately c. So the time t is approximately 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds? Wait, let me compute that: 3e8 is 300,000,000. So 30 / 3e8 is 1e-7 seconds, yeah. So 0.1 microseconds or something.\n\nIn the lab frame, the lifetime of the particle is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau). So tau is the lifetime in the particle's own frame. So the proper lifetime is the time it has to decay before it would reach the wall if it weren't moving, right?\n\nWait, no. The particle is moving, so from the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer due to gamma. So the proper lifetime tau is such that gamma tau must be greater than or equal to the time it takes to reach the wall, which is t = 30 / (v). But since v is approximately c, t is about 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 seconds, as I said.\n\nSo the condition is gamma * tau >= t. So the probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall is... Well, I think the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle decays before time t is 1 - e^(-t/tau). So the probability of decay before reaching the wall is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)). Wait, no, wait. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the mean lifetime is gamma tau. So the decay probability is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, maybe I got that backwards. The proper lifetime is tau, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So the decay rate in the lab frame is lambda' = lambda / gamma, where lambda is the decay rate in the proper frame (lambda = 1/tau). Because the decay rate transforms inversely with gamma. Hmm, so the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the decay probability in the lab frame is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nBut wait, in the initial scenario, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the detector walls. That would mean that two-thirds decay before reaching the walls. So the probability of decaying before reaching is 2/3, which is about 66.666...%.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question says that on average, one third reach the walls. So the probability of a particle not decaying before reaching the wall is one third. So the probability of decay is two-thirds. So 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)) = 2/3. So e^(-t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3. Taking natural logs: -t/(gamma tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3). So t/(gamma tau) = ln(3). So gamma tau = t / ln(3).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because the original problem says that when gamma is 20, one third reach the walls. So in that case, gamma is 20. So the probability that a particle doesn't decay is 1/3. So the decay probability is 2/3.\n\nSo for the original situation: gamma1 = 20, probability of decay before reaching is 2/3.\n\nWe can write the equation as:\n\n1 - e^(-t/(gamma1 tau)) = 2/3\n\nWhich gives e^(-t/(gamma1 tau)) = 1/3\n\nSo -t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3)\n\nSo t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(3)\n\nSo gamma1 tau = t / ln(3)\n\nNow, when we change gamma to gamma2, we want the probability of decay to be such that one third decay, so two-thirds reach the walls. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is, what gamma is needed so that two-thirds reach the walls. So the probability of not decaying is 2/3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"about two-thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls.\" So the probability of not decaying (i.e., reaching the wall) is two-thirds. So the probability of decay is one minus that, which is 1/3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me clarify. When gamma is 20, one third reach the walls, meaning two-thirds decay before. Now, the question is, what gamma is needed for two-thirds to reach the walls, meaning one-third decay.\n\nWait, no. No. Because the question is to find a gamma where two-thirds reach the walls. So the probability of reaching is 2/3, meaning the decay probability is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo for the new gamma, gamma2, we have:\n\ne^(-t/(gamma2 tau)) = 2/3\n\nBecause the probability of not decaying (i.e., reaching the wall) is 2/3.\n\nWait, no. The equation is:\n\nProbability of reaching = e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nBecause the decay probability is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)), so the survival probability (reaching the wall) is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and detectors. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nSo the problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and move at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the walls?\n\nWait, I remember that the Lorentz factor is gamma, which is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). And since these are ultra-relativistic, v is very close to c. So gamma is much larger than 1.\n\nBut how does the Lorentz factor relate to the particles reaching the detector walls? Oh right, time dilation and length contraction come into play here. Because from the lab frame (the detector's frame), the particles are moving very fast, but their lifetime is affected by time dilation. So the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is multiplied by gamma to get the lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nSo the particles are created at the center, so the maximum distance they can travel is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. The time they have to reach the wall is the time it takes for the particle to move from the center to the wall, which is 30 meters divided by their speed.\n\nWait, but since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their speed is approximately c. So the time t is approximately 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds? Wait, let me compute that: 3e8 is 300,000,000. So 30 / 3e8 is 1e-7 seconds, yeah. So 0.1 microseconds or something.\n\nIn the lab frame, the lifetime of the particle is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau). So tau is the lifetime in the particle's own frame. So the proper lifetime is the time it has to decay before it would reach the wall if it weren't moving, right?\n\nWait, no. The particle is moving, so from the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer due to gamma. So the proper lifetime tau is such that gamma tau must be greater than or equal to the time it takes to reach the wall, which is t = 30 / (v). But since v is approximately c, t is about 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 seconds, as I said.\n\nSo the condition is gamma * tau >= t. So the probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall is... Well, I think the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle decays before time t is 1 - e^(-t/tau). So the probability of decay before reaching the wall is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)). Wait, no, wait. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the mean lifetime is gamma tau. So the decay probability is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nWait, maybe I got that backwards. The proper lifetime is tau, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So the decay rate in the lab frame is lambda' = lambda / gamma, where lambda is the decay rate in the proper frame (lambda = 1/tau). Because the decay rate transforms inversely with gamma. Hmm, so the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the decay probability in the lab frame is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nBut wait, in the initial scenario, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the detector walls. That would mean that two-thirds decay before reaching the walls. So the probability of decaying before reaching is 2/3, which is about 66.666...%.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question says that on average, one third reach the walls. So the probability of a particle not decaying before reaching the wall is one third. So the probability of decay is two-thirds. So 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)) = 2/3. So e^(-t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3. Taking natural logs: -t/(gamma tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3). So t/(gamma tau) = ln(3). So gamma tau = t / ln(3).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because the original problem says that when gamma is 20, one third reach the walls. So in that case, gamma is 20. So the probability that a particle doesn't decay is 1/3. So the decay probability is 2/3.\n\nSo for the original situation: gamma1 = 20, probability of decay before reaching is 2/3.\n\nWe can write the equation as:\n\n1 - e^(-t/(gamma1 tau)) = 2/3\n\nWhich gives e^(-t/(gamma1 tau)) = 1/3\n\nSo -t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3)\n\nSo t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(3)\n\nSo gamma1 tau = t / ln(3)\n\nNow, when we change gamma to gamma2, we want the probability of decay to be such that one third decay, so two-thirds reach the walls. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is, what gamma is needed so that two-thirds reach the walls. So the probability of not decaying is 2/3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"about two-thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls.\" So the probability of not decaying (i.e., reaching the wall) is two-thirds. So the probability of decay is one minus that, which is 1/3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me clarify. When gamma is 20, one third reach the walls, meaning two-thirds decay before. Now, the question is, what gamma is needed for two-thirds to reach the walls, meaning one-third decay.\n\nWait, no. No. Because the question is to find a gamma where two-thirds reach the walls. So the probability of reaching is 2/3, meaning the decay probability is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo for the new gamma, gamma2, we have:\n\ne^(-t/(gamma2 tau)) = 2/3\n\nBecause the probability of not decaying (i.e., reaching the wall) is 2/3.\n\nWait, no. The equation is:\n\nProbability of reaching = e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nBecause the decay probability is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)), so the survival probability (reaching the wall) is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).\n\nSo when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So:\n\ne^(-t/(20 tau)) = 1/3.\n\nSo that's the initial condition.\n\nNow, when we want the survival probability to be 2/3, that is:\n\ne^(-t/(gamma2 tau)) = 2/3.\n\nSo taking the ratio of the two equations.\n\nWe have:\n\ne^(-t/(20 tau)) = 1/3,\n\nand\n\ne^(-t/(gamma2 tau)) = 2/3.\n\nDividing the second equation by the first:\n\n[e^(-t/(gamma2 tau))] / [e^(-t/(20 tau))] = (2/3)/(1/3) = 2.\n\nWhich simplifies to e^[ t/(20 tau) - t/(gamma2 tau) ] = 2.\n\nFactor out t/(tau):\n\ne^[ t/(tau) (1/20 - 1/gamma2) ] = 2.\n\nTake natural log of both sides:\n\nt/(tau) [1/20 - 1/gamma2] = ln(2).\n\nNow, from the initial condition, when gamma=20, e^(-t/(20 tau))=1/3.\n\nSo -t/(20 tau) = ln(1/3) => t/(20 tau) = ln(3).\n\nSo t/(tau) = 20 ln(3).\n\nSubstitute this into the previous equation:\n\n[20 ln(3)] [ (1/20) - (1/gamma2) ] = ln(2).\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\nln(3) [1 - (20/gamma2) ] = ln(2).\n\nSo,\n\nln(3) (1 - 20/gamma2) = ln(2).\n\nDivide both sides by ln(3):\n\n1 - 20/gamma2 = ln(2)/ln(3).\n\nCalculate ln(2) \u2248 0.6931, ln(3)\u22481.0986.\n\nSo ln(2)/ln(3) \u2248 0.6309.\n\nSo,\n\n1 - 20/gamma2 = 0.6309.\n\nWhich gives:\n\n20/gamma2 = 1 - 0.6309 = 0.3691.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma2 = 20 / 0.3691 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n20 divided by approximately 0.3691.\n\nLet me calculate 20 / 0.3691.\n\n0.3691 is roughly 0.369.\n\n20 / 0.369 \u2248 ?\n\nWell, 0.369 * 54 = let's see: 50 *0.369=18.45, 4*0.369=1.476 \u2192 18.45+1.476=19.926.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. One third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.\n\nHmm, right. So the key here is understanding how the Lorentz factor affects the distance the particles travel before decaying. Since the particles are fast-decaying, their lifetime is probably related to their speed. Oh wait, Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), which affects time dilation. So from the lab frame (the detector's frame), the particles' lifetime is longer due to gamma.\n\nWait, but the particles are moving at a high speed, so their decay length would be gamma multiplied by their proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in their rest frame) multiplied by their speed. But wait, the speed is close to c, so v \u2248 c. So the distance they travel before decaying is roughly gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.\n\nWait, the problem says that one third reach the inner walls when gamma is 20. So for gamma =20, the average distance they travel is equal to the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. Or maybe not exactly, but the fraction that reaches the wall depends on whether their decay length is longer than the radius.\n\nWait, the fraction reaching the inner walls would be the fraction of particles whose decay length is longer than the radius. So for a given gamma, each particle has a probability to decay at some distance. So the average distance they travel is the mean lifetime multiplied by their speed, which is gamma c tau.\n\nWait, but I think the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that a particle decays after traveling a distance L is given by the exponential distribution. The survival probability (not decaying) is exp(-L/(gamma c tau)), where L is the distance. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the detector's radius R is exp(-R/(gamma c tau)).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's said that one third reach the inner walls. So when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So 1/3 = exp(-R/(gamma c tau)).\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused here. So the problem is about the particles traveling without decaying until they reach the detector's wall. So the fraction that makes it to the wall is the fraction that hasn't decayed by that point. So the survival probability is 1/3 when gamma is 20.\n\nSo, for gamma=20, the survival probability is 1/3. The survival probability is exp(-R/(gamma c tau)).\n\nBut wait, R is 30 meters. So we can write for gamma=20:\n\n1/3 = exp(-30/(20 c tau)).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the exact expression. Let me think again. The decay length is gamma c tau, so the mean distance a particle travels before decaying is gamma c tau. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after traveling distance L is exp(-L/(gamma c tau)).\n\nSo when the detector's radius is R, the probability of a particle reaching the wall is P = exp(-R/(gamma c tau)).\n\nIn the given scenario, when gamma=20, P=1/3.\n\nSo,\n\n1/3 = exp(-30/(20 c tau)).\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau).\n\nln(1/3) is about -1.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n-1.0986 = -30/(20 c tau).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n1.0986 = 30/(20 c tau).\n\nSimplify 30/20 to 3/2.\n\n1.0986 = (3/2) / (c tau).\n\nWait, solving for c tau:\n\nc tau = (3/2) / 1.0986 \u2248 (1.5) / 1.0986 \u2248 approximately 1.364 m.\n\nSo c tau is about 1.364 meters.\n\nNow, the question is, what gamma do we need so that the survival probability P is 2/3?\n\nSo set P = 2/3.\n\nSo,\n\n2/3 = exp(-30/(gamma c tau)).\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(gamma c tau).\n\nln(2/3) is approximately -0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\n-0.4055 = -30/(gamma * c tau).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0.4055 = 30/(gamma c tau).\n\nWe already know that c tau is approximately 1.364 meters. So substitute:\n\n0.4055 = 30/(gamma * 1.364).\n\nMultiply both sides by gamma * 1.364:\n\n0.4055 * gamma * 1.364 = 30.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4055 *1.364:\n\ngamma = 30 / (0.4055 * 1.364).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute the denominator: 0.4055 *1.364.\n\n0.4055 *1.364 \u2248 0.4055 *1.364 \u2248 let's calculate:\n\n1.364 * 0.4 = 0.5456.\n\n1.364 *0.0055 = approximately 0.0075 (since 1.364 *0.005=0.00682; 1.364 *0.0005=0.000682; so total ~0.0075).\n\nSo total denominator approx 0.5456 + 0.0075 \u2248 0.5531.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 30 / 0.5531 \u2248 54.23.\n\nHmm, so gamma is approximately 54.2. Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.\n\nWait, but wait a second.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. One third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.\n\nHmm, right. So the key here is understanding how the Lorentz factor affects the distance the particles travel before decaying. Since the particles are fast-decaying, their lifetime is probably related to their speed. Oh wait, Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), which affects time dilation. So from the lab frame (the detector's frame), the particles' lifetime is longer due to gamma.\n\nWait, but the particles are moving at a high speed, so their decay length would be gamma multiplied by their proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in their rest frame) multiplied by their speed. But wait, the speed is close to c, so v \u2248 c. So the distance they travel before decaying is roughly gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.\n\nWait, the problem says that one third reach the inner walls when gamma is 20. So for gamma =20, the average distance they travel is equal to the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. Or maybe not exactly, but the fraction that reaches the wall depends on whether their decay length is longer than the radius.\n\nWait, the fraction reaching the inner walls would be the fraction of particles whose decay length is longer than the radius. So for a given gamma, each particle has a probability to decay at some distance. So the average distance they travel is the mean lifetime multiplied by their speed, which is gamma c tau.\n\nWait, but I think the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that a particle decays after traveling a distance L is given by the exponential distribution. The survival probability (not decaying) is exp(-L/(gamma c tau)), where L is the distance. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the detector's radius R is exp(-R/(gamma c tau)).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's said that one third reach the inner walls. So when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So 1/3 = exp(-R/(gamma c tau)).\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused here. So the problem is about the particles traveling without decaying until they reach the detector's wall. So the fraction that makes it to the wall is the fraction that hasn't decayed by that point. So the survival probability is 1/3 when gamma is 20.\n\nSo, for gamma=20, the survival probability is 1/3. The survival probability is exp(-R/(gamma c tau)).\n\nBut wait, R is 30 meters. So we can write for gamma=20:\n\n1/3 = exp(-30/(20 c tau)).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the exact expression. Let me think again. The decay length is gamma c tau, so the mean distance a particle travels before decaying is gamma c tau. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after traveling distance L is exp(-L/(gamma c tau)).\n\nSo when the detector's radius is R, the probability of a particle reaching the wall is P = exp(-R/(gamma c tau)).\n\nIn the given scenario, when gamma=20, P=1/3.\n\nSo,\n\n1/3 = exp(-30/(20 c tau)).\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau).\n\nln(1/3) is about -1.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n-1.0986 = -30/(20 c tau).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n1.0986 = 30/(20 c tau).\n\nSimplify 30/20 to 3/2.\n\n1.0986 = (3/2) / (c tau).\n\nWait, solving for c tau:\n\nc tau = (3/2) / 1.0986 \u2248 (1.5) / 1.0986 \u2248 approximately 1.364 m.\n\nSo c tau is about 1.364 meters.\n\nNow, the question is, what gamma do we need so that the survival probability P is 2/3?\n\nSo set P = 2/3.\n\nSo,\n\n2/3 = exp(-30/(gamma c tau)).\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(gamma c tau).\n\nln(2/3) is approximately -0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\n-0.4055 = -30/(gamma * c tau).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0.4055 = 30/(gamma c tau).\n\nWe already know that c tau is approximately 1.364 meters. So substitute:\n\n0.4055 = 30/(gamma * 1.364).\n\nMultiply both sides by gamma * 1.364:\n\n0.4055 * gamma * 1.364 = 30.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4055 *1.364:\n\ngamma = 30 / (0.4055 * 1.364).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute the denominator: 0.4055 *1.364.\n\n0.4055 *1.364 \u2248 0.4055 *1.364 \u2248 let's calculate:\n\n1.364 * 0.4 = 0.5456.\n\n1.364 *0.0055 = approximately 0.0075 (since 1.364 *0.005=0.00682; 1.364 *0.0005=0.000682; so total ~0.0075).\n\nSo total denominator approx 0.5456 + 0.0075 \u2248 0.5531.\n\nSo gamma \u2248 30 / 0.5531 \u2248 54.23.\n\nHmm, so gamma is approximately 54.2. Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the calculations because I might have approximated too much.\n\nLet me compute 0.4055 *1.364 exactly.\n\n0.4055 *1.364:\n\nMultiply 0.4055 by 1.364.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n0.4 *1.364 = 0.5456.\n\n0.0055 *1.364 = 0.007502.\n\nSo total is 0.5456 + 0.007502 = 0.553102.\n\nSo denominator is 0.553102.\n\nGamma = 30 / 0.553102 \u2248 54.23.\n\nSo approximately 54.23, which is about 54. So option A is 54.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.\n\nSo the answer should be A)54.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nThe survival probability P is exp(-R/(gamma c tau)).\n\nWhen gamma=20, P=1/3.\n\nSo, 1/3 = exp(-30/(20 c tau)).\n\nSo, ln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau).\n\nWhich gives 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3).\n\nWait, ln(3) is about 1.0986. So,\n\n30/(20 c tau) = 1.0986.\n\nSimplify 30/20=3/2=1.5.\n\nSo 1.5/(c tau) =1.0986.\n\nSo c tau = 1.5 /1.0986 \u2248 1.364 m.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, when we need P=2/3.\n\nSo,\n\n2/3 = exp(-30/(gamma c tau)).\n\nTake ln both sides: ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma c tau).\n\nln(2/3)= approx -0.4055.\n\nSo,\n\n-0.4055 = -30/(gamma *1.364).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0.4055 = 30/(gamma *1.364).\n\ngamma = 30/(0.4055 *1.364) \u2248 30/(0.5531) \u224854.23.\n\nWhich rounds to 54, option A.\n\nWait, but the question says \"about two-thirds\". So perhaps the calculation is precise, but the options are rounded.
