      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what it says. \n\nAlright, the setup: Two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. They're using the radial velocity (RV) method to detect them. So, RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull.\n\nPlanet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.\n\nWait, the question is about the orbital periods. Hmm. I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass and orbit of the planet. The formula I think is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period.\n\nLet me try to recall the formula. Oh right, the RV formula is K = (v) = (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )^(1/3) )? Hmm, maybe I should think of it another way.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P). The key point is that the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is inversely related to the planet's orbital period, but also depends on other factors.\n\nWait, the formula I think is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) )? No, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, let's think about the Doppler shift. The semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. The formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2\u03c0) / (P * (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5)) ) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut since the planets are similar to Neptune and the stars are solar mass, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So we can approximate M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so that term goes away.\n\nSo K simplifies to ( (G * M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) / something? Wait, let me write it more accurately.\n\nThe correct formula for K (velocity semi-amplitude) when the orbit is circular is:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2\u03c0 / (P * (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut again, since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So it becomes:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G * M_p) / M_star )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut e=0, so that last term is 1. So:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G * M_p ) / M_star )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, let me rearrange this. Let's cube both sides to get K^3.\n\nK^3 \u2248 ( (G M_p) / M_star ) * (2\u03c0 / P )\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\nP = (2\u03c0) * (G M_p / (M_star K^3)) )\n\nWait, but both planets have the same mass, since both are similar to Neptune. So M_p is same for both planets. M_star is same too because both stars are solar mass.\n\nSo, for each planet, the period P is proportional to (1/K^3), because P = (2\u03c0 G M_p / (M_star K^3) )^(1/1) ) ?\n\nWait, wait, let's think. Let me write the equation again.\n\nWe have K = ( (G M_p) / M_star )^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) )\n\nSo, cube both sides:\n\nK^3 = (G M_p / M_star) * (2\u03c0 / P )\n\nThen, solving for P:\n\nP = (2\u03c0 G M_p / (M_star)) ) * (1/(K^3)) )\n\nSince M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, P is inversely proportional to K^3.\n\nSo, P \u221d 1/K^3.\n\nWait, that's the key. So the period is inversely proportional to the cube of the velocity semi-amplitude K.\n\nSo, for planet #1, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, and for planet #2, K2 is 7 milliangstrom. Since the question is about P2 / P1, the ratio is (K1/K2)^3.\n\nWait, because P is inversely proportional to K^3. So if K2 is larger, P2 is smaller.\n\nWait, let's see: P1 = (something) / K1^3, P2 = (something) / K2^3. So P2/P1 = (K1^3) / (K2^3) = (5/7)^3.\n\nWait, no. Because (K1 is 5, K2 is 7). So (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2 is 0.364 times P1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1.\n\nWait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 longer by a factor of 0.364? That would mean P2 is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364. So P2 is 0.364 times P1, which is less than one. So P2 is shorter.\n\nWait, but the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is shorter, the factor is less than 1, but perhaps I got the ratio reversed.\n\nWait, let's reevaluate. Let me define P1 as the period of planet #1, P2 as that of planet #2. The ratio is P2/P1.\n\nBecause P \u221d 1/K^3, then P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3.\n\nSo 5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. That means P2 is shorter than P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nSo the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? If P2 is shorter, then it's 0.36 times longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is ~0.36.\n\nSo the correct answer should be A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.\n\nSo the question says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets. \n\nThe key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.\n\nWait, radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift, right? The shift in the spectral lines is due to the star moving towards or away from us because of the planet's gravity. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity of the star.\n\nI remember the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star)) )^(1/3) ) ) multiplied by (1 / (P) )^(1/3) ) ). Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the period, the inclination, and the mass of the star.\n\nWait, the formula for K is K = ( ( (2\u03c0G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) ), but since M_p is much less than M_star (since Neptune is much less than the Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So K \u2248 ( (2\u03c0G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, but maybe another approach: the RV method gives a velocity semi-amplitude K, which is related to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ) ) / (something). Hmm, perhaps I should look for a more straightforward relation.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), but since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 would be (P2/P1)^(1/3) )? Or maybe the inverse.\n\nWait, let's think about the formula again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is about 1/17th Earth's mass, and Earth is 1/318th of Sun's mass; so M_p/M_star is negligible), we can ignore that term. So K \u2248 ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / (M_star^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to K \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Maybe the correct formula is:\n\nK = (v) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (1 AU) ) * ( 1 / (P) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1) / (P)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (2\u03c0) / (c) ) )\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the exact formula. Let's think about the relation between K and the period.\n\nSince both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), and the stars have the same mass (solar-like), the ratio of K1 to K2 will depend on the ratio of their orbital periods.\n\nWait, from the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K \u221d (1 / P^(1/3)).\n\nSo K1 = (some constant) * (1 / P1^(1/3))\nK2 = (same constant) * (1 / P2^(1/3))\n\nSo the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nBut wait, no: if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) ?\n\nWait, let me rephrase. Let's say K \u221d 1/(P^(1/3)). So K1 = A / (P1^(1/3)), K2 = A / (P2^(1/3)).\n\nSo K1/K2 = (A/(P1^(1/3))) / (A/(P2^(1/3))) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nGiven that K1 is 5 miliangstrom, K2 is 7 miliangstrom. So K1/K2 = 5/7.\n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWe need to find P2/P1.\n\nSo let's cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.\n\nSo (125)/(343) = P2/P1.\n\nSo P2 is 125/343 times P1.\n\nWait, 125 divided by 343. Let me compute that: 125 \u00f7 343. Let's see, 343 is 7^3 (7*7=49, 49*7=343). 125 is 5^3.\n\nSo 125/343 = (5/7)^3. So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1.\n\nWait, no, because earlier I said K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So when K1 is smaller than K2, the period P2 must be shorter? Because if K is lower, the period is longer? Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K is smaller, P is larger.\n\nWait, let's think of it this way: if a star has a larger K, that means it's moving faster, which implies a shorter period because the planet is orbiting more quickly.\n\nSo in our case, K2 is larger than K1 (7 >5). So K2 is bigger, so P2 must be smaller than P1 because a larger K corresponds to a smaller period.\n\nWait, but according to the ratio we set earlier: K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo (5/7)^3 = P2/P1\n\nWhich is (125)/(343) = P2/P1 \u2248 0.364\n\nSo P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nBut the question asks: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\n\nSo, if P2 is 0.36 * P1, that means planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. So it's not longer. Wait, but the question says, how many times longer is P2 than P1? If P2 is shorter, it's 0.36 times, so the ratio is 0.36. But that's the ratio P2/P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 compared to P1? So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter, not longer.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me recheck the question.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\n\nSo they're asking P2/P1.\n\nIn our calculation, P2/P1 \u2248 0.364, which is about 0.36.\n\nSo the answer would be option A, which is ~0.36.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up K1 and K2.\n\nBecause in our earlier setup, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 =5/7.\n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 (0.714)^3 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo yes, P2 is about 0.36 times P1.\n\nSo planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's. So it's shorter, not longer.\n\nBut the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period. So if it's 0.36 times, then it's 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter. So the period is shorter, not longer.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / (P)^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the formula again. Alternatively, I can think about the relationship between velocity and period.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\nSo K \u221d 1/(P)^(1/3)\n\nSo if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1.\n\nBecause higher K means higher velocity, which for the same mass would mean a shorter period (the star is moving faster, so the planet must be orbiting quicker, i.e., shorter period).\n\nSo the ratio K1/K2 is 5/7.\n\nK1/K2 = (1/(P1^(1/3)))/(1/(P2^(1/3))) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 \u2192 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2 is about 0.36 times P1.\n\nSo planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times as long, so it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer? The answer is approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Did I set up the formula correctly?\n\nAnother approach: the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )\n\nAssuming sin i \u2248 1 (edge-on orbit), and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star.\n\nSo K \u2248 ( (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) / (c) ) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3))\n\nSo K is proportional to M_p / (M_star^(2/3)) * 1/(P^(1/3))\n\nSince M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 is 1/(P1^(1/3)) / (1/(P2^(1/3))) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo again, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo yes, the conclusion is correct.\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter, not longer.\n\nBut the question asks how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times. So it's shorter, so the ratio is less than one.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.\n\nSo the question says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets. \n\nThe key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.\n\nWait, radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift, right? The shift in the spectral lines is due to the star moving towards or away from us because of the planet's gravity. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity of the star.\n\nI remember the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star)) )^(1/3) ) ) multiplied by (1 / (P) )^(1/3) ) ). Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the period, the inclination, and the mass of the star.\n\nWait, the formula for K is K = ( ( (2\u03c0G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) ), but since M_p is much less than M_star (since Neptune is much less than the Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So K \u2248 ( (2\u03c0G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, but maybe another approach: the RV method gives a velocity semi-amplitude K, which is related to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ) ) / (something). Hmm, perhaps I should look for a more straightforward relation.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), but since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 would be (P2/P1)^(1/3) )? Or maybe the inverse.\n\nWait, let's think about the formula again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is about 1/17th Earth's mass, and Earth is 1/318th of Sun's mass; so M_p/M_star is negligible), we can ignore that term. So K \u2248 ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / (M_star^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to K \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Maybe the correct formula is:\n\nK = (v) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (1 AU) ) * ( 1 / (P) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1) / (P)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (2\u03c0) / (c) ) )\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the exact formula. Let's think about the relation between K and the period.\n\nSince both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), and the stars have the same mass (solar-like), the ratio of K1 to K2 will depend on the ratio of their orbital periods.\n\nWait, from the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K \u221d (1 / P^(1/3)).\n\nSo K1 = (some constant) * (1 / P1^(1/3))\nK2 = (same constant) * (1 / P2^(1/3))\n\nSo the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nBut wait, no: if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) ?\n\nWait, let me rephrase. Let's say K \u221d 1/(P^(1/3)). So K1 = A / (P1^(1/3)), K2 = A / (P2^(1/3)).\n\nSo K1/K2 = (A/(P1^(1/3))) / (A/(P2^(1/3))) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nGiven that K1 is 5 miliangstrom, K2 is 7 miliangstrom. So K1/K2 = 5/7.\n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWe need to find P2/P1.\n\nSo let's cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.\n\nSo (125)/(343) = P2/P1.\n\nSo P2 is 125/343 times P1.\n\nWait, 125 divided by 343. Let me compute that: 125 \u00f7 343. Let's see, 343 is 7^3 (7*7=49, 49*7=343). 125 is 5^3.\n\nSo 125/343 = (5/7)^3. So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1.\n\nWait, no, because earlier I said K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So when K1 is smaller than K2, the period P2 must be shorter? Because if K is lower, the period is longer? Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K is smaller, P is larger.\n\nWait, let's think of it this way: if a star has a larger K, that means it's moving faster, which implies a shorter period because the planet is orbiting more quickly.\n\nSo in our case, K2 is larger than K1 (7 >5). So K2 is bigger, so P2 must be smaller than P1 because a larger K corresponds to a smaller period.\n\nWait, but according to the ratio we set earlier: K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo (5/7)^3 = P2/P1\n\nWhich is (125)/(343) = P2/P1 \u2248 0.364\n\nSo P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nBut the question asks: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\n\nSo, if P2 is 0.36 * P1, that means planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. So it's not longer. Wait, but the question says, how many times longer is P2 than P1? If P2 is shorter, it's 0.36 times, so the ratio is 0.36. But that's the ratio P2/P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 compared to P1? So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter, not longer.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me recheck the question.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\n\nSo they're asking P2/P1.\n\nIn our calculation, P2/P1 \u2248 0.364, which is about 0.36.\n\nSo the answer would be option A, which is ~0.36.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up K1 and K2.\n\nBecause in our earlier setup, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 =5/7.\n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 (0.714)^3 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo yes, P2 is about 0.36 times P1.\n\nSo planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's. So it's shorter, not longer.\n\nBut the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period. So if it's 0.36 times, then it's 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter. So the period is shorter, not longer.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / (P)^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the formula again.

So how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times as long, so it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer?

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet orbits, causing the star to wobble.\n\nSo the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that each star shows a periodic shift in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.\n\nHmm. I think the RV method detects the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I recall is that the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula is something like K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star, which is the same for both stars here. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so that term becomes 1. So the formula simplifies.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can think in terms of the RV semi-amplitude formula. The semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G * P) / (2\u03c0 c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * something with the orbital period.\n\nWait, another approach. The RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (1 AU) )^(1/3) ) * some constants.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the equation that relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period P. I think K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) / (P)^(1/3). Or maybe inversely proportional? Let me think.\n\nThe formula I found in my notes is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star, so the first term simplifies to (G M_p / M_star)^(1/3). So K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\nWait, but in this problem, both planets have the same mass, same as Neptune. So M_p is the same for both. The stars have the same mass as the Sun, so M_star is same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).\n\nWait, no, because K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)), so if K increases, P decreases. Because if K is larger, then P must be smaller. Because if K is bigger, the star is moving faster, which would imply a shorter period. Wait, because if a planet is closer, the period is shorter, and the RV semi-amplitude would be higher. Because the star is moving more quickly in its orbit.\n\nSo, if Planet #2 has a larger RV shift (7 vs 5 milliangstroms), that implies that K2 > K1. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K2 = K1 * (P1/P2)^(1/3). Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if K2 is larger, P2 must be smaller than P1. Wait no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K = constant / P^(1/3). So if K2 > K1, then P2^(1/3) < P1^(1/3), so P2 < P1.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is shorter, then the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. But let me think again.\n\nWait, the formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) / (c), where c is the speed of light, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)), where a is the semi-major axis. Because the star's velocity is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe a better approach is to think about the relationship between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period.\n\nAnother approach: The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. The formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) )\n\nBut since e=0 for both planets, and M_p is same and much less than M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G * M_p) / M_star )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nSo, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 > K1, then P2^(1/3) < P1^(1/3). Therefore, P2 < P1.\n\nBut the question is, how much longer is P2 than P1? So we need to find P2/P1.\n\nLet me denote K1 as 5 milliangstroms, K2 as 7.\n\nSo K1 = (something) / (P1)^(1/3)\n\nK2 = (same something) / (P2)^(1/3)\n\nTaking the ratio K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n\nSo K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)\n\nWe can rearrange this to find P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^(-3)\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let me take the ratio:\n\nK2 / K1 = [ (something) / P2^(1/3) ] / [ (something) / P1^(1/3) ] ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)\n\nSo, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)\n\nCube both sides:\n\n(K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2\n\nSo, P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3\n\nSo the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.\n\nGiven K1=5, K2=7.\n\nSo K1/K2 = 5/7 \u2248 0.714.\n\nSo (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2/P1 \u2248 0.364. Which means P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1. So P2 is shorter.\n\nBut the question asks, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Wait, that would be P2/P1. Which in this case is 0.36 times. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter, not longer.\n\nWait, but the options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.\n\nSo the ratio P2/P1 is about 0.36. So the correct answer would be A) ~0.36.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I didn't mix up the ratio.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet orbits, causing the star to wobble.\n\nSo the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that each star shows a periodic shift in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.\n\nHmm. I think the RV method detects the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I recall is that the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula is something like K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star, which is the same for both stars here. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so that term becomes 1. So the formula simplifies.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can think in terms of the RV semi-amplitude formula. The semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G * P) / (2\u03c0 c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * something with the orbital period.\n\nWait, another approach. The RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (1 AU) )^(1/3) ) * some constants.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the equation that relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period P. I think K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) / (P)^(1/3). Or maybe inversely proportional? Let me think.\n\nThe formula I found in my notes is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) )\n\nBut since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star, so the first term simplifies to (G M_p / M_star)^(1/3). So K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\nWait, but in this problem, both planets have the same mass, same as Neptune. So M_p is the same for both. The stars have the same mass as the Sun, so M_star is same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).\n\nWait, no, because K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)), so if K increases, P decreases. Because if K is larger, then P must be smaller. Because if K is bigger, the star is moving faster, which would imply a shorter period. Wait, because if a planet is closer, the period is shorter, and the RV semi-amplitude would be higher. Because the star is moving more quickly in its orbit.\n\nSo, if Planet #2 has a larger RV shift (7 vs 5 milliangstroms), that implies that K2 > K1. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K2 = K1 * (P1/P2)^(1/3). Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if K2 is larger, P2 must be smaller than P1. Wait no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K = constant / P^(1/3). So if K2 > K1, then P2^(1/3) < P1^(1/3), so P2 < P1.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is shorter, then the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. But let me think again.\n\nWait, the formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) / (c), where c is the speed of light, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)), where a is the semi-major axis. Because the star's velocity is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe a better approach is to think about the relationship between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period.\n\nAnother approach: The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. The formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) )\n\nBut since e=0 for both planets, and M_p is same and much less than M_star, this simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G * M_p) / M_star )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nSo, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 > K1, then P2^(1/3) < P1^(1/3). Therefore, P2 < P1.\n\nBut the question is, how much longer is P2 than P1? So we need to find P2/P1.\n\nLet me denote K1 as 5 milliangstroms, K2 as 7.\n\nSo K1 = (something) / (P1)^(1/3)\n\nK2 = (same something) / (P2)^(1/3)\n\nTaking the ratio K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n\nSo K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)\n\nWe can rearrange this to find P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^(-3)\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let me take the ratio:\n\nK2 / K1 = [ (something) / P2^(1/3) ] / [ (something) / P1^(1/3) ] ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)\n\nSo, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)\n\nCube both sides:\n\n(K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2\n\nSo, P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3\n\nSo the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.\n\nGiven K1=5, K2=7.\n\nSo K1/K2 = 5/7 \u2248 0.714.\n\nSo (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2/P1 \u2248 0.364. Which means P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1. So P2 is shorter.\n\nBut the question asks, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Wait, that would be P2/P1. Which in this case is 0.36 times. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter, not longer.\n\nWait, but the options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.\n\nSo the ratio P2/P1 is about 0.36. So the correct answer would be A) ~0.36.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. Let me go through again.\n\nWe have K2 > K1, so P2 < P1.\n\nSo the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1.\n\nThe formula gave P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo that's option A, which is ~0.36.\n\nSo the answer should be A.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes.

Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) / ( (1 AU)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (P/(2\u03c0)) )^(-1/3) )\n\nBut wait, maybe a simpler approach is to use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the orbital period P. Or wait, no, because K depends on other factors too.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the velocity of the star in its orbit, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the main variable here is the semi-amplitude of the shift, which relates to the velocity of the star.\n\nThe RV shift (wavelength shift) is proportional to the velocity of the star. So the 5 milliangstrom shift for planet 1 and 7 for planet 2 would mean that the velocity of the star is higher for planet 2, since a larger shift implies higher velocity.\n\nWait, but how does the velocity relate to the orbital period? The velocity of the star in its orbit is given by v = (2\u03c0 a) / P, where a is the semi-major axis (assuming circular orbit), and P is the orbital period.\n\nBut since the star and planet orbit the common center of mass, the semi-major axis of the star's orbit is a_* = (M_p/(M_* + M_p)) * a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But since M_* is much larger than M_p (Sun-like stars and Neptune-like planets), a_* \u2248 (M_p / M_*) * a_planet. But perhaps this approximation isn't necessary here.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the RV semi-amplitude K. The formula for K is:\n\nK = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/(2\u03c0)) ) * (1/( (1 AU)^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think of a simplified version. Since both stars have the same mass M*, and both planets have the same mass M_p (Neptune-like), the ratio K1/K2 would be proportional to (P2/P1)^(1/3), because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).\n\nWait, no. Let's think about the formula for K. K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = [ (2\u03c0 G) / (c) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, perhaps a more straightforward approach is to note that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut since M_* >> M_p, M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, so it's roughly (M_p / M_*^(1/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )\n\nSo K \u221d (M_p) / ( M_*^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\nBut since both planets have similar M_p and same M_*, the ratio K1/K2 would be ( P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) )\n\nBecause K1 = k * (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) P1^(1/3) )\n\nSimilarly, K2 = k * (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) P2^(1/3) )\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, no, if K1 is proportional to 1/P1^(1/3), then K1 = C / P1^(1/3), where C is a constant. Similarly, K2 = C / P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nBut in the problem, K1 is the shift for planet 1, which is 5 milliangstrom, and K2 is 7. So K1 =5, K2=7. So K1/K2 =5/7.\n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3).\n\nSo K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / ( C / P2^(1/3) ) ) = (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )\n\nSo (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWe have K1=5, K2=7. So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So how much longer is P2 than P1? Wait, no, because if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So it's 0.36 times as long. So it's about 0.36 times. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me re-express the relationship correctly. K is the semi-amplitude, which is the maximum velocity of the star. So the larger K, the larger the velocity, which implies a shorter period. Because if a planet has a larger semi-amplitude (K), it's causing the star to move more, which would happen if the planet's orbit is more massive or if the period is shorter (since the star is moving more rapidly in its orbit, implying a shorter period).\n\nSo in our case, Planet #2 has a larger K (7 vs 5), which would imply a shorter period. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? If P2 is shorter, then it's not longer. So perhaps I messed up the ratio.\n\nWait, let's re-express the formula correctly.\n\nWe have K \u221d 1 / P^(1/3), so P \u221d 1 / K^(3)\n\nSo P1 is proportional to 1/K1^3, and P2 proportional to 1/K2^3.\n\nSo the ratio P2/P1 = (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.\n\nBecause K1=5, K2=7: (5/7)^3 = 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.36.\n\nSo the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Since 0.36 is less than 1, it's not longer. Wait, that can't be. Because the problem says both planets were found, so perhaps I've made a mistake in the ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it this way: if K is larger, the period is smaller. So planet #2 has a larger K (7) than planet #1 (5), so P2 is smaller than P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's shorter, so the factor is less than 1. So the options include 0.36, which would mean P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the answer is A) ~0.36.\n\nBut let me think again. Let's think of it as K1 = 5, K2=7. So K2 is bigger than K1. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), K2 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) * K1. Wait, maybe I should set up the equations properly.\n\nLet\u2019s write the formula:\n\nK \u221d (M_p / (M_*^(1/3) P^(1/3) )) )\n\nAssuming M_p and M_* are same for both planets, so K \u221d 1/P^(1/3).\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nGiven K1=5, K2=7. So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.\n\nSo P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1 \u2248 (125/343) * P1 \u2248 0.364 * P1.\n\nSo P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's not longer; it's shorter. So the factor is less than 1, which matches option A.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's not longer; it's shorter. So the correct factor would be 0.36, but the question is about how much longer, which would be 0.36 times. So the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I got the ratio backward. Let me check.\n\nWait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\n\nIf P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, so it's shorter. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the answer is A.\n\nSo the correct option is A) ~0.36.\n",

The velocity of the star in its orbit is given by v = (2\u03c0 a) / P, where a is the semi-major axis (assuming circular orbit), and P is the orbital period.\n\nBut since the star and planet orbit the common center of mass, the semi-major axis of the star's orbit is a_* = (M_p/(M_* + M_p)) * a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But since M_* is much larger than M_p (Sun-like stars and Neptune-like planets), a_* \u2248 (M_p / M_*) * a_planet. But perhaps this approximation isn't necessary here.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the RV semi-amplitude K. The formula for K is:\n\nK = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/(2\u03c0)) ) * (1/( (1 AU)^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think of a simplified version. Since both stars have the same mass M*, and both planets have the same mass M_p (Neptune-like), the ratio K1/K2 would be proportional to (P2/P1)^(1/3), because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).\n\nWait, no. Let's think about the formula for K. K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = [ (2\u03c0 G) / (c) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, perhaps a more straightforward approach is to note that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut since M_* >> M_p, M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, so it's roughly (M_p / M_*^(1/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )\n\nSo K \u221d (M_p) / ( M_*^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\nBut since both planets have similar M_p and same M_*, the ratio K1/K2 would be ( P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) )\n\nBecause K1 = k * (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) P1^(1/3) )\n\nSimilarly, K2 = k * (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) P2^(1/3) )\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, no, if K1 is proportional to 1/P1^(1/3), then K1 = C / P1^(1/3), where C is a constant. Similarly, K2 = C / P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nBut in the problem, K1 is the shift for planet 1, which is 5 milliangstrom, and K2 is 7. So K1 =5, K2=7. So K1/K2 =5/7.\n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3).\n\nSo K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / ( C / P2^(1/3) ) ) = (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )\n\nSo (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWe have K1=5, K2=7. So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So how much longer is P2 than P1? Wait, no, because if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So it's 0.36 times as long. So it's about 0.36 times. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me re-express the relationship correctly. K is the semi-amplitude, which is the maximum velocity of the star. So the larger K, the larger the velocity, which implies a shorter period. Because if a planet has a larger semi-amplitude (K), it's causing the star to move more, which would happen if the planet's orbit is more massive or if the period is shorter (since the star is moving more rapidly in its orbit, implying a shorter period).\n\nSo in our case, Planet #2 has a larger K (7 vs 5), which would imply a shorter period. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? If P2 is shorter, then it's not longer. So perhaps I messed up the ratio.\n\nWait, let's re-express the formula correctly.\n\nWe have K \u221d 1 / P^(1/3), so P \u221d 1 / K^(3)\n\nSo P1 is proportional to 1/K1^3, and P2 proportional to 1/K2^3.\n\nSo the ratio P2/P1 = (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.\n\nBecause K1=5, K2=7: (5/7)^3 = 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.36.\n\nSo the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Since 0.36 is less than 1, it's not longer. Wait, that can't be. Because the problem says both planets were found, so perhaps I've made a mistake in the ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it this way: if K is larger, the period is smaller. So planet #2 has a larger K (7) than planet #1 (5), so P2 is smaller than P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's shorter, so the factor is less than 1. So the options include 0.36, which would mean P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the answer is A) ~0.36.\n\nBut let me think again. Let's think of it as K1 = 5, K2=7. So K2 is bigger than K1. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), K2 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) * K1. Wait, maybe I should set up the equations properly.\n\nLet\u2019s write the formula:\n\nK \u221d (M_p / (M_*^(1/3) P^(1/3) )) )\n\nAssuming M_p and M_* are same for both planets, so K \u221d 1/P^(1/3).\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nGiven K1=5, K2=7. So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.\n\nSo P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1 \u2248 (125/343) * P1 \u2248 0.364 * P1.\n\nSo P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's not longer; it's shorter. So the factor is less than 1, which matches option A.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's not longer; it's shorter. So the correct factor would be 0.36, but the question is about how much longer, which would be 0.36 times. So the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I got the ratio backward. Let me check.\n\nWait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\n\nIf P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, so it's shorter. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the answer is A.\n\nSo the correct option is A) ~0.36.\n\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectral lines of the host star, caused by the star's motion due to the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude of the RV shift, \\( K \\), is inversely proportional to the orbital period \\( P \\) of the planet, specifically \\( K \\propto P^{-1/3} \\). This relationship arises because the star's velocity in its orbit depends on the orbital period and the planet's mass.\n\nGiven that both stars have the same mass \\( M_* \\) and both planets have similar masses \\( M_p \\), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \\( K_1 \\) and \\( K_2 \\) (5 milliangstrom for Planet #1 and 7 milliangstrom for Planet #2) can be used to determine the ratio of their orbital periods. Using the proportionality \\( K \\propto P^{-1/3} \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( K_1 = 5 \\) and \\( K_2 = 7 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{7} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}.\n\\]\n\nCubing both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_2}{P_1}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.364.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( P_2 \\approx 0.364 \\cdot P_1 \\), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star move. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think.\n\nThe question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So the planets are probably gas giants but not as big as Jupiter. Both are in circular orbits, which simplifies things because eccentricity doesn't complicate the calculations.\n\nThe key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines: Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.\n\nWait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula for the RV method involves the velocity semi-amplitude K. Oh right, K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e^2)^(1/2)) ) )^(1/3) ), but since e is zero (circular orbits), that simplifies. Also, since M_planet is much smaller than M_star (Sun-like stars and Neptune mass), M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the relationship between the RV shift and the orbital period. I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula is K = ( (2\u03c0G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ), where i is the inclination angle. Since both planets are detected, I can assume their inclinations are such that sin i is close to 1 (edge-on orbits), so we can ignore that factor.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have similar Neptune masses. So M_planet is the same for both. So K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, let's think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n\nK = [ ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star) ) ) )^(1/3) ] * (1 / (P * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) )) )^(1/3)\n\nWait, no, maybe I should look up the correct formula. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e\u00b2)) ) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut since M_planet << M_star, M_star + M_planet \u2248 M_star. And since the orbits are circular, e=0, so sqrt(1-e\u00b2)=1.\n\nSo simplifying, K \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / P )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, but wait, I think I'm mixing up the exponents. Let me get the formula right. The correct formula for K is:\n\nK = ( ( (G * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e\u00b2)) ) )\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K can be approximated by:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) ) / ( P^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) )\n\nBut since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, and e=0, so:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / M_* )^(1/3) * (1) / ( P^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period P.\n\nLet me think about the equation again. K is proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nWait, but the masses are the same for both stars and planets. So M_p1 = M_p2, M_*1 = M_*2.\n\nSo K1/K2 = ( ( (M_p1 / M_*1 ) / (M_p2 / M_*2) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (P2 / P1) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut since M_p1 = M_p2 and M_*1 = M_*2, the first ratio is 1. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nBut wait, in this problem, K is the velocity shift. The shift in wavelength is related to velocity via the Doppler effect. The formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c.\n\nWait, more accurately, the Doppler shift formula is:\n\ndelta_lambda / lambda = (v) / c\n\nBut since the velocities are small compared to c, this is a good approximation.\n\nSo the observed shift in wavelength (delta_lambda) is proportional to velocity (v).\n\nSo in this case, K1 is the velocity semi-amplitude for planet #1, K2 for planet #2.\n\nGiven that delta_lambda is proportional to K, so K1 = (delta_lambda1) / (lambda0) * c, and same for K2.\n\nWait, but since both are measured at the same wavelength, the ratio of K's is the same as the ratio of delta_lambda's.\n\nSo K1 / K2 = (5 / 7) milliangstroms.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the same spectral line is observed. So the same lambda0 for both. So delta_lambda is proportional to K.\n\nThus, K1 = (5/7) * K2.\n\nWait, no, because K is the velocity. So if K1 is 5 miliangstrom, K2 is 7. Wait, no, wait, no, wait. The shift is 5 and 7. So K1 = (5 / lambda0) * c, K2 = (7 / lambda0) * c.\n\nSo K1 / K2 = 5/7.\n\nSo from earlier, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * ( (M_p1/M_*1) / (M_p2/M_*2) ) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut M_p1 = M_p2, M_*1 = M_*2. So the mass ratio is 1.\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWhich is (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWait, but wait, earlier I thought K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3), but wait, wait:\n\nWait, let's re-express the equation. Earlier, I had K1/K2 = ( (M_p1/M_*1) / (M_p2/M_*2) )^(1/3) * (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nBut since both M_p and M_* are the same, that ratio is 1. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWait, but K1 is the velocity for planet #1, and K2 for planet #2. So:\n\nK1 = (G M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / (P1^(1/3)) )\n\nSimilarly, K2 = (G M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / (P2^(1/3)) )\n\nTaking the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 =5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWait, but wait, no. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, let me re-express the formula correctly. K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)). Because from the earlier formula, K = (constant) * (1/P^(1/3)).\n\nSo K1 = C / P1^(1/3)\n\nK2 = C / P2^(1/3)\n\nWhere C is the same for both because M_p and M_* are same.\n\nSo K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / ( C / P2^(1/3) ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo rearranged, (K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1\n\nWe have K1=5, K2=7. So K1/K2=5/7.\n\nSo (5/7)^3 = P2 / P1\n\nSo P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3\n\nBut wait, the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the ratio is P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2 is about 0.364 times the period of P1, meaning it's shorter. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1, so planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Because if the RV shift (K) is larger, that implies a larger velocity. From the formula, higher K implies a larger planet mass, but in this case, the masses are same. So a larger K would imply a shorter orbital period because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 would be smaller than P1. So planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than planet #1.\n\nSo the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Since P2 is shorter, the ratio is less than 1. The options are looking for P2/P1.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure I got the formula right. Let me write down the formula again.\n\nWe have K = ( (G * M_p) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1-e\u00b2)^(1/2)) )^(1/3)\n\nWait, no, let me think of it another way. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )\n\nAssuming M_p << M_*, sin i \u2248 1, and e=0, this simplifies to:\n\nK = ( (2 \u03c0 G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) )\n\nBut for the ratio between K1 and K2, since M_p and M_* are same, the ratio K1/K2 is proportional to (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWe have K1=5, K2=7. So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\n(5/7)^3 = P2/P1 \u2192 P2 = (125/343) P1 \u2248 0.364 P1.\n\nSo P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.364 times, so shorter.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\"\n\nSo P2 is shorter, so it's about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the ratio is approximately 0.36.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.\n",

Let me get the formula right. The correct formula for K is:\n\nK = ( ( (G * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e\u00b2)) ) )\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K can be approximated by:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) ) / ( P^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) )\n\nBut since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, and e=0, so:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / M_* )^(1/3) * (1) / ( P^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period P.\n\nLet me think about the equation again. K is proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nWait, but the masses are the same for both stars and planets. So M_p1 = M_p2, M_*1 = M_*2.\n\nSo K1/K2 = ( ( (M_p1 / M_*1 ) / (M_p2 / M_*2) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (P2 / P1) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut since M_p1 = M_p2 and M_*1 = M_*2, the first ratio is 1. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nBut wait, in this problem, K is the velocity shift. The shift in wavelength is related to velocity via the Doppler effect. The formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c.\n\nWait, more accurately, the Doppler shift formula is:\n\ndelta_lambda / lambda = (v) / c\n\nBut since the velocities are small compared to c, this is a good approximation.\n\nSo the observed shift in wavelength (delta_lambda) is proportional to velocity (v).\n\nSo in this case, K1 is the velocity semi-amplitude for planet #1, K2 for planet #2.\n\nGiven that delta_lambda is proportional to K, so K1 = (delta_lambda1) / (lambda0) * c, and same for K2.\n\nWait, but since both are measured at the same wavelength, the ratio of K's is the same as the ratio of delta_lambda's.\n\nSo K1 / K2 = (5 / 7) milliangstroms.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the same spectral line is observed. So the same lambda0 for both. So delta_lambda is proportional to K.\n\nThus, K1 = (5/7) * K2.\n\nWait, no, because K is the velocity. So if K1 is 5 miliangstrom, K2 is 7. Wait, no, wait, no, wait. The shift is 5 and 7. So K1 = (5 / lambda0) * c, K2 = (7 / lambda0) * c.\n\nSo K1 / K2 = 5/7.\n\nSo from earlier, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * ( (M_p1/M_*1) / (M_p2/M_*2) ) )^(1/3) )\n\nBut M_p1 = M_p2, M_*1 = M_*2. So the mass ratio is 1.\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWhich is (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWait, but wait, earlier I thought K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3), but wait, wait:\n\nWait, let's re-express the equation. Earlier, I had K1/K2 = ( (M_p1/M_*1) / (M_p2/M_*2) )^(1/3) * (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nBut since both M_p and M_* are the same, that ratio is 1. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWait, but K1 is the velocity for planet #1, and K2 for planet #2. So:\n\nK1 = (G M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / (P1^(1/3)) )\n\nSimilarly, K2 = (G M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / (P2^(1/3)) )\n\nTaking the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 =5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWait, but wait, no. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, let me re-express the formula correctly. K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)). Because from the earlier formula, K = (constant) * (1/P^(1/3)).\n\nSo K1 = C / P1^(1/3)\n\nK2 = C / P2^(1/3)\n\nWhere C is the same for both because M_p and M_* are same.\n\nSo K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / ( C / P2^(1/3) ) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo rearranged, (K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1\n\nWe have K1=5, K2=7. So K1/K2=5/7.\n\nSo (5/7)^3 = P2 / P1\n\nSo P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3\n\nBut wait, the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the ratio is P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2 is about 0.364 times the period of P1, meaning it's shorter. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1, so planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Because if the RV shift (K) is larger, that implies a larger velocity. From the formula, higher K implies a larger planet mass, but in this case, the masses are same. So a larger K would imply a shorter orbital period because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 would be smaller than P1. So planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than planet #1.\n\nSo the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Since P2 is shorter, the ratio is less than 1. The options are looking for P2/P1.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure I got the formula right. Let me write down the formula again.\n\nWe have K = ( (G * M_p) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1-e\u00b2)^(1/2)) )^(1/3)\n\nWait, no, let me think of it another way. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (v) ) = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )\n\nAssuming M_p << M_*, sin i \u2248 1, and e=0, this simplifies to:\n\nK = ( (2 \u03c0 G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) )\n\nBut for the ratio between K1 and K2, since M_p and M_* are same, the ratio K1/K2 is proportional to (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWe have K1=5, K2=7. So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\n(5/7)^3 = P2/P1 \u2192 P2 = (125/343) P1 \u2248 0.364 P1.\n\nSo P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.364 times, so shorter.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\"\n\nSo P2 is shorter, so it's about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the ratio is approximately 0.36.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.\n\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectral lines of the host star, which is caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The RV semi-amplitude \\( K \\) is proportional to the inverse of the orbital period \\( P \\) raised to the power of \\( 1/3 \\), assuming the planet-to-star mass ratio is constant.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little back and forth as the planet orbits it, and that causes the spectral lines to shift wavelengths periodically.\n\nThe problem says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, each hosting a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So the stars are identical in mass, and the planets are roughly the same size, Neptune-like.\n\nThe data given is about the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.\n\nWait, I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the Doppler shift. The semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star in the radial direction. But here, the problem gives the wavelength shift, which I need to convert into velocity.\n\nRight, the Doppler shift formula connects the velocity of the star (v) to the wavelength shift (\u0394\u03bb). The formula is v = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c, where c is the speed of light. But since \u0394\u03bb and \u03bb are in the same units, and the shifts are given in milliangstroms, maybe I can find the ratio without knowing the exact wavelength.\n\nLet me think: the problem gives the shifts for each planet. For planet #1, \u0394\u03bb\u2081 = 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, \u0394\u03bb\u2082 =7 milliangstroms. Since the stars are the same, their rest wavelengths (\u03bb) are the same. So the velocity ratio v\u2081/v\u2082 would be (\u0394\u03bb\u2081)/(\u0394\u03bb\u2082) = 5/7 \u2248 0.714.\n\nBut wait, what determines the radial velocity semi-amplitude K? The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1 / (2\u03c0)) ) * (1 / ( (P) * (1 + (M_p/M_*) )^(2/3) )) ) )\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. I think a simpler approach would be to consider the relation between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_*, which is solar mass, we can approximate M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*. So the equation simplifies a bit.\n\nSo, K \u2248 ( (2\u03c0 G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p / M_*^(2/3) )\n\nBut since the stars have the same mass and the planets are similar to Neptune, M_p and M_* are roughly the same for both planets. So when comparing K\u2081 and K\u2082, the ratio K\u2081/K\u2082 would be proportional to ( (P\u2082 / P\u2081 )^(1/3) ) ), because:\n\nK \u221d (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)\n\nBut since M_p and M_* are the same for both, K \u221d 1/P^(1/3)\n\nWait, wait, let's write the formula for K more clearly.\n\nK = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (1) / ( (1 + (M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) )) )\n\nBut since e is zero for both (they're circular orbits), and M_p << M_*, we can approximate this as:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I've read that the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( ( (27 * pi * G ) / (4 c^3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(2/3) )) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to realize that the Doppler shift (velocity) is proportional to the semi-amplitude K. Since we have two planets, K\u2081 and K\u2082, which are the velocities causing the spectral shifts.\n\nThe observed Doppler shifts are proportional to K, because the velocity of the star (K) causes the wavelength shift. So if planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms and planet #2 causes 7, then K\u2081/K\u2082 = 5/7.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem gives the shift in wavelength, which is proportional to velocity. So the velocities (semi-amplitudes) are in the ratio K\u2081/K\u2082 = 5/7.\n\nSo K\u2081 = (5/7) K\u2082.\n\nBut from the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) )) )\n\nBut since M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, the ratio K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082^(1/3) ) / (P\u2081^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, because:\n\nK\u2081 = (constant) * (M_p / M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/(P\u2081^(1/3) ) )\n\nSimilarly, K\u2082 = (constant) * (M_p / M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/(P\u2082^(1/3) ) )\n\nSo K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082^(1/3) ) / (P\u2081^(1/3) )\n\nBut we know that K\u2081/K\u2082 = 5/7.\n\nSo,\n\n5/7 = (P\u2082 / P\u2081 )^(1/3)\n\nCube both sides:\n\n(5/7)^3 = P\u2082 / P\u2081\n\nWhich is (125)/(343) = P\u2082/P\u2081 \u2192 P\u2082 = (125/343) * P\u2081\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So we need P\u2082 / P\u2081.\n\nBut from the above, P\u2082 / P\u2081 = 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo the period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1. So it's about 0.36 times longer? Wait, no. Wait, if P\u2082 is smaller than P\u2081, then P\u2082 is shorter. So if P\u2082 is 0.36 times P\u2081, that means planet #2's period is shorter. So how many times longer is P\u2082 than P\u2081? If P\u2082 is shorter, then it's 0.36 times as long, meaning P\u2082 is about 0.36 times P\u2081. So the ratio P\u2082/P\u2081 is about 0.36.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So if K\u2081 is smaller than K\u2082, that implies that P\u2081 is larger than P\u2082.\n\nBecause K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K \u2192 smaller P.\n\nIn this case, K\u2081 is 5 milliangstrom, K\u2082 is 7. So K\u2081 < K\u2082 \u2192 P\u2081 > P\u2082.\n\nSo planet #1 has a longer period than planet #2.\n\nBut the question is, how many times longer is the period of planet #2 than that of planet #1? So P\u2082 is shorter, so the ratio is less than 1.\n\nWait, but I thought I had:\n\nK\u2081/K\u2082 = 5/7 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3)\n\nSo (5/7) cubed is 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P\u2082/P\u2081 = 0.364.\n\nSo the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter, not longer.\n\nBut the question asks, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1? So if P\u2082 is shorter, the factor is less than 1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me check the formula again. Maybe I got the ratio reversed.\n\nWait, the formula I have is K proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)). So K\u2081 = constant / P\u2081^(1/3), K\u2082 = constant / P\u2082^(1/3).\n\nTaking the ratio K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082^(1/3) ) / (P\u2081^(1/3) )\n\nSo K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3)\n\nWe know K\u2081/K\u2082 = 5/7, so (5/7) = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3)\n\nCube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P\u2082/P\u2081 \u2192 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P\u2082 is about 0.364 times P\u2081, meaning P\u2082 is shorter than P\u2081. So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? It's shorter, so the factor is about 0.36 times. So the answer is 0.36, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is inversely proportional to K^(3).\n\nSo P\u2082/P\u2081 = (K\u2081/K\u2082)^3.\n\nBecause P is proportional to 1/K^(3).\n\nSo K\u2081=5, K\u2082=7.\n\nSo P\u2082/P\u2081 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 \u2248 0.364. So the same result.\n\nSo the answer is 0.36, which is option A.\n",

So when comparing K\u2081 and K\u2082, the ratio K\u2081/K\u2082 would be proportional to ( (P\u2082 / P\u2081 )^(1/3) ) ), because:\n\nK \u221d (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)\n\nBut since M_p and M_* are the same for both, K \u221d 1/P^(1/3)\n\nWait, wait, let's write the formula for K more clearly.\n\nK = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (1) / ( (1 + (M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e\u00b2)^(0.5) )) )\n\nBut since e is zero for both (they're circular orbits), and M_p << M_*, we can approximate this as:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I've read that the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( ( (27 * pi * G ) / (4 c^3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(2/3) )) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to realize that the Doppler shift (velocity) is proportional to the semi-amplitude K. Since we have two planets, K\u2081 and K\u2082, which are the velocities causing the spectral shifts.\n\nThe observed Doppler shifts are proportional to K, because the velocity of the star (K) causes the wavelength shift. So if planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms and planet #2 causes 7, then K\u2081/K\u2082 = 5/7.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem gives the shift in wavelength, which is proportional to velocity. So the velocities (semi-amplitudes) are in the ratio K\u2081/K\u2082 = 5/7.\n\nSo K\u2081 = (5/7) K\u2082.\n\nBut from the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) )) )\n\nBut since M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, the ratio K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082^(1/3) ) / (P\u2081^(1/3) ) )\n\nWait, because:\n\nK\u2081 = (constant) * (M_p / M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/(P\u2081^(1/3) ) )\n\nSimilarly, K\u2082 = (constant) * (M_p / M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/(P\u2082^(1/3) ) )\n\nSo K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082^(1/3) ) / (P\u2081^(1/3) )\n\nBut we know that K\u2081/K\u2082 = 5/7.\n\nSo,\n\n5/7 = (P\u2082 / P\u2081 )^(1/3)\n\nCube both sides:\n\n(5/7)^3 = P\u2082 / P\u2081\n\nWhich is (125)/(343) = P\u2082/P\u2081 \u2192 P\u2082 = (125/343) * P\u2081\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So we need P\u2082 / P\u2081.\n\nBut from the above, P\u2082 / P\u2081 = 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo the period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1. So it's about 0.36 times longer? Wait, no. Wait, if P\u2082 is smaller than P\u2081, then P\u2082 is shorter. So if P\u2082 is 0.36 times P\u2081, that means planet #2's period is shorter. So how many times longer is P\u2082 than P\u2081? If P\u2082 is shorter, then it's 0.36 times as long, meaning P\u2082 is about 0.36 times P\u2081. So the ratio P\u2082/P\u2081 is about 0.36.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So if K\u2081 is smaller than K\u2082, that implies that P\u2081 is larger than P\u2082.\n\nBecause K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K \u2192 smaller P.\n\nIn this case, K\u2081 is 5 milliangstrom, K\u2082 is 7. So K\u2081 < K\u2082 \u2192 P\u2081 > P\u2082.\n\nSo planet #1 has a longer period than planet #2.\n\nBut the question is, how many times longer is the period of planet #2 than that of planet #1? So P\u2082 is shorter, so the ratio is less than 1.\n\nWait, but I thought I had:\n\nK\u2081/K\u2082 = 5/7 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3)\n\nSo (5/7) cubed is 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P\u2082/P\u2081 = 0.364.\n\nSo the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter, not longer.\n\nBut the question asks, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1? So if P\u2082 is shorter, the factor is less than 1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me check the formula again. Maybe I got the ratio reversed.\n\nWait, the formula I have is K proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)). So K\u2081 = constant / P\u2081^(1/3), K\u2082 = constant / P\u2082^(1/3).\n\nTaking the ratio K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082^(1/3) ) / (P\u2081^(1/3) )\n\nSo K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3)\n\nWe know K\u2081/K\u2082 = 5/7, so (5/7) = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3)\n\nCube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P\u2082/P\u2081 \u2192 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P\u2082 is about 0.364 times P\u2081, meaning P\u2082 is shorter than P\u2081. So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? It's shorter, so the factor is about 0.36 times. So the answer is 0.36, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is inversely proportional to K^(3).\n\nSo P\u2082/P\u2081 = (K\u2081/K\u2082)^3.\n\nBecause P is proportional to 1/K^(3).\n\nSo K\u2081=5, K\u2082=7.\n\nSo P\u2082/P\u2081 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 \u2248 0.364. So the same result.\n\nSo the answer is 0.36, which is option A.\n\n\nTo determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \\( K \\) and the orbital period \\( P \\). The radial velocity semi-amplitude \\( K \\) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, given by:\n\n\\[\nK \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nThe problem provides the wavelength shifts caused by the planets, which are proportional to their radial velocity semi-amplitudes \\( K_1 \\) and \\( K_2 \\). For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it is 7 milliangstroms. Thus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{7} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nCubing both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_2}{P_1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.364\n\\]\n\nThus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This means planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. Since the question asks how many times longer the period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately **0.36**.\n\nAnswer: A",

Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. \n\nThe question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.\n\nWait, so the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. I think the formula for the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by this formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance between them.\n\nThe formula I remember is K = (v) = (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/(1 AU))^(1/3) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Alternatively, I think K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / sqrt(P)) )? Or is it something else?\n\nWait, I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) * [ (sin i) / (c) ]\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less than Sun's mass), M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So that term becomes (G M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (2\u03c0 / P )^(1/3) * sin i / c.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The formula can be written as K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / M_star^(2/3) )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a more simplified version for when M_p << M_star:\n\nK \u2248 ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * c ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to relate K1 and K2 because M_p and M_star are the same for both planets. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses (Neptune), their M_p and M_star are the same.\n\nSo, for both planets, M_p and M_star are same, so K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3)) ) multiplied by some other factors.\n\nWait, let's think of the formula again. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = [ (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )\n\nSince M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can ignore the (1 + M_p/M_star) term, so it becomes approximately:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3) )\n\nBut since M_p and M_star are same for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 would be [ (P2/P1)^(1/3) ].\n\nWait, wait, let's rearrange the formula. Let me write K as proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nSo, K = (constant) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nSince M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).\n\nSo, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me re-express this:\n\nK1 = (constant) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P1^(1/3) )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nK2 = (constant) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P2^(1/3) )\n\nSo, taking the ratio K1/K2 = [ (1/P1^(1/3) ) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) ] = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )\n\nSo, K1 = K2 * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nWait, but in the question, Planet #1 has K1 = 5 mA, Planet #2 has K2 = 7 mA.\n\nSo, K1 / K2 = 5/7.\n\nAnd from the formula, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )\n\nSo,\n\n5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nWe need to find P2 / P1.\n\nSo, raising both sides to the power of 3:\n\n(5/7)^3 = P2/P1\n\nSo,\n\n125 / 343 = P2/P1\n\nSo,\n\nP2 = (125/343) * P1\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, that's (P2/P1) = 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo, P2 is approximately 0.364 times the period of P1. So, the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. So, the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1.\n\nWait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long, which is the same as saying P2 is 0.36 times P1. So, the ratio P2/P1 is ~0.36, meaning P2 is 0.36 times longer than P1? No, wait, no. Because if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter. So the question is how much longer is P2 than P1? So, if P2 is shorter, the answer would be less than 1. But the options include 0.36 as option A.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nA) ~0.36\n\nB) ~1.40\n\nC) ~1.96\n\nD) ~0.85\n\nSo the question is, the period of planet #2 is how many times longer than planet #1? So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long. So, the period is shorter, but the question is how many times longer. So the answer would be 0.36 times as long, meaning planet #2's period is shorter, and the ratio is 0.36. So the answer would be 0.36, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my setup.\n\nWait, let me think again. Because K is the velocity semi-amplitude. The larger K, the higher the velocity of the star. So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is7, K2 is larger. So the star is moving more for planet #2 than planet #1. But according to the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, if K2 is larger than K1, that would imply that P2 is smaller than P1, because K is larger when P is smaller.\n\nWait, because K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo, K1=5, K2=7.\n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nSo, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2 is 0.364 times P1. So, planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than planet #1. So, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, if P2 is 0.364 times P1, it's 36% of P1's period. So, P2 is 0.36 times longer than P1. Wait, no, because if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is shorter. So the period of planet #2 is shorter, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, the ratio is 0.36. So, the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as planet #1. So, the answer is option A, approximately 0.36.\n\nWait, but let me think about the formula again. Because the formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) * sin i / c\n\nAssuming M_p << M_star, this simplifies to K \u2248 (G M_p / M_star )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) * (sin i / c )\n\nSo, K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)) )\n\nSo, K \u221d 1/P^(1/3)\n\nSo, K1 = C / P1^(1/3)\n\nK2 = C / P2^(1/3)\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, yes, 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nSo, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 125 / 343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, the question is, how many times longer is the period of planet #2 than planet #1? Since 0.36 is less than 1, planet #2's period is shorter. So the answer is 0.36 times longer, which is option A.\n",

So, the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1.\n\nWait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long, which is the same as saying P2 is 0.36 times P1. So, the ratio P2/P1 is ~0.36, meaning P2 is 0.36 times longer than P1? No, wait, no. Because if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter. So the question is how much longer is P2 than P1? So, if P2 is shorter, the answer would be less than 1. But the options include 0.36 as option A.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nA) ~0.36\n\nB) ~1.40\n\nC) ~1.96\n\nD) ~0.85\n\nSo the question is, the period of planet #2 is how many times longer than planet #1? So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long. So, the period is shorter, but the question is how many times longer. So the answer would be 0.36 times as long, meaning planet #2's period is shorter, and the ratio is 0.36. So the answer would be 0.36, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my setup.\n\nWait, let me think again. Because K is the velocity semi-amplitude. The larger K, the higher the velocity of the star. So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is7, K2 is larger. So the star is moving more for planet #2 than planet #1. But according to the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, if K2 is larger than K1, that would imply that P2 is smaller than P1, because K is larger when P is smaller.\n\nWait, because K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo, K1=5, K2=7.\n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nSo, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2 is 0.364 times P1. So, planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than planet #1. So, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, if P2 is 0.364 times P1, it's 36% of P1's period. So, P2 is 0.36 times longer than P1. Wait, no, because if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is shorter. So the period of planet #2 is shorter, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, the ratio is 0.36. So, the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times as long as planet #1. So, the answer is option A, approximately 0.36.\n\nWait, but let me think about the formula again. Because the formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) * sin i / c\n\nAssuming M_p << M_star, this simplifies to K \u2248 (G M_p / M_star )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) * (sin i / c )\n\nSo, K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)) )\n\nSo, K \u221d 1/P^(1/3)\n\nSo, K1 = C / P1^(1/3)\n\nK2 = C / P2^(1/3)\n\nSo, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, yes, 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )\n\nSo, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 125 / 343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, the question is, how many times longer is the period of planet #2 than planet #1? Since 0.36 is less than 1, planet #2's period is shorter. So the answer is 0.36 times longer, which is option A.\n\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, \\( K \\), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \\( P \\), given by:\n\n\\[\nK \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}\n\\]\n\nFor two planets with similar masses orbiting stars of the same mass, the ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is related to the ratio of their orbital periods as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nFrom the problem, \\( K_1 = 5 \\, \\text{mA} \\) and \\( K_2 = 7 \\, \\text{mA} \\). Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{7} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nRaising both sides to the power of 3:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_2}{P_1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{125}{343} = \\frac{P_2}{P_1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.364\n\\]\n\nThis means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is **shorter** than that of planet #1 by a factor of approximately 0.36.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star wobble.\n\nThe setup: there are two stars with the same mass as each other and similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key point is the shift in the spectral lines observed. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms.\n\nThe question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. So, I need to find the ratio P2/P1.\n\nWait, the RV method detects the Doppler shift, which depends on the velocity of the star due to the planet. The velocity semi-amplitude K is what's measured. The formula I remember for K is K = (v * sin i), but since the orbits are circular, sin i is 1 because inclination i is 90 degrees (edge-on), which is when the maximum Doppler shift occurs. So, K is the velocity semi-amplitude.\n\nThe formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )... Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. Another approach: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (2\u03c0 G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )\n\nBut since M_p is much smaller than M_*, which is similar to the Sun, M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*. So the formula simplifies. Let me write this more accurately.\n\nThe formula I think is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think about the relation between K and P. Because if the stars are identical (same mass), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune), then the ratio of their velocities would be inversely proportional to the cube root of their orbital periods. Because K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / P^(1/3)).\n\nWait, I think the exact relation is K \u221d (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ). Since M_* is the same for both stars, and M_p is the same (both are Neptune mass), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Or wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1. Because K is higher when the period is shorter.\n\nWait, the question says that the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstrom, and for #2 it's 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.\n\nBut since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), that ratio would be (P1/P2)^(1/3). So:\n\nK2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)\n\nSo 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)\n\nWait, but I want P2/P1, so let me rearrange.\n\nTake both sides to the power of 3:\n\n(7/5)^3 = P1/P2\n\nSo P1/P2 = (7/5)^3 = (343)/(125) \u2248 2.744.\n\nWait, that would mean P1 is longer than P2 by a factor of ~2.744. But the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. So P2/P1 = 1/(2.744) \u2248 0.365. So about 0.36 times.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The RV method detects the star's velocity, and the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )\n\nBut since both planets have circular orbits, e=0, so that term is 1. So K is proportional to (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)).\n\nBut since both M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWait, because K1 is proportional to 1/P1^(1/3), K2 proportional to 1/P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).\n\nWait, but in the problem, K2 is larger than K1. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4. Which would be (P2/P1)^(1/3) = 7/5?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K \u221d 1/P^(1/3). So, K1 = C * 1/P1^(1/3), K2 = C * 1/P2^(1/3), where C is a constant because M_p and M_* are the same.\n\nSo K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nGiven that K1 is 5 and K2 is7, K1/K2 = 5/7.\n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nCubing both sides:\n\n(5/7)^3 = P2/P1\n\nSo P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2 is about 0.364 times the period of P1. That's about 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be option A) ~0.36.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people get confused between the cube and the square. Let me double-check the formula.\n\nAnother approach: The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination (which is 1 for edge-on), and the orbital period and distance.\n\nThe formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) )\n\nSince M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, and e=0, so:\n\nK \u2248 ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\nSo K is proportional to M_p / ( M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\nSince M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).\n\nWait, no. Wait, K1 is for planet 1, so K1 \u221d 1/P1^(1/3). Similarly, K2 \u221d 1/P2^(1/3).\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWhich rearranges to (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, K1/K2 =5/7. So:\n\n5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nCube both sides:\n\n(5/7)^3 = P2/P1\n\n5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. 125/343 \u2248 0.364.\n\nSo P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So that would be 0.36 times, meaning P2 is shorter. But wait, the question is phrased: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\n\nSo if P2 is shorter, then the answer is less than 1. So the correct option is A) ~0.36.\n\nAlternatively, another way: Let's say planet #1 has a period P1, and planet #2 has P2. The ratio is P2/P1.\n\nWe found P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.364. So it's about 0.36 times as long, so planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. So how many times longer is #2's period than #1's? It's not; it's shorter. So the ratio is 0.36, meaning #2's period is ~36% the length of #1's.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A.\n",

The semi-amplitude \\( K \\) is inversely proportional to \\( P^{1/3} \\), given by:\n\n\\[\nK \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}\n\\]\n\nSince both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses, the proportionality simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nFrom the problem, \\( K_1 = 5 \\, \\text{milliangstroms} \\) and \\( K_2 = 7 \\, \\text{milliangstroms} \\). Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}\n\\]\n\nEquating this to the proportionality:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{7} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nCubing both sides to solve for \\( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_2}{P_1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.364\n\\]\n\nThus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately \\( 0.36 \\) times the orbital period of Planet #1. This means Planet #2's period is shorter than Planet #1's. The question asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1, and the answer is approximately \\( 0.36 \\).\n\nAnswer: A",
