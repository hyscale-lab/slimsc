      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about energy levels and their lifetimes, and figuring out the energy difference needed so that two states can be clearly distinguished.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The question is asking which energy difference between them allows us to clearly resolve these two levels. The options are A through D, with various exponents on 10 and eV units.\n\nHmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) and the uncertainty in time (\u0394t) is on the order of \u0127 (h-bar), which is Planck's constant over 2\u03c0. So, the formula is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2 or something like that. Wait, actually, the exact form is \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, but sometimes people use \u0394E \u0394t \u2248 \u0127 for order of magnitude estimates.\n\nIn this problem, the lifetimes of the states are given. I think the lifetimes are related to the uncertainty in time, \u0394t. Wait, the lifetime \u03c4 is the average lifetime of the state, so the uncertainty in time \u0394t would be on the order of \u03c4 itself, perhaps. So maybe I can take \u0394t as approximately \u03c4.\n\nSo the lifetimes are 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. The energy difference \u0394E must be such that the uncertainty principle allows us to resolve them. That is, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state so that we can distinguish them.\n\nWait, no. Because each state has its own uncertainty. Let me think again. Suppose we have two states with different energies, E1 and E2. The uncertainty in energy for each state is \u0394E_i \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4_i. So for E1, \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / (1e-9 s), and for E2, \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / (1e-8 s).\n\nWait, but when we have two states, the energy difference \u0394E between them needs to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, right? Or perhaps it's the other way around. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the two states would blur together and we wouldn't be able to resolve them.\n\nWait, maybe more accurately, the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the individual uncertainties. Or perhaps each state's uncertainty allows us to set a minimum detectable \u0394E. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the resolving power of the measurements.\n\nWait, maybe the key idea is that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy of each state so that they can be distinguished. So, the energy difference \u0394E should be larger than the uncertainties of each state.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Each state has an energy uncertainty of about \u0127/\u03c4. So for E1, \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(1e-9 s). And for E2, \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(1e-8 s). So, \u0394E1 is 10 times larger than \u0394E2, since \u03c41 is 1e-9 and \u03c42 is 1e-8 (so \u03c41 is 1/10 of \u03c42; thus, \u0394E1 is 10 times \u0394E2).\n\nWait, so the uncertainty in each state's energy is \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. To distinguish E1 and E2, the energy difference between them must be larger than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. Otherwise, the two energies could be within each other's uncertainty, making it impossible to tell them apart.\n\nSo, \u0394E must be greater than the maximum of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. So, let's compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u0127. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. So \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo, for E1, \u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = 1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s / 1e-9 s = 1.05457e-25 J.\n\nSimilarly, for E2, \u0394E2 = \u0127 / \u03c42 = 1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s / 1e-8 s = 1.05457e-26 J.\n\nWait, but wait, that's in joules. Let me convert that to electron volts because the options are in eV.\n\nI know that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So, to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 in eV: (1.05457e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) \u2248 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 = (1.05457e-26 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) \u2248 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 is about 6.58e-8 eV. So, the larger uncertainty is \u0394E1, which is 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nTherefore, to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference between them must be larger than this maximum uncertainty, which is \u0394E \u2248 6.58e-7 eV. So, the energy difference should be greater than about 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 1e-9 is smaller than 6.58e-7 \u2192 can't resolve.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 way smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 6.58e-7 eV \u2192 so this would work.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 which is 1e-8, which is smaller than 6.58e-7 (since 6.58e-7 is 6.58 * 1e-7, which is 658e-9, or about 6.58e-7 is 65.8e-8, so 1e-8 is way smaller than that).\n\nSo, only option C is larger than the required 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. But when considering the energy difference, perhaps the uncertainty comes from both states. Because if you have two states, their combined uncertainty would be the sum of their individual uncertainties?\n\nWait, no, because each state's uncertainty is for its own energy. The energy difference between them would have a different uncertainty. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference \u0394E between the two states should be such that the uncertainty in \u0394E is less than the energy difference. So, how is the uncertainty in \u0394E calculated?\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this differently. If the two states are E1 and E2, each with their own uncertainties \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, then the uncertainty in the energy difference \u0394E = E2 - E1 would be the sum of the uncertainties, because \u0394E = (E2 \u00b1 \u0394E2) - (E1 \u00b1 \u0394E1) = (E2-E1) \u00b1 (\u0394E2 + \u0394E1).\n\nSo, for the energy difference to be resolvable, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties.\n\nWait, but that would mean \u0394E must be greater than \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nWait, let me compute that. So, from earlier, \u0394E1 was about 6.58e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 was 6.58e-8 eV. So sum is approximately 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference \u0394E should be greater than 7.238e-7 eV to be resolvable.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 1e-8, so 1e-4 is much larger than 7.238e-7. So option C is way bigger than needed.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the energy difference just needs to be larger than the uncertainty of each individual state. Because if the energy difference is bigger than either of the uncertainties, then you can tell them apart.\n\nSo, if \u0394E > \u0394E1 and \u0394E > \u0394E2, then you can resolve them. So, \u0394E has to be larger than the larger of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. Which in this case is \u0394E1, which is 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSo, the energy difference must be larger than 6.58e-7 eV. So, looking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV. 1e-4 is larger than 6.58e-7 (since 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658). So yes, option C is way bigger, so it would satisfy the condition.\n\nThe other options are smaller than 6.58e-7, so they wouldn't work. For example, option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, much smaller than 6.58e-7.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to the concept, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D, each with different energy differences.\n\nHmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play, especially when dealing with energy and time. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle! I think it's something like \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me try to recall. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) and the uncertainty in time (\u0394t) is approximately equal to \u0127 divided by 2\u03c0. Or maybe it's \u0127 over 2? I'm not entirely sure about the exact coefficient, but I know it's something like \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127.\n\nSo, in this problem, the lifetimes of the states are given. I think the lifetime relates to the uncertainty in time. Wait, the lifetime \u03c4 is the time for which the state exists before decaying. So the uncertainty in time \u0394t would be on the order of the lifetime. But wait, I've heard that sometimes \u0394t is taken as the lifetime itself, or maybe half of it, but I'm not sure. Maybe for this purpose, we can approximate \u0394t as the lifetime \u03c4.\n\nSo for each state, E1 has a lifetime \u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds, and E2 has \u03c42 = 1e-8 seconds. Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the energy difference \u0394E = E2 - E1. We need to find what \u0394E should be so that the two states can be clearly resolved.\n\nI think the key here is that for the energy levels to be distinguishable, their energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy, which is given by the uncertainty principle. So the energy difference \u0394E should be greater than or equal to \u0127/\u03c4, or something like that. Because if \u0394E is too small, the two states might not be resolvable due to the uncertainty.\n\nWait, let me get the formula straight. The uncertainty principle for energy and time is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. So the minimum \u0394E needed to distinguish two states would be about \u0127/(2\u0394t), where \u0394t is the uncertainty in time, which here is the lifetime of the state. But wait, which lifetime do we use? Since the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1, each with their own lifetimes. Hmm, maybe I should calculate the uncertainty for each state and see what that implies.\n\nWait, no. Because the two states have different lifetimes, but when measuring their energies, the time uncertainty for each would be their own lifetime. So, for the first state, \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c41), and for the second state, \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u03c42). But wait, wait. No, I think I'm getting confused. The question is about the energy difference between the two levels, so perhaps the relevant \u0394t is the time it takes to measure the energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be such that the uncertainty in the energy measurement (due to the lifetimes) is less than the energy difference. So \u0394E > (\u0394E1 + \u0394E2)/something. Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's better to think about the energy resolution. The energy resolution would be determined by the time available for measurement. The longer the lifetime, the lower the energy uncertainty.\n\nSo the maximum uncertainty in energy for each state is approximately \u0127/(2\u03c4). So for E1, the uncertainty is \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u03c41), and for E2, \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u03c42). But since we're looking at the energy difference between E2 and E1, perhaps the total uncertainty is the sum of the two uncertainties. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty in the energy difference would be the difference in the uncertainties, or the sum, or something else. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying it by saying that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty associated with one of the states. Because if \u0394E is greater than the uncertainty, then the two states can be distinguished.\n\nWait, let's think about the given lifetimes. \u03c41 is 1e-9 seconds, and \u03c42 is 1e-8 seconds. So \u03c42 is ten times larger than \u03c41. Since \u03c4 is in the denominator of the uncertainty, the larger \u03c4 is, the smaller the uncertainty. So E2's energy is known more precisely than E1's.\n\nBut the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So perhaps the relevant uncertainty is the sum of the uncertainties of both states. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty is the larger of the two. Hmm, I'm not exactly certain, but perhaps the idea is that the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty associated with the measurement.\n\nWait, perhaps the energy difference \u0394E must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The energy difference must be such that the uncertainty in the energy of each state is less than the difference between E2 and E1. So, for E1, the uncertainty is \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u03c41), and for E2, \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u03c42). The energy difference \u0394E should be greater than the sum of these uncertainties to ensure clear distinguishability.\n\nSo \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nBut let's compute the numbers.\n\nFirst, compute \u0127. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. So \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nLet me compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nFor E1: \u03c41 = 1e-9 s.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2 \u03c41) = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = approx 5.27e-26 J.\n\nConvert J to eV. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so \u0394E1 in eV is 5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for E2: \u03c42 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 \u03c42) = 1.0545718e-34 / (2e-8) = approx 5.27e-27 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 5.27e-27 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainties are about 3.29e-7 eV for E1 and 3.29e-8 eV for E2.\n\nIf we're looking for \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, that would be 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = approximately 3.62e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, let's see what's available.\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, it's definitely larger than the required uncertainty, so it would be resolvable.\n\nOption A is 1e-9 eV, which is smaller than 3.6e-7, so not sufficient.\n\nOption B is 1e-11 eV, also way too small.\n\nOption D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 0.00000001 eV. Hmm, that's larger than 3.29e-8 eV (the uncertainty of E2), but smaller than 3.29e-7 eV (the uncertainty of E1). So if \u0394E is 1e-8 eV, it's less than the sum (3.6e-7), so perhaps not enough. But wait, the sum is the total uncertainty.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the correct approach is to sum the uncertainties or take the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each state's uncertainty contributes, and the energy difference needs to be greater than the maximum uncertainty. But in that case, the maximum uncertainty is about 3.29e-7 eV. So any \u0394E above that would be resolvable.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way above that, so it's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the combined uncertainty, which is the sum of each individual uncertainty. In that case, 3.6e-7 eV is the threshold. The options given are A) 1e-9, B) 1e-11, C) 1e-4, D)1e-8.\n\nSo option C is way above 3.6e-7 eV, so it's suitable. The others are below.\n\nWait, but let's think about the actual formula. The energy-time uncertainty principle says that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. So the minimum detectable energy difference is on the order of \u0127/\u0394t, where \u0394t is the time the system is observed. In this case, the lifetimes are given as \u03c4, so the maximum \u0394t we can have is \u03c4, because the system doesn't last longer than that. So the uncertainty in energy is about \u0127/(2\u03c4).\n\nSo for E1, the uncertainty is around 3.29e-7 eV, and E2's is 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference \u0394E must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if \u0394E is larger than the larger uncertainty, it's resolvable.\n\nIn that case, the larger uncertainty is 3.29e-7 eV. So any \u0394E above that is resolvable.\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 1e4 times larger than 3.29e-7, so it's definitely larger.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but what about the other option D, which is 1e-8 eV. That's about 0.00000001 eV. The uncertainty for E1 is 3.29e-7 eV, which is 3.29e-7 = 3.29e-7 eV. So 1e-8 is less than that. So if the energy difference is 1e-8 eV, it's smaller than the uncertainty in E1, so it's not resolvable.\n\nSo only options with \u0394E above 3.29e-7 eV would be resolvable. The only option that meets this is option C (1e-4 eV).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n",

Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so \u0394E1 in eV is 5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for E2: \u03c42 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 \u03c42) = 1.0545718e-34 / (2e-8) = approx 5.27e-27 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 5.27e-27 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainties are about 3.29e-7 eV for E1 and 3.29e-8 eV for E2.\n\nIf we're looking for \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, that would be 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = approximately 3.62e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, let's see what's available.\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 3.6e-7 eV.

But wait, the sum is the total uncertainty.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the correct approach is to sum the uncertainties or take the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each state's uncertainty contributes, and the energy difference needs to be greater than the maximum uncertainty. But in that case, the maximum uncertainty is about 3.29e-7 eV. So any \u0394E above that would be resolvable.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way above that, so it's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the combined uncertainty, which is the sum of each individual uncertainty. In that case, 3.6e-7 eV is the threshold. The options given are A) 1e-9, B) 1e-11, C) 1e-4, D)1e-8.\n\nSo option C is way above 3.6e-7 eV, so it's suitable. The others are below.\n\nWait, but let's think about the actual formula. The energy-time uncertainty principle says that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. So the minimum detectable energy difference is on the order of \u0127/\u0394t, where \u0394t is the time the system is observed. In this case, the lifetimes are given as \u03c4, so the maximum \u0394t we can have is \u03c4, because the system doesn't last longer than that. So the uncertainty in energy is about \u0127/(2\u03c4).\n\nSo for E1, the uncertainty is around 3.29e-7 eV, and E2's is 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference \u0394E must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if \u0394E is larger than the larger uncertainty, it's resolvable.\n\nIn that case, the larger uncertainty is 3.29e-7 eV. So any \u0394E above that is resolvable.\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 1e4 times larger than 3.29e-7, so it's definitely larger.\n\nSo the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but what about the other option D, which is 1e-8 eV. That's about 0.00000001 eV. The uncertainty for E1 is 3.29e-7 eV, which is 3.29e-7 = 3.29e-7 eV. So 1e-8 is less than that.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step. \n\nThe question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The formula is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. \n\nSo, the lifetime here is \u0394t. But wait, the lifetimes given are for each state. I think the principle says that the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So for each state, the uncertainty in their energy would be around \u0127/(2\u0394t).\n\nLet me compute that. I think \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But wait, since the options are in eV, maybe I should convert units properly. Oh right, 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 joules.\n\nSo, for E1 with \u0394t = 1e-9 seconds:\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2*\u0394t) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) \u2248 5.27e-26 J. Convert that to eV: 5.27e-26 J * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) \u2248 3.29e-7 eV. So about 3e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for E2 with \u0394t =1e-8 seconds:\n\u0394E2 \u2248 (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) = 5.27e-27 J.

Actually, each state has its own uncertainty. But I'm not sure if I should consider the difference between the two. \n\nWait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1, right? So the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Or is it the sum of their individual uncertainties?\n\nWait, maybe the way to think about it is that for two states to be resolved, their energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't distinguish them.\n\nSo, the energy difference \u0394E = |E2 - E1| must be greater than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nWait, but which uncertainty matters here? Because each state has its own uncertainty. So, the total uncertainty when measuring the energy difference would be the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because when you measure the difference between two energies, the uncertainty is the quadrature sum or something. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the uncertainty in the energy difference. Suppose each energy has an uncertainty \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. Then the uncertainty in their difference would be sqrt(\u0394E1^2 + \u0394E2^2). But maybe, for an approximate calculation, we can take the sum, especially if one uncertainty is much larger than the other.\n\nLooking at our earlier calculations, \u0394E1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 is about 3.29e-8 eV. So \u0394E1 is about ten times larger than \u0394E2. So when adding in quadrature, the total uncertainty would be approximately sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) \u2248 3.3e-7 eV, since the second term is negligible.\n\nSo the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than this uncertainty to be distinguishable. So \u0394E > 3.3e-7 eV.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 eV \u2192 way smaller than 3e-7.\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 1e4 * 1e-8, so much larger than 3e-7. So 1e-4 eV is 1e4 * 3e-7 = 30e-4 eV, which is larger. So option C is way above the needed.\n\nWait wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV. 3.3e-7 is 0.00000033 eV. So yes, 0.0001 is larger than that.\n\nOption D) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 3.3e-7. So the energy difference must be larger than 3.3e-7 eV.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The formula I think is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, sometimes it's written with a factor of \u03c0/2 or something like that. Oh, right, sometimes it's approximated as \u0394E\u0394t \u2248 \u0127, but I'm not sure about the exact factor. Maybe for this problem, the exact factor isn't crucial, but the order of magnitude is.\n\nSo the idea is that the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (\u0394t). A longer lifetime means a smaller uncertainty in energy because the energy is more precisely known. So, to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Otherwise, the two states would overlap, and we couldn't distinguish them.\n\nWait, but how exactly do the lifetimes of each state affect the uncertainty in their energy? Each state has its own lifetime, so each has its own uncertainty in energy. So for state 1 with lifetime \u03c41 = 1e-9 sec, the uncertainty \u0394E1 is approximately \u0127/(\u03c41). Similarly, for state 2, \u0394E2 is \u0127/(\u03c42). But since \u03c42 is longer, \u0394E2 is smaller than \u0394E1.\n\nBut wait, when we're trying to resolve two energy levels, E2 and E1, the energy difference \u0394E = |E2 - E1| must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, I think. Because if the difference is smaller than either uncertainty, then the states might not be resolvable. Alternatively, perhaps it's the larger of the two uncertainties that matters. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy resolution. To distinguish two states, their energies must be separated by more than the uncertainty in energy. So if each state has an uncertainty \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, then the difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum of the uncertainties, the lines might overlap.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's the maximum uncertainty between the two. Because if one uncertainty is much bigger than the other, perhaps the sum isn't the right approach. Let me think. Let's say state 1 has a larger uncertainty, \u0394E1, and state 2 has a smaller \u0394E2. Then, the energy difference \u0394E should be greater than \u0394E1. Because if the difference is larger than \u0394E1, then even though state 2's energy is uncertain by \u0394E2, the separation is still clear. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required is that \u0394E is greater than the maximum of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the energy difference is bigger than the larger uncertainty, then it's definitely resolvable. For example, if one state has a very broad peak (large \u0394E), and the other is a narrow peak (small \u0394E), the separation only needs to be more than the broad peak's width. Because the narrow peak is well-defined, so as long as the two are separated by more than the width of the broader peak, they can be distinguished.\n\nSo in this case, the lifetimes are \u03c41 = 1e-9 s and \u03c42 = 1e-8 s. So \u03c42 is ten times longer than \u03c41. Therefore, \u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 and \u0394E2 = \u0127 / \u03c42. Since \u03c42 is larger, \u0394E2 is smaller than \u0394E1. So the larger uncertainty is \u0394E1.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than \u0394E1. Let's compute \u0394E1.\n\nWhat's the value of \u0127? Approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are given in eV, I should convert units. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So let's compute \u0394E1 in eV.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41\n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\n\u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s\n\u03c41 = 1e-9 s\n\n\u0394E1 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J\n\nNow convert J to eV:\n\n1 J = 1 / (1.602e-19) eV \u2248 6.242e18 eV\nSo,\n\n\u0394E1 = 1.0545718e-25 J * (6.242e18 eV/J) \u2248 (1.0545718e-25) * (6.242e18) eV\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1.05457e-25 * 6.242e18 \u2248 (1.05457 * 6.242) * 1e-7 \u2248 (6.58) * 1e-7 eV \u2248 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nWait, that's 6.58e-7 eV. Hmm, so approximately 7e-7 eV. But let me double-check the math:\n\n1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s / 1e-9 s = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nConvert J to eV:\n\n1 J = 6.242e18 eV, so:\n\n1.05457e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J = 1.05457e-25 * 6.242e18 = (1.05457 * 6.242) * 1e-7.\n\nCompute 1.05457 * 6.242:\n\n1.05457 * 6 \u2248 6.327, 1.05457 * 0.242 \u2248 ~0.255. So total \u2248 6.327 + 0.255 = 6.582. So about 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 \u2248 6.58e-7 eV, or approximately 6.6e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than this value for them to be distinguishable. Let's look at the options.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 eV \u2192 way smaller than 6.6e-7 eV.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.6e-7 eV. So that's way bigger, so it's resolvable.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.001e-5 eV \u2192 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8 eV, which is 1e-8 eV. Wait, 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV. Our required \u0394E is about 6.6e-7 eV, which is 0.00000066 eV.\n\nSo 1e-8 eV is smaller than 6.6e-7 eV, because 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, and 6.6e-7 is 6.6e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller, so it's not enough. So option D is 1e-8 eV, which is less than the required 6.6e-7 eV.\n\nWait, no, wait: 1e-8 is 0.1e-7. 6.6e-7 is 6.6e-7, which is 660e-9. So 1e-8 is 10e-9. So 10e-9 is much less than 660e-9, so 1e-8 is smaller than 6.6e-7. So the energy difference must be larger than 6.6e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than that is option C, 1e-4 eV. Because 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 = 100e-6 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is way bigger than 6.6e-7.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Did I compute the \u0394E correctly? Because I think I might have mixed up the exponents.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculation of \u0394E1.\n\n\u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s\n\n\u03c41 = 1e-9 s\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = (1.0545718e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nConvert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo, 1 J = 1 / 1.602e-19 eV \u2248 6.242e18 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 = 1.0545718e-25 J * (6.242e18 eV/J) = (1.05457e-25) * (6.242e18) eV.\n\nMultiplying 1.05457e-25 by 6.242e18: Let's think in terms of exponents. 1e-25 * 1e18 = 1e-7. So 1.05457 * 6.242 \u2248 6.58, so 6.58e-7 eV. So about 6.58e-7 eV, which is 6.58 * 1e-7 eV, which is 0.000000658 eV.\n\nSo, 6.58e-7 eV is the same as 6.58 * 1e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.58e-7 eV. So yes, that's definitely resolvable.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the actual energy difference. Because the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1, which would be \u0394E = E2 - E1. So for them to be clearly resolved, \u0394E must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. But wait, perhaps it's the sum of the uncertainties? Or the maximum of the two.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The uncertainty principle for each state is \u0394E_i \u2248 \u0127/\u03c4_i.\n\nSo for state 1, \u0394E1 = \u0127/\u03c41 \u2248 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nState 2 has \u03c42 = 1e-8 s, so \u0394E2 = \u0127/\u03c42 = (1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1e-8 s) = 1.05457e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.05457e-26 J * 6.242e18 eV/J = (1.05457e-26) * 6.242e18 = (1.05457 * 6.242) * 1e-8 eV.\n\nWhich is about 6.58 * 1e-8 eV, which is 6.58e-8 eV, or 0.0000000658 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E2 is about 6.58e-8 eV, which is smaller than \u0394E1.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than both, then it's resolvable.\n\nWait, no. Because each state has its own uncertainty. So when you have two states, the combined uncertainty isn't just the sum, but perhaps the maximum. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than the sum, then their energy levels don't overlap. Hmm.\n\nWait, for example, if E1 is uncertain by \u0394E1 and E2 is uncertain by \u0394E2, then the minimum separation for clear distinction would be when the lower end of E2's uncertainty is above the higher end of E1's uncertainty.\n\nSo E2 - \u0394E2 > E1 + \u0394E1.\n\nSo the required \u0394E = E2 - E1 > (\u0394E1 + \u0394E2).\n\nBecause if E2 - E1 > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, then the two energy ranges don't overlap.\n\nIn this case, \u0394E1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, \u0394E2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 = 6.58e-7 + 0.658e-7 = 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo the required \u0394E must be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, the only option that is bigger than 7.24e-7 eV is option C: 1e-4 eV, which is much larger. The other options are all smaller.\n\nWait, but the options given are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 eV \u2192 1e-9 is 0.001 * 1e-6 \u2192 which is way below 1e-7.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 \u2192 much larger.\n\nD) 1e-8 \u2192 0.01e-6 \u2192 which is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01e-6, which is 1e-8 = 0.00000001 eV. So 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, which is 0.1e-7 eV. The required \u0394E is about 7.2e-7 eV, so 0.72e-6 eV. So 1e-8 is much smaller than that.\n\nSo the only option that's larger than the required sum is option C, 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 7.2e-7 eV. So yes, that's sufficient.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because 1e-4 eV seems like a very large energy difference. In real experiments, such as in atomic or nuclear physics, energy differences are usually on the order of eV or smaller, but in terms of distinguishability, perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: the energy difference is the separation between E1 and E2. So for them to be distinguishable, this separation must be larger than the uncertainties in each state.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The natural linewidth is given by \u0394E = \u0127/\u03c4. So for state 1, the linewidth is about 6.58e-7 eV, and state 2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo the lines for E1 and E2 would each have a certain width. The separation between the lines must be larger than the sum of the half-widths for them to be resolvable.\n\nWait, but in terms of the total width, each line has a width of \u0394E. So the separation between the peaks (E2 - E1) must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties (\u0394E1 + \u0394E2) to be clearly distinguishable.\n\nSo again, the required \u0394E is about 7.2e-7 eV.\n\nSo among the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than that.\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The formula I think is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, sometimes it's written with a factor of \u03c0/2 or something like that. Oh, right, sometimes it's approximated as \u0394E\u0394t \u2248 \u0127, but I'm not sure about the exact factor. Maybe for this problem, the exact factor isn't crucial, but the order of magnitude is.\n\nSo the idea is that the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (\u0394t). A longer lifetime means a smaller uncertainty in energy because the energy is more precisely known. So, to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Otherwise, the two states would overlap, and we couldn't distinguish them.\n\nWait, but how exactly do the lifetimes of each state affect the uncertainty in their energy? Each state has its own lifetime, so each has its own uncertainty in energy. So for state 1 with lifetime \u03c41 = 1e-9 sec, the uncertainty \u0394E1 is approximately \u0127/(\u03c41). Similarly, for state 2, \u0394E2 is \u0127/(\u03c42). But since \u03c42 is longer, \u0394E2 is smaller than \u0394E1.\n\nBut wait, when we're trying to resolve two energy levels, E2 and E1, the energy difference \u0394E = |E2 - E1| must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, I think. Because if the difference is smaller than either uncertainty, then the states might not be resolvable. Alternatively, perhaps it's the larger of the two uncertainties that matters. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy resolution. To distinguish two states, their energies must be separated by more than the uncertainty in energy. So if each state has an uncertainty \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, then the difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum of the uncertainties, the lines might overlap.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's the maximum uncertainty between the two. Because if one uncertainty is much bigger than the other, perhaps the sum isn't the right approach. Let me think. Let's say state 1 has a larger uncertainty, \u0394E1, and state 2 has a smaller \u0394E2. Then, the energy difference \u0394E should be greater than \u0394E1. Because if the difference is larger than \u0394E1, then even though state 2's energy is uncertain by \u0394E2, the separation is still clear. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required is that \u0394E is greater than the maximum of \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the energy difference is bigger than the larger uncertainty, then it's definitely resolvable. For example, if one state has a very broad peak (large \u0394E), and the other is a narrow peak (small \u0394E), the separation only needs to be more than the broad peak's width. Because the narrow peak is well-defined, so as long as the two are separated by more than the width of the broader peak, they can be distinguished.\n\nSo in this case, the lifetimes are \u03c41 = 1e-9 s and \u03c42 = 1e-8 s. So \u03c42 is ten times longer than \u03c41. Therefore, \u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 and \u0394E2 = \u0127 / \u03c42. Since \u03c42 is larger, \u0394E2 is smaller than \u0394E1. So the larger uncertainty is \u0394E1.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than \u0394E1. Let's compute \u0394E1.\n\nWhat's the value of \u0127? Approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are given in eV, I should convert units. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So let's compute \u0394E1 in eV.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41\n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\n\u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s\n\u03c41 = 1e-9 s\n\n\u0394E1 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J\n\nNow convert J to eV:\n\n1 J = 1 / (1.602e-19) eV \u2248 6.242e18 eV\nSo,\n\n\u0394E1 = 1.0545718e-25 J * (6.242e18 eV/J) \u2248 (1.0545718e-25) * (6.242e18) eV\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1.05457e-25 * 6.242e18 \u2248 (1.05457 * 6.242) * 1e-7 \u2248 (6.58) * 1e-7 eV \u2248 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nWait, that's 6.58e-7 eV. Hmm, so approximately 7e-7 eV. But let me double-check the math:\n\n1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s / 1e-9 s = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nConvert J to eV:\n\n1 J = 6.242e18 eV, so:\n\n1.05457e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J = 1.05457e-25 * 6.242e18 = (1.05457 * 6.242) * 1e-7.\n\nCompute 1.05457 * 6.242:\n\n1.05457 * 6 \u2248 6.327, 1.05457 * 0.242 \u2248 ~0.255. So total \u2248 6.327 + 0.255 = 6.582. So about 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 \u2248 6.58e-7 eV, or approximately 6.6e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than this value for them to be distinguishable. Let's look at the options.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 eV \u2192 way smaller than 6.6e-7 eV.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.6e-7 eV. So that's way bigger, so it's resolvable.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.001e-5 eV \u2192 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8 eV, which is 1e-8 eV. Wait, 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV. Our required \u0394E is about 6.6e-7 eV, which is 0.00000066 eV.\n\nSo 1e-8 eV is smaller than 6.6e-7 eV, because 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, and 6.6e-7 is 6.6e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller, so it's not enough. So option D is 1e-8 eV, which is less than the required 6.6e-7 eV.\n\nWait, no, wait: 1e-8 is 0.1e-7. 6.6e-7 is 6.6e-7, which is 660e-9. So 1e-8 is 10e-9. So 10e-9 is much less than 660e-9, so 1e-8 is smaller than 6.6e-7. So the energy difference must be larger than 6.6e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than that is option C, 1e-4 eV. Because 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 = 100e-6 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is way bigger than 6.6e-7.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Did I compute the \u0394E correctly? Because I think I might have mixed up the exponents.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculation of \u0394E1.\n\n\u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s\n\n\u03c41 = 1e-9 s\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = (1.0545718e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nConvert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo, 1 J = 1 / 1.602e-19 eV \u2248 6.242e18 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 = 1.0545718e-25 J * (6.242e18 eV/J) = (1.05457e-25) * (6.242e18) eV.\n\nMultiplying 1.05457e-25 by 6.242e18: Let's think in terms of exponents. 1e-25 * 1e18 = 1e-7. So 1.05457 * 6.242 \u2248 6.58, so 6.58e-7 eV. So about 6.58e-7 eV, which is 6.58 * 1e-7 eV, which is 0.000000658 eV.\n\nSo, 6.58e-7 eV is the same as 6.58 * 1e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.58e-7 eV. So yes, that's definitely resolvable.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the actual energy difference. Because the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1, which would be \u0394E = E2 - E1. So for them to be clearly resolved, \u0394E must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. But wait, perhaps it's the sum of the uncertainties? Or the maximum of the two.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The uncertainty principle for each state is \u0394E_i \u2248 \u0127/\u03c4_i.\n\nSo for state 1, \u0394E1 = \u0127/\u03c41 \u2248 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nState 2 has \u03c42 = 1e-8 s, so \u0394E2 = \u0127/\u03c42 = (1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1e-8 s) = 1.05457e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.05457e-26 J * 6.242e18 eV/J = (1.05457e-26) * 6.242e18 = (1.05457 * 6.242) * 1e-8 eV.\n\nWhich is about 6.58 * 1e-8 eV, which is 6.58e-8 eV, or 0.0000000658 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E2 is about 6.58e-8 eV, which is smaller than \u0394E1.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than both, then it's resolvable.\n\nWait, no. Because each state has its own uncertainty. So when you have two states, the combined uncertainty isn't just the sum, but perhaps the maximum. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than the sum, then their energy levels don't overlap. Hmm.\n\nWait, for example, if E1 is uncertain by \u0394E1 and E2 is uncertain by \u0394E2, then the minimum separation for clear distinction would be when the lower end of E2's uncertainty is above the higher end of E1's uncertainty.\n\nSo E2 - \u0394E2 > E1 + \u0394E1.\n\nSo the required \u0394E = E2 - E1 > (\u0394E1 + \u0394E2).\n\nBecause if E2 - E1 > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, then the two energy ranges don't overlap.\n\nIn this case, \u0394E1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, \u0394E2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 = 6.58e-7 + 0.658e-7 = 7.238e-7 eV.\n\nSo the required \u0394E must be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, the only option that is bigger than 7.24e-7 eV is option C: 1e-4 eV, which is much larger. The other options are all smaller.\n\nWait, but the options given are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 eV \u2192 1e-9 is 0.001 * 1e-6 \u2192 which is way below 1e-7.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 \u2192 much larger.\n\nD) 1e-8 \u2192 0.01e-6 \u2192 which is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01e-6, which is 1e-8 = 0.00000001 eV. So 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, which is 0.1e-7 eV. The required \u0394E is about 7.2e-7 eV, so 0.72e-6 eV. So 1e-8 is much smaller than that.\n\nSo the only option that's larger than the required sum is option C, 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 7.2e-7 eV. So yes, that's sufficient.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because 1e-4 eV seems like a very large energy difference. In real experiments, such as in atomic or nuclear physics, energy differences are usually on the order of eV or smaller, but in terms of distinguishability, perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: the energy difference is the separation between E1 and E2. So for them to be distinguishable, this separation must be larger than the uncertainties in each state.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The natural linewidth is given by \u0394E = \u0127/\u03c4. So for state 1, the linewidth is about 6.58e-7 eV, and state 2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo the lines for E1 and E2 would each have a certain width. The separation between the lines must be larger than the sum of the half-widths for them to be resolvable.\n\nWait, but in terms of the total width, each line has a width of \u0394E. So the separation between the peaks (E2 - E1) must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties (\u0394E1 + \u0394E2) to be clearly distinguishable.\n\nSo again, the required \u0394E is about 7.2e-7 eV.\n\nSo among the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than that.\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\\( \\Delta E \\)) to the lifetime (\\( \\Delta t \\)) of the state: \n\n\\[\n\\Delta E \\Delta t \\approx \\hbar\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck's constant (\\( \\hbar \\approx 1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s} \\)).

When you have two states with their own uncertainties, the energy difference between them (\u0394E = E2 - E1) must be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. Because if \u0394E is smaller than the sum, then the two states could overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.\n\nSo, the formula would be: \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nEach \u0394E is given by \u0127 / \u03c4, where \u03c4 is the lifetime.\n\nSo, let me compute the energy uncertainty for each state.\n\nFirst, let's get the values straight. The lifetimes are \u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds and \u03c42 = 1e-8 seconds. So \u03c42 is ten times longer than \u03c41.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41, and \u0394E2 = \u0127 / \u03c42.\n\nSince \u0127 is approximately 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s, but wait, we're working in eV here, so I'll need to convert units.\n\nWait, another approach. The energy uncertainty \u0394E can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4.\n\nBut I should convert \u0127 into eV\u00b7s so that the units work out. I remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.6e-19 joules. So, let's compute \u0127 in eV\u00b7s.\n\nThe value of \u0127 is 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. Converting J to eV:\n\n1 J = 1/(1.6e-19) eV \u2248 6.242e18 eV.\n\nSo \u0127 in eV\u00b7s is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 eV / 1.6e-19 J) \u2248 (1.05457e-34) / (1.6e-19) ) eV\u00b7s \u2248 6.5923e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\n1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 eV / 1.602176634e-19 J) = (1.0545718e-34) / (1.602176634e-19) eV\u00b7s.\n\nCalculating that: 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602176634e-19 \u2248 (1.0545718 / 1.602176634) * 1e-15 \u2248 approx 0.6582 * 1e-15 = 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, the energy uncertainty for each state is \u0394E = \u0127 / \u03c4.\n\nFor \u03c41 = 1e-9 s: \u0394E1 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c42 = 1e-8 s: \u0394E2 = (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) ) = 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nWait, wait, wait.

Wait, 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7.24e-7 eV (which is 0.000000724 eV).\n\nWait, so the required \u0394E should be greater than 7.24e-7 eV. Let me see the options again.\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 * 1e6 eV = 1e2 * 1e-6 eV \u2192 1e-4 eV is much larger than 7.24e-7 eV. So that would work.\n\nOption D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7.24e-7 eV (0.000000724 eV). So D is smaller than the required.\n\nSo the correct energy difference must be larger than 7.24e-7 eV. The only option that is larger is option C: 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the formula is \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\n\u0394E1 is 6.582e-7 eV, \u0394E2 is 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, no, that's not relevant.\n\nWait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. So that's way bigger than 7.24e-7 eV (which is 7.24e-7 eV = 0.000000724 eV).\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, the energy uncertainty for \u03c41 is \u0127/\u03c41. Let me compute that again.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\n\u03c41 = 1e-9 s \u2192 \u0394E1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c42 = 1e-8 s \u2192 \u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nSum: 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = (6.582 + 0.6582) * 1e-7 \u2192 7.2402e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference needs to be larger than this sum. So the options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 \u2192 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 \u2192 0.000001 eV \u2192 way less than 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 which is 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV.\n\nWait, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV.\n\nSo 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo option C is the only one that's larger. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem statement, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So E2 - E1 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. So yes, option C is the only option that's larger than 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n",

I remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.6e-19 joules. So, let's compute \u0127 in eV\u00b7s.\n\nThe value of \u0127 is 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. Converting J to eV:\n\n1 J = 1/(1.6e-19) eV \u2248 6.242e18 eV.\n\nSo \u0127 in eV\u00b7s is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 eV / 1.6e-19 J) \u2248 (1.05457e-34) / (1.6e-19) ) eV\u00b7s \u2248 6.5923e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\n1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 eV / 1.602176634e-19 J) = (1.0545718e-34) / (1.602176634e-19) eV\u00b7s.\n\nCalculating that: 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602176634e-19 \u2248 (1.0545718 / 1.602176634) * 1e-15 \u2248 approx 0.6582 * 1e-15 = 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, the energy uncertainty for each state is \u0394E = \u0127 / \u03c4.\n\nFor \u03c41 = 1e-9 s: \u0394E1 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c42 = 1e-8 s: \u0394E2 = (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) ) = 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the exponents.\n\nWait, 1e-9 seconds is 10^-9 s.

Wait, 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7.24e-7 eV (which is 0.000000724 eV).\n\nWait, so the required \u0394E should be greater than 7.24e-7 eV. Let me see the options again.\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 * 1e6 eV = 1e2 * 1e-6 eV \u2192 1e-4 eV is much larger than 7.24e-7 eV. So that would work.\n\nOption D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7.24e-7 eV (0.000000724 eV). So D is smaller than the required.\n\nSo the correct energy difference must be larger than 7.24e-7 eV. The only option that is larger is option C: 1e-4 eV.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the formula is \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\n\u0394E1 is 6.582e-7 eV, \u0394E2 is 6.582e-8 eV. So sum is about 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than that.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 \u2192 0.001e-6 \u2192 1e-9 eV is 0.000000001 eV \u2192 much less than 7.24e-7.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 which is 1e-4 = 1e2 * 1e-6 \u2192 0.0001 eV is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV.\n\nWait, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 * 1e6 meV \u2192 1e2 meV. Wait, no, that's not relevant.\n\nWait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. So that's way bigger than 7.24e-7 eV (which is 7.24e-7 eV = 0.000000724 eV).\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, the energy uncertainty for \u03c41 is \u0127/\u03c41. Let me compute that again.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\n\u03c41 = 1e-9 s \u2192 \u0394E1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c42 = 1e-8 s \u2192 \u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nSum: 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = (6.582 + 0.6582) * 1e-7 \u2192 7.2402e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference needs to be larger than this sum. So the options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 \u2192 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 \u2192 0.000001 eV \u2192 way less than 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 which is 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV.\n\nWait, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV.\n\nSo 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo option C is the only one that's larger. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem statement, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So E2 - E1 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. So yes, option C is the only option that's larger than 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the energy uncertainty (\\( \\Delta E \\)) to the lifetime (\\( \\tau \\)) of the state as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( \\hbar \\) (reduced Planck's constant) is approximately \\( 6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{eV\u00b7s} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with measurements. Oh right, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle! It states that you can't precisely know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously; the more you know about one, the less you know about the other. But wait, this question is about energy and lifetime, so I think it's the time-energy version of the uncertainty principle.\n\nThe time-energy uncertainty principle is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, where \u0394E is the uncertainty in energy, \u0394t is the uncertainty in time (or the lifetime of the state), and \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. So, the idea is that if the energy levels are too close together (small \u0394E), they might not be distinguishable because the uncertainty in energy is larger than the actual energy difference.\n\nWait, but the question is about clearly distinguishing the two states. So the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy. If the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty, then they can be resolved. Otherwise, they blur together.\n\nSo, for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be \u0127 divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s. Oh wait, but sometimes people use units in eV\u00b7s. Let me think. 1 eV is 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 joules. So, \u0127 in eV\u00b7s would be \u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) \u2248 6.582 \u00d7 10^-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nNow, for each state, the uncertainty in energy \u0394E is \u0127 / \u03c4, where \u03c4 is the lifetime. Let's compute this for both states.\n\nFirst state: \u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 \u2248 (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nSecond state: \u03c42 = 1e-8 seconds.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127 / \u03c42 \u2248 (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) = 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The question is about the energy difference between the two states, E2 - E1, that needs to be resolved. So, to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, or perhaps each's uncertainty?\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty associated with each state. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWhen you have two energy levels, each has its own uncertainty. To resolve them, the energy difference should be larger than the combined uncertainties. Or perhaps, each's uncertainty is a separate factor. Alternatively, the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.\n\nWait, I think that the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in each state. Because if the difference is smaller than either uncertainty, then you can't tell them apart.\n\nWait, no. Let me think about it. Suppose E2 - E1 = \u0394E. For the two levels to be distinguishable, \u0394E must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or perhaps just greater than each of their uncertainties individually?\n\nWait, perhaps each state's uncertainty is the uncertainty in their own energy. So, if the two states have a separation larger than each's individual uncertainty, then they can be resolved. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.\n\nWait, but the energy difference is E2 - E1, so let's say it's a positive number. The uncertainty in E2 is \u0394E2, and the uncertainty in E1 is \u0394E1. So, to resolve E2 and E1, the energy difference must be greater than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. Because if the difference is less than either, you might not be able to tell them apart.\n\nSo, let's compute the required condition. For the two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference must be greater than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nWait, but looking at the numbers:\n\n\u0394E1 is 6.582e-7 eV. \u0394E2 is 6.582e-8 eV. So, the larger uncertainty is \u0394E1.\n\nSo, the energy difference needs to be greater than 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none of them are that big. Let me see the options.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-7 eV\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 0.0001e-7 eV\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 eV\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 1e-8 eV\n\nWait, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 6.58e-7 eV. So that's definitely larger.\n\nOption D is 1e-8 eV, which is larger than \u0394E2 (6.58e-8 eV is about 6.58e-8, so 1e-8 is smaller than that). So if the energy difference is 1e-8 eV, which is less than \u0394E2, then it's not distinguishable. But wait, \u0394E1 is larger.\n\nWait, so if the energy difference is 1e-8 eV, which is less than \u0394E1 (6.58e-7 eV), but larger than \u0394E2 (6.58e-8 eV). So, does that mean that it's above the uncertainty of the second state but below the first? Hmm, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose you have two states, E1 and E2. The uncertainty in E1 is \u0394E1, and the uncertainty in E2 is \u0394E2. The energy difference between them is \u0394E = E2 - E1.\n\nTo distinguish them, the difference \u0394E must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps, the energy difference must be greater than the individual uncertainties.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the energy levels can be resolved if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So, \u0394E should be greater than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nBut wait, let's compute the maximum of the two uncertainties. \u0394E1 is 6.58e-7 eV, which is much bigger than \u0394E2 (6.58e-8 eV). So, the energy difference must be larger than 6.58e-7 eV to be resolved.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. Wait, 6.58e-7 eV is 0.000000658 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is much larger than 0.000000658. So option C would satisfy the condition.\n\nBut wait, none of the other options are that big. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 0.00000001 eV, which is less than \u0394E1. So that wouldn't work.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Another thought: the lifetime given for each state is the lifetime of each state. So perhaps the uncertainty in energy for each state is based on their own lifetimes. So the energy of each state can only be determined within the uncertainty of \u0127/\u03c4.\n\nBut when you have two states, the energy difference \u0394E must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference. So perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or, perhaps the uncertainty in \u0394E is the same as the uncertainty of each state, whichever is larger. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference, which would be the sum of the uncertainties of each state.\n\nWait, that's another approach. Let me think. If you have two states, their energy difference's uncertainty would be the sum of their individual uncertainties. So \u0394E_diff = \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nSo, in this case, \u0394E_diff = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo, for the energy difference to be clearly resolved, the actual \u0394E must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 7.24e-7 eV is 0.000000724 eV. So 0.0001 is much larger, so option C would satisfy that.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The reasoning is that the uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties. So if \u0394E is larger than that sum, then you can resolve them. So, \u0394E > (\u0394E1 + \u0394E2).\n\nIn this case, the sum is approximately 7.24e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that. The options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 \u2192 0.000000001 \u2192 less than 7.24e-7 \u2192 can't resolve.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 even smaller \u2192 can't.\n\nC) 1e-4 \u2192 0.0001 \u2192 much larger \u2192 can resolve.\n\nD) 1e-8 \u2192 0.00000001 \u2192 less than sum \u2192 can't.\n\nSo option C is the correct answer.\n",

But wait, this question is about energy and lifetime, so I think it's the time-energy version of the uncertainty principle.\n\nThe time-energy uncertainty principle is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2, where \u0394E is the uncertainty in energy, \u0394t is the uncertainty in time (or the lifetime of the state), and \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. So, the idea is that if the energy levels are too close together (small \u0394E), they might not be distinguishable because the uncertainty in energy is larger than the actual energy difference.\n\nWait, but the question is about clearly distinguishing the two states. So the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy. If the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty, then they can be resolved. Otherwise, they blur together.\n\nSo, for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be \u0127 divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s. Oh wait, but sometimes people use units in eV\u00b7s. Let me think. 1 eV is 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 joules. So, \u0127 in eV\u00b7s would be \u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) \u2248 6.582 \u00d7 10^-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nNow, for each state, the uncertainty in energy \u0394E is \u0127 / \u03c4, where \u03c4 is the lifetime. Let's compute this for both states.\n\nFirst state: \u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 \u2248 (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nSecond state: \u03c42 = 1e-8 seconds.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127 / \u03c42 \u2248 (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) = 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The question is about the energy difference between the two states, E2 - E1, that needs to be resolved. So, to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, or perhaps each's uncertainty?\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty associated with each state. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWhen you have two energy levels, each has its own uncertainty. To resolve them, the energy difference should be larger than the combined uncertainties. Or perhaps, each's uncertainty is a separate factor. Alternatively, the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.\n\nWait, I think that the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in each state. Because if the difference is smaller than either uncertainty, then you can't tell them apart.\n\nWait, no. Let me think about it. Suppose E2 - E1 = \u0394E. For the two levels to be distinguishable, \u0394E must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or perhaps just greater than each of their uncertainties individually?\n\nWait, perhaps each state's uncertainty is the uncertainty in their own energy. So, if the two states have a separation larger than each's individual uncertainty, then they can be resolved. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.\n\nWait, but the energy difference is E2 - E1, so let's say it's a positive number. The uncertainty in E2 is \u0394E2, and the uncertainty in E1 is \u0394E1. So, to resolve E2 and E1, the energy difference must be greater than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. Because if the difference is less than either, you might not be able to tell them apart.\n\nSo, let's compute the required condition. For the two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference must be greater than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nWait, but looking at the numbers:\n\n\u0394E1 is 6.582e-7 eV. \u0394E2 is 6.582e-8 eV. So, the larger uncertainty is \u0394E1.\n\nSo, the energy difference needs to be greater than 6.582e-7 eV.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none of them are that big. Let me see the options.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-7 eV\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 0.0001e-7 eV\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 eV\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 1e-8 eV\n\nWait, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 6.58e-7 eV. So that's definitely larger.\n\nOption D is 1e-8 eV, which is larger than \u0394E2 (6.58e-8 eV is about 6.58e-8, so 1e-8 is smaller than that). So if the energy difference is 1e-8 eV, which is less than \u0394E2, then it's not distinguishable. But wait, \u0394E1 is larger.\n\nWait, so if the energy difference is 1e-8 eV, which is less than \u0394E1 (6.58e-7 eV), but larger than \u0394E2 (6.58e-8 eV). So, does that mean that it's above the uncertainty of the second state but below the first? Hmm, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose you have two states, E1 and E2. The uncertainty in E1 is \u0394E1, and the uncertainty in E2 is \u0394E2. The energy difference between them is \u0394E = E2 - E1.\n\nTo distinguish them, the difference \u0394E must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps, the energy difference must be greater than the individual uncertainties.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the energy levels can be resolved if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So, \u0394E should be greater than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nBut wait, let's compute the maximum of the two uncertainties. \u0394E1 is 6.58e-7 eV, which is much bigger than \u0394E2 (6.58e-8 eV). So, the energy difference must be larger than 6.58e-7 eV to be resolved.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. Wait, 6.58e-7 eV is 0.000000658 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is much larger than 0.000000658. So option C would satisfy the condition.\n\nBut wait, none of the other options are that big. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 0.00000001 eV, which is less than \u0394E1. So that wouldn't work.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Another thought: the lifetime given for each state is the lifetime of each state. So perhaps the uncertainty in energy for each state is based on their own lifetimes. So the energy of each state can only be determined within the uncertainty of \u0127/\u03c4.\n\nBut when you have two states, the energy difference \u0394E must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference. So perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or, perhaps the uncertainty in \u0394E is the same as the uncertainty of each state, whichever is larger. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference, which would be the sum of the uncertainties of each state.\n\nWait, that's another approach. Let me think. If you have two states, their energy difference's uncertainty would be the sum of their individual uncertainties. So \u0394E_diff = \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nSo, in this case, \u0394E_diff = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo, for the energy difference to be clearly resolved, the actual \u0394E must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 7.24e-7 eV is 0.000000724 eV. So 0.0001 is much larger, so option C would satisfy that.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The reasoning is that the uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties. So if \u0394E is larger than that sum, then you can resolve them. So, \u0394E > (\u0394E1 + \u0394E2).\n\nIn this case, the sum is approximately 7.24e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that. The options are:\n\nA) 1e-9 \u2192 0.000000001 \u2192 less than 7.24e-7 \u2192 can't resolve.\n\nB) 1e-11 \u2192 even smaller \u2192 can't.\n\nC) 1e-4 \u2192 0.0001 \u2192 much larger \u2192 can resolve.\n\nD) 1e-8 \u2192 0.00000001 \u2192 less than sum \u2192 can't.\n\nSo option C is the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\), we use the time-energy uncertainty principle, which states:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\Delta E \\) is the uncertainty in energy, \\( \\Delta t \\) is the uncertainty in time (or the lifetime of the state), and \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck's constant (\\( \\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{eV\u00b7s} \\)).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state\nFor the first state with lifetime \\( \\tau_1 = 10^{-9} \\, \\text{s} \\):\n\\[\n\\Delta E_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\nFor the second state with lifetime \\( \\tau_2 = 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s} \\):\n\\[\n\\Delta E_2 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the condition for distinguishability\nTo clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \\( \\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \\) must be greater than the uncertainty in the energy difference. The uncertainty in the energy difference is approximately the sum of the individual uncertainties:\n\\[\n\\Delta E_{\\text{diff}} = \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2 = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \\times 10^{-8} = 7.24 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the energy difference \\( \\Delta E \\) must satisfy:\n\\[\n\\Delta E > 7.24 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the options\n- **Option A: \\( 10^{-9} \\, \\text{eV} \\)**  \n  \\( 10^{-9} \\, \\text{eV} = 0.000000001 \\, \\text{eV} \\), which is much smaller than \\( 7.24 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states and whether we can distinguish them clearly.\n\nAlright, the problem says we have two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference so that we can clearly resolve these two levels. The options are A to D.\n\nWait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The principle states that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. So, the product of the energy uncertainty and the lifetime (time uncertainty) can't be smaller than a certain value.\n\nSo the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainty, then we can distinguish them. If the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty might make it hard to tell them apart.\n\nLet me think. The energy uncertainty \u0394E would be related to the lifetime of each state. Wait, but here we have two different lifetimes. Hmm. Or maybe I should consider the uncertainty in the measurement time. Wait, no, perhaps the question is considering the energy uncertainty due to the lifetime of each state.\n\nWait, each state has its own lifetime. But when you're measuring the energy, the time you can observe each state is limited by its lifetime. So the uncertainty in energy for each state is \u0394E = \u0127 / (2 * \u03c4), where \u03c4 is the lifetime.\n\nWait, but the problem is about two states. So maybe I need to compute the uncertainty for each and ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum or something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the energy uncertainty for each state and then see what the minimum energy difference should be.\n\nSo for each state, the uncertainty is \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u03c41) and \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u03c42). But since the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1, perhaps the relevant uncertainty is the maximum of the two uncertainties? Or maybe the sum?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it this way: to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them should be greater than the uncertainty in the energy measurement. So if the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty, they are resolvable.\n\nSo what's the uncertainty here? I think the uncertainty in energy is given by the state's lifetime. So for each state, the energy is uncertain by about \u0127/(2\u03c4). But when you're looking at the energy difference between two states, I think the uncertainty in the difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because each state's energy has its own uncertainty, and when you subtract them, the uncertainties add.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me think. If you have two measurements, each with their own uncertainties, the uncertainty in their difference would be the square root of the sum of their squares, assuming the uncertainties are independent. But maybe in this case, since the two states are being measured, perhaps the uncertainty is dominated by the longer lifetime. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the time it takes to measure the energy difference. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the energy resolution based on the lifetimes of the states. The key is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state.\n\nSo, the formula is \u0394E > \u0127/(2\u03c4). So for each state, the energy uncertainty is \u0127/(2\u03c4). Let's compute that for both states.\n\nWait, Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are in eV, I should convert that to eV\u00b7s.\n\n1 eV is 1.60218 \u00d7 10^-19 joules. So \u0127 in eV\u00b7s would be (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1.60218e-19 J/eV) \u2248 6.582 \u00d7 10^-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo for the first state, \u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2 \u03c41) = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) ) eV.\n\nLet me calculate that: 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582/2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.\n\nWait, 1e-16 divided by 1e-9 is 1e-7. So 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582/2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV. So about 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for the second state, \u03c42 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 \u03c42) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) eV.\n\nThat's (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) ) = (6.582/2) * 1e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nSo the energy uncertainty for the first state is about 3.29e-7 eV, and for the second state, it's 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nWait, so the first state has a larger uncertainty. So when we're considering the energy difference between the two states, perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, because each state's energy could be uncertain. Or maybe it's the maximum of the two? Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought: when you have two states, the energy difference's uncertainty is the sum of their individual uncertainties. So \u0394E_diff \u2248 \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nWait, but in this case, \u0394E1 is 3.29e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 is 3.29e-8 eV. So adding them together gives about 3.62e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than this sum to be resolvable.\n\nSo the energy difference should be larger than approximately 3.6e-7 eV. Let me look at the options.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 eV \u2192 1e-9 is smaller than 3.6e-7.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 way smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 which is 1e-4, which is larger than 3.6e-7.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.00001e-6 eV \u2192 which is 1e-8, which is smaller than 3.6e-7.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than approximately 3.6e-7 eV. So looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. So in this case, the sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = about 3.62e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference needs to be bigger than that. Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is much bigger. So that's the only option that satisfies this condition.\n\nThe other options are either too small. So the correct answer must be option C.\n",

The key is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state.\n\nSo, the formula is \u0394E > \u0127/(2\u03c4). So for each state, the energy uncertainty is \u0127/(2\u03c4). Let's compute that for both states.\n\nWait, Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are in eV, I should convert that to eV\u00b7s.\n\n1 eV is 1.60218 \u00d7 10^-19 joules. So \u0127 in eV\u00b7s would be (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1.60218e-19 J/eV) \u2248 6.582 \u00d7 10^-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo for the first state, \u03c41 = 1e-9 seconds.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2 \u03c41) = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) ) eV.\n\nLet me calculate that: 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582/2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.\n\nWait, 1e-16 divided by 1e-9 is 1e-7. So 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582/2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV. So about 3.29e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for the second state, \u03c42 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2 \u03c42) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) eV.\n\nThat's (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) ) = (6.582/2) * 1e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.\n\nSo the energy uncertainty for the first state is about 3.29e-7 eV, and for the second state, it's 3.29e-8 eV.\n\nWait, so the first state has a larger uncertainty. So when we're considering the energy difference between the two states, perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, because each state's energy could be uncertain. Or maybe it's the maximum of the two? Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought: when you have two states, the energy difference's uncertainty is the sum of their individual uncertainties. So \u0394E_diff \u2248 \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nWait, but in this case, \u0394E1 is 3.29e-7 eV, and \u0394E2 is 3.29e-8 eV. So adding them together gives about 3.62e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than this sum to be resolvable.\n\nSo the energy difference should be larger than approximately 3.6e-7 eV. Let me look at the options.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 eV \u2192 1e-9 is smaller than 3.6e-7.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 way smaller.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV \u2192 which is 1e-4, which is larger than 3.6e-7.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.00001e-6 eV \u2192 which is 1e-8, which is smaller than 3.6e-7.\n\nSo the energy difference must be larger than approximately 3.6e-7 eV. So looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. So in this case, the sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = about 3.62e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference needs to be bigger than that. Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is much bigger. So that's the only option that satisfies this condition.\n\nThe other options are either too small. So the correct answer must be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the energy uncertainty (\\( \\Delta E \\)) and the lifetime (\\( \\tau \\)) of a state is approximately \\( \\hbar / 2 \\), where \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck's constant.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.\n\nThe question says we have two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between the two energy levels. The options are A to D.\n\nWait, I remember that the uncertainty principle comes into play here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of the state. The principle states that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0394E is the uncertainty in energy and \u0394t is the lifetime (or the time interval the state exists). \n\nSo, the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime. A shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy. But wait, in this question, we're looking for the energy difference that can be clearly resolved. So, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty to be distinguishable.\n\nLet me write down the formula. The uncertainty principle can be written as \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (2\u0394t). So, the minimum energy difference that can be resolved is about \u0127/(2\u0394t). But wait, which \u0394t do we use here? The question gives two different lifetimes, 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. I think the energy uncertainty is determined by the shorter lifetime because that's the more restrictive case. Or wait, maybe each state has its own uncertainty. Hmm.\n\nWait, no. Each state has its own lifetime. So the energy uncertainty for each state is \u0127/(2\u0394t_i). But when considering two states, the energy difference \u0394E between them must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or perhaps, it's the larger of the two uncertainties? Because if one has a much larger uncertainty, the other's is negligible in comparison.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's compute the energy uncertainty for each state. Let's compute \u0127/(2\u0394t) for each.\n\nI remember that \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But since the options are in eV, I should convert units appropriately.\n\nWait, alternatively, there's a handy approximation: 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So, I can compute \u0394E for each state.\n\nFirst, for the first state, \u0394t1 = 1e-9 s.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u0394t1) = (1.05e-34 J\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-9) = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-25 J.\n\nWait, 1e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 1e-25. So that's 0.525e-25 J.\n\nNow, to convert J to eV. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, we can find how many eV this is.\n\nSo, 0.525e-25 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = (0.525 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV.\n\n0.525 divided by 1.602 is approximately 0.328. So, 0.328e-6 eV, which is 3.28e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for the second state, \u0394t2 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u0394t2) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-8) ) = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-26 J.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me compute that again.\n\nWait, 2\u0394t2 is 2e-8 s. So, 1.05e-34 / (2e-8) = (1.05/2) * 1e-26 J. So that's 0.525e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 0.525e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (0.525 / 1.602) * 1e-7 eV.\n\n0.525 / 1.602 \u2248 0.328 again. So, 0.328e-7 eV, which is 3.28e-8 eV.\n\nWait, so the first state's energy uncertainty is about 3.28e-7 eV, and the second is about 3.28e-8 eV.\n\nNow, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So, to clearly distinguish them, the energy difference \u0394E must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. Wait, no, because the uncertainty in E1 is larger. So if \u0394E is larger than the sum of the uncertainties, that would be the condition. But perhaps, more accurately, the energy resolution is determined by the smaller of the two lifetimes, because that would have a larger uncertainty. Wait, no, longer lifetime means smaller uncertainty, so the first state has a shorter lifetime and hence a larger uncertainty.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy difference needing to be larger than the uncertainty for each state. So, the energy difference must be greater than both \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, but since \u0394E1 is larger, the critical condition is \u0394E > \u0394E1.\n\nWait, but wait. The energy difference between E1 and E2 is \u0394E = |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, this \u0394E should be greater than the uncertainty in each energy measurement. Because each state's energy has an uncertainty, the difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Or perhaps, considering that the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because \u0394E_total = \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nWait, that's probably the right approach. Because the energy difference between the two states would have an uncertainty of \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. So, to distinguish them, the actual energy difference must be greater than this sum.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose E1 has an uncertainty of \u0394E1, and E2 has \u0394E2. The energy difference \u0394E = E2 - E1. The uncertainty in \u0394E would be \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, because the uncertainties add in quadrature when considering the difference. Wait, no, actually, when you subtract two independent variables, their uncertainties add in quadrature. Or is it a sum? Wait, no. If you have two independent variables, each with uncertainty \u03c31 and \u03c32, the uncertainty in their difference is sqrt(\u03c31^2 + \u03c32^2). But when one uncertainty is much larger than the other, it's approximately the larger one. But perhaps for this problem, we can approximate the sum as the larger uncertainty.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the sum of the two uncertainties and see which option is larger than that.\n\nSo, \u0394E1 \u2248 3.28e-7 eV, \u0394E2 \u2248 3.28e-8 eV. So the sum is approximately 3.6e-7 eV. So, the energy difference must be greater than about 3.6e-7 eV.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 0.001e-6 eV \u2192 1e-9 eV is way smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So no.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 0.00001e-6 eV \u2192 even smaller. No.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 0.1e-3 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7. So yes.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.1e-6 eV, which is smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So no.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, 3.6e-7 eV is 360e-9 eV. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger. So the only option that's larger than the sum of the uncertainties is option C.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n",

So no.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 0.00001e-6 eV \u2192 even smaller. No.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 0.1e-3 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7. So yes.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.1e-6 eV, which is smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So no.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, 3.6e-7 eV is 360e-9 eV. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger. So the only option that's larger than the sum of the uncertainties is option C.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{2},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\Delta E \\) is the uncertainty in energy and \\( \\Delta t \\) is the lifetime of the state. The energy uncertainty for each state is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta t}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute the energy uncertainties\nFor the first state with \\( \\Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \\, \\text{s} \\):\n\\[\n\\Delta E_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta t_1} = \\frac{1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s}}{2 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{s}} = 5.27 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{J}.\n\\]\nConverting to electron volts (\\( 1 \\, \\text{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\)):\n\\[\n\\Delta E_1 = \\frac{5.27 \\times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 3.29 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\nFor the second state with \\( \\Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s} \\):\n\\[\n\\Delta E_2 = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta t_2} = \\frac{1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s}}{2 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s}} = 5.27 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{J}.\n\\]\nConverting to electron volts:\n\\[\n\\Delta E_2 = \\frac{5.27 \\times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 3.29 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required\nTo resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \\( \\Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \\) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in energy:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E > \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\Delta E > 3.29 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} + 3.29 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{eV} \\approx 3.62 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the options\n- **A) \\( 10^{-9} \\, \\text{eV} \\):** This is \\( 0.001 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{eV} \\), which is much smaller than \\( 3.62 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\). Not sufficient.\n- **B) \\( 10^{-11} \\, \\text{eV} \\):** This is \\( 0.00001 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{eV} \\), which is even smaller. Not sufficient.\n- **C) \\( 10^{-4} \\, \\text{eV} \\):** This is \\( 0.1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{eV} \\), which is much larger than \\( 3.62 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\). Sufficient.\n- **D) \\( 10^{-8} \\, \\text{eV} \\):** This is \\( 0.1 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{eV} \\), which is smaller than \\( 3.62 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{eV} \\). Not sufficient.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",
