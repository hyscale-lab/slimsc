      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X as 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters.\n\nWait, mean decay distance... I remember that particles that decay do so after some time, and the distance they travel before decaying depends on their lifetime and their velocity. Oh right, the mean lifetime is related to the width of the resonance. Because the width \u0393 is the energy uncertainty, which is inversely related to the lifetime \u03c4 via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. So \u0393 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4, meaning \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. \n\nBut wait, the units here. \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 is usually in units of GeV\u00b7s or something. I need to make sure I convert everything correctly.\n\nSo first, let me write down the formula for the mean decay distance. The decay distance L is the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime \u03c4. So L = v * \u03c4. But since \u03c4 is \u0127/(\u0393), L = v * \u0127/(\u0393). Alternatively, I can think of it as L = (v * \u0127) / \u0393.\n\nBut wait, the velocity v depends on the particle's energy and mass. The energy E is given as 8 GeV. The mass m is 1.2 GeV. So I can calculate the velocity using the relativistic energy equations.\n\nThe total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum by E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2. Solving for pc, we get pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2). Then, the momentum p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2) / c. \n\nBut wait, units are a bit tricky here. Let's make sure I'm using consistent units. Since all the energies are given in GeV, maybe I can work in natural units where c=1 and \u0127=1, but then I'd have to convert back to meters at the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute everything in SI units. Let me plan this out step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the momentum p. Using E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. Wait, actually, when using E in GeV, m is in GeV/c\u00b2. So, plugging into E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2.\n\nLet me rearrange for pc: pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2) = sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) GeV * c.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 8 squared is 64, 1.2 squared is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV * c. sqrt(62.56) is about 7.91, right? Because 7.9^2 is 62.41, which is close. So approximately 7.91 GeV c.\n\nWait, wait, but I need to be precise here. Let me calculate sqrt(62.56). Let me think: 7.9^2=62.41, 7.91^2= (7.9 +0.01)^2=7.9^2 + 2*7.9*0.01 + 0.01^2 =62.41 + 0.158 + 0.0001=62.5681. Oh, that's exactly 62.5681, which is about 62.56. So sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV c.\n\nSo pc =7.91 GeV c. So p = 7.91 GeV c / c =7.91 GeV / (c^2) * c = 7.91 GeV/(c) ? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let's think in terms of units.\n\nWait, I'm trying to find the momentum p. So, E in GeV, m in GeV/c\u00b2. Then, when you square E, you have (GeV)^2. m c\u00b2 is (GeV/c\u00b2) * c^2 = GeV. So E and m c\u00b2 are in the same units.\n\nSo, E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 = (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.\n\nSo, pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV \u2248 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c, because (pc) is in GeV.\n\nNow, the velocity v can be found from relativistic equations. The momentum p is related to the velocity by p = gamma m v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, but gamma is E/(m c\u00b2), because E = gamma m c\u00b2. So gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 6.6667.\n\nAlternatively, another formula for velocity is v = c * sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E^2)}.\n\nWait, let's compute that. Let me compute (m c^2)^2 = (1.2 GeV)^2 = 1.44 GeV^2. E\u00b2 is 64 GeV\u00b2. So 1 - (1.44/64) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo v = c * 0.9887 \u2248 0.9887c. That's about 0.9887 times the speed of light.\n\nWait, but another way to compute v is using p = gamma m v. Let's see.\n\np = gamma m v.\n\nWe have p = 7.91 GeV/c. Gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.6667. m is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n7.91 GeV/c = gamma * m * v.\n\ngamma m = (8 GeV/(1.2 GeV c\u00b2)) ) * 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2 = 8/(1.2) * 1.2 GeV/(c\u00b2) * GeV/c\u00b2? Hmm, perhaps this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to plug into the formula v = p c / (gamma m c\u00b2) * c.\n\nWait, perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, since gamma = E/(m c\u00b2), and E = gamma m c\u00b2, then p = gamma m v.\n\nSo,\n\np = gamma m v.\n\nBut E = gamma m c\u00b2, so gamma = E/(m c\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nv = p c\u00b2 / (E).\n\nWait, substituting gamma from E = gamma m c\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\np = gamma m v.\n\nBut gamma = E/(m c\u00b2), so:\n\np = (E/(m c\u00b2)) * m v.\n\nSo,\n\np = E v / (c\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nv = p c\u00b2 / E.\n\nHmm, that makes sense because when E is large, v approaches c.\n\nSo, p is 7.91 GeV/c. E is 8 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nv = (7.91 GeV/c * c\u00b2) / 8 GeV.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(7.91 GeV * c\u00b2 ) / (8 GeV c) ) = (7.91 /8 ) c * (c^2/c) )? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, the formula is v = (p c\u00b2) / E.\n\np is 7.91 GeV/c.\n\nSo,\n\nv = (7.91 GeV/c * c\u00b2) / E.\n\nE is 8 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nv = (7.91 * c\u00b2 * GeV ) / (c * 8 GeV) )\n\nThe GeV cancels, and c\u00b2 / c is c. So,\n\nv = (7.91 / 8 ) c.\n\n7.91 /8 is approximately 0.98875. So v \u2248 0.98875 c. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So that's correct.\n\nSo, v \u2248 0.98875 c.\n\nNow, the lifetime \u03c4 is related to the width \u0393. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says \u0394E \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. For the decay width, \u0393 is the uncertainty in energy, so \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127/(\u0393). But I need to be precise with the units.\n\nWait, \u0393 is given as 320 MeV. I need to convert that into GeV. 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, \u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nNow, \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. In units where c=1 and \u0127=1, but here I need to use SI units. Let me recall the value of \u0127 in J\u00b7s.\n\n\u0127 \u2248 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nBut wait, E is in GeV, so I need to convert \u0127 into GeV\u00b7s.\n\n1 GeV = 1.60218 \u00d7 10^-10 J.\n\nSo, 1 J = 1e34 / 1.0545718e-34 GeV\u00b7s. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s.\n\nLet me calculate \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s.\n\n1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J.\n\nSo, 1 J = 1/(1.60218e-10) GeV \u2248 6.242e9 GeV.\n\nSo, \u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s = 1.0545718e-34 * (6.242e9 GeV) * s.\n\nWait, because 1 J = 6.242e9 GeV, so 1 J\u00b7s = 6.242e9 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, \u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s = 1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e9 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e9 = (1.0545718 * 6.242) \u00d7 1e-34+9 = approx (6.582) \u00d7 1e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, 1.0545718 *6.242 is approximately:\n\n1.0545718 *6 =6.32743, 1.0545718 *0.242 \u2248 0.255. So total about 6.58243.\n\nSo, \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit uncertain about the exact value, but maybe I can look for a more precise approach. Alternatively, I can use the conversion factor for \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s. I think the value is approximately 6.582 \u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, another approach: I remember that \u0127c \u2248 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm, where fm is fermi (1e-15 m). So perhaps I can use that.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to use natural units, but let me think.\n\nSo, the lifetime \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\n\u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32 ) s.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.0568e-24 seconds.\n\nSo, \u03c4 \u2248 2.0568e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, the decay distance L is v * \u03c4.\n\nv is approximately 0.98875 c. c is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 0.98875 *3e8 = approx 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.0568e-24 s:\n\n2.96625e8 * 2.0568e-24 = (2.96625 * 2.0568) \u00d7 1e8-24 = (6.106) \u00d71e-16 meters.\n\nWait, 2.96625 * 2.0568 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n2.96625 *2 is 5.9325. 2.96625 *0.0568 \u2248 approximately 0.169. So total is about 6.1015. So 6.1015e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.0655e-16 m, and option A is 5.02e-16 m. Hmm, none of the options match 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, let me recalculate \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s.\n\n1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J.\n\n\u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo, to convert \u0127 into GeV\u00b7s, divide by 1.602e-10.\n\nSo, \u0127 (GeV\u00b7s) = 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-10 \u2248 6.586e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\n\u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.586e-25 / 0.32 \u2248 2.058e-24 s.\n\nv is 0.98875 c, which is approximately 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\nThen, L = v * \u03c4 = 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.058e-24 s = ?\n\nMultiply 2.96625e8 by 2.058e-24.\n\nSo 2.96625e8 = 2.96625 \u00d7 1e8.\n\n2.058e-24 = 2.058 \u00d71e-24.\n\nMultiply the coefficients: 2.96625 * 2.058 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n2.96625 *2 = 5.9325.\n\n2.96625 *0.058 \u2248 0.172.\n\nSo total is approximately 6.1045.\n\nThen, exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.\n\nSo, L \u22486.1045e-16 m.\n\nWait, that's 6.1045e-16 m, but none of the options match this. The options are 5.02e-15, 4.06e-16, etc.\n\nHmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity v. Let me go back.\n\nEarlier, I used two methods to calculate v. One gave me approximately 0.9887c, another gave me 0.98875c. But perhaps I should use the exact value.\n\nWait, let me compute the exact value of v.\n\nv = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ) * c.\n\nm is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2, E is 8 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\n(m c\u00b2)^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 GeV\u00b2.\n\nE\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 =64 GeV\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n1 - (1.44/64) = 1 -0.0225=0.9775.\n\nsqrt(0.9775)= let me compute this more accurately.\n\nLet me see, 0.9887^2 = ?\n\n(0.9887)^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98\u00b2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087\u00b2.\n\n0.98\u00b2=0.9604.\n\n2*0.98*0.0087= 0.017292.\n\n0.0087^2= ~0.00007569.\n\nAdding up: 0.9604 +0.017292=0.977692 + 0.00007569\u22480.977767.\n\nBut our sqrt(0.9775) is sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887.\n\nWait, but 0.9887^2 is 0.977767, which is slightly larger than 0.9775. So the actual value is a little less than 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.9775):\n\nWe can use a linear approximation.\n\nLet me let x = 0.977767, which is x = (0.9887)^2.\n\nWe want to find x' = 0.9775, which is 0.977767 - 0.000267.\n\nSo, the difference is delta_x = -0.000267.\n\nThe derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2 sqrt(x)). So, at x=0.977767, sqrt(x)=0.9887.\n\nSo, delta_y \u2248 (delta_x) / (2 * 0.9887) )= (-0.000267) / (1.9774) \u2248 -0.0001353.\n\nSo, sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887 - 0.0001353 \u2248 0.98856.\n\nSo, v \u2248 0.98856 c.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a more precise value.\n\nSo, v \u2248 0.98856 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96568e8 m/s.\n\nNow, let me recompute L with this more precise velocity.\n\nSo, L = v * \u03c4.\n\nv = 2.96568e8 m/s.\n\ntau = 2.058e-24 s.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 2.96568e8 m/s * 2.058e-24 s = ?\n\nMultiply the coefficients: 2.96568 * 2.058 \u2248 Let's compute this.\n\n2.96568 * 2 =5.93136.\n\n2.96568 * 0.058 \u2248 0.172.\n\nSo total \u2248 5.93136 +0.172=6.10336.\n\nWait, but 2.96568 * 2.058 is more accurately:\n\n2.058 \u00d7 2.96568.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n2 * 2.96568 = 5.93136.\n\n0.058 * 2.96568 = let's compute 0.05 * 2.96568 =0.148284, 0.008 *2.96568=0.02372544. So total 0.148284 +0.02372544=0.17200944.\n\nSo total is 5.93136 +0.17200944=6.10336944.\n\nSo, L\u22486.10336944e-16 m.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the velocity. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for decay length is different.\n\nWait, another approach: The decay length can also be calculated using the formula L = c * tau * gamma * beta.\n\nBecause tau is the proper lifetime, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau. So, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. Then, the distance is velocity (beta c) multiplied by gamma tau. So L= beta c * gamma tau.\n\nBut tau is \u0127/(Gamma). So,\n\nL = beta gamma c * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWait, let me write this.\n\nL = beta gamma c \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo,\n\nbeta is v/c, gamma is E/(m c^2).\n\nSo, beta gamma = (v/c) * gamma = (v gamma)/c.\n\nAlternatively, beta gamma can be written as p/(m c), since p = gamma m v = gamma m (beta c) = gamma beta m c.\n\nSo, beta gamma = p/(m c).\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute beta gamma as:\n\nbeta gamma = sqrt(1 + (p^2 c^2)/(m^2 c^4)) ) * (p c)/(m c^2) ) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, beta is v/c, which is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)}.\n\nGamma is E/(m c\u00b2).\n\nSo, beta gamma = (sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2))) * (E/(m c\u00b2)).\n\nAlternatively, beta gamma = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4)/(m^2 c^4) ) * (E/(m c\u00b2)) )\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute beta gamma as (E)/(m c\u00b2) * sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nWhich is the same as (E sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ) / (m c\u00b2).\n\nHmm, but perhaps I should compute this numerically.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo, (E/m c\u00b2) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.\n\nsqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2) ) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 -0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.\n\nSo, beta gamma = 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6667 *0.9887 \u2248 let's compute.\n\n6 *0.9887=5.9322.\n\n0.6667 *0.9887\u22480.6591.\n\nSo total \u22485.9322 +0.6591=6.5913.\n\nSo, beta gamma \u22486.5913.\n\nSo, L = (beta gamma c) * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWait, \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s. Gamma is in GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL = (beta gamma c ) * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWait, let's compute each part.\n\nbeta gamma is 6.5913.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV )\n\nWait, the GeV units cancel.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 6.5913 *3e8 * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) m.\n\nCompute 6.582e-25 /0.32 = 2.056875e-24.\n\nSo,\n\nL =6.5913 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.\n\nCompute 6.5913 *3e8 = 1.97739e9.\n\nThen multiply by 2.056875e-24:\n\n1.97739e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.056875) \u00d71e9-24 = (4.065) \u00d71e-15.\n\nWait, 1.97739 * 2.056875 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n1.97739 *2=3.95478.\n\n1.97739 *0.056875\u22480.11215.\n\nSo total is approx 3.95478 +0.11215\u22484.0669.\n\nSo, L \u22484.0669e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's approximately 4.067e-15 meters.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X as 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters.\n\nWait, mean decay distance... I remember that particles that decay do so after some time, and the distance they travel before decaying depends on their lifetime and their velocity. Oh right, the mean lifetime is related to the width of the resonance. Because the width \u0393 is the energy uncertainty, which is inversely related to the lifetime \u03c4 via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. So \u0393 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4, meaning \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. \n\nBut wait, the units here. \u0393 is given in MeV, and \u0127 is usually in units of GeV\u00b7s or something. I need to make sure I convert everything correctly.\n\nSo first, let me write down the formula for the mean decay distance. The decay distance L is the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime \u03c4. So L = v * \u03c4. But since \u03c4 is \u0127/(\u0393), L = v * \u0127/(\u0393). Alternatively, I can think of it as L = (v * \u0127) / \u0393.\n\nBut wait, the velocity v depends on the particle's energy and mass. The energy E is given as 8 GeV. The mass m is 1.2 GeV. So I can calculate the velocity using the relativistic energy equations.\n\nThe total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum by E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2. Solving for pc, we get pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2). Then, the momentum p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2) / c. \n\nBut wait, units are a bit tricky here. Let's make sure I'm using consistent units. Since all the energies are given in GeV, maybe I can work in natural units where c=1 and \u0127=1, but then I'd have to convert back to meters at the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute everything in SI units. Let me plan this out step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the momentum p. Using E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. Wait, actually, when using E in GeV, m is in GeV/c\u00b2. So, plugging into E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2.\n\nLet me rearrange for pc: pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2) = sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) GeV * c.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 8 squared is 64, 1.2 squared is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV * c. sqrt(62.56) is about 7.91, right? Because 7.9^2 is 62.41, which is close. So approximately 7.91 GeV c.\n\nWait, wait, but I need to be precise here. Let me calculate sqrt(62.56). Let me think: 7.9^2=62.41, 7.91^2= (7.9 +0.01)^2=7.9^2 + 2*7.9*0.01 + 0.01^2 =62.41 + 0.158 + 0.0001=62.5681. Oh, that's exactly 62.5681, which is about 62.56. So sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV c.\n\nSo pc =7.91 GeV c. So p = 7.91 GeV c / c =7.91 GeV / (c^2) * c = 7.91 GeV/(c) ? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let's think in terms of units.\n\nWait, I'm trying to find the momentum p. So, E in GeV, m in GeV/c\u00b2. Then, when you square E, you have (GeV)^2. m c\u00b2 is (GeV/c\u00b2) * c^2 = GeV. So E and m c\u00b2 are in the same units.\n\nSo, E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 = (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.\n\nSo, pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV \u2248 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c, because (pc) is in GeV.\n\nNow, the velocity v can be found from relativistic equations. The momentum p is related to the velocity by p = gamma m v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, but gamma is E/(m c\u00b2), because E = gamma m c\u00b2. So gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 6.6667.\n\nAlternatively, another formula for velocity is v = c * sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E^2)}.\n\nWait, let's compute that. Let me compute (m c^2)^2 = (1.2 GeV)^2 = 1.44 GeV^2. E\u00b2 is 64 GeV\u00b2. So 1 - (1.44/64) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo v = c * 0.9887 \u2248 0.9887c. That's about 0.9887 times the speed of light.\n\nWait, but another way to compute v is using p = gamma m v. Let's see.\n\np = gamma m v.\n\nWe have p = 7.91 GeV/c. Gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.6667. m is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n7.91 GeV/c = gamma * m * v.\n\ngamma m = (8 GeV/(1.2 GeV c\u00b2)) ) * 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2 = 8/(1.2) * 1.2 GeV/(c\u00b2) * GeV/c\u00b2? Hmm, perhaps this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to plug into the formula v = p c / (gamma m c\u00b2) * c.\n\nWait, perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, since gamma = E/(m c\u00b2), and E = gamma m c\u00b2, then p = gamma m v.\n\nSo,\n\np = gamma m v.\n\nBut E = gamma m c\u00b2, so gamma = E/(m c\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nv = p c\u00b2 / (E).\n\nWait, substituting gamma from E = gamma m c\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\np = gamma m v.\n\nBut gamma = E/(m c\u00b2), so:\n\np = (E/(m c\u00b2)) * m v.\n\nSo,\n\np = E v / (c\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\nv = p c\u00b2 / E.\n\nHmm, that makes sense because when E is large, v approaches c.\n\nSo, p is 7.91 GeV/c. E is 8 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nv = (7.91 GeV/c * c\u00b2) / 8 GeV.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(7.91 GeV * c\u00b2 ) / (8 GeV c) ) = (7.91 /8 ) c * (c^2/c) )? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, the formula is v = (p c\u00b2) / E.\n\np is 7.91 GeV/c.\n\nSo,\n\nv = (7.91 GeV/c * c\u00b2) / E.\n\nE is 8 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nv = (7.91 * c\u00b2 * GeV ) / (c * 8 GeV) )\n\nThe GeV cancels, and c\u00b2 / c is c. So,\n\nv = (7.91 / 8 ) c.\n\n7.91 /8 is approximately 0.98875. So v \u2248 0.98875 c. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So that's correct.\n\nSo, v \u2248 0.98875 c.\n\nNow, the lifetime \u03c4 is related to the width \u0393. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says \u0394E \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. For the decay width, \u0393 is the uncertainty in energy, so \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127/(\u0393). But I need to be precise with the units.\n\nWait, \u0393 is given as 320 MeV. I need to convert that into GeV. 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, \u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nNow, \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. In units where c=1 and \u0127=1, but here I need to use SI units. Let me recall the value of \u0127 in J\u00b7s.\n\n\u0127 \u2248 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nBut wait, E is in GeV, so I need to convert \u0127 into GeV\u00b7s.\n\n1 GeV = 1.60218 \u00d7 10^-10 J.\n\nSo, 1 J = 1e34 / 1.0545718e-34 GeV\u00b7s. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s.\n\nLet me calculate \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s.\n\n1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J.\n\nSo, 1 J = 1/(1.60218e-10) GeV \u2248 6.242e9 GeV.\n\nSo, \u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s = 1.0545718e-34 * (6.242e9 GeV) * s.\n\nWait, because 1 J = 6.242e9 GeV, so 1 J\u00b7s = 6.242e9 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo, \u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s = 1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e9 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e9 = (1.0545718 * 6.242) \u00d7 1e-34+9 = approx (6.582) \u00d7 1e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, 1.0545718 *6.242 is approximately:\n\n1.0545718 *6 =6.32743, 1.0545718 *0.242 \u2248 0.255. So total about 6.58243.\n\nSo, \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit uncertain about the exact value, but maybe I can look for a more precise approach. Alternatively, I can use the conversion factor for \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s. I think the value is approximately 6.582 \u00d710^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, another approach: I remember that \u0127c \u2248 197.33 MeV\u00b7fm, where fm is fermi (1e-15 m). So perhaps I can use that.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to use natural units, but let me think.\n\nSo, the lifetime \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\n\u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32 ) s.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.0568e-24 seconds.\n\nSo, \u03c4 \u2248 2.0568e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, the decay distance L is v * \u03c4.\n\nv is approximately 0.98875 c. c is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 0.98875 *3e8 = approx 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.0568e-24 s:\n\n2.96625e8 * 2.0568e-24 = (2.96625 * 2.0568) \u00d7 1e8-24 = (6.106) \u00d71e-16 meters.\n\nWait, 2.96625 * 2.0568 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n2.96625 *2 is 5.9325. 2.96625 *0.0568 \u2248 approximately 0.169. So total is about 6.1015. So 6.1015e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.0655e-16 m, and option A is 5.02e-16 m. Hmm, none of the options match 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, let me recalculate \u0127 in GeV\u00b7s.\n\n1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J.\n\n\u0127 = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo, to convert \u0127 into GeV\u00b7s, divide by 1.602e-10.\n\nSo, \u0127 (GeV\u00b7s) = 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-10 \u2248 6.586e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, \u0393 is 0.32 GeV.\n\n\u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.586e-25 / 0.32 \u2248 2.058e-24 s.\n\nv is 0.98875 c, which is approximately 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\nThen, L = v * \u03c4 = 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.058e-24 s = ?\n\nMultiply 2.96625e8 by 2.058e-24.\n\nSo 2.96625e8 = 2.96625 \u00d7 1e8.\n\n2.058e-24 = 2.058 \u00d71e-24.\n\nMultiply the coefficients: 2.96625 * 2.058 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n2.96625 *2 = 5.9325.\n\n2.96625 *0.058 \u2248 0.172.\n\nSo total is approximately 6.1045.\n\nThen, exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.\n\nSo, L \u22486.1045e-16 m.\n\nWait, that's 6.1045e-16 m, but none of the options match this. The options are 5.02e-15, 4.06e-16, etc.\n\nHmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity v. Let me go back.\n\nEarlier, I used two methods to calculate v. One gave me approximately 0.9887c, another gave me 0.98875c. But perhaps I should use the exact value.\n\nWait, let me compute the exact value of v.\n\nv = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ) * c.\n\nm is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2, E is 8 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\n(m c\u00b2)^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 GeV\u00b2.\n\nE\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 =64 GeV\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n1 - (1.44/64) = 1 -0.0225=0.9775.\n\nsqrt(0.9775)= let me compute this more accurately.\n\nLet me see, 0.9887^2 = ?\n\n(0.9887)^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98\u00b2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087\u00b2.\n\n0.98\u00b2=0.9604.\n\n2*0.98*0.0087= 0.017292.\n\n0.0087^2= ~0.00007569.\n\nAdding up: 0.9604 +0.017292=0.977692 + 0.00007569\u22480.977767.\n\nBut our sqrt(0.9775) is sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887.\n\nWait, but 0.9887^2 is 0.977767, which is slightly larger than 0.9775. So the actual value is a little less than 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.9775):\n\nWe can use a linear approximation.\n\nLet me let x = 0.977767, which is x = (0.9887)^2.\n\nWe want to find x' = 0.9775, which is 0.977767 - 0.000267.\n\nSo, the difference is delta_x = -0.000267.\n\nThe derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2 sqrt(x)). So, at x=0.977767, sqrt(x)=0.9887.\n\nSo, delta_y \u2248 (delta_x) / (2 * 0.9887) )= (-0.000267) / (1.9774) \u2248 -0.0001353.\n\nSo, sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887 - 0.0001353 \u2248 0.98856.\n\nSo, v \u2248 0.98856 c.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a more precise value.\n\nSo, v \u2248 0.98856 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96568e8 m/s.\n\nNow, let me recompute L with this more precise velocity.\n\nSo, L = v * \u03c4.\n\nv = 2.96568e8 m/s.\n\ntau = 2.058e-24 s.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 2.96568e8 m/s * 2.058e-24 s = ?\n\nMultiply the coefficients: 2.96568 * 2.058 \u2248 Let's compute this.\n\n2.96568 * 2 =5.93136.\n\n2.96568 * 0.058 \u2248 0.172.\n\nSo total \u2248 5.93136 +0.172=6.10336.\n\nWait, but 2.96568 * 2.058 is more accurately:\n\n2.058 \u00d7 2.96568.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n2 * 2.96568 = 5.93136.\n\n0.058 * 2.96568 = let's compute 0.05 * 2.96568 =0.148284, 0.008 *2.96568=0.02372544. So total 0.148284 +0.02372544=0.17200944.\n\nSo total is 5.93136 +0.17200944=6.10336944.\n\nSo, L\u22486.10336944e-16 m.\n\nBut none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the velocity. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for decay length is different.\n\nWait, another approach: The decay length can also be calculated using the formula L = c * tau * gamma * beta.\n\nBecause tau is the proper lifetime, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau. So, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. Then, the distance is velocity (beta c) multiplied by gamma tau. So L= beta c * gamma tau.\n\nBut tau is \u0127/(Gamma). So,\n\nL = beta gamma c * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWait, let me write this.\n\nL = beta gamma c \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo,\n\nbeta is v/c, gamma is E/(m c^2).\n\nSo, beta gamma = (v/c) * gamma = (v gamma)/c.\n\nAlternatively, beta gamma can be written as p/(m c), since p = gamma m v = gamma m (beta c) = gamma beta m c.\n\nSo, beta gamma = p/(m c).\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute beta gamma as:\n\nbeta gamma = sqrt(1 + (p^2 c^2)/(m^2 c^4)) ) * (p c)/(m c^2) ) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, beta is v/c, which is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)}.\n\nGamma is E/(m c\u00b2).\n\nSo, beta gamma = (sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2))) * (E/(m c\u00b2)).\n\nAlternatively, beta gamma = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4)/(m^2 c^4) ) * (E/(m c\u00b2)) )\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute beta gamma as (E)/(m c\u00b2) * sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nWhich is the same as (E sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ) / (m c\u00b2).\n\nHmm, but perhaps I should compute this numerically.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo, (E/m c\u00b2) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.\n\nsqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2) ) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 -0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.\n\nSo, beta gamma = 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6667 *0.9887 \u2248 let's compute.\n\n6 *0.9887=5.9322.\n\n0.6667 *0.9887\u22480.6591.\n\nSo total \u22485.9322 +0.6591=6.5913.\n\nSo, beta gamma \u22486.5913.\n\nSo, L = (beta gamma c) * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWait, \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s. Gamma is in GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL = (beta gamma c ) * ( \u0127 / Gamma )\n\nWait, let's compute each part.\n\nbeta gamma is 6.5913.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nGamma is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV )\n\nWait, the GeV units cancel.\n\nSo,\n\nL = 6.5913 *3e8 * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) m.\n\nCompute 6.582e-25 /0.32 = 2.056875e-24.\n\nSo,\n\nL =6.5913 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.\n\nCompute 6.5913 *3e8 = 1.97739e9.\n\nThen multiply by 2.056875e-24:\n\n1.97739e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.056875) \u00d71e9-24 = (4.065) \u00d71e-15.\n\nWait, 1.97739 * 2.056875 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n1.97739 *2=3.95478.\n\n1.97739 *0.056875\u22480.11215.\n\nSo total is approx 3.95478 +0.11215\u22484.0669.\n\nSo, L \u22484.0669e-15 m.\n\nWait, that's approximately 4.067e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance \\( L \\) of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nL = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\tau \\) is the particle's lifetime, \\( \\beta = v/c \\) is the velocity in units of the speed of light, and \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember from my studies that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance has something to do with their properties. Let me think about what I know.\n\nThe question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A through D, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.\n\nWait, I recall that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The uncertainty principle says that the width \u0393 is inversely proportional to the mean lifetime \u03c4. The formula I think is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, wait, no. I think the relation is actually \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393/2) because \u0393 is the total decay width. So \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393/2) = 2\u0127/\u0393. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another way: \u0393 is the energy width, and the lifetime is given by \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393). Because \u0393 is the decay rate, which has units of energy. So the decay rate \u0393 is \u0127/\u03c4. So \u03c4 = \u0127/\u0393.\n\nWait, units: \u0393 has units of energy, and \u0127 has units of energy\u00b7time. So \u0127/(\u0393) would have units of time. Right.\n\nOnce I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance. The decay distance is the product of the velocity v of the particle and the lifetime \u03c4. So L = v * \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the velocity? I know the energy and mass of the meson. So I can find the velocity from the energy.\n\nThe production energy E_X is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is moving with some kinetic energy plus rest mass. The total energy E is the sum of kinetic energy and rest mass energy. Wait, actually, E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So the rest mass energy is m c\u00b2. So the kinetic energy is E - m c\u00b2. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, the relativistic energy-momentum relation is E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2. So I can find the momentum p in terms of E and m.\n\nBut wait, the meson is produced with energy E_X, which is 8 GeV. So let's compute the momentum p.\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2\n\nSo (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2\n\nBut let's calculate it in natural units where c=1, which is common in particle physics. So the equation becomes E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2. So p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2).\n\nWait, but E is in GeV, m is in GeV as well, so E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.\n\nSo p\u00b2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p = sqrt(62.56) \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nWait, but wait, that's in natural units. So in terms of units, p would be 7.91 GeV/c, since in natural units c=1.\n\nBut for velocity, I need to find v in terms of p and E. The velocity can be found from the relation v = (pc\u00b2) / E. Because from E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and p = \u03b3 m v. So v = (p c) / (\u03b3 m c\u00b2) * c\u00b2? Hmm, maybe I should think again.\n\nWait, another approach: the velocity can be found from the beta factor, \u03b2 = v/c. And \u03b2 is given by (p c\u00b2) / (E), since p = \u03b3 m v, and E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So \u03b2 = (p c) / E.\n\nBecause p = \u03b3 m v \u2192 v = p c\u00b2 / (\u03b3 m c) \u2192 v = (p c\u00b2) / (E), since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo \u03b2 = (p c\u00b2) / (E) \u2192 v = \u03b2 c = (p c\u00b2 / E) * (1/c) ) \u2192 wait, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, from p = \u03b3 m v. So v = p/(\u03b3 m). And E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So v = (p c\u00b2) / (E). Because \u03b3 m = E/(c\u00b2), so v = p c\u00b2 / E.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So v = (p c\u00b2) / E.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused with the units. Let's see: E is in GeV, p in GeV/c. So when I compute (p c\u00b2) / E, the units would be (GeV/c * c\u00b2) / GeV \u2192 (GeV c) / GeV \u2192 c. So the units are correct for velocity.\n\nSo in natural units, c=1, but when we're not using them, I need to be careful. Wait, but in our calculation, p is in GeV/c. So (p c\u00b2) would have units (GeV/c) * (c\u00b2) ) = GeV * c.\n\nHmm, but E is in GeV. So when I divide by E, the GeV cancels, and I have (GeV c)/(GeV) )= c. So the units are correct for velocity.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: p = 7.91 GeV/c, E = 8 GeV.\n\nv = (7.91 GeV/c * c\u00b2 ) / 8 GeV ) = (7.91 c\u00b2 GeV ) / (8 GeV) * (1/c) )? Wait, maybe I'm messing up the units.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute in natural units, where c=1. So in natural units, v = p / E. Because with c=1, E = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2), and velocity is v = p c / E, which with c=1 is p/E.\n\nWait, so in natural units, v = p/E.\n\nSo p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2) = sqrt(8\u00b2 - 1.2\u00b2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo v = p / E = 7.91 / 8 \u2248 0.98875 c.\n\nSo beta is approximately 0.98875, so v \u2248 0.98875 * c.\n\nSo the velocity is about 0.98875 times the speed of light.\n\nNow, the lifetime \u03c4 is \u0127 / \u0393. Let me compute that.\n\n\u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) \u2248 (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s \u2248 20.56875e-25 s.\n\nWait, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So \u03c4 \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that again.\n\n6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = let's compute:\n\n0.32 * 20 = 6.4, 0.32 * 20.56875 = 6.582.\n\nSo yes, 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.\n\nSo \u03c4 \u2248 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 20.56875e-25 s? Because 6.582 /0.32 =20.56875, so 20.56875 * 1e-25 s.\n\nYes.\n\nSo \u03c4 is about 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875 * 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance L is v * \u03c4.\n\nv is approximately 0.98875 c, which is 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = v * \u03c4 = (0.98875 * 3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s )\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 0.98875 *3e8 = approx 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24 s:\n\n2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m.\n\nCompute 2.96625 * 2.056875.\n\nHmm, let me calculate:\n\n2.96625 * 2 = 5.9325.\n\n2.96625 * 0.056875 \u2248 let's compute 2.96625 * 0.05 = 0.1483125, and 2.96625 * 0.006875 \u2248 0.020428125. So total \u2248 0.1483125 + 0.020428125 \u2248 0.168740625.\n\nSo total \u2248 5.9325 + 0.168740625 \u2248 6.101240625.\n\nSo approximately 6.10124e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the numbers are around 4e-15 or 5e-15, or 4e-16, 5e-16.\n\nWait, my calculation gives about 6e-16 m, but none of the options are around that. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck the steps.\n\nFirst, the velocity v.\n\nWait, in natural units, v = p/E. So with p = 7.91 GeV/c and E =8 GeV, so v = (7.91 /8 ) c \u2248 0.98875 c. Correct.\n\nThen, lifetime \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = (6.582/0.32) * 1e-25 s = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nThen, L = v * \u03c4 = (0.98875 c) * (2.056875e-24 s) \n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L \u2248 (0.98875 *3e8 m/s) * 2.056875e-24 s\n\nCompute 0.98875 *3e8 = approx 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24 s:\n\n2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.96625 * 2.056875 = let me calculate more accurately.\n\n2.96625 * 2.056875.\n\nLet me compute 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.\n\n0.96625 * 2.056875 = ?\n\n0.96625 * 2 = 1.9325.\n\n0.96625 * 0.056875 = approx 0.0550.\n\nSo total is 1.9325 + 0.0550 = 1.9875.\n\nSo 2.96625 * 2.056875 = 4.11375 + 1.9875 = 6.10125.\n\nSo 6.10125e-16 meters.\n\nHmm. The options given are:\n\nA) 5.0223 *1e-16 m\n\nB)4.0655e-15 m\n\nC)5.0223e-15 m\n\nD)4.0655e-16 m\n\nWait, my result is about 6.1e-16 m, but none of the options match. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity.\n\nWait, perhaps the velocity is not v = p c\u00b2 / E, but something else.\n\nWait, let me double-check the velocity calculation. Another approach is to find the beta factor, \u03b2 = v/c.\n\nIn relativistic terms, \u03b2 = p c / E.\n\nSo \u03b2 = (p c) / E.\n\nSince p is in GeV/c, and E is in GeV, then (p c) has units of GeV, so \u03b2 is dimensionless.\n\nSo \u03b2 = (p c) / E \u2192 p in GeV/c, so p c is GeV.\n\nSo p c is 7.91 GeV/c * c \u2192 7.91 GeV.\n\nE is 8 GeV.\n\nSo \u03b2 = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) )= 0.98875.\n\nSo v = 0.98875 c. Correct.\n\nWait, so that part was correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width and lifetime.\n\nWait, another thing: the width \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So when calculating \u03c4, it's \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut perhaps I should use \u0393/2 because \u0393 is the full width? No, wait, the mean lifetime is given by \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. Because \u0393 is the decay rate, which is \u0127/\u03c4.\n\nWait, no, \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that the width is \u0393 = \u0127/\u03c4, so tau is \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the momentum p.\n\nWait, E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 c^4 + m^2 c^4 \u2192 p^2 = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c^4.\n\nBut in natural units, c=1, so p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2).\n\nWait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E\u00b2 = 64 (GeV)^2, m\u00b2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2.\n\nSo p\u00b2 = 64 -1.44 = 62.56 \u2192 p \u2248 7.91 GeV/c.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation when I multiplied 2.96625e8 m/s by 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, 2.96625e8 is 2.96625 x10^8.\n\n2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 x10^-24.\n\nMultiplying gives (2.96625 * 2.056875) x10^(8-24) \u2192 6.10125 x10^-16 meters.\n\nWhich is 6.10125e-16 m.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the velocity, or maybe in the calculation of the width.\n\nWait, another possibility: the problem says X is a meson resonance. Resonances have a Breit-Wigner distribution, and the width is \u0393. So the mean lifetime is \u03c4=\u0127/(\u0393), which I think is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should check the calculation of L again.\n\nWait, 0.98875 *3e8 = 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\n2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?\n\nLet me compute 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24.\n\n1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.\n\nSo 2.96625 * 2.056875 = let's compute accurately.\n\n2.96625 * 2 = 5.9325.\n\n2.96625 * 0.056875.\n\nCompute 0.05 * 2.96625 = 0.1483125.\n\n0.006875 *2.96625= approximately 0.020428125.\n\nSo 0.1483125 +0.020428125=0.168740625.\n\nSo total is 5.9325 + 0.168740625=6.101240625.\n\nSo 6.101240625e-16 m.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the decay distance is given by L = c\u03c4 * beta, since v = beta c.\n\nSo L = beta c \u03c4.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it.\n\nSo L = beta * c * tau.\n\nBeta is 0.98875, c=3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCompute that: 0.98875 * 3e8 = 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24 s:\n\n2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.10125e-16 m.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nHmm, so none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the velocity.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used relativistic gamma somewhere. Wait, no, the velocity calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me check.\n\nWait, \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So when I compute tau as \u0127/\u0393, which is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 GeV.\n\nYes, that gives tau in seconds.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of the mean decay distance.\n\nWait, another approach: the mean decay length can also be expressed as L = (c * tau) * beta.\n\nWhich is the same as what I did before.\n\nWait, let me compute c*tau first.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\ntau=2.056875e-24 s.\n\nc * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen multiply by beta: 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 \u2248 6.10125e-16 m.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in using the wrong formula.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the decay length formula is L = gamma * v * tau.\n\nWait, wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor. So when you have a moving particle, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime.\n\nWait, no, the proper lifetime is tau_0 = \u0127 / (m * \u0393), but I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0.\n\nBecause in the particle's rest frame, the lifetime is tau_0 = \u0127/(\u0393), but in the lab frame, it's longer by gamma.\n\nWait, so perhaps I should compute gamma and multiply the tau by gamma.\n\nWait, let's think about this. The width \u0393 is the same in all frames because it's the total decay rate. So the lifetime tau is related to the width via tau = \u0127/(\u0393). But this is the same in all frames because \u0393 is frame-independent.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The total width \u0393 is frame-dependent. Wait, no, in particle physics, the width is related to the lifetime in the rest frame. So tau = \u0127/(\u0393), where \u0393 is the total decay width in the rest frame.\n\nSo in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so its lifetime is longer by gamma. So the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. So perhaps I should multiply tau by gamma.\n\nHmm, that would change the calculation. Let's see.\n\nGamma is the Lorentz factor, gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 in natural units, gamma = E/m.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8/1.2 \u22486.6667.\n\nSo gamma \u22486.6667.\n\nSo the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nSo tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.\n\nSo tau_lab = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s \u2248 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nWait, then the decay distance L is v * tau_lab.\n\nv is 0.98875 c.\n\nSo L = 0.98875 c * 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nCompute that:\n\n0.98875 *3e8 m/s = 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 1.37125e-23 s:\n\n2.96625e8 *1.37125e-23 = (2.96625 *1.37125) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 2.96625 *1.37125.\n\nHmm, 3 *1.37125=4.11375. But since it's 2.96625, which is 3 -0.03375.\n\nSo 1.37125 * (3 -0.03375) = 4.11375 - (1.37125 *0.03375).\n\nCompute 1.37125 *0.03375.\n\n1.37125 *0.03 =0.0411375.\n\n1.37125 *0.00375= approximately 0.0051421875.\n\nTotal: 0.0411375 +0.0051421875=0.0462796875.\n\nSo 4.11375 -0.0462796875 \u22484.0674703125.\n\nSo L \u22484.06747e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.07e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nSo 4.067e-15 is close to option B (4.0655e-15 m).\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to include the gamma factor.\n\nSo why did I get a different result when I included gamma?\n\nAh, because I forgot that the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the decay length is longer by gamma times the previous calculation.\n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.\n\nSo the earlier calculation without gamma was about 6e-16 m, but when including gamma, it's around 4e-15 m, which matches option B.\n\nSo probably, I made a mistake by not considering gamma earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 4.0655e-15 m.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember from my studies that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance has something to do with their properties. Let me think about what I know.\n\nThe question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A through D, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.\n\nWait, I recall that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The uncertainty principle says that the width \u0393 is inversely proportional to the mean lifetime \u03c4. The formula I think is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, wait, no. I think the relation is actually \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393/2) because \u0393 is the total decay width. So \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393/2) = 2\u0127/\u0393. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another way: \u0393 is the energy width, and the lifetime is given by \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393). Because \u0393 is the decay rate, which has units of energy. So the decay rate \u0393 is \u0127/\u03c4. So \u03c4 = \u0127/\u0393.\n\nWait, units: \u0393 has units of energy, and \u0127 has units of energy\u00b7time. So \u0127/(\u0393) would have units of time. Right.\n\nOnce I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance. The decay distance is the product of the velocity v of the particle and the lifetime \u03c4. So L = v * \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the velocity? I know the energy and mass of the meson. So I can find the velocity from the energy.\n\nThe production energy E_X is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is moving with some kinetic energy plus rest mass. The total energy E is the sum of kinetic energy and rest mass energy. Wait, actually, E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So the rest mass energy is m c\u00b2. So the kinetic energy is E - m c\u00b2. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, the relativistic energy-momentum relation is E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)\u00b2. So I can find the momentum p in terms of E and m.\n\nBut wait, the meson is produced with energy E_X, which is 8 GeV. So let's compute the momentum p.\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2\n\nSo (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2\n\nBut let's calculate it in natural units where c=1, which is common in particle physics. So the equation becomes E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2. So p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2).\n\nWait, but E is in GeV, m is in GeV as well, so E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.\n\nSo p\u00b2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p = sqrt(62.56) \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nWait, but wait, that's in natural units. So in terms of units, p would be 7.91 GeV/c, since in natural units c=1.\n\nBut for velocity, I need to find v in terms of p and E. The velocity can be found from the relation v = (pc\u00b2) / E. Because from E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and p = \u03b3 m v. So v = (p c) / (\u03b3 m c\u00b2) * c\u00b2? Hmm, maybe I should think again.\n\nWait, another approach: the velocity can be found from the beta factor, \u03b2 = v/c. And \u03b2 is given by (p c\u00b2) / (E), since p = \u03b3 m v, and E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So \u03b2 = (p c) / E.\n\nBecause p = \u03b3 m v \u2192 v = p c\u00b2 / (\u03b3 m c) \u2192 v = (p c\u00b2) / (E), since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo \u03b2 = (p c\u00b2) / (E) \u2192 v = \u03b2 c = (p c\u00b2 / E) * (1/c) ) \u2192 wait, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, from p = \u03b3 m v. So v = p/(\u03b3 m). And E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So v = (p c\u00b2) / (E). Because \u03b3 m = E/(c\u00b2), so v = p c\u00b2 / E.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So v = (p c\u00b2) / E.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused with the units. Let's see: E is in GeV, p in GeV/c. So when I compute (p c\u00b2) / E, the units would be (GeV/c * c\u00b2) / GeV \u2192 (GeV c) / GeV \u2192 c. So the units are correct for velocity.\n\nSo in natural units, c=1, but when we're not using them, I need to be careful. Wait, but in our calculation, p is in GeV/c. So (p c\u00b2) would have units (GeV/c) * (c\u00b2) ) = GeV * c.\n\nHmm, but E is in GeV. So when I divide by E, the GeV cancels, and I have (GeV c)/(GeV) )= c. So the units are correct for velocity.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: p = 7.91 GeV/c, E = 8 GeV.\n\nv = (7.91 GeV/c * c\u00b2 ) / 8 GeV ) = (7.91 c\u00b2 GeV ) / (8 GeV) * (1/c) )? Wait, maybe I'm messing up the units.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute in natural units, where c=1. So in natural units, v = p / E. Because with c=1, E = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2), and velocity is v = p c / E, which with c=1 is p/E.\n\nWait, so in natural units, v = p/E.\n\nSo p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2) = sqrt(8\u00b2 - 1.2\u00b2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo v = p / E = 7.91 / 8 \u2248 0.98875 c.\n\nSo beta is approximately 0.98875, so v \u2248 0.98875 * c.\n\nSo the velocity is about 0.98875 times the speed of light.\n\nNow, the lifetime \u03c4 is \u0127 / \u0393. Let me compute that.\n\n\u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) \u2248 (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s \u2248 20.56875e-25 s.\n\nWait, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So \u03c4 \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that again.\n\n6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = let's compute:\n\n0.32 * 20 = 6.4, 0.32 * 20.56875 = 6.582.\n\nSo yes, 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.\n\nSo \u03c4 \u2248 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 20.56875e-25 s? Because 6.582 /0.32 =20.56875, so 20.56875 * 1e-25 s.\n\nYes.\n\nSo \u03c4 is about 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875 * 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance L is v * \u03c4.\n\nv is approximately 0.98875 c, which is 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L = v * \u03c4 = (0.98875 * 3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s )\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 0.98875 *3e8 = approx 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24 s:\n\n2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m.\n\nCompute 2.96625 * 2.056875.\n\nHmm, let me calculate:\n\n2.96625 * 2 = 5.9325.\n\n2.96625 * 0.056875 \u2248 let's compute 2.96625 * 0.05 = 0.1483125, and 2.96625 * 0.006875 \u2248 0.020428125. So total \u2248 0.1483125 + 0.020428125 \u2248 0.168740625.\n\nSo total \u2248 5.9325 + 0.168740625 \u2248 6.101240625.\n\nSo approximately 6.10124e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the numbers are around 4e-15 or 5e-15, or 4e-16, 5e-16.\n\nWait, my calculation gives about 6e-16 m, but none of the options are around that. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck the steps.\n\nFirst, the velocity v.\n\nWait, in natural units, v = p/E. So with p = 7.91 GeV/c and E =8 GeV, so v = (7.91 /8 ) c \u2248 0.98875 c. Correct.\n\nThen, lifetime \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\n\u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = (6.582/0.32) * 1e-25 s = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nThen, L = v * \u03c4 = (0.98875 c) * (2.056875e-24 s) \n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo L \u2248 (0.98875 *3e8 m/s) * 2.056875e-24 s\n\nCompute 0.98875 *3e8 = approx 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24 s:\n\n2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.96625 * 2.056875 = let me calculate more accurately.\n\n2.96625 * 2.056875.\n\nLet me compute 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.\n\n0.96625 * 2.056875 = ?\n\n0.96625 * 2 = 1.9325.\n\n0.96625 * 0.056875 = approx 0.0550.\n\nSo total is 1.9325 + 0.0550 = 1.9875.\n\nSo 2.96625 * 2.056875 = 4.11375 + 1.9875 = 6.10125.\n\nSo 6.10125e-16 meters.\n\nHmm. The options given are:\n\nA) 5.0223 *1e-16 m\n\nB)4.0655e-15 m\n\nC)5.0223e-15 m\n\nD)4.0655e-16 m\n\nWait, my result is about 6.1e-16 m, but none of the options match. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity.\n\nWait, perhaps the velocity is not v = p c\u00b2 / E, but something else.\n\nWait, let me double-check the velocity calculation. Another approach is to find the beta factor, \u03b2 = v/c.\n\nIn relativistic terms, \u03b2 = p c / E.\n\nSo \u03b2 = (p c) / E.\n\nSince p is in GeV/c, and E is in GeV, then (p c) has units of GeV, so \u03b2 is dimensionless.\n\nSo \u03b2 = (p c) / E \u2192 p in GeV/c, so p c is GeV.\n\nSo p c is 7.91 GeV/c * c \u2192 7.91 GeV.\n\nE is 8 GeV.\n\nSo \u03b2 = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) )= 0.98875.\n\nSo v = 0.98875 c. Correct.\n\nWait, so that part was correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width and lifetime.\n\nWait, another thing: the width \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So when calculating \u03c4, it's \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut perhaps I should use \u0393/2 because \u0393 is the full width? No, wait, the mean lifetime is given by \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. Because \u0393 is the decay rate, which is \u0127/\u03c4.\n\nWait, no, \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that the width is \u0393 = \u0127/\u03c4, so tau is \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the momentum p.\n\nWait, E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 c^4 + m^2 c^4 \u2192 p^2 = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c^4.\n\nBut in natural units, c=1, so p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2).\n\nWait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E\u00b2 = 64 (GeV)^2, m\u00b2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2.\n\nSo p\u00b2 = 64 -1.44 = 62.56 \u2192 p \u2248 7.91 GeV/c.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation when I multiplied 2.96625e8 m/s by 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, 2.96625e8 is 2.96625 x10^8.\n\n2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 x10^-24.\n\nMultiplying gives (2.96625 * 2.056875) x10^(8-24) \u2192 6.10125 x10^-16 meters.\n\nWhich is 6.10125e-16 m.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the velocity, or maybe in the calculation of the width.\n\nWait, another possibility: the problem says X is a meson resonance. Resonances have a Breit-Wigner distribution, and the width is \u0393. So the mean lifetime is \u03c4=\u0127/(\u0393), which I think is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should check the calculation of L again.\n\nWait, 0.98875 *3e8 = 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\n2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?\n\nLet me compute 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24.\n\n1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.\n\nSo 2.96625 * 2.056875 = let's compute accurately.\n\n2.96625 * 2 = 5.9325.\n\n2.96625 * 0.056875.\n\nCompute 0.05 * 2.96625 = 0.1483125.\n\n0.006875 *2.96625= approximately 0.020428125.\n\nSo 0.1483125 +0.020428125=0.168740625.\n\nSo total is 5.9325 + 0.168740625=6.101240625.\n\nSo 6.101240625e-16 m.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the decay distance is given by L = c\u03c4 * beta, since v = beta c.\n\nSo L = beta c \u03c4.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it.\n\nSo L = beta * c * tau.\n\nBeta is 0.98875, c=3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCompute that: 0.98875 * 3e8 = 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24 s:\n\n2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.10125e-16 m.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nHmm, so none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the velocity.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used relativistic gamma somewhere. Wait, no, the velocity calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me check.\n\nWait, \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So when I compute tau as \u0127/\u0393, which is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 GeV.\n\nYes, that gives tau in seconds.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of the mean decay distance.\n\nWait, another approach: the mean decay length can also be expressed as L = (c * tau) * beta.\n\nWhich is the same as what I did before.\n\nWait, let me compute c*tau first.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\ntau=2.056875e-24 s.\n\nc * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nThen multiply by beta: 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 \u2248 6.10125e-16 m.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in using the wrong formula.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the decay length formula is L = gamma * v * tau.\n\nWait, wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor. So when you have a moving particle, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime.\n\nWait, no, the proper lifetime is tau_0 = \u0127 / (m * \u0393), but I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0.\n\nBecause in the particle's rest frame, the lifetime is tau_0 = \u0127/(\u0393), but in the lab frame, it's longer by gamma.\n\nWait, so perhaps I should compute gamma and multiply the tau by gamma.\n\nWait, let's think about this. The width \u0393 is the same in all frames because it's the total decay rate. So the lifetime tau is related to the width via tau = \u0127/(\u0393). But this is the same in all frames because \u0393 is frame-independent.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The total width \u0393 is frame-dependent. Wait, no, in particle physics, the width is related to the lifetime in the rest frame. So tau = \u0127/(\u0393), where \u0393 is the total decay width in the rest frame.\n\nSo in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so its lifetime is longer by gamma. So the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. So perhaps I should multiply tau by gamma.\n\nHmm, that would change the calculation. Let's see.\n\nGamma is the Lorentz factor, gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 in natural units, gamma = E/m.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8/1.2 \u22486.6667.\n\nSo gamma \u22486.6667.\n\nSo the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.\n\nSo tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.\n\nSo tau_lab = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s \u2248 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nWait, then the decay distance L is v * tau_lab.\n\nv is 0.98875 c.\n\nSo L = 0.98875 c * 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nCompute that:\n\n0.98875 *3e8 m/s = 2.96625e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 1.37125e-23 s:\n\n2.96625e8 *1.37125e-23 = (2.96625 *1.37125) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 2.96625 *1.37125.\n\nHmm, 3 *1.37125=4.11375. But since it's 2.96625, which is 3 -0.03375.\n\nSo 1.37125 * (3 -0.03375) = 4.11375 - (1.37125 *0.03375).\n\nCompute 1.37125 *0.03375.\n\n1.37125 *0.03 =0.0411375.\n\n1.37125 *0.00375= approximately 0.0051421875.\n\nTotal: 0.0411375 +0.0051421875=0.0462796875.\n\nSo 4.11375 -0.0462796875 \u22484.0674703125.\n\nSo L \u22484.06747e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.07e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nSo 4.067e-15 is close to option B (4.0655e-15 m).\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to include the gamma factor.\n\nSo why did I get a different result when I included gamma?\n\nAh, because I forgot that the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the decay length is longer by gamma times the previous calculation.\n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.\n\nSo the earlier calculation without gamma was about 6e-16 m, but when including gamma, it's around 4e-15 m, which matches option B.\n\nSo probably, I made a mistake by not considering gamma earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 4.0655e-15 m.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the following steps:\n\n### Key Information:\n- **Production energy**: \\( E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\)\n- **Mass**: \\( m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} \\)\n- **Width**: \\( \\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\)\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the momentum \\( p \\)\nUsing the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\\[\nE^2 = p^2 + m^2\n\\]\nSubstitute \\( E = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and \\( m = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} \\):\n\\[\np^2 = E^2 - m^2 = 8^2 - 1.2^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \\, \\text{GeV}^2\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\sqrt{62.56} \\approx 7.91 \\, \\text{GeV}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the velocity \\( v \\)\nThe velocity \\( v \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\nv = \\frac{p}{E} \\quad \\text{(in natural units where \\( c = 1 \\))} \n\\]\nSubstitute \\( p = 7.91 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and \\( E = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\):\n\\[\nv = \\frac{7.91}{8} \\approx 0.98875 \\, c\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the mean lifetime \\( \\tau \\)\nThe mean lifetime is related to the decay width \\( \\Gamma \\) by:\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\n\\]\nUsing \\( \\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\) and \\( \\Gamma = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\):\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \\approx 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \\( L \\)\nThe mean decay distance is given by:\n\\[\nL = v \\cdot \\tau\n\\]\nSubstitute \\( v = 0.98875 \\, c \\) and \\( c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\):\n\\[\nL = 0.98875 \\cdot 3 \\times 10^8 \\cdot 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24}\n\\]\n\\[\nL = (0.98875 \\cdot 3 \\times 10^8) \\cdot (2.056875 \\times 10^{-24})\n\\]\n\\[\nL = 2.96625 \\times 10^8 \\cdot 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24}\n\\]\n\\[\nL \\approx 6.10125 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Include the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\)\nThe Lorentz factor is:\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} = \\frac{8}{1.2} \\approx 6.6667\n\\]\nThe lab-frame lifetime is:\n\\[\n\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau = 6.6667 \\cdot 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\approx 1.37125 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\nThe corrected decay distance is:\n\\[\nL = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}} = 0.98875 \\cdot 3 \\times 10^8 \\cdot 1.37125 \\times 10^{-23}\n\\]\n\\[\nL = 2.96625 \\times 10^8 \\cdot 1.37125 \\times 10^{-23}\n\\]\n\\[\nL \\approx 4.067 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe mean decay distance is approximately \\( 4.067 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m} \\), which matches option **B**.\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so it's a really tiny distance, which makes sense because particles decay quickly.\n\nWait, so mesons are bosons, right? They can be made of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles that don't exist for long, so they decay quickly. The mean decay distance would depend on how long the particle lives before decaying, which is related to its lifetime.\n\nI remember that the mean lifetime \u03c4 of a particle is related to its width \u0393 by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. For a particle that's unstable, the energy uncertainty \u0394E is about the width \u0393. So \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, isn't \u0393 the total decay width, which is the inverse of the mean lifetime? Or is it the other way around? I think \u0393 is the width, and the lifetime \u03c4 is \u0127 divided by \u0393. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. That seems right because a larger \u0393 means a shorter lifetime.\n\nOnce I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the particle's velocity by the lifetime. So, mean distance d = v * \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, what about relativistic effects? The particle's speed is probably close to the speed of light. So, I should calculate v \u2248 c, but maybe I need to be more precise.\n\nWait, the energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is E - m c\u00b2. Wait, but I'm not sure if I should use the rest mass or the total energy. Hmm, but for a moving particle, its total energy is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So the gamma factor is E / (m c\u00b2). Let's calculate that.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E/(m c\u00b2) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667. That means the particle is moving at a high speed, beta is v/c. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2), I can find beta. Let's see, gamma squared is (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 \u2248 (6.6667)^2 \u2248 44.444. So 1 - beta\u00b2 = 1/(gamma squared) \u2192 1/44.444 \u2248 0.0225. So beta\u00b2 \u2248 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 \u2192 beta \u2248 sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887c.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can approximate v as just c for an order of magnitude estimate. Because 0.9887 is close to 1. So perhaps the problem expects me to use v \u2248 c. Let's proceed with that for simplicity.\n\nSo first, calculate the lifetime \u03c4. The width \u0393 is 320 MeV. I need to convert that into units compatible with \u0127. Remember that \u0127 is about 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. But maybe I can just use the conversion factor where \u0127c is around 197 MeV\u00b7fm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nWait, the units: \u0393 is given in MeV. So I need to convert that into GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So \u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nNow, tau = \u0127 / \u0393. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32: 6.582 / 0.32 \u2248 20.56875. So tau \u2248 20.56875e-25 s \u2192 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, wait, no: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875 * 1e-25 s. So 2.056875e-24 s? No, wait, 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.\n\nThen, the mean decay distance d is v * tau. If v is approximately c (3e8 m/s), then:\n\nd = c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters. Hmm, looking at the options, none of them match that exactly. The options are all around 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the calculation: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is:\n\n6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 goes into 6.582 how many times? 0.32 * 20 is 6.4. So 20 times with 0.182 left. 0.182 / 0.32 \u2248 0.56875. So total is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.\n\nThen, distance d = c * tau = (3e8 m/s) * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters. Hmm, but none of the options match that exactly. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nB)4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nC)5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\nD)4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nWait, none of these are 6e-16. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the total energy E_X instead of the mass in calculating the velocity. Because the particle is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, which is higher than its rest mass. So the gamma factor is E_X / (m c^2). So yes, I did that correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the width. Let me double-check the units. Because \u0393 is given in MeV, but I converted it to GeV as 0.32 GeV. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula d = c * tau * beta * gamma. Because tau is the proper lifetime, and the observed lifetime is gamma * tau. So the mean path length is v * gamma tau. Wait, that's a different approach.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The lifetime measured in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. Because the particle is moving, so time dilation occurs. So the mean lifetime is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime (rest frame). So the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau_0.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought tau = \u0127 / Gamma. But Gamma is the total decay width, which is energy, so it's in the rest frame. So tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau_0.\n\nSo the mean decay distance would be v * gamma * tau_0. Hmm, so perhaps I missed the gamma factor in my initial calculation.\n\nWait, that's a big mistake. So I think I have to include the gamma factor.\n\nSo let's recalculate.\n\ntau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nThen, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau_0.\n\nGamma (as in Lorentz factor) is E_X / (m c^2) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.\n\nSo lab lifetime is 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s \u2248 1.3711e-23 s.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because the lifetime in the lab frame would be longer. But wait, the decay width is measured in the rest frame, so the lifetime is tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma. The lab frame lifetime is longer by gamma.\n\nSo the mean path length d is v * lab_lifetime.\n\nv is approximately c, so d = c * gamma * tau_0.\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\ngamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.\n\ntau_0 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo gamma * tau_0 = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 \u2248 1.3711e-23 s.\n\nThen, distance d = c * 1.3711e-23 s.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nd = 3e8 * 1.3711e-23 = 4.1133e-15 meters. Hmm, which is approximately 4.113e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.\n\nWait, so my calculation gives about 4.11e-15 meters. So closest is option B: 4.0655e-15 m. But why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I should be more precise with the gamma calculation.\n\nGamma = E/(m c\u00b2) = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 \u2248 6.666666667.\n\nTau_0 = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nGamma * tau_0 = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875e-24) /3 = (41.1375e-24)/3 = 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nThen, d = c * (gamma tau_0) = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nWhich is 4.11375e-15 meters. The option B is 4.0655e-15, which is a bit lower.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should compute more accurately.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nGamma is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 \u2248 6.666666666666667.\n\nTau_0 is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute that precisely.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = ?\n\nWell, 0.32 is 32/100. So 6.582 * 100 /32 = 658.2 /32 = 20.56875.\n\nSo tau_0 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nGamma * tau_0 = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) / 3 * 1e-24.\n\n20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375.\n\n41.1375 /3 = 13.7125.\n\nSo 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nd = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (3 * 1.37125) * 1e-15 = 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.114e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15, which is a bit less. So perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate v more accurately. Earlier, I approximated v as c, but perhaps I should use the exact value of beta.\n\nBeta was sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).\n\nGamma is 20/3 \u22486.666666667.\n\nGamma squared is (400/9) \u224844.44444444.\n\nSo 1 - (1/(gamma^2)) = 1 - 1/44.44444444 \u2248 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo v = 0.9887 * c.\n\nSo in the decay length calculation, I should use v = beta c, not c.\n\nSo decay length d = v * gamma tau_0 = beta c * gamma tau_0.\n\nWait, no. Because tau in the lab frame is gamma tau_0, and d = v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau_0.\n\nAlternatively, d = beta c gamma tau_0.\n\nSo let's compute beta * gamma.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) = sqrt(1 - (3\u00b2)/(20\u00b2)) ) = sqrt( (400 -9)/400 ) = sqrt(391/400) )= sqrt(0.9775) \u22480.9887.\n\nSo beta * gamma = 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u22486.5846.\n\nSo d = (beta gamma c) * tau_0.\n\nTau_0 is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo d = 6.5846 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, let's compute this.\n\nWait, 6.5846 * 3e8 = 1.97538e9 m/s.\n\nMultiply by tau_0=2.056875e-24 s:\n\nd = 1.97538e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97538 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 1.97538 *2.056875:\n\nApproximately, 2 * 2 is 4, but let's do it accurately.\n\n1.97538 *2.056875:\n\n= (2 - 0.02462) * (2 + 0.056875)\n= 2*2 + 2*0.056875 -0.02462*2 -0.02462*0.056875\n=4 + 0.11375 -0.04924 -0.001396\n=4 + 0.11375 =4.11375\n4.11375 -0.04924 =4.06451\n4.06451 -0.001396 \u22484.063114.\n\nSo approximately 4.063114e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option B.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which matches our calculation of approximately 4.063e-15, considering rounding errors.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so it's a really tiny distance, which makes sense because particles decay quickly.\n\nWait, so mesons are bosons, right? They can be made of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles that don't exist for long, so they decay quickly. The mean decay distance would depend on how long the particle lives before decaying, which is related to its lifetime.\n\nI remember that the mean lifetime \u03c4 of a particle is related to its width \u0393 by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. For a particle that's unstable, the energy uncertainty \u0394E is about the width \u0393. So \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, isn't \u0393 the total decay width, which is the inverse of the mean lifetime? Or is it the other way around? I think \u0393 is the width, and the lifetime \u03c4 is \u0127 divided by \u0393. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. That seems right because a larger \u0393 means a shorter lifetime.\n\nOnce I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the particle's velocity by the lifetime. So, mean distance d = v * \u03c4.\n\nBut wait, what about relativistic effects? The particle's speed is probably close to the speed of light. So, I should calculate v \u2248 c, but maybe I need to be more precise.\n\nWait, the energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is E - m c\u00b2. Wait, but I'm not sure if I should use the rest mass or the total energy. Hmm, but for a moving particle, its total energy is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So the gamma factor is E / (m c\u00b2). Let's calculate that.\n\nE is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E/(m c\u00b2) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667. That means the particle is moving at a high speed, beta is v/c. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2), I can find beta. Let's see, gamma squared is (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 \u2248 (6.6667)^2 \u2248 44.444. So 1 - beta\u00b2 = 1/(gamma squared) \u2192 1/44.444 \u2248 0.0225. So beta\u00b2 \u2248 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 \u2192 beta \u2248 sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887c.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can approximate v as just c for an order of magnitude estimate. Because 0.9887 is close to 1. So perhaps the problem expects me to use v \u2248 c. Let's proceed with that for simplicity.\n\nSo first, calculate the lifetime \u03c4. The width \u0393 is 320 MeV. I need to convert that into units compatible with \u0127. Remember that \u0127 is about 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. But maybe I can just use the conversion factor where \u0127c is around 197 MeV\u00b7fm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nWait, the units: \u0393 is given in MeV. So I need to convert that into GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So \u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nNow, tau = \u0127 / \u0393. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32: 6.582 / 0.32 \u2248 20.56875. So tau \u2248 20.56875e-25 s \u2192 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, wait, no: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875 * 1e-25 s. So 2.056875e-24 s? No, wait, 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.\n\nThen, the mean decay distance d is v * tau. If v is approximately c (3e8 m/s), then:\n\nd = c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters. Hmm, looking at the options, none of them match that exactly. The options are all around 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the calculation: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is:\n\n6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 goes into 6.582 how many times? 0.32 * 20 is 6.4. So 20 times with 0.182 left. 0.182 / 0.32 \u2248 0.56875. So total is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.\n\nThen, distance d = c * tau = (3e8 m/s) * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters. Hmm, but none of the options match that exactly. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nB)4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nC)5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\nD)4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nWait, none of these are 6e-16. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the total energy E_X instead of the mass in calculating the velocity. Because the particle is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, which is higher than its rest mass. So the gamma factor is E_X / (m c^2). So yes, I did that correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the width. Let me double-check the units. Because \u0393 is given in MeV, but I converted it to GeV as 0.32 GeV. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula d = c * tau * beta * gamma. Because tau is the proper lifetime, and the observed lifetime is gamma * tau. So the mean path length is v * gamma tau. Wait, that's a different approach.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The lifetime measured in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. Because the particle is moving, so time dilation occurs. So the mean lifetime is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime (rest frame). So the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau_0.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought tau = \u0127 / Gamma. But Gamma is the total decay width, which is energy, so it's in the rest frame. So tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau_0.\n\nSo the mean decay distance would be v * gamma * tau_0. Hmm, so perhaps I missed the gamma factor in my initial calculation.\n\nWait, that's a big mistake. So I think I have to include the gamma factor.\n\nSo let's recalculate.\n\ntau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nThen, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau_0.\n\nGamma (as in Lorentz factor) is E_X / (m c^2) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.\n\nSo lab lifetime is 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s \u2248 1.3711e-23 s.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because the lifetime in the lab frame would be longer. But wait, the decay width is measured in the rest frame, so the lifetime is tau_0 = \u0127 / Gamma. The lab frame lifetime is longer by gamma.\n\nSo the mean path length d is v * lab_lifetime.\n\nv is approximately c, so d = c * gamma * tau_0.\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\ngamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.\n\ntau_0 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo gamma * tau_0 = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 \u2248 1.3711e-23 s.\n\nThen, distance d = c * 1.3711e-23 s.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\nd = 3e8 * 1.3711e-23 = 4.1133e-15 meters. Hmm, which is approximately 4.113e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.\n\nWait, so my calculation gives about 4.11e-15 meters. So closest is option B: 4.0655e-15 m. But why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I should be more precise with the gamma calculation.\n\nGamma = E/(m c\u00b2) = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 \u2248 6.666666667.\n\nTau_0 = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nGamma * tau_0 = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875e-24) /3 = (41.1375e-24)/3 = 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nThen, d = c * (gamma tau_0) = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nWhich is 4.11375e-15 meters. The option B is 4.0655e-15, which is a bit lower.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should compute more accurately.\n\nWait, let me compute gamma more accurately.\n\nGamma is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 \u2248 6.666666666666667.\n\nTau_0 is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute that precisely.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = ?\n\nWell, 0.32 is 32/100. So 6.582 * 100 /32 = 658.2 /32 = 20.56875.\n\nSo tau_0 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nGamma * tau_0 = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) / 3 * 1e-24.\n\n20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375.\n\n41.1375 /3 = 13.7125.\n\nSo 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nd = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (3 * 1.37125) * 1e-15 = 4.11375e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.114e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15, which is a bit less. So perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate v more accurately. Earlier, I approximated v as c, but perhaps I should use the exact value of beta.\n\nBeta was sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).\n\nGamma is 20/3 \u22486.666666667.\n\nGamma squared is (400/9) \u224844.44444444.\n\nSo 1 - (1/(gamma^2)) = 1 - 1/44.44444444 \u2248 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo v = 0.9887 * c.\n\nSo in the decay length calculation, I should use v = beta c, not c.\n\nSo decay length d = v * gamma tau_0 = beta c * gamma tau_0.\n\nWait, no. Because tau in the lab frame is gamma tau_0, and d = v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau_0.\n\nAlternatively, d = beta c gamma tau_0.\n\nSo let's compute beta * gamma.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) = sqrt(1 - (3\u00b2)/(20\u00b2)) ) = sqrt( (400 -9)/400 ) = sqrt(391/400) )= sqrt(0.9775) \u22480.9887.\n\nSo beta * gamma = 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u22486.5846.\n\nSo d = (beta gamma c) * tau_0.\n\nTau_0 is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo d = 6.5846 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, let's compute this.\n\nWait, 6.5846 * 3e8 = 1.97538e9 m/s.\n\nMultiply by tau_0=2.056875e-24 s:\n\nd = 1.97538e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97538 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 1.97538 *2.056875:\n\nApproximately, 2 * 2 is 4, but let's do it accurately.\n\n1.97538 *2.056875:\n\n= (2 - 0.02462) * (2 + 0.056875)\n= 2*2 + 2*0.056875 -0.02462*2 -0.02462*0.056875\n=4 + 0.11375 -0.04924 -0.001396\n=4 + 0.11375 =4.11375\n4.11375 -0.04924 =4.06451\n4.06451 -0.001396 \u22484.063114.\n\nSo approximately 4.063114e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option B.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which matches our calculation of approximately 4.063e-15, considering rounding errors.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we start by calculating the proper lifetime \\( \\tau_0 \\), which is related to the total decay width \\( \\Gamma \\) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}.\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( \\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and \\( \\hbar = 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_0 = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we account for time dilation due to the particle's relativistic motion. The Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{8 \\, \\text{GeV}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.6667.\n\\]\n\nThe lab-frame lifetime is then:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 6.6667 \\times 2.056875 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s} = 1.37125 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{s}.\n\\]\n\nThe mean decay distance \\( d \\) is the product of the particle's velocity \\( v \\) and the lab-frame lifetime \\( \\tau \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. \n\nWait, I remember that the decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula should be something like decay distance L = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2, where c is the speed of light, \u03c4 is the mean lifetime, and \u03b2 is the velocity relative to the speed of light. \n\nBut how do I find \u03c4? Oh, I think the mean lifetime \u03c4 is related to the decay width \u0393 through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time are inversely related. So \u03c4 is approximately \u0127 divided by \u0393. \n\nWait, wait. \u0393 is the total decay width, which is the total rate of decay. So the mean lifetime \u03c4 should be \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But I have to make sure about the units here. \n\nLet me jot down the constants. Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Wait, yes, I remember that 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and \u0127c is about 197 MeV\u00b7fm, but maybe I don't need that right now.\n\nSo first, calculate \u03c4. \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, but wait, that's 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s. Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. \n\nBut wait, no, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. Let me calculate 6.582 / 0.32. \n\n0.32 goes into 6.582 about 20.56875 times. So \u03c4 \u2248 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. \n\nBut wait, I think the decay width \u0393 is in the denominator because \u0393 is the uncertainty in energy, and \u03c4 is the uncertainty in time. So yes, that makes sense. \n\nNext, I need to find the velocity \u03b2. But wait, for that, I think I need the energy of the meson. The production energy is E_X = 8 GeV, but the rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can find the Lorentz gamma factor. \n\nThe energy E is related to the rest mass by E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. Since we're dealing in GeV and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, maybe the units will work out. \n\nSo \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2). Wait, but actually, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c\u00b2. So when you multiply m c\u00b2, you get GeV. So \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2) \u2192 but since E is given as 8 GeV, and m c\u00b2 is 1.2 GeV, then \u03b3 = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667. \n\nWait, but in natural units where c=1, E = \u03b3 m. So yes, \u03b3 = E / m = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667. \n\nThen, \u03b2 is sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Let me compute that. 1/\u03b3\u00b2 is (1/6.6667)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. \n\nSo \u03b2 \u2248 0.9887. \n\nNow, the decay length L is c * \u03c4 * \u03b2. \n\nWait, c is the speed of light, about 3e8 meters per second. \n\nSo let's compute each part. \n\nFirst, \u03c4 is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Multiply by c: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.1706e-16 meters. Then multiply by \u03b2: 6.1706e-16 m * 0.9887 \u2248 6.106e-16 m. \n\nWait, but none of the options are around 6e-16. Hmm. Let me check the calculations again. Maybe I messed up the exponents. \n\nWait, let's go back. \n\nWait, \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nThen, c is 3e8 m/s. So c * \u03c4 is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters. \n\nMultiply by \u03b2: 0.9887 * 6.170625e-16 \u2248 6.106e-16 m. \n\nHmm, but the options are around 4e-15 or 5e-15. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me recalculate beta.\n\nWait, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667. So 1/gamma^2 is 1/(44.4444) = approx 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in units for tau? Let me double-check. \u0393 is given in MeV, but I converted it to GeV correctly. Yes, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the natural units where \u0127c is used. Alternatively, maybe the formula for decay length is different. Oh wait, another approach: the decay length can be calculated using L = c * (\u0127 / (\u0393 c)) * (E/m) * ... Wait, perhaps I should use the formula L = (\u0127 c) / (\u0393) * (E/m) ) / m ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about it another way. The mean lifetime is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. So the time is \u03c4. The distance is then velocity times time. The velocity v = \u03b2 c. So L = v \u03c4 = \u03b2 c (\u0127 / \u0393). \n\nBut wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of energy. Hmm, maybe the expression for the decay length is L = (c * \u0127) / (\u0393) * (E/(m)) * something. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. \n\nWait, let me compute all the steps again carefully. \n\nGamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s. So c * \u03c4 = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters. \n\nMultiply by \u03b2: 0.9887 * 6.170625e-16 \u2248 6.106e-16 m.\n\nWait, but none of the options are around 6e-16. The options are A)5.02e-16, B)4.06e-15, C)5.02e-15, D)4.06e-16.\n\nHmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the decay length formula is different. Wait, perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, but I should consider that \u0393 is in MeV, but when using \u0127, which is in GeV\u00b7s, perhaps I should convert \u0393 into GeV. Oh wait, I did that correctly: 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, but maybe I should use the relativistic formula for beta. Let me check that again. \n\nBeta is v/c = sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2). \n\nSince E is 8 GeV and m c^2 is 1.2 GeV, so (m c^2 / E ) = 1.2 / 8 = 0.15. So 1 - (0.15)^2 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot to include the gamma factor correctly. Wait, no, because L is c * tau * beta, which is correct. \n\nWait, maybe I should compute the energy correctly. Let me think: E = gamma m c\u00b2. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667. Then, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444))) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So that part is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L. Let me recompute it.\n\nc * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nMultiply by beta: 0.9887 * 6.170625e-16 = 6.106e-16 m. \n\nBut the options don't have anything around 6e-16. So maybe I messed up the calculation of tau. Wait, perhaps the formula for tau is different. Oh wait, another thought: in particle physics, the width \u0393 is related to the lifetime by \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393). But perhaps I should use \u0393 in energy units compatible with \u0127.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express \u0393 in GeV. Yes, I did that. So 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So that's correct. \n\nWait, maybe the formula for L is (c * \u0127) / (\u0393) * (E/m). Wait, let me think. Let me write down all the variables:\n\nL = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2 = c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * \u03b2.\n\nBut beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nAlternatively, since E = gamma m c\u00b2, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nSo, let me try to write L in terms of E, m, \u0393, and \u0127.\n\nSo L = c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nHmm, perhaps I should compute this expression step by step.\n\nCompute sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)):\n\nm = 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2, E =8 GeV. So (m c^2)^2 / (E)^2 = (1.2)^2 / (8)^2 = (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225. So sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo back to L: c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * 0.9887.\n\nBut c is 3e8 m/s, \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, \u0393 is 0.32 GeV. \n\nSo let me compute (\u0127 / \u0393) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nMultiply by c: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by beta: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.106e-16 m.\n\nWait, but the options don't have this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me think again. Oh wait, E is the total energy, including rest mass. So beta is v/c = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nWait, let me compute m c^2: m c^2 is 1.2 GeV. E is 8 GeV. So (m c^2 / E) is 0.15. So (m c^2 / E)^2 is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775, sqrt is ~0.9887. So that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the width \u0393 is given in MeV, and perhaps I should use the correct unit conversion. Let me check the units again.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So I did that correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L. Let me compute each step numerically.\n\nCompute (\u0127 / \u0393):\n\n\u0127 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\n\u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s.\n\nWhich is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.\n\nMultiply by c: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by beta: 0.9887 * 6.170625e-16 \u2248 6.106e-16 m.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I missed a factor. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the width is given in MeV, so perhaps I should use 320 MeV without converting to GeV? Let me try that.\n\nIf \u0393 is 320 MeV, and \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, then 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that the decay width is given as 320 MeV, but the formula uses the natural unit where \u0127c is used. Hmm, perhaps another approach: the decay length L can be expressed as L = (c * \u0127) / (\u0393) * (E/m) * something.\n\nWait, another approach: the decay length is (c * \u0127 * E) / (m * \u0393). Let me think. Let me see:\n\nL = c * \u03c4 * beta = c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * beta.\n\nBut beta is sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nWait, let me substitute beta:\n\nL = c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 )\n\nBut perhaps I can write this as L = c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ) / E.\n\nHmm, let me compute E^2 - (m c^2)^2: (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56.\n\nSo sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 ) = sqrt(62.56) / E = 7.91 / 8 \u2248 0.98875. Same as before.\n\nSo, L = c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * (7.91 / 8 GeV) / GeV \u2192 since E is in GeV, the units may work out.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the expression as:\n\nL = (c * \u0127) / \u0393 * sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nSo let's compute each part numerically.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u0127 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\n\u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nsqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)) = 0.9887.\n\nSo L = (3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s ) / 0.32 GeV * 0.9887.\n\nWait, let me compute the numerator first: 3e8 * 6.582e-25 = 1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nThen divide by 0.32 GeV: (1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m) / 0.32 GeV = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.106e-16 m.\n\nAgain, same result. So none of the options match. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor because of unit conversions. Wait, maybe I should consider that \u0127 is in J\u00b7s, not GeV\u00b7s. Oh wait, perhaps I should convert \u0127 to J\u00b7s.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Let me think again about the units.\n\nPlanck's constant \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. But to compute in SI units, I need to convert GeV to Joules.\n\n1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J. So 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s = 6.582e-25 * 1.602e-10 J\u00b7s \u2248 1.054e-34 J\u00b7s, which is the correct value for \u0127 (since \u0127 \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s).\n\nBut perhaps I should compute using SI units instead of natural units. Let's try that.\n\nCompute tau \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut \u0393 is in MeV. So let's convert \u0393 to J.\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 320 MeV = 320e6 eV = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 5.1264e-11 J.\n\nSo \u0127 is 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.1264e-11 J) \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds. Same as before.\n\nSo that doesn't change the result. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that I should use E = 8 GeV, but the energy of the meson is its kinetic energy, not total energy? No, I don't think so. The problem states E_X is the production energy, which should be the total energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the mean decay distance using the formula L = (c * \u0127) * (E) / (\u0393 m c^2). Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units where c=1 and \u0127=1. Then, the decay length is L = (E/(\u0393 m)) * (1/c^2) * c * tau. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, another formula I found once: the decay length L = (c * \u0127) * (E) / (\u0393 m c^2) ) * (sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 )).\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\nc * \u0127 = 3e8 m/s * 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. Wait, but J is kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2, so (m/s) * (kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2 \u00b7 s) ) = kg\u00b7m^3/s^2. Hmm, not sure. Maybe better to compute in terms of units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the decay length in terms of E, m, and \u0393.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed a factor of gamma somewhere. Let me think again: the mean lifetime is tau = \u0127 / \u0393. The velocity is beta c. So L = beta c tau.\n\nBut beta is gamma (v/c) = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nSo L = c * tau * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I should calculate using the speed in terms of beta, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong formula. Let me look for another approach.\n\nAnother approach: The decay length is given by L = (c * \u0127) * (E) / (\u0393 * m) * (sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 )).\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nCompute (c * \u0127) = 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s = 1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nThen, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.\n\nSo (E) / (\u0393 * m) = 8 GeV / (0.32 GeV * 1.2 GeV) = 8 / (0.384) \u2248 20.8333.\n\nMultiply by sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo L = 1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m * 20.8333 * 0.9887.\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m * 20.8333 = (1.9746e-16) * 20.8333 \u2248 4.116e-15 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nMultiply by 0.9887: 4.116e-15 * 0.9887 \u2248 4.072e-15 m.\n\nWhich is about 4.07e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15.\n\nWait, 4.07e-15 is close to option B (4.0655e-15). So perhaps the correct answer is B.\n\nBut wait, why did this approach give a different result than the earlier one? Because earlier I got around 6e-16 m, but this approach gives around 4e-15 m. There's a discrepancy. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in this approach. Let me think again. Because in this approach, I'm computing (c * \u0127) * (E) / (\u0393 * m) * sqrt(...).\n\nWait, let me double-check the units. \n\nc is in m/s, \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s. So c * \u0127 would be (m/s) * (GeV\u00b7s) = GeV\u00b7m.\n\nE is in GeV, m is in GeV/c\u00b2. Wait, but in this approach, when I compute (E)/(\u0393 * m), what are the units?\n\nE is GeV, \u0393 is GeV, m is GeV/c\u00b2. So units are (GeV) / ( GeV * GeV/c\u00b2 ) ) \u2192 (1/(GeV c\u00b2 )) \u2192 Wait, perhaps I should not worry about units and just compute numerically.\n\nLet me compute each part again:\n\n(c * \u0127) = 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s = 3e8 *6.582e-25 * 1e9 eV\u00b7m \u2192 Wait, no, GeV is 1e9 eV. Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps this approach is correct because it's using the formula L = (c * \u0127) * (E) / (\u0393 * m) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2).\n\nWait, let me compute each part:\n\n(c * \u0127) = 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s = 1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nE = 8 GeV.\n\n\u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nm = 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo (E) / (\u0393 * m) = 8 / (0.32 * 1.2) = 8 / 0.384 \u2248 20.8333.\n\nMultiply by sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo L = 1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m * 20.8333 * 0.9887.\n\nCompute 1.9746e-16 * 20.8333 = approx 4.116e-15 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nThen multiply by 0.9887 \u2192 4.116e-15 * 0.9887 \u2248 4.07e-15 m.\n\nSo this gives approximately 4.07e-15 m, which matches option B (4.0655e-15 m).\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed using tau and beta, I got around 6e-16 m. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the initial approach, I calculated tau as \u0127 / \u0393, which is correct. Then, L = c * tau * beta.\n\nBut when I computed it, I got about 6e-16 m, but according to the second approach, it's about 4e-15 m.\n\nHmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation in the first approach. Let me recheck.\n\nFirst approach:\n\ntau = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nc * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by beta: 0.9887 * 6.170625e-16 = approx 6.106e-16 m.\n\nBut according to the second approach, the answer is about 4.07e-15 m, which is an order of magnitude larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot to consider that beta is (sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 )) and not (sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 )). But no, that's the same because m c^2 is E_rest = 1.2 GeV.\n\nWait, another possibility: I confused the decay width \u0393 with the mass m. But no, the width is given correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the first approach is wrong because I should have used the energy E in a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is L = (c * \u0127) * (E) / (\u0393 * m) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ). That gives 4.07e-15 m, which is option B.\n\nBut why did the first approach give a different result? Because perhaps in the first approach, I forgot that the velocity is beta = v/c, but perhaps I should have used beta gamma?\n\nWait, no, L is v * tau, which is beta c * tau. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me compute beta again.\n\nE = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nIn natural units, c=1, so beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nCorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first approach is correct, but the second approach is not. Alternatively, perhaps the second approach is wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the velocity as v = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / E.\n\nWait, in any case, perhaps the correct approach is the first one, and perhaps the options are wrong. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach.\n\nWait, let me try to compute using the second approach again.\n\n(c * \u0127) = 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, GeV is 1e9 eV, but perhaps I should convert GeV to kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nWait, 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J (since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1e9 eV = 1.602e-10 J).\n\nSo, (c * \u0127) in m\u00b7J\u00b7s? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second approach is correct and the first approach is missing a factor.\n\nWait, let me compute the two approaches numerically.\n\nFirst approach gives L = 6.106e-16 m.\n\nSecond approach gives L = 4.07e-15 m.\n\nHmm, they differ by a factor of about 6.6667, which is gamma (8/1.2 = 6.6667). Interesting.\n\nSo, 4.07e-15 m is about 6.6667 times larger than 6.1e-16 m.\n\nWait, so perhaps the second approach is correct, and the first approach missed a factor of gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I forgot to multiply by gamma. Because, the decay length could be L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nWait, but beta is already multiplied by gamma in the expression for velocity. Wait, no, gamma is E/(m c^2), and beta is sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E )^2 ).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is L = gamma * beta * c * tau. But that would be gamma * beta * c tau.\n\nWait, but c tau is (c * \u0127 ) / Gamma.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is L = gamma * beta * (c tau) = gamma * beta * (c * \u0127 / Gamma).\n\nBut in the first approach, I computed L as beta * c tau, which is beta * (c * \u0127 / Gamma). So perhaps I missed the gamma factor.\n\nWait, but wait, gamma is E/(m c^2) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.\n\nSo, if I multiply the first approach's result by gamma, I get 6.106e-16 m * 6.6667 \u2248 4.07e-15 m, which matches the second approach.\n\nAh! So I think I see the mistake. In the first approach, I used L = beta * c tau, but perhaps the correct formula is L = gamma * beta * c tau.\n\nWait, but why would that be the case? Let me think about units. Let me see, tau is the lifetime, which is the same in all frames. But the velocity beta is frame-dependent. Hmm, perhaps the decay length is gamma * beta * c * tau. Because the particle is moving, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma.\n\nWait, no, the mean lifetime tau is the proper time, the lifetime in the rest frame. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. Because in the rest frame, the lifetime is tau, but in the lab frame, it's longer by gamma.\n\nWait, no, wait. In the rest frame, the lifetime is tau. In the lab frame, moving at velocity v, the lifetime is gamma tau. Because time dilation occurs.\n\nSo the decay length L is v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame: t = gamma tau.\n\nSo L = v * gamma tau.\n\nv = beta c.\n\nSo L = beta c gamma tau.\n\nWait, so L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nBut tau is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo L = beta gamma c (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nBut beta gamma can be written as gamma beta.\n\nHmm, let me compute beta gamma.\n\ngamma = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nbeta = 0.9887.\n\nSo beta gamma = 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.582.\n\nSo L = c * tau * beta gamma.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by beta gamma (6.582): 6.170625e-16 * 6.582 \u2248 4.07e-15 m.\n\nWhich matches the second approach.\n\nAh, so I see where I went wrong. I forgot to include the gamma factor in the first approach. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma, so the decay length is L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nWhich gives L \u2248 4.07e-15 m, matching option B.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. \n\nWait, I remember that the decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula should be something like decay distance L = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2, where c is the speed of light, \u03c4 is the mean lifetime, and \u03b2 is the velocity relative to the speed of light. \n\nBut how do I find \u03c4? Oh, I think the mean lifetime \u03c4 is related to the decay width \u0393 through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time are inversely related. So \u03c4 is approximately \u0127 divided by \u0393. \n\nWait, wait. \u0393 is the total decay width, which is the total rate of decay. So the mean lifetime \u03c4 should be \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But I have to make sure about the units here. \n\nLet me jot down the constants. Planck's constant \u0127 is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. Wait, yes, I remember that 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and \u0127c is about 197 MeV\u00b7fm, but maybe I don't need that right now.\n\nSo first, calculate \u03c4. \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, but wait, that's 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s. Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. \n\nBut wait, no, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. Let me calculate 6.582 / 0.32. \n\n0.32 goes into 6.582 about 20.56875 times. So \u03c4 \u2248 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. \n\nBut wait, I think the decay width \u0393 is in the denominator because \u0393 is the uncertainty in energy, and \u03c4 is the uncertainty in time. So yes, that makes sense. \n\nNext, I need to find the velocity \u03b2. But wait, for that, I think I need the energy of the meson. The production energy is E_X = 8 GeV, but the rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can find the Lorentz gamma factor. \n\nThe energy E is related to the rest mass by E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. Since we're dealing in GeV and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, maybe the units will work out. \n\nSo \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2). Wait, but actually, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c\u00b2. So when you multiply m c\u00b2, you get GeV. So \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2) \u2192 but since E is given as 8 GeV, and m c\u00b2 is 1.2 GeV, then \u03b3 = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667. \n\nWait, but in natural units where c=1, E = \u03b3 m. So yes, \u03b3 = E / m = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667. \n\nThen, \u03b2 is sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Let me compute that. 1/\u03b3\u00b2 is (1/6.6667)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. \n\nSo \u03b2 \u2248 0.9887. \n\nNow, the decay length L is c * \u03c4 * \u03b2. \n\nWait, c is the speed of light, about 3e8 meters per second. \n\nSo let's compute each part. \n\nFirst, \u03c4 is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Multiply by c: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.1706e-16 meters. Then multiply by \u03b2: 6.1706e-16 m * 0.9887 \u2248 6.106e-16 m. \n\nWait, but none of the options are around 6e-16. Hmm. Let me check the calculations again. Maybe I messed up the exponents. \n\nWait, let's go back. \n\nWait, \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nThen, c is 3e8 m/s. So c * \u03c4 is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters. \n\nMultiply by \u03b2: 0.9887 * 6.170625e-16 \u2248 6.106e-16 m. \n\nHmm, but the options are around 4e-15 or 5e-15. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me recalculate beta.\n\nWait, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667. So 1/gamma^2 is 1/(44.4444) = approx 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in units for tau? Let me double-check. \u0393 is given in MeV, but I converted it to GeV correctly. Yes, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the natural units where \u0127c is used. Alternatively, maybe the formula for decay length is different. Oh wait, another approach: the decay length can be calculated using L = c * (\u0127 / (\u0393 c)) * (E/m) * ... Wait, perhaps I should use the formula L = (\u0127 c) / (\u0393) * (E/m) ) / m ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about it another way. The mean lifetime is \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. So the time is \u03c4. The distance is then velocity times time. The velocity v = \u03b2 c. So L = v \u03c4 = \u03b2 c (\u0127 / \u0393). \n\nBut wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of energy. Hmm, maybe the expression for the decay length is L = (c * \u0127) / (\u0393) * (E/(m)) * something. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. \n\nWait, let me compute all the steps again carefully. \n\nGamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s. So c * \u03c4 = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters. \n\nMultiply by \u03b2: 0.9887 * 6.170625e-16 \u2248 6.106e-16 m.\n\nWait, but none of the options are around 6e-16. The options are A)5.02e-16, B)4.06e-15, C)5.02e-15, D)4.06e-16.\n\nHmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the decay length formula is different. Wait, perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, but I should consider that \u0393 is in MeV, but when using \u0127, which is in GeV\u00b7s, perhaps I should convert \u0393 into GeV. Oh wait, I did that correctly: 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.\n\nWait, but maybe I should use the relativistic formula for beta. Let me check that again. \n\nBeta is v/c = sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2). \n\nSince E is 8 GeV and m c^2 is 1.2 GeV, so (m c^2 / E ) = 1.2 / 8 = 0.15. So 1 - (0.15)^2 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot to include the gamma factor correctly. Wait, no, because L is c * tau * beta, which is correct. \n\nWait, maybe I should compute the energy correctly. Let me think: E = gamma m c\u00b2. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667. Then, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444))) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So that part is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L. Let me recompute it.\n\nc * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 meters.\n\nMultiply by beta: 0.9887 * 6.170625e-16 = 6.106e-16 m. \n\nBut the options don't have anything around 6e-16. So maybe I messed up the calculation of tau. Wait, perhaps the formula for tau is different. Oh wait, another thought: in particle physics, the width \u0393 is related to the lifetime by \u03c4 = \u0127/(\u0393). But perhaps I should use \u0393 in energy units compatible with \u0127.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express \u0393 in GeV. Yes, I did that. So 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So that's correct. \n\nWait, maybe the formula for L is (c * \u0127) / (\u0393) * (E/m). Wait, let me think. Let me write down all the variables:\n\nL = c * \u03c4 * \u03b2 = c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * \u03b2.\n\nBut beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nAlternatively, since E = gamma m c\u00b2, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nSo, let me try to write L in terms of E, m, \u0393, and \u0127.\n\nSo L = c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nHmm, perhaps I should compute this expression step by step.\n\nCompute sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)):\n\nm = 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2, E =8 GeV. So (m c^2)^2 / (E)^2 = (1.2)^2 / (8)^2 = (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225. So sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo back to L: c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * 0.9887.\n\nBut c is 3e8 m/s, \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, \u0393 is 0.32 GeV. \n\nSo let me compute (\u0127 / \u0393) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nMultiply by c: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by beta: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.106e-16 m.\n\nWait, but the options don't have this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me think again. Oh wait, E is the total energy, including rest mass. So beta is v/c = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nWait, let me compute m c^2: m c^2 is 1.2 GeV. E is 8 GeV. So (m c^2 / E) is 0.15. So (m c^2 / E)^2 is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775, sqrt is ~0.9887. So that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the width \u0393 is given in MeV, and perhaps I should use the correct unit conversion. Let me check the units again.\n\n\u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So I did that correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L. Let me compute each step numerically.\n\nCompute (\u0127 / \u0393):\n\n\u0127 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\n\u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s.\n\nWhich is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.\n\nMultiply by c: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by beta: 0.9887 * 6.170625e-16 \u2248 6.106e-16 m.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I missed a factor. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the width is given in MeV, so perhaps I should use 320 MeV without converting to GeV? Let me try that.\n\nIf \u0393 is 320 MeV, and \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, then 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that the decay width is given as 320 MeV, but the formula uses the natural unit where \u0127c is used. Hmm, perhaps another approach: the decay length L can be expressed as L = (c * \u0127) / (\u0393) * (E/m) * something.\n\nWait, another approach: the decay length is (c * \u0127 * E) / (m * \u0393). Let me think. Let me see:\n\nL = c * \u03c4 * beta = c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * beta.\n\nBut beta is sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nWait, let me substitute beta:\n\nL = c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 )\n\nBut perhaps I can write this as L = c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ) / E.\n\nHmm, let me compute E^2 - (m c^2)^2: (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56.\n\nSo sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV.\n\nSo sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 ) = sqrt(62.56) / E = 7.91 / 8 \u2248 0.98875. Same as before.\n\nSo, L = c * (\u0127 / \u0393) * (7.91 / 8 GeV) / GeV \u2192 since E is in GeV, the units may work out.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the expression as:\n\nL = (c * \u0127) / \u0393 * sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nSo let's compute each part numerically.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u0127 = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\n\u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nsqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)) = 0.9887.\n\nSo L = (3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s ) / 0.32 GeV * 0.9887.\n\nWait, let me compute the numerator first: 3e8 * 6.582e-25 = 1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nThen divide by 0.32 GeV: (1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m) / 0.32 GeV = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.106e-16 m.\n\nAgain, same result. So none of the options match. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor because of unit conversions. Wait, maybe I should consider that \u0127 is in J\u00b7s, not GeV\u00b7s. Oh wait, perhaps I should convert \u0127 to J\u00b7s.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Let me think again about the units.\n\nPlanck's constant \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. But to compute in SI units, I need to convert GeV to Joules.\n\n1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J. So 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s = 6.582e-25 * 1.602e-10 J\u00b7s \u2248 1.054e-34 J\u00b7s, which is the correct value for \u0127 (since \u0127 \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s).\n\nBut perhaps I should compute using SI units instead of natural units. Let's try that.\n\nCompute tau \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nBut \u0393 is in MeV. So let's convert \u0393 to J.\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 320 MeV = 320e6 eV = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 5.1264e-11 J.\n\nSo \u0127 is 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.1264e-11 J) \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds. Same as before.\n\nSo that doesn't change the result. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that I should use E = 8 GeV, but the energy of the meson is its kinetic energy, not total energy? No, I don't think so. The problem states E_X is the production energy, which should be the total energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the mean decay distance using the formula L = (c * \u0127) * (E) / (\u0393 m c^2). Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units where c=1 and \u0127=1. Then, the decay length is L = (E/(\u0393 m)) * (1/c^2) * c * tau. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, another formula I found once: the decay length L = (c * \u0127) * (E) / (\u0393 m c^2) ) * (sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 )).\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\nc * \u0127 = 3e8 m/s * 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. Wait, but J is kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2, so (m/s) * (kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2 \u00b7 s) ) = kg\u00b7m^3/s^2. Hmm, not sure. Maybe better to compute in terms of units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the decay length in terms of E, m, and \u0393.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed a factor of gamma somewhere. Let me think again: the mean lifetime is tau = \u0127 / \u0393. The velocity is beta c. So L = beta c tau.\n\nBut beta is gamma (v/c) = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nSo L = c * tau * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I should calculate using the speed in terms of beta, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong formula. Let me look for another approach.\n\nAnother approach: The decay length is given by L = (c * \u0127) * (E) / (\u0393 * m) * (sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 )).\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nCompute (c * \u0127) = 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s = 1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nThen, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.\n\nSo (E) / (\u0393 * m) = 8 GeV / (0.32 GeV * 1.2 GeV) = 8 / (0.384) \u2248 20.8333.\n\nMultiply by sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo L = 1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m * 20.8333 * 0.9887.\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m * 20.8333 = (1.9746e-16) * 20.8333 \u2248 4.116e-15 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nMultiply by 0.9887: 4.116e-15 * 0.9887 \u2248 4.072e-15 m.\n\nWhich is about 4.07e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15.\n\nWait, 4.07e-15 is close to option B (4.0655e-15). So perhaps the correct answer is B.\n\nBut wait, why did this approach give a different result than the earlier one? Because earlier I got around 6e-16 m, but this approach gives around 4e-15 m. There's a discrepancy. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in this approach. Let me think again. Because in this approach, I'm computing (c * \u0127) * (E) / (\u0393 * m) * sqrt(...).\n\nWait, let me double-check the units. \n\nc is in m/s, \u0127 is in GeV\u00b7s. So c * \u0127 would be (m/s) * (GeV\u00b7s) = GeV\u00b7m.\n\nE is in GeV, m is in GeV/c\u00b2. Wait, but in this approach, when I compute (E)/(\u0393 * m), what are the units?\n\nE is GeV, \u0393 is GeV, m is GeV/c\u00b2. So units are (GeV) / ( GeV * GeV/c\u00b2 ) ) \u2192 (1/(GeV c\u00b2 )) \u2192 Wait, perhaps I should not worry about units and just compute numerically.\n\nLet me compute each part again:\n\n(c * \u0127) = 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s = 3e8 *6.582e-25 * 1e9 eV\u00b7m \u2192 Wait, no, GeV is 1e9 eV. Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps this approach is correct because it's using the formula L = (c * \u0127) * (E) / (\u0393 * m) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2).\n\nWait, let me compute each part:\n\n(c * \u0127) = 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s = 1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nE = 8 GeV.\n\n\u0393 = 0.32 GeV.\n\nm = 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo (E) / (\u0393 * m) = 8 / (0.32 * 1.2) = 8 / 0.384 \u2248 20.8333.\n\nMultiply by sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo L = 1.9746e-16 GeV\u00b7m * 20.8333 * 0.9887.\n\nCompute 1.9746e-16 * 20.8333 = approx 4.116e-15 GeV\u00b7m.\n\nThen multiply by 0.9887 \u2192 4.116e-15 * 0.9887 \u2248 4.07e-15 m.\n\nSo this gives approximately 4.07e-15 m, which matches option B (4.0655e-15 m).\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed using tau and beta, I got around 6e-16 m. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the initial approach, I calculated tau as \u0127 / \u0393, which is correct. Then, L = c * tau * beta.\n\nBut when I computed it, I got about 6e-16 m, but according to the second approach, it's about 4e-15 m.\n\nHmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation in the first approach. Let me recheck.\n\nFirst approach:\n\ntau = 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nc * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by beta: 0.9887 * 6.170625e-16 = approx 6.106e-16 m.\n\nBut according to the second approach, the answer is about 4.07e-15 m, which is an order of magnitude larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot to consider that beta is (sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 )) and not (sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 )). But no, that's the same because m c^2 is E_rest = 1.2 GeV.\n\nWait, another possibility: I confused the decay width \u0393 with the mass m. But no, the width is given correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the first approach is wrong because I should have used the energy E in a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is L = (c * \u0127) * (E) / (\u0393 * m) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ). That gives 4.07e-15 m, which is option B.\n\nBut why did the first approach give a different result? Because perhaps in the first approach, I forgot that the velocity is beta = v/c, but perhaps I should have used beta gamma?\n\nWait, no, L is v * tau, which is beta c * tau. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me compute beta again.\n\nE = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2 c^4)/(E\u00b2)).\n\nIn natural units, c=1, so beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nCorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first approach is correct, but the second approach is not. Alternatively, perhaps the second approach is wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the velocity as v = (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^(1/2) / E.\n\nWait, in any case, perhaps the correct approach is the first one, and perhaps the options are wrong. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach.\n\nWait, let me try to compute using the second approach again.\n\n(c * \u0127) = 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, GeV is 1e9 eV, but perhaps I should convert GeV to kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2.\n\nWait, 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J (since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1e9 eV = 1.602e-10 J).\n\nSo, (c * \u0127) in m\u00b7J\u00b7s? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second approach is correct and the first approach is missing a factor.\n\nWait, let me compute the two approaches numerically.\n\nFirst approach gives L = 6.106e-16 m.\n\nSecond approach gives L = 4.07e-15 m.\n\nHmm, they differ by a factor of about 6.6667, which is gamma (8/1.2 = 6.6667). Interesting.\n\nSo, 4.07e-15 m is about 6.6667 times larger than 6.1e-16 m.\n\nWait, so perhaps the second approach is correct, and the first approach missed a factor of gamma.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I forgot to multiply by gamma. Because, the decay length could be L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nWait, but beta is already multiplied by gamma in the expression for velocity. Wait, no, gamma is E/(m c^2), and beta is sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E )^2 ).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is L = gamma * beta * c * tau. But that would be gamma * beta * c tau.\n\nWait, but c tau is (c * \u0127 ) / Gamma.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is L = gamma * beta * (c tau) = gamma * beta * (c * \u0127 / Gamma).\n\nBut in the first approach, I computed L as beta * c tau, which is beta * (c * \u0127 / Gamma). So perhaps I missed the gamma factor.\n\nWait, but wait, gamma is E/(m c^2) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.\n\nSo, if I multiply the first approach's result by gamma, I get 6.106e-16 m * 6.6667 \u2248 4.07e-15 m, which matches the second approach.\n\nAh! So I think I see the mistake. In the first approach, I used L = beta * c tau, but perhaps the correct formula is L = gamma * beta * c tau.\n\nWait, but why would that be the case? Let me think about units. Let me see, tau is the lifetime, which is the same in all frames. But the velocity beta is frame-dependent. Hmm, perhaps the decay length is gamma * beta * c * tau. Because the particle is moving, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma.\n\nWait, no, the mean lifetime tau is the proper time, the lifetime in the rest frame. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. Because in the rest frame, the lifetime is tau, but in the lab frame, it's longer by gamma.\n\nWait, no, wait. In the rest frame, the lifetime is tau. In the lab frame, moving at velocity v, the lifetime is gamma tau. Because time dilation occurs.\n\nSo the decay length L is v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame: t = gamma tau.\n\nSo L = v * gamma tau.\n\nv = beta c.\n\nSo L = beta c gamma tau.\n\nWait, so L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nBut tau is \u0127 / Gamma.\n\nSo L = beta gamma c (\u0127 / Gamma).\n\nBut beta gamma can be written as gamma beta.\n\nHmm, let me compute beta gamma.\n\ngamma = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nbeta = 0.9887.\n\nSo beta gamma = 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.582.\n\nSo L = c * tau * beta gamma.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.\n\nMultiply by beta gamma (6.582): 6.170625e-16 * 6.582 \u2248 4.07e-15 m.\n\nWhich matches the second approach.\n\nAh, so I see where I went wrong. I forgot to include the gamma factor in the first approach. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma, so the decay length is L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute L = beta gamma c tau.\n\nWhich gives L \u2248 4.07e-15 m, matching option B.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance \\( L \\) of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nL = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{m^2 c^4}{E^2}} \\) is the velocity of the particle in units of \\( c \\),\n- \\( \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m c^2} \\) is the Lorentz factor,\n- \\( \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} \\) is the mean lifetime,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light,\n- \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck constant,\n- \\( \\Gamma \\) is the total decay width.\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( \\tau \\)\nThe mean lifetime \\( \\tau \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( \\hbar = 6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV\u00b7s} \\) and \\( \\Gamma = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.\n\nThe question gives me some values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (\u03c4), but then again, particles moving relativistically might have a longer distance because of their velocity.\n\nSo, first, I think I need to find the lifetime \u03c4 of the meson. I remember the uncertainty principle relating the width \u0393 to the lifetime. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. So, \u0393 is the uncertainty in energy, and \u03c4 is the mean lifetime. So \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nWait, but I should check the exact relation. The width \u0393 is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the mean lifetime. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, sometimes it's written as \u0393 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4, so \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo let's compute \u03c4. But wait, the units. Let me make sure I convert everything properly. \u0393 is given in MeV, so I need to convert that to Joules. Because \u0127 is in J\u00b7s.\n\nWait, let me recall the constants. Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s. So \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nBut \u0393 is 320 MeV. Oh, I need to convert MeV to Joules. 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. So 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J. Let me calculate that.\n\n320e6 = 3.2e8. So 3.2e8 * 1.60218e-19 = 5.126976e-11 J.\n\nSo \u0393 = 5.126976e-11 J.\n\nNow, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. So \u03c4 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.126976e-11 J) \u2248 2.057e-24 seconds. Wait, let me compute that.\n\n1.05457e-34 / 5.126976e-11 \u2248 let's see, 1e-34 / 5e-11 is about 2e-24. But let me be precise.\n\nDivide 1.0545718 by 5.126976. Let's approximate. 5.126976 is approximately 5.127. 1.05457 / 5.127 \u2248 0.2056. So 0.2056e-23 = 2.056e-24 seconds. So \u03c4 \u2248 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nBut wait, particles moving at relativistic speeds would have a longer lifetime in their rest frame? Or is the lifetime \u03c4 already the proper time (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame)?\n\nAh, right, the lifetime \u03c4 is the proper time, the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. So to find the distance it travels before decaying, I need to multiply \u03c4 by the velocity of the particle times the speed of light.\n\nWait, the velocity v can be found from the energy and mass. The total energy E is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass energy is m_X c\u00b2, which is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is E - m_X c\u00b2 = 8 - 1.2 = 6.8 GeV.\n\nWait, but to find the velocity, perhaps I should use the relativistic energy formula. The total energy E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) = (8 GeV)/(1.2 GeV) = 8/1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nSo \u03b3 is about 6.6667. Then \u03b2 = v/c can be found from \u03b3. The relation is \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2\u00b2). So let's solve for \u03b2.\n\nLet me compute \u03b2. So, \u03b3 = 6.6667. Then,\n\n\u03b3\u00b2 = (1)/(1 - \u03b2\u00b2) \u2192 1 - \u03b2\u00b2 = 1/\u03b3\u00b2 \u2192 \u03b2\u00b2 = 1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2.\n\nSo compute 1/\u03b3\u00b2: (1/6.6667)^2 \u2248 (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So \u03b2\u00b2 = 0.9775 \u2192 \u03b2 \u2248 sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let's compute 1/(6.6667)^2.\n\n6.6667 is 20/3. So (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u2248 44.4444. So 1/(44.4444) \u2248 0.0225. So yes, same as before.\n\nSo \u03b2 \u2248 sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo v \u2248 0.9887c. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo the velocity is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance L is v * \u03c4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, \u03c4 is the proper time, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. But the particle is moving at a high speed, so from our lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma. So the mean lifetime observed in the lab is \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nSo L = v * (\u03b3 \u03c4) = v \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nWait, but wait, another approach: the mean path length is L = (v * \u03c4) * gamma? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nProper time is \u03c4. The lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4. So the distance is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime: L = v * \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nSo L = v \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nAlternatively, since \u03c4 is the proper time, the lab frame observes the lifetime as longer, so \u03c4_lab = \u03b3 \u03c4. So L = v * \u03c4_lab = v \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo let me compute each part.\n\nWe have:\n\nv \u2248 0.9887c \u2248 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\n\u03b3 = 6.6667.\n\n\u03c4 \u2248 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L = v * gamma * tau.\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nv * gamma = (2.966e8 m/s) * 6.6667 \u2248 2.966e8 * 6.6667 \u2248 let's see, 2.966 *6.6667 \u2248 19.773, so 19.773e8 m/s.\n\nThen multiply by tau: 19.773e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s \u2248 19.773e8 * 2.056e-24 m.\n\nCompute 19.773 * 2.056 \u2248 let's see, 20 * 2 = 40, but more precisely:\n\n19.773 * 2.056: 20 *2 is 40, but 19.773 is 0.227 less than 20. So 2.056 * 0.227 \u2248 0.467. So 40 - 0.467 = 39.533.\n\nWait, no, wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, 19.773 * 2.056.\n\nLet me compute 20 * 2.056 = 41.12.\n\nBut since it's 19.773, which is 20 - 0.227.\n\nSo 19.773 * 2.056 = (20 - 0.227) * 2.056 = 20 * 2.056 - 0.227 * 2.056.\n\n20 * 2.056 = 41.12.\n\n0.227 * 2.056 \u2248 0.227 * 2 = 0.454, and 0.227 * 0.056 \u2248 0.01265. So total \u2248 0.46665.\n\nSo 41.12 - 0.46665 \u2248 40.65335.\n\nSo 40.65335e8 * 1e-24 = 40.65335e-16 m.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because 19.773e8 is 1.9773e9 m/s, and multiplied by 2.056e-24 s gives (1.9773e9 m/s) * (2.056e-24 s) = (1.9773 *2.056) * 1e-15 m.\n\nWait, 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.\n\nSo 1.9773 * 2.056 = let's compute that.\n\n1.9773 * 2 = 3.9546, 1.9773 * 0.056 \u2248 0.1107. So total \u2248 4.0653.\n\nSo 4.0653e-15 meters.\n\nWait, so that's approximately 4.0653e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Option D is 4.0655e-16 m. So the calculation seems to match option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps for any possible mistake.\n\nFirst, the calculation of \u0393 in J:\n\n\u0393_X = 320 MeV = 320e6 eV. Each eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 = 320e6 is 3.2e8. 3.2e8 *1.60218e-19 = (3.2 *1.60218) * 1e-11.\n\n3.2 *1.60218 = 5.126976. So yes, 5.126976e-11 J.\n\nThen \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.126976e-11 J) = 2.056e-24 s.\n\nGamma from energy: E =8 GeV, m_X =1.2 GeV. So gamma =8 /1.2 =6.666666...\n\nThen, beta calculation: gamma =1/sqrt(1-beta^2). So beta^2 =1 - (1/gamma^2) =1 - (1/(44.4444)) = 1-0.0225=0.9775. So beta =sqrt(0.9775)=approx 0.9887.\n\nSo v =0.9887c. c=3e8 m/s, so v\u22482.966e8 m/s.\n\nThen, L = v * gamma * tau.\n\nv=2.966e8 m/s, gamma=6.6667, tau=2.056e-24 s.\n\nv * gamma =2.966e8 *6.6667 \u224819.773e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by tau: 19.773e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = (19.773 *2.056) *1e-16 m.\n\n19.773 *2.056 =40.65335. So 40.65335e-16 m=4.065335e-15 m.\n\nSo the calculation leads to approximately 4.065e-15 m. Which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are A) 5.0223e-16, B)4.0655e-15, C)5.0223e-15, D)4.0655e-16.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when calculating the decay length, sometimes people use the mean lifetime multiplied by the velocity. But in this case, we have to consider that the lifetime is dilated due to gamma. So yes, the lab frame lifetime is gamma times the proper time, so the distance is v multiplied by gamma tau.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The mean path length L is c * tau * gamma * beta.\n\nWait, because L = v * tau_lab = beta c * (gamma tau) = beta gamma c tau.\n\nWhich is the same as c * gamma beta tau.\n\nSo perhaps I can compute it that way.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\ngamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.9887.\n\nSo gamma * beta =6.6667 * 0.9887\u22486.6667*(approx 0.9887)= let's compute.\n\n6.6667 * 0.9887: 6 *0.9887=5.9322, 0.6667 *0.9887\u22480.6583. Total \u22486.5905.\n\nSo gamma * beta \u22486.5905.\n\nThen, L = c * gamma beta tau =3e8 m/s * 6.5905 * 2.056e-24 s.\n\nCompute 3e8 *6.5905=1.97715e9.\n\nMultiply by 2.056e-24: 1.97715e9 *2.056e-24 = (1.97715 *2.056) * 1e-15.\n\n1.97715 *2.056 \u22484.065.\n\nSo again, 4.065e-15 m.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.\n\nThe question gives me some values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width \u0393_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (\u03c4), but then again, particles moving relativistically might have a longer distance because of their velocity.\n\nSo, first, I think I need to find the lifetime \u03c4 of the meson. I remember the uncertainty principle relating the width \u0393 to the lifetime. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. So, \u0393 is the uncertainty in energy, and \u03c4 is the mean lifetime. So \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393.\n\nWait, but I should check the exact relation. The width \u0393 is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the mean lifetime. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, sometimes it's written as \u0393 \u2248 \u0127 / \u03c4, so \u03c4 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo let's compute \u03c4. But wait, the units. Let me make sure I convert everything properly. \u0393 is given in MeV, so I need to convert that to Joules. Because \u0127 is in J\u00b7s.\n\nWait, let me recall the constants. Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s. So \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nBut \u0393 is 320 MeV. Oh, I need to convert MeV to Joules. 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. So 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J. Let me calculate that.\n\n320e6 = 3.2e8. So 3.2e8 * 1.60218e-19 = 5.126976e-11 J.\n\nSo \u0393 = 5.126976e-11 J.\n\nNow, \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. So \u03c4 = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.126976e-11 J) \u2248 2.057e-24 seconds. Wait, let me compute that.\n\n1.05457e-34 / 5.126976e-11 \u2248 let's see, 1e-34 / 5e-11 is about 2e-24. But let me be precise.\n\nDivide 1.0545718 by 5.126976. Let's approximate. 5.126976 is approximately 5.127. 1.05457 / 5.127 \u2248 0.2056. So 0.2056e-23 = 2.056e-24 seconds. So \u03c4 \u2248 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nBut wait, particles moving at relativistic speeds would have a longer lifetime in their rest frame? Or is the lifetime \u03c4 already the proper time (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame)?\n\nAh, right, the lifetime \u03c4 is the proper time, the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. So to find the distance it travels before decaying, I need to multiply \u03c4 by the velocity of the particle times the speed of light.\n\nWait, the velocity v can be found from the energy and mass. The total energy E is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass energy is m_X c\u00b2, which is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is E - m_X c\u00b2 = 8 - 1.2 = 6.8 GeV.\n\nWait, but to find the velocity, perhaps I should use the relativistic energy formula. The total energy E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) = (8 GeV)/(1.2 GeV) = 8/1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nSo \u03b3 is about 6.6667. Then \u03b2 = v/c can be found from \u03b3. The relation is \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2\u00b2). So let's solve for \u03b2.\n\nLet me compute \u03b2. So, \u03b3 = 6.6667. Then,\n\n\u03b3\u00b2 = (1)/(1 - \u03b2\u00b2) \u2192 1 - \u03b2\u00b2 = 1/\u03b3\u00b2 \u2192 \u03b2\u00b2 = 1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2.\n\nSo compute 1/\u03b3\u00b2: (1/6.6667)^2 \u2248 (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So \u03b2\u00b2 = 0.9775 \u2192 \u03b2 \u2248 sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. So v \u2248 0.9887c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let's compute 1/(6.6667)^2.\n\n6.6667 is 20/3. So (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u2248 44.4444. So 1/(44.4444) \u2248 0.0225. So yes, same as before.\n\nSo \u03b2 \u2248 sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo v \u2248 0.9887c. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo the velocity is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance L is v * \u03c4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, \u03c4 is the proper time, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. But the particle is moving at a high speed, so from our lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma. So the mean lifetime observed in the lab is \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nSo L = v * (\u03b3 \u03c4) = v \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nWait, but wait, another approach: the mean path length is L = (v * \u03c4) * gamma? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nProper time is \u03c4. The lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4. So the distance is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime: L = v * \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nSo L = v \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nAlternatively, since \u03c4 is the proper time, the lab frame observes the lifetime as longer, so \u03c4_lab = \u03b3 \u03c4. So L = v * \u03c4_lab = v \u03b3 \u03c4.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo let me compute each part.\n\nWe have:\n\nv \u2248 0.9887c \u2248 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.966e8 m/s.\n\n\u03b3 = 6.6667.\n\n\u03c4 \u2248 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L = v * gamma * tau.\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nv * gamma = (2.966e8 m/s) * 6.6667 \u2248 2.966e8 * 6.6667 \u2248 let's see, 2.966 *6.6667 \u2248 19.773, so 19.773e8 m/s.\n\nThen multiply by tau: 19.773e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s \u2248 19.773e8 * 2.056e-24 m.\n\nCompute 19.773 * 2.056 \u2248 let's see, 20 * 2 = 40, but more precisely:\n\n19.773 * 2.056: 20 *2 is 40, but 19.773 is 0.227 less than 20. So 2.056 * 0.227 \u2248 0.467. So 40 - 0.467 = 39.533.\n\nWait, no, wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, 19.773 * 2.056.\n\nLet me compute 20 * 2.056 = 41.12.\n\nBut since it's 19.773, which is 20 - 0.227.\n\nSo 19.773 * 2.056 = (20 - 0.227) * 2.056 = 20 * 2.056 - 0.227 * 2.056.\n\n20 * 2.056 = 41.12.\n\n0.227 * 2.056 \u2248 0.227 * 2 = 0.454, and 0.227 * 0.056 \u2248 0.01265. So total \u2248 0.46665.\n\nSo 41.12 - 0.46665 \u2248 40.65335.\n\nSo 40.65335e8 * 1e-24 = 40.65335e-16 m.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because 19.773e8 is 1.9773e9 m/s, and multiplied by 2.056e-24 s gives (1.9773e9 m/s) * (2.056e-24 s) = (1.9773 *2.056) * 1e-15 m.\n\nWait, 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.\n\nSo 1.9773 * 2.056 = let's compute that.\n\n1.9773 * 2 = 3.9546, 1.9773 * 0.056 \u2248 0.1107. So total \u2248 4.0653.\n\nSo 4.0653e-15 meters.\n\nWait, so that's approximately 4.0653e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Option D is 4.0655e-16 m. So the calculation seems to match option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps for any possible mistake.\n\nFirst, the calculation of \u0393 in J:\n\n\u0393_X = 320 MeV = 320e6 eV. Each eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 = 320e6 is 3.2e8. 3.2e8 *1.60218e-19 = (3.2 *1.60218) * 1e-11.\n\n3.2 *1.60218 = 5.126976. So yes, 5.126976e-11 J.\n\nThen \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (1.05457e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.126976e-11 J) = 2.056e-24 s.\n\nGamma from energy: E =8 GeV, m_X =1.2 GeV. So gamma =8 /1.2 =6.666666...\n\nThen, beta calculation: gamma =1/sqrt(1-beta^2). So beta^2 =1 - (1/gamma^2) =1 - (1/(44.4444)) = 1-0.0225=0.9775. So beta =sqrt(0.9775)=approx 0.9887.\n\nSo v =0.9887c. c=3e8 m/s, so v\u22482.966e8 m/s.\n\nThen, L = v * gamma * tau.\n\nv=2.966e8 m/s, gamma=6.6667, tau=2.056e-24 s.\n\nv * gamma =2.966e8 *6.6667 \u224819.773e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by tau: 19.773e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = (19.773 *2.056) *1e-16 m.\n\n19.773 *2.056 =40.65335. So 40.65335e-16 m=4.065335e-15 m.\n\nSo the calculation leads to approximately 4.065e-15 m. Which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are A) 5.0223e-16, B)4.0655e-15, C)5.0223e-15, D)4.0655e-16.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when calculating the decay length, sometimes people use the mean lifetime multiplied by the velocity. But in this case, we have to consider that the lifetime is dilated due to gamma. So yes, the lab frame lifetime is gamma times the proper time, so the distance is v multiplied by gamma tau.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The mean path length L is c * tau * gamma * beta.\n\nWait, because L = v * tau_lab = beta c * (gamma tau) = beta gamma c tau.\n\nWhich is the same as c * gamma beta tau.\n\nSo perhaps I can compute it that way.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\ngamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.9887.\n\nSo gamma * beta =6.6667 * 0.9887\u22486.6667*(approx 0.9887)= let's compute.\n\n6.6667 * 0.9887: 6 *0.9887=5.9322, 0.6667 *0.9887\u22480.6583. Total \u22486.5905.\n\nSo gamma * beta \u22486.5905.\n\nThen, L = c * gamma beta tau =3e8 m/s * 6.5905 * 2.056e-24 s.\n\nCompute 3e8 *6.5905=1.97715e9.\n\nMultiply by 2.056e-24: 1.97715e9 *2.056e-24 = (1.97715 *2.056) * 1e-15.\n\n1.97715 *2.056 \u22484.065.\n\nSo again, 4.065e-15 m. So same result.\n\nSo the answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nL = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(v\\) is the particle's velocity,\n- \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor,\n- \\(\\tau\\) is the proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n### Step 1: Compute the proper lifetime (\\(\\tau\\))\nThe width \\(\\Gamma\\) is related to the proper lifetime by the uncertainty principle:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(\\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 5.126976 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{J}\\), and \\(\\hbar = 1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s}\\), we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34}}{5.126976 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 2.056 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Lorentz factor (\\(\\gamma\\))\nThe Lorentz factor is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m c^2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(E = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}\\) and \\(m = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of the meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula should be something like decay length L = \u03b3 * \u03b2 * c * \u03c4, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, \u03b2 is the velocity over the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and \u03c4 is the proper lifetime.\n\nBut wait, how do I find \u03c4? Oh right, the proper lifetime \u03c4 is related to the width \u0393 by the uncertainty principle. The width \u0393 is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, I think the relation is \u03c4 = \u0127 / (\u0393), but I need to make sure about the units.\n\nWait, no, the width \u0393 is the total decay rate. The lifetime \u03c4 is the mean lifetime, so they are inversely related. \u0393 is the energy width, and \u03c4 is the time it takes on average for the particle to decay. The relation is \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4, so \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, I think I should double-check that. Oh wait, no, actually, the correct relation is \u0393 = \u0127 * (1/\u03c4), so \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. That makes sense because the uncertainty principle says \u0394E \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. So if \u0393 is the energy uncertainty, the time uncertainty is roughly \u0127/(\u0393). So \u03c4 is approximately \u0127/(\u0393). But wait, units are important here. Because \u0393 is in MeV, and \u0127 is in units of GeV\u00b7s or something.\n\nWait, let me get the units straight. \u0127 (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So if \u0393 is in GeV, then \u03c4 would be in seconds. But here, \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, no, wait. \u0393 is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So yes, that calculation holds.\n\nNow, I need to find the velocity \u03b2 of the meson. To find \u03b2, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV. The mass of the meson is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2. But since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c\u00b2, perhaps it's easier to work in natural units where c=1.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of units. Let me write E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 c^4 + m\u00b2 c^4. So, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. Then, p\u00b2 c^4 = E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4. So p = sqrt( (E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4) ) / c\u00b2. Wait, maybe I should compute this in terms of beta and gamma.\n\nAlternatively, beta is v/c, and gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). Because E = gamma m c\u00b2. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). Wait, since E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c\u00b2. So the units for gamma would be (GeV) / ( GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2 ) ) \u2192 GeV/(GeV) ) \u2192 unitless. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). Since c=1 in these units, gamma is just E/m.\n\nSo gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.\n\nThen, gamma is 6.6667, so beta can be found from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So 1 - beta\u00b2 = 1/gamma\u00b2 \u2192 beta\u00b2 = 1 - (1/gamma\u00b2). Gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400/9) \u2248 44.4444. So 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 \u2248 0.0225. So 1 - beta^2 = 0.0225 \u2192 beta^2 = 0.9775 \u2192 beta \u2248 sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887. Let me calculate that more accurately. sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887, yeah.\n\nSo beta is approximately 0.9887, and gamma is about 6.6667.\n\nNow, the lifetime \u03c4 is 2.056875e-24 seconds, as calculated earlier. Then, the mean decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nWait, let me compute each part. Gamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.9887. So gamma * beta \u2248 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.591. Then multiply by c (speed of light) and tau.\n\nc is approximately 3e8 meters per second. tau is 2.056875e-24 s. So putting it all together:\n\nL = 6.591 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 6.591 * 3e8 = 6.591 * 3e8 = 1.9773e9.\n\nThen multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.9773e9 * 2.056875e-24.\n\nLet me compute 1.9773 * 2.056875 \u2248 4.065. Then, exponents: 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15. So L \u2248 4.065e-15 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, and option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that would be option B, but wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.\n\nLet me recompute the steps.\n\nGamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666667.\n\nGamma squared is (6.666666667)^2 = 44.44444444.\n\nSo 1/gamma squared is 1/44.44444444 = 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - beta^2 = 0.0225 \u2192 beta^2 = 0.9775 \u2192 beta = sqrt(0.9775).\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.9775): Let's compute it accurately. 0.9775 is between 0.98^2=0.9604 and 0.99^2=0.9801. Wait, 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.9775.\n\nWait, 0.9887 * 0.9887: 0.9887^2 = (approx) (0.98)^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + (0.0087)^2 = 0.9604 + 0.0168 (approx) + 0.000075 \u2192 ~0.977275. Close enough. So beta \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo gamma * beta = 6.666666667 * 0.9887 \u2248 let's compute that more accurately.\n\n6.666666667 * 0.9887 = ?\n\n6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.\n\n0.666666667 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.66 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.6525 (approx), so total is about 5.9322 + 0.6525 = 6.5847.\n\nSo gamma*beta \u2248 6.5847.\n\nNow, compute L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\ntau is (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo L = 6.5847 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nCompute 6.5847 * 3e8 = 1.9754e9.\n\nThen, 1.9754e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9754 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.\n\n1.9754 * 2.056875 \u2248 Let's compute 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375, but since it's 1.9754, which is about 0.0246 less than 2. So 4.11375 - (0.0246 * 2.056875) \u2192 4.11375 - 0.0506 \u2248 4.06315.\n\nSo approximately 4.06315e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. Option D is 4.0655e-16, which is ten times smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake with the calculation of tau. Let me double-check that.\n\nTau is \u0127 / \u0393. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV (since 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV). So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875 \u2192 so 20.56875e-25 s \u2192 which is 2.056875e-24 s. So that's correct.\n\nAnother point: I used E in GeV and m in GeV/c\u00b2, so when I computed gamma as E/m, that's correct.\n\nWait, another thing: in the decay length formula, L = gamma * beta * c * tau. But tau is the proper lifetime. So the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma*beta*c*tau.\n\nLet me recompute the numbers with more precise values.\n\nGamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666666666667.\n\nBeta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.44444444))) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.988683.\n\nSo gamma*beta = 6.666666666666667 * 0.988683 \u2248 6.666666666666667 * 0.988683.\n\nLet me compute 6.666666666666667 * 0.988683.\n\n6.666666666666667 * 0.988683 = 6.666666666666667 * (0.9 + 0.08 + 0.008 + 0.000683) \u2192 Hmm, perhaps it's easier to just multiply.\n\nAlternatively, 6.666666666666667 * 0.988683.\n\nWell, 6 * 0.988683 = 5.932098.\n\n0.666666666666667 * 0.988683 \u2248 0.66 * 0.988683 = approx 0.652387, but let's compute it accurately.\n\n0.666666666666667 * 0.988683 = 0.666666666666667 * 0.988683.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n0.6 * 0.988683 = 0.5932098.\n\n0.06 * 0.988683 = 0.05932098.\n\n0.006666666666667 * 0.988683 \u2248 0.00659122.\n\nAdding them: 0.5932098 + 0.05932098 = 0.65253078 + 0.00659122 \u2248 0.659122.\n\nSo total gamma*beta is 5.932098 + 0.659122 \u2248 6.59122.\n\nNow, multiply by c=3e8 m/s and tau=2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo 6.59122 * 3e8 = 1.977366e9.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.977366e9 * 2.056875e-24.\n\n1.977366 * 2.056875 \u2248 Let's compute that.\n\n1.977366 * 2 = 3.954732.\n\n1.977366 * 0.056875 \u2248 let's compute 1.977366 * 0.05 = 0.0988683, and 1.977366 * 0.006875 \u2248 0.013549.\n\nAdding those: 0.0988683 + 0.013549 \u2248 0.1124173.\n\nSo total 3.954732 + 0.1124173 \u2248 4.06715.\n\nSo 4.06715e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of the meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV.\n\nWait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula should be something like decay length L = \u03b3 * \u03b2 * c * \u03c4, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, \u03b2 is the velocity over the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and \u03c4 is the proper lifetime.\n\nBut wait, how do I find \u03c4? Oh right, the proper lifetime \u03c4 is related to the width \u0393 by the uncertainty principle. The width \u0393 is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, I think the relation is \u03c4 = \u0127 / (\u0393), but I need to make sure about the units.\n\nWait, no, the width \u0393 is the total decay rate. The lifetime \u03c4 is the mean lifetime, so they are inversely related. \u0393 is the energy width, and \u03c4 is the time it takes on average for the particle to decay. The relation is \u0393 = \u0127 / \u03c4, so \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, I think I should double-check that. Oh wait, no, actually, the correct relation is \u0393 = \u0127 * (1/\u03c4), so \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393. That makes sense because the uncertainty principle says \u0394E \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2. So if \u0393 is the energy uncertainty, the time uncertainty is roughly \u0127/(\u0393). So \u03c4 is approximately \u0127/(\u0393). But wait, units are important here. Because \u0393 is in MeV, and \u0127 is in units of GeV\u00b7s or something.\n\nWait, let me get the units straight. \u0127 (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. So if \u0393 is in GeV, then \u03c4 would be in seconds. But here, \u0393 is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So \u03c4 = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 \u2248 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, no, wait. \u0393 is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So yes, that calculation holds.\n\nNow, I need to find the velocity \u03b2 of the meson. To find \u03b2, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV. The mass of the meson is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2. But since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c\u00b2, perhaps it's easier to work in natural units where c=1.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of units. Let me write E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 c^4 + m\u00b2 c^4. So, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c\u00b2. Then, p\u00b2 c^4 = E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4. So p = sqrt( (E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c^4) ) / c\u00b2. Wait, maybe I should compute this in terms of beta and gamma.\n\nAlternatively, beta is v/c, and gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). Because E = gamma m c\u00b2. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). Wait, since E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c\u00b2. So the units for gamma would be (GeV) / ( GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2 ) ) \u2192 GeV/(GeV) ) \u2192 unitless. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). Since c=1 in these units, gamma is just E/m.\n\nSo gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.\n\nThen, gamma is 6.6667, so beta can be found from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So 1 - beta\u00b2 = 1/gamma\u00b2 \u2192 beta\u00b2 = 1 - (1/gamma\u00b2). Gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400/9) \u2248 44.4444. So 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 \u2248 0.0225. So 1 - beta^2 = 0.0225 \u2192 beta^2 = 0.9775 \u2192 beta \u2248 sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.

Option D is 4.0655e-16, which is ten times smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake with the calculation of tau. Let me double-check that.\n\nTau is \u0127 / \u0393. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. \u0393 is 0.32 GeV (since 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV). So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that.\n\n6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875 \u2192 so 20.56875e-25 s \u2192 which is 2.056875e-24 s. So that's correct.\n\nAnother point: I used E in GeV and m in GeV/c\u00b2, so when I computed gamma as E/m, that's correct.\n\nWait, another thing: in the decay length formula, L = gamma * beta * c * tau. But tau is the proper lifetime. So the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma*beta*c*tau.\n\nLet me recompute the numbers with more precise values.\n\nGamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666666666667.\n\nBeta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.44444444))) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.988683.\n\nSo gamma*beta = 6.666666666666667 * 0.988683 \u2248 6.666666666666667 * 0.988683.\n\nLet me compute 6.666666666666667 * 0.988683.\n\n6.666666666666667 * 0.988683 = 6.666666666666667 * (0.9 + 0.08 + 0.008 + 0.000683) \u2192 Hmm, perhaps it's easier to just multiply.\n\nAlternatively, 6.666666666666667 * 0.988683.\n\nWell, 6 * 0.988683 = 5.932098.\n\n0.666666666666667 * 0.988683 \u2248 0.66 * 0.988683 = approx 0.652387, but let's compute it accurately.\n\n0.666666666666667 * 0.988683 = 0.666666666666667 * 0.988683.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n0.6 * 0.988683 = 0.5932098.\n\n0.06 * 0.988683 = 0.05932098.\n\n0.006666666666667 * 0.988683 \u2248 0.00659122.\n\nAdding them: 0.5932098 + 0.05932098 = 0.65253078 + 0.00659122 \u2248 0.659122.\n\nSo total gamma*beta is 5.932098 + 0.659122 \u2248 6.59122.\n\nNow, multiply by c=3e8 m/s and tau=2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo 6.59122 * 3e8 = 1.977366e9.\n\nMultiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.977366e9 * 2.056875e-24.\n\n1.977366 * 2.056875 \u2248 Let's compute that.\n\n1.977366 * 2 = 3.954732.\n\n1.977366 * 0.056875 \u2248 let's compute 1.977366 * 0.05 = 0.0988683, and 1.977366 * 0.006875 \u2248 0.013549.\n\nAdding those: 0.0988683 + 0.013549 \u2248 0.1124173.\n\nSo total 3.954732 + 0.1124173 \u2248 4.06715.\n\nSo 4.06715e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.\n\nThe question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. \n\nWait, so I remember that the decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where tau is the mean lifetime. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c.\n\nBut wait, how do I get tau from the given parameters? Oh, right, the mean lifetime tau is related to the decay width \u0393. The uncertainty principle tells us that the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. Specifically, tau \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393, but I need to get the units right.\n\nLet me jot down the formula: tau = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, the units for \u0393 are in MeV. I'll need to convert everything into consistent units. Maybe I should convert everything to GeV to make it easier.\n\nWait, 1 GeV is 10^3 MeV. So \u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. I remember that \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Let me make sure: yes, because Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, and \u0127 = h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. But when we express it in GeV\u00b7s, since 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J, so \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. That makes sense.\n\nSo, tau = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So tau \u2248 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, no, wait. Because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.568e-25 s? Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me do the division correctly. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 divided by 0.32: 0.32 * 20 is 6.4, so 20.568. So yes, 20.568e-25 s. So tau \u2248 2.0568e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 \u00d7 20 = 6.4. So 6.582 -6.4=0.182. 0.182 /0.32 is about 0.56875. So 20.56875. So yeah, 6.582e-25 /0.32 GeV is 20.56875e-25 s. So tau is approximately 2.0568e-24 seconds. Wait, 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s, correct.\n\nNext, I need to find the velocity of the meson. To find beta and gamma, I'll need the velocity. But how?\n\nWell, the meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, and its mass is m_X =1.2 GeV. So, the energy is much higher than the rest mass. So, the Lorentz factor gamma would be E/(m c^2), but since E is given in GeV and m in GeV/c\u00b2, the units should work out if I use E = gamma m c\u00b2.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of natural units where c=1. So, E = gamma * m. So gamma = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So gamma is 6.666..., which is 20/3 or approximately 6.6667.\n\nThen, beta is v/c. To find beta, we can use the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So solving for beta:\n\ngamma^2 = 1 / (1 - beta^2)\n1 - beta^2 = 1 / gamma^2\nbeta^2 = 1 - (1 / gamma^2)\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nLet me compute that. Gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400/9) \u2248 44.4444. 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887. So v is about 0.9887c.\n\nWait, let me compute it more precisely. Let's compute 1/gamma^2:\n\ngamma = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 = 6.6666667. So gamma^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u224844.444444.\n\nSo 1/gamma^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.\n\nTaking the square root: sqrt(0.9775). Hmm, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. Let me check with a calculator approximation.\n\nAlternatively, using the Taylor expansion for sqrt(1 - x) when x is small. x=0.0225. So sqrt(1-x) \u2248 1 - x/2 - x^2/8.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.0225/2 = 1 - 0.01125 = 0.98875. Hmm, that's about 0.98875. So beta is approximately 0.98875. So that's about 0.9888.\n\nSo beta is roughly 0.9888, and gamma is 20/3 \u22486.6667.\n\nNow, the mean decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nWait, let me make sure the formula is correct. The lifetime tau is the proper time, the lifetime in the rest frame. The moving frame (lab frame) sees a longer lifetime: tau' = gamma tau.\n\nThe decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying, so L = v * tau', which is beta c * gamma tau. Because v = beta c, and tau' is gamma tau. So yes, L= beta gamma c tau.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nL = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nWe have beta \u2248 0.9888, gamma \u22486.6667, c is speed of light, and tau we calculated earlier as approximately 2.0568e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute tau again. So tau = \u0127 / \u0393. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, and \u0393 is 0.32 GeV. So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute that.\n\n6.582 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Right.\n\nSo now, putting it all together.\n\nL = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, beta * gamma: 0.9888 * 6.6667 \u2248 ?\n\n0.9888 * 6.6667 is roughly 6.6 (since 0.9888 is close to 1, so 6.6667 * 0.9888 \u2248 6.6).\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately:\n\n6.6667 * 0.9888:\n\nCompute 6 * 0.9888 = 5.9328\n\n0.6667 * 0.9888 \u2248 0.6667 * 1 is 0.6667, but subtract 0.6667 * 0.0112 = approx 0.0075. So 0.6667 - 0.0075 \u2248 0.6592.\n\nSo total is 5.9328 + 0.6592 \u2248 6.592.\n\nSo beta * gamma \u2248 6.592.\n\nNow, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nSo, L = 6.592 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, multiply 6.592 *3e8 = 6.592 * 3 * 1e8 = 19.776e8 = 1.9776e9 m/s.\n\nWait, no, wait. No, 6.592 *3e8 m/s is 6.592 * 3e8 = (6.592 *3) * 1e8 = 19.776 * 1e8 m/s \u2192 1.9776e9 m/s.\n\nWait no, wait, actually, no. Because 3e8 is 3 times 1e8, so 6.592 *3e8 is 19.776e8, which is 1.9776e9 m/s. So L is (1.9776e9 m/s) multiplied by tau, which is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo, 1.9776e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?\n\nLet me compute 1.9776e9 * 2.056875e-24.\n\nMultiply the coefficients: 1.9776 *2.056875 \u2248 let me calculate that.\n\n1.9776 * 2 = 3.9552\n\n1.9776 * 0.056875 = let me compute 0.056875 * 2000 = 113.75, but wait, 1.9776 *0.05 =0.09888; 1.9776*0.006875= approx 0.01356. So total is 0.09888 +0.01356= 0.11244.\n\nSo total is approximately 3.9552 + 0.11244 = 4.06764.\n\nSo 4.06764 multiplied by 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.\n\nSo L \u22484.06764e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, option B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nHmm, our calculation is about 4.067e-15 m. So that's very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nWait, perhaps I made some approximations that caused the slight discrepancy. Let me check the precise calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be more precise with the beta and gamma.\n\nWait, let me recalculate beta more accurately.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.\n\nThe question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width \u0393_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. \n\nWait, so I remember that the decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where tau is the mean lifetime. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c.\n\nBut wait, how do I get tau from the given parameters? Oh, right, the mean lifetime tau is related to the decay width \u0393. The uncertainty principle tells us that the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. Specifically, tau \u2248 \u0127 / \u0393, but I need to get the units right.\n\nLet me jot down the formula: tau = \u0127 / \u0393. But wait, the units for \u0393 are in MeV. I'll need to convert everything into consistent units. Maybe I should convert everything to GeV to make it easier.\n\nWait, 1 GeV is 10^3 MeV. So \u0393 is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. I remember that \u0127 is approximately 6.582 \u00d7 10^-25 GeV\u00b7s. Let me make sure: yes, because Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, and \u0127 = h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. But when we express it in GeV\u00b7s, since 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J, so \u0127 \u2248 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s. That makes sense.\n\nSo, tau = \u0127 / \u0393 = (6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So tau \u2248 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, no, wait. Because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.568e-25 s? Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me do the division correctly. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 divided by 0.32: 0.32 * 20 is 6.4, so 20.568. So yes, 20.568e-25 s. So tau \u2248 2.0568e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 \u00d7 20 = 6.4. So 6.582 -6.4=0.182. 0.182 /0.32 is about 0.56875. So 20.56875. So yeah, 6.582e-25 /0.32 GeV is 20.56875e-25 s. So tau is approximately 2.0568e-24 seconds. Wait, 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s, correct.\n\nNext, I need to find the velocity of the meson. To find beta and gamma, I'll need the velocity. But how?\n\nWell, the meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, and its mass is m_X =1.2 GeV. So, the energy is much higher than the rest mass. So, the Lorentz factor gamma would be E/(m c^2), but since E is given in GeV and m in GeV/c\u00b2, the units should work out if I use E = gamma m c\u00b2.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of natural units where c=1. So, E = gamma * m. So gamma = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So gamma is 6.666..., which is 20/3 or approximately 6.6667.\n\nThen, beta is v/c. To find beta, we can use the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So solving for beta:\n\ngamma^2 = 1 / (1 - beta^2)\n1 - beta^2 = 1 / gamma^2\nbeta^2 = 1 - (1 / gamma^2)\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nLet me compute that. Gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400/9) \u2248 44.4444. 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887. So v is about 0.9887c.\n\nWait, let me compute it more precisely. Let's compute 1/gamma^2:\n\ngamma = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 = 6.6666667. So gamma^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u224844.444444.\n\nSo 1/gamma^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.\n\nSo 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.\n\nTaking the square root: sqrt(0.9775). Hmm, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. Let me check with a calculator approximation.\n\nAlternatively, using the Taylor expansion for sqrt(1 - x) when x is small. x=0.0225. So sqrt(1-x) \u2248 1 - x/2 - x^2/8.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.0225/2 = 1 - 0.01125 = 0.98875. Hmm, that's about 0.98875. So beta is approximately 0.98875. So that's about 0.9888.\n\nSo beta is roughly 0.9888, and gamma is 20/3 \u22486.6667.\n\nNow, the mean decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nWait, let me make sure the formula is correct. The lifetime tau is the proper time, the lifetime in the rest frame. The moving frame (lab frame) sees a longer lifetime: tau' = gamma tau.\n\nThe decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying, so L = v * tau', which is beta c * gamma tau. Because v = beta c, and tau' is gamma tau. So yes, L= beta gamma c tau.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nL = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nWe have beta \u2248 0.9888, gamma \u22486.6667, c is speed of light, and tau we calculated earlier as approximately 2.0568e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute tau again. So tau = \u0127 / \u0393. \u0127 is 6.582e-25 GeV\u00b7s, and \u0393 is 0.32 GeV. So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute that.\n\n6.582 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Right.\n\nSo now, putting it all together.\n\nL = beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, beta * gamma: 0.9888 * 6.6667 \u2248 ?\n\n0.9888 * 6.6667 is roughly 6.6 (since 0.9888 is close to 1, so 6.6667 * 0.9888 \u2248 6.6).\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately:\n\n6.6667 * 0.9888:\n\nCompute 6 * 0.9888 = 5.9328\n\n0.6667 * 0.9888 \u2248 0.6667 * 1 is 0.6667, but subtract 0.6667 * 0.0112 = approx 0.0075. So 0.6667 - 0.0075 \u2248 0.6592.\n\nSo total is 5.9328 + 0.6592 \u2248 6.592.\n\nSo beta * gamma \u2248 6.592.\n\nNow, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.\n\nTau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.\n\nSo, L = 6.592 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, multiply 6.592 *3e8 = 6.592 * 3 * 1e8 = 19.776e8 = 1.9776e9 m/s.\n\nWait, no, wait. No, 6.592 *3e8 m/s is 6.592 * 3e8 = (6.592 *3) * 1e8 = 19.776 * 1e8 m/s \u2192 1.9776e9 m/s.\n\nWait no, wait, actually, no. Because 3e8 is 3 times 1e8, so 6.592 *3e8 is 19.776e8, which is 1.9776e9 m/s. So L is (1.9776e9 m/s) multiplied by tau, which is 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nSo, 1.9776e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?\n\nLet me compute 1.9776e9 * 2.056875e-24.\n\nMultiply the coefficients: 1.9776 *2.056875 \u2248 let me calculate that.\n\n1.9776 * 2 = 3.9552\n\n1.9776 * 0.056875 = let me compute 0.056875 * 2000 = 113.75, but wait, 1.9776 *0.05 =0.09888; 1.9776*0.006875= approx 0.01356. So total is 0.09888 +0.01356= 0.11244.\n\nSo total is approximately 3.9552 + 0.11244 = 4.06764.\n\nSo 4.06764 multiplied by 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.\n\nSo L \u22484.06764e-15 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 m, option B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nHmm, our calculation is about 4.067e-15 m. So that's very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nWait, perhaps I made some approximations that caused the slight discrepancy.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think through it.\n\nThe question is about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance, X. I remember that when particles decay, their mean path length before decaying is related to their lifetime and their velocity. But wait, how exactly does that work?\n\nHmm, I think the mean decay distance (often called the decay length) is given by the formula L = gamma * v * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime of the particle. Or wait, maybe it's just gamma multiplied by the velocity times the lifetime? I'm a bit confused about the exact formula.\n\nWait, let me think. The mean lifetime tau is related to the width Gamma by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy (Gamma) and the uncertainty in time (tau) are inversely related. The formula is tau \u2248 \u0127 / Gamma, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. Oh, right, because Gamma is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the lifetime. So tau = \u0127 / (Gamma * c), wait, no, Gamma has units of energy, so when you take \u0127 (which has units of J\u00b7s) divided by Gamma (GeV), you have to convert units properly.\n\nWait, units are going to be tricky here. Let me jot down what I know:\n\nE_X = 8 GeV (production energy)\nm_X = 1.2 GeV (mass)\nGamma_X = 320 MeV (width)\n\nI need to find the mean decay distance. So first, let's find the lifetime tau of the meson. Tau is approximately equal to hbar / Gamma. But Gamma is given in MeV, and hbar is in J\u00b7s. I'll need to convert units.\n\nWait, the formula for tau is tau = \u0127 / (Gamma * c^2)? No, I think Gamma is the total decay width, which has units of energy. So tau should be hbar divided by Gamma. Because \u0127 has units of J\u00b7s, and Gamma is GeV, so converting GeV to J is necessary.\n\nLet me get the constants straight. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s. So \u0127 is h/(2pi) \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But I think for particle physics, it's often easier to work in natural units where c=1 and \u0127=1, but when converting to meters, I'll have to use the proper units.\n\nWait, but let me think about the formula again. The lifetime tau is given by tau = \u0127 / Gamma. Gamma is in GeV, so I need to convert that to J. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J.\n\nSo Gamma_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Gamma_X = 0.32 GeV = 0.32e9 eV = 0.32e9 * 1.602e-19 J.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nGamma_X = 0.32 GeV = 0.32 * 1.602e-10 J = 5.1264e-11 J.\n\nWait, wait: 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 0.32 GeV is 0.32 * 1e9 eV = 3.2e8 eV. Then 3.2e8 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11 J.\n\nSo Gamma_X is 5.1264e-11 J.\n\nThen, tau = \u0127 / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.1264e-11 J) ) = approximately (1.05457e-34) / (5.1264e-11) seconds.\n\nCalculating that: 1.05457e-34 / 5.1264e-11 \u2248 2.057e-24 seconds. Wait, that seems really short. But mesons are short-lived particles, so maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, is Gamma in the denominator or numerator? Because tau is the lifetime, which is the inverse of the decay rate (Gamma is the decay rate, in units of energy, but I think that Gamma = \u0127 * decay rate. So decay rate \u0393 is Gamma / \u0127. So tau is 1/(Gamma / \u0127) ) => tau = \u0127 / Gamma. So my earlier calculation is correct.\n\nSo tau \u2248 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, I need to find the velocity of the meson X. Because the mean decay distance L is gamma * v * c * tau. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact expression. Let me think again.\n\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula is L = gamma * v * c * tau. Because gamma is the Lorentz factor, which accounts for time dilation. Alternatively, another way to write it is L = gamma * beta * c * tau, since beta is v/c.\n\nSo, first, I need to find gamma and beta. To find gamma, I need the energy E of the meson. The energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV. The rest mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is gamma * m c^2. So gamma = E / (m c^2). But since we're working in natural units where c=1, gamma = E / m.\n\nWait, let's compute gamma. E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nBut wait, that's in units where c=1, but when considering units, since E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, so gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2) ) = 8/1.2 = 6.6667. So yes, gamma is 6.6667.\n\nNext, find beta. Beta is v/c, which can be found from gamma using the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So, solving for beta:\n\ngamma^2 = 1/(1-beta^2) => 1 - beta^2 = 1/gamma^2 => beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2.\n\nGamma is 6.6667, so gamma^2 is (6.6667)^2 = approx 44.444.\n\nSo beta^2 = 1 - 1/44.444 \u2248 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a more precise calculation: 1/gamma\u00b2 = 1/(400/9) )= 9/400=0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9887.\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo now, v = beta c \u2248 0.9887 c.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps using beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nNow, compute L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nWait, but let me check the units again. Tau is in seconds. c is in m/s. So the product c * tau is meters.\n\nSo L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\ngamma = 6.6667\n\nbeta \u2248 0.9887\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\ntau \u2248 2.057e-24 s\n\nSo L = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6667 * 0.9887. Let me compute that:\n\n6 * 0.9887 is about 5.9322, 0.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 approx 0.658. So total \u2248 5.9322 + 0.658 \u2248 6.5902.\n\nSo 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.59.\n\nThen, multiply by 3e8 m/s: 6.59 * 3e8 = 1.977e9 m/s.\n\nWait, no, wait: 6.59 * 3e8 = 1.977e9 m/s.\n\nBut wait, that's multiplied by tau, which is 2.057e-24 s. So L = 1.977e9 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.\n\nSo 1.977e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.977 * 2.057) * 1e-15.\n\nCalculating 1.977 * 2.057: approx 1.977 * 2 is 3.954, and 1.977 * 0.057 \u2248 0.1126. So total is approx 4.0666.\n\nSo 4.0666e-15 meters.\n\nWait, that's 4.0666e-15 m. Looking at the options:\n\nOption B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nOption C is 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nSo this calculation gives around 4.066e-15 m, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15 m).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the exact numbers because I approximated a few steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should do more precise calculations.\n\nLet me recompute gamma and beta precisely.\n\nGamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/(1.2) = 20/3 \u2248 6.6666666667.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nGamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u2248 44.4444444.\n\n1/gamma^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.\n\n1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.\n\nBeta = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 let's compute it accurately.\n\nsqrt(0.9775) = ?\n\nLet me compute it: 0.9887^2 is 0.9775. Wait, let me square 0.9887:\n\n0.9887 * 0.9887.\n\nCompute 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.\n\nThen, 0.9887 is 0.98 + 0.0087.\n\nSo (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\n\na=0.98, b=0.0087.\n\na^2=0.9604.\n\n2ab=2*0.98*0.0087= 2 * 0.008526= 0.017052.\n\nb^2=0.0087^2= ~0.00007569.\n\nAdding them together: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452 + 0.00007569 \u2248 0.97752769.\n\nSo 0.9887^2 \u2248 0.97752769, which is very close to 0.9775. So beta \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo gamma * beta is (20/3) * 0.9887 \u2248 (6.66666667) * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute that accurately:\n\n6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.\n\n0.66666667 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.6591.\n\nAdding: 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.\n\nSo gamma * beta \u2248 6.5913.\n\nNow, c is 3e8 m/s.\n\nTau is 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L = gamma * beta * c * tau = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.\n\nWait, let's compute 6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.97739e9 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.057e-24 s: 1.97739e9 * 2.057e-24 = ?\n\n1.97739e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.057) * 1e-15.\n\nCalculating 1.97739 * 2.057:\n\nLet me compute 2 * 2.057 = 4.114.\n\nSubtract 0.02261 * 2.057:\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: 1.97739 = 2 - 0.02261.\n\nSo (2 - 0.02261) * 2.057 = 2*2.057 - 0.02261 *2.057.\n\n2*2.057=4.114.\n\n0.02261 *2.057: let's compute 0.02 *2.057=0.04114, 0.00261 *2.057\u22480.00537. So total is approximately 0.04651.\n\nSo 4.114 - 0.04651 \u2248 4.0675.\n\nSo 1.97739 * 2.057 \u2248 4.0675.\n\nSo L \u22484.0675e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this value.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but why is my approximate calculation leading to 4.0675e-15, and the option is 4.0655e-15? Maybe because of more precise calculations of beta or other steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Gamma. Let me double-check Gamma.\n\nWait, Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo when I calculated Gamma_X in Joules, I did 0.32 GeV = 0.32 * 1.602e-10 J = 5.1264e-11 J. That's correct.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.1264e-11 J) = 2.057e-24 seconds. Correct.\n\nWait, let me recompute 1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11.\n\n1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = (1.0545718 / 5.1264) ) * 1e-23.\n\n1.0545718 /5.1264 \u2248 0.2057.\n\nSo tau \u2248 0.2057e-23 s = 2.057e-24 s. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation is right.\n\nAnother thing to check: when computing gamma * beta, perhaps I should use more precise values. Let me compute gamma * beta precisely.\n\ngamma is 20/3 \u22486.6666666667.\n\nbeta is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 let's compute it with more precision.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.9775) using a calculator method.\n\nLet me see, 0.9887^2 = 0.97752769, as before.\n\nBut perhaps the actual value is a bit less. Let me compute 0.9886^2.\n\n0.9886 * 0.9886:\n\n= (0.98 + 0.0086)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0086 + 0.0086^2.\n\n= 0.9604 + 0.017168 + 0.00007396.\n\n= 0.9604 + 0.017168 = 0.977568 + 0.00007396 \u2248 0.97764196.\n\nWhich is higher than 0.9775. So perhaps beta is around 0.9886.\n\nWait, let me try 0.9886:\n\n0.9886^2 \u2248 0.97764196.\n\nBut our target is 0.9775, which is a little less. So let's try 0.9885:\n\n0.9885^2 = ?\n\nCompute 0.9885 * 0.9885:\n\n= (0.98 + 0.0085)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0085 + 0.0085^2.\n\n= 0.9604 + 0.01666 + 0.00007225.\n\n= 0.9604 + 0.01666 = 0.97706 + 0.00007225 = 0.97713225.\n\nStill a bit higher than 0.9775? Wait, wait, no. 0.97713225 is less than 0.9775.\n\nWait, our target is 0.9775.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nAt beta = 0.9885, beta^2 is 0.97713225.\n\nAt beta = 0.9886, beta^2 is 0.97764196.\n\nWe want beta^2 = 0.9775.\n\nSo between 0.9885 and 0.9886.\n\nLet me compute the difference:\n\n0.9775 - 0.97713225 = 0.00036775.\n\nBetween 0.9885 and 0.9886, the beta^2 increases by 0.97764196 - 0.97713225 = 0.00050971.\n\nWe need 0.00036775 of that. So the fraction is 0.00036775 / 0.00050971 \u2248 0.722.\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.9885 + 0.722*(0.0001) = 0.9885 + 0.0000722 \u2248 0.9885722.\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.988572.\n\nSo gamma * beta = (20/3) * 0.988572 \u2248 6.6666667 * 0.988572.\n\nLet me compute this more accurately:\n\n6 * 0.988572 = 5.931432.\n\n0.6666667 * 0.988572 \u2248 0.6666667 * 0.988572.\n\nCompute 0.6666667 * 0.988572:\n\n0.6 * 0.988572 = 0.5931432.\n\n0.0666667 * 0.988572 \u2248 0.0659048.\n\nAdding together: 0.5931432 + 0.0659048 = 0.659048.\n\nSo total gamma * beta is 5.931432 + 0.659048 \u2248 6.59048.\n\nNow, L = 6.59048 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.\n\nCompute 6.59048 * 3e8 = 1.977144e9 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.057e-24 s: 1.977144e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.977144 * 2.057) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 1.977144 * 2.057:\n\nLet me compute this accurately:\n\n1.977144 * 2.057.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n= 1.977144 * 2 + 1.977144 * 0.05 + 1.977144 * 0.007.\n\n= 3.954288 + 0.0988572 + 0.013840008.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n3.954288 + 0.0988572 = 4.0531452.\n\n4.0531452 + 0.013840008 = 4.067, approx.\n\nWait, precise calculation:\n\n3.954288\n+ 0.0988572\n= 4.0531452\n\n+ 0.013840008\n= 4.066985208.\n\nSo approximately 4.066985e-15 m.\n\nSo L \u22484.066985e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nHmm, my precise calculation gives about 4.067e-15, but option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. It's possible that the slight difference is due to more precise values of the constants or perhaps a miscalculation in the steps. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the units for Gamma.\n\nWait, another thought: Gamma is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Gamma = \u0127 / tau. So tau = \u0127 / Gamma. But I have to make sure that the units are correctly handled.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So in Joules, it's 0.32 * 1.602e-10 J = 5.1264e-11 J. Correct.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.1264e-11 J) = approximately 2.057e-24 seconds. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the constants.\n\nLet me use the exact value of \u0127: 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nGamma = 0.32 GeV = 0.32 * 1.602176634e-10 J = 0.32 * 1.602176634e-10 = let me compute this:\n\n0.32 * 1.602176634e-10 = 5.1269652288e-11 J.\n\nTau = (1.0545718e-34) / (5.1269652288e-11) = approx 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nSo, 1.0545718e-34 /5.1269652288e-11 = let me compute this division more accurately.\n\nCompute 1.0545718e-34 /5.1269652288e-11 = (1.0545718 /5.1269652288 ) * 1e-23.\n\n1.0545718 /5.1269652288 \u2248 0.2057.\n\nSo tau \u2248 0.2057e-23 s = 2.057e-24 s. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps seem correct.\n\nSo the final L is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15 m).\n\nWait, but why is there a slight discrepancy? Let me check the calculation of gamma * beta again. Because in the earlier step, I got gamma * beta = 6.59048, leading to 6.59048 * 3e8 * 2.057e-24 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it as:\n\ngamma * beta = 6.59048.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\ntau = 2.057e-24 s.\n\nSo L = 6.59048 * 3e8 * 2.057e-24.\n\nCompute 6.59048 * 3e8 = 1.977144e9.\n\nMultiply by 2.057e-24:\n\n1.977144e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.977144 * 2.057) * 1e-15.\n\nAs before, 1.977144 * 2.057 \u2248 4.066985.\n\nSo L \u22484.066985e-15 m.\n\nBut the option is 4.0655e-15, which is a bit lower.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma * beta is a bit lower due to more precise beta. Let me compute beta more accurately.\n\nEarlier, I approximated beta as 0.988572, but perhaps it's a bit less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula for beta.\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 / E^2 )).\n\nWait, because gamma = E/(m c^2), and beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E )^2 ). But in natural units, c=1, so beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2).\n\nSo, m =1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887 as before.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps using the exact value of gamma and beta.\n\nLet me compute gamma * beta using more precise values.\n\ngamma = E/m = 8 /1.2 = 20/3 \u2248 6.6666666667.\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.98871486.\n\nSo gamma * beta = (20/3) * 0.98871486 = 6.666666667 * 0.98871486.\n\nCompute this precisely:\n\n6.666666667 * 0.98871486.\n\nLet me compute 6 * 0.98871486 = 5.93228916.\n\n0.666666667 * 0.98871486 = ?\n\n0.6 * 0.98871486 = 0.593228916.\n\n0.066666667 * 0.98871486 \u2248 0.065914324.\n\nAdding: 0.593228916 + 0.065914324 = 0.65914324.\n\nSo total gamma * beta = 5.93228916 + 0.65914324 = 6.5914324.\n\nSo gamma * beta \u22486.5914324.\n\nNow, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\ntau = 2.057e-24 s.\n\nSo, 6.5914324 * 3e8 = 1.97742972e9 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.057e-24 s:\n\n1.97742972e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.97742972 * 2.057) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 1.97742972 * 2.057:\n\nLet me compute this with more precision.\n\n1.97742972 * 2.057:\n\n= 1.97742972 * 2 + 1.97742972 * 0.05 + 1.97742972 * 0.007.\n\n= 3.95485944 + 0.098871486 + 0.013842008.\n\nAdding:\n\n3.95485944 + 0.098871486 = 4.053730926.\n\n4.053730926 + 0.013842008 = 4.067572934.\n\nSo L \u22484.067572934e-15 m.\n\nBut the option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps I should check if my initial calculation of Gamma in J was correct.\n\nWait, Gamma is 320 MeV. Let me compute that again.\n\n320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\n1 GeV = 1.602176634e-10 J.\n\nSo Gamma = 0.32 * 1.602176634e-10 = 5.1269652288e-11 J.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s / 5.1269652288e-11 J.\n\nCompute that division:\n\n1.0545718e-34 / 5.1269652288e-11.\n\nLet me compute 1.0545718 / 5.1269652288 \u2248 0.2057.\n\nSo tau = 0.2057e-23 s = 2.057e-24 s. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma * beta * c * tau as:\n\ngamma * beta = 6.5914324.\n\nc = 299792458 m/s. Oh wait, I've been using c=3e8 m/s as an approximation, but perhaps using the exact value (299792458 m/s) would change the result a tiny bit.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCompute c = 2.99792458e8 m/s.\n\ngamma * beta = 6.5914324.\n\nSo, 6.5914324 * 2.99792458e8 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6 * 2.99792458e8 = 1.79875475e9.\n\n0.5914324 * 2.99792458e8 = ?\n\n0.5 * 2.99792458e8 = 1.49896229e8.\n\n0.0914324 * 2.99792458e8 \u2248 approx 2.741e7.\n\nSo, 1.49896229e8 + 2.741e7 \u2248 1.773e8.\n\nSo total gamma * beta * c \u2248 1.79875475e9 + 1.773e8 \u2248 1.97605475e9 m/s.\n\nNow, multiply by tau: 1.97605475e9 * 2.057e-24.\n\nSo 1.97605475 * 2.057 = ?\n\nCompute:\n\n1.97605475 * 2 = 3.9521095.\n\n1.97605475 * 0.057 = approximately 0.112755.\n\nAdding together: 3.9521095 + 0.112755 \u2248 4.0648645.\n\nSo L \u22484.0648645e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.0649e-15 m.\n\nBut the option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that's very close.\n\nHmm, perhaps the slight difference comes from using more precise c. So, using the exact c, the result is 4.0649e-15, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15).\n\nSo the correct answer must be option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think through it.\n\nThe question is about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance, X. I remember that when particles decay, their mean path length before decaying is related to their lifetime and their velocity. But wait, how exactly does that work?\n\nHmm, I think the mean decay distance (often called the decay length) is given by the formula L = gamma * v * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime of the particle. Or wait, maybe it's just gamma multiplied by the velocity times the lifetime? I'm a bit confused about the exact formula.\n\nWait, let me think. The mean lifetime tau is related to the width Gamma by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy (Gamma) and the uncertainty in time (tau) are inversely related. The formula is tau \u2248 \u0127 / Gamma, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. Oh, right, because Gamma is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the lifetime. So tau = \u0127 / (Gamma * c), wait, no, Gamma has units of energy, so when you take \u0127 (which has units of J\u00b7s) divided by Gamma (GeV), you have to convert units properly.\n\nWait, units are going to be tricky here. Let me jot down what I know:\n\nE_X = 8 GeV (production energy)\nm_X = 1.2 GeV (mass)\nGamma_X = 320 MeV (width)\n\nI need to find the mean decay distance. So first, let's find the lifetime tau of the meson. Tau is approximately equal to hbar / Gamma. But Gamma is given in MeV, and hbar is in J\u00b7s. I'll need to convert units.\n\nWait, the formula for tau is tau = \u0127 / (Gamma * c^2)? No, I think Gamma is the total decay width, which has units of energy. So tau should be hbar divided by Gamma. Because \u0127 has units of J\u00b7s, and Gamma is GeV, so converting GeV to J is necessary.\n\nLet me get the constants straight. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s. So \u0127 is h/(2pi) \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. But I think for particle physics, it's often easier to work in natural units where c=1 and \u0127=1, but when converting to meters, I'll have to use the proper units.\n\nWait, but let me think about the formula again. The lifetime tau is given by tau = \u0127 / Gamma. Gamma is in GeV, so I need to convert that to J. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J.\n\nSo Gamma_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Gamma_X = 0.32 GeV = 0.32e9 eV = 0.32e9 * 1.602e-19 J.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nGamma_X = 0.32 GeV = 0.32 * 1.602e-10 J = 5.1264e-11 J.\n\nWait, wait: 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 0.32 GeV is 0.32 * 1e9 eV = 3.2e8 eV. Then 3.2e8 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = 5.1264e-11 J.\n\nSo Gamma_X is 5.1264e-11 J.\n\nThen, tau = \u0127 / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.1264e-11 J) ) = approximately (1.05457e-34) / (5.1264e-11) seconds.\n\nCalculating that: 1.05457e-34 / 5.1264e-11 \u2248 2.057e-24 seconds. Wait, that seems really short. But mesons are short-lived particles, so maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, is Gamma in the denominator or numerator? Because tau is the lifetime, which is the inverse of the decay rate (Gamma is the decay rate, in units of energy, but I think that Gamma = \u0127 * decay rate. So decay rate \u0393 is Gamma / \u0127. So tau is 1/(Gamma / \u0127) ) => tau = \u0127 / Gamma. So my earlier calculation is correct.\n\nSo tau \u2248 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nNow, I need to find the velocity of the meson X. Because the mean decay distance L is gamma * v * c * tau. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact expression. Let me think again.\n\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula is L = gamma * v * c * tau. Because gamma is the Lorentz factor, which accounts for time dilation. Alternatively, another way to write it is L = gamma * beta * c * tau, since beta is v/c.\n\nSo, first, I need to find gamma and beta. To find gamma, I need the energy E of the meson. The energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV. The rest mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is gamma * m c^2. So gamma = E / (m c^2). But since we're working in natural units where c=1, gamma = E / m.\n\nWait, let's compute gamma. E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 \u2248 6.6667.\n\nBut wait, that's in units where c=1, but when considering units, since E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, so gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2) ) = 8/1.2 = 6.6667. So yes, gamma is 6.6667.\n\nNext, find beta. Beta is v/c, which can be found from gamma using the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So, solving for beta:\n\ngamma^2 = 1/(1-beta^2) => 1 - beta^2 = 1/gamma^2 => beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2.\n\nGamma is 6.6667, so gamma^2 is (6.6667)^2 = approx 44.444.\n\nSo beta^2 = 1 - 1/44.444 \u2248 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a more precise calculation: 1/gamma\u00b2 = 1/(400/9) )= 9/400=0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9887.\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo now, v = beta c \u2248 0.9887 c.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps using beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nNow, compute L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nWait, but let me check the units again. Tau is in seconds. c is in m/s. So the product c * tau is meters.\n\nSo L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\ngamma = 6.6667\n\nbeta \u2248 0.9887\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\ntau \u2248 2.057e-24 s\n\nSo L = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.6667 * 0.9887. Let me compute that:\n\n6 * 0.9887 is about 5.9322, 0.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 approx 0.658. So total \u2248 5.9322 + 0.658 \u2248 6.5902.\n\nSo 6.6667 * 0.9887 \u2248 6.59.\n\nThen, multiply by 3e8 m/s: 6.59 * 3e8 = 1.977e9 m/s.\n\nWait, no, wait: 6.59 * 3e8 = 1.977e9 m/s.\n\nBut wait, that's multiplied by tau, which is 2.057e-24 s. So L = 1.977e9 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.\n\nSo 1.977e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.977 * 2.057) * 1e-15.\n\nCalculating 1.977 * 2.057: approx 1.977 * 2 is 3.954, and 1.977 * 0.057 \u2248 0.1126. So total is approx 4.0666.\n\nSo 4.0666e-15 meters.\n\nWait, that's 4.0666e-15 m. Looking at the options:\n\nOption B is 4.0655e-15 m.\n\nOption C is 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nSo this calculation gives around 4.066e-15 m, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15 m).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the exact numbers because I approximated a few steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should do more precise calculations.\n\nLet me recompute gamma and beta precisely.\n\nGamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/(1.2) = 20/3 \u2248 6.6666666667.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).\n\nGamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u2248 44.4444444.\n\n1/gamma^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.\n\n1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.\n\nBeta = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 let's compute it accurately.\n\nsqrt(0.9775) = ?\n\nLet me compute it: 0.9887^2 is 0.9775. Wait, let me square 0.9887:\n\n0.9887 * 0.9887.\n\nCompute 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.\n\nThen, 0.9887 is 0.98 + 0.0087.\n\nSo (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\n\na=0.98, b=0.0087.\n\na^2=0.9604.\n\n2ab=2*0.98*0.0087= 2 * 0.008526= 0.017052.\n\nb^2=0.0087^2= ~0.00007569.\n\nAdding them together: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452 + 0.00007569 \u2248 0.97752769.\n\nSo 0.9887^2 \u2248 0.97752769, which is very close to 0.9775. So beta \u2248 0.9887.\n\nSo gamma * beta is (20/3) * 0.9887 \u2248 (6.66666667) * 0.9887.\n\nLet me compute that accurately:\n\n6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.\n\n0.66666667 * 0.9887 \u2248 0.6591.\n\nAdding: 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.\n\nSo gamma * beta \u2248 6.5913.\n\nNow, c is 3e8 m/s.\n\nTau is 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nSo L = gamma * beta * c * tau = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.\n\nWait, let's compute 6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.97739e9 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.057e-24 s: 1.97739e9 * 2.057e-24 = ?\n\n1.97739e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.057) * 1e-15.\n\nCalculating 1.97739 * 2.057:\n\nLet me compute 2 * 2.057 = 4.114.\n\nSubtract 0.02261 * 2.057:\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: 1.97739 = 2 - 0.02261.\n\nSo (2 - 0.02261) * 2.057 = 2*2.057 - 0.02261 *2.057.\n\n2*2.057=4.114.\n\n0.02261 *2.057: let's compute 0.02 *2.057=0.04114, 0.00261 *2.057\u22480.00537. So total is approximately 0.04651.\n\nSo 4.114 - 0.04651 \u2248 4.0675.\n\nSo 1.97739 * 2.057 \u2248 4.0675.\n\nSo L \u22484.0675e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this value.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but why is my approximate calculation leading to 4.0675e-15, and the option is 4.0655e-15? Maybe because of more precise calculations of beta or other steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Gamma. Let me double-check Gamma.\n\nWait, Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo when I calculated Gamma_X in Joules, I did 0.32 GeV = 0.32 * 1.602e-10 J = 5.1264e-11 J. That's correct.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.1264e-11 J) = 2.057e-24 seconds. Correct.\n\nWait, let me recompute 1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11.\n\n1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = (1.0545718 / 5.1264) ) * 1e-23.\n\n1.0545718 /5.1264 \u2248 0.2057.\n\nSo tau \u2248 0.2057e-23 s = 2.057e-24 s. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation is right.\n\nAnother thing to check: when computing gamma * beta, perhaps I should use more precise values. Let me compute gamma * beta precisely.\n\ngamma is 20/3 \u22486.6666666667.\n\nbeta is sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 let's compute it with more precision.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.9775) using a calculator method.\n\nLet me see, 0.9887^2 = 0.97752769, as before.\n\nBut perhaps the actual value is a bit less. Let me compute 0.9886^2.\n\n0.9886 * 0.9886:\n\n= (0.98 + 0.0086)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0086 + 0.0086^2.\n\n= 0.9604 + 0.017168 + 0.00007396.\n\n= 0.9604 + 0.017168 = 0.977568 + 0.00007396 \u2248 0.97764196.\n\nWhich is higher than 0.9775. So perhaps beta is around 0.9886.\n\nWait, let me try 0.9886:\n\n0.9886^2 \u2248 0.97764196.\n\nBut our target is 0.9775, which is a little less. So let's try 0.9885:\n\n0.9885^2 = ?\n\nCompute 0.9885 * 0.9885:\n\n= (0.98 + 0.0085)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0085 + 0.0085^2.\n\n= 0.9604 + 0.01666 + 0.00007225.\n\n= 0.9604 + 0.01666 = 0.97706 + 0.00007225 = 0.97713225.\n\nStill a bit higher than 0.9775? Wait, wait, no. 0.97713225 is less than 0.9775.\n\nWait, our target is 0.9775.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nAt beta = 0.9885, beta^2 is 0.97713225.\n\nAt beta = 0.9886, beta^2 is 0.97764196.\n\nWe want beta^2 = 0.9775.\n\nSo between 0.9885 and 0.9886.\n\nLet me compute the difference:\n\n0.9775 - 0.97713225 = 0.00036775.\n\nBetween 0.9885 and 0.9886, the beta^2 increases by 0.97764196 - 0.97713225 = 0.00050971.\n\nWe need 0.00036775 of that. So the fraction is 0.00036775 / 0.00050971 \u2248 0.722.\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.9885 + 0.722*(0.0001) = 0.9885 + 0.0000722 \u2248 0.9885722.\n\nSo beta \u2248 0.988572.\n\nSo gamma * beta = (20/3) * 0.988572 \u2248 6.6666667 * 0.988572.\n\nLet me compute this more accurately:\n\n6 * 0.988572 = 5.931432.\n\n0.6666667 * 0.988572 \u2248 0.6666667 * 0.988572.\n\nCompute 0.6666667 * 0.988572:\n\n0.6 * 0.988572 = 0.5931432.\n\n0.0666667 * 0.988572 \u2248 0.0659048.\n\nAdding together: 0.5931432 + 0.0659048 = 0.659048.\n\nSo total gamma * beta is 5.931432 + 0.659048 \u2248 6.59048.\n\nNow, L = 6.59048 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.\n\nCompute 6.59048 * 3e8 = 1.977144e9 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.057e-24 s: 1.977144e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.977144 * 2.057) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 1.977144 * 2.057:\n\nLet me compute this accurately:\n\n1.977144 * 2.057.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n= 1.977144 * 2 + 1.977144 * 0.05 + 1.977144 * 0.007.\n\n= 3.954288 + 0.0988572 + 0.013840008.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n3.954288 + 0.0988572 = 4.0531452.\n\n4.0531452 + 0.013840008 = 4.067, approx.\n\nWait, precise calculation:\n\n3.954288\n+ 0.0988572\n= 4.0531452\n\n+ 0.013840008\n= 4.066985208.\n\nSo approximately 4.066985e-15 m.\n\nSo L \u22484.066985e-15 m.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.\n\nHmm, my precise calculation gives about 4.067e-15, but option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. It's possible that the slight difference is due to more precise values of the constants or perhaps a miscalculation in the steps. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the units for Gamma.\n\nWait, another thought: Gamma is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Gamma = \u0127 / tau. So tau = \u0127 / Gamma. But I have to make sure that the units are correctly handled.\n\nGamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So in Joules, it's 0.32 * 1.602e-10 J = 5.1264e-11 J. Correct.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s) / (5.1264e-11 J) = approximately 2.057e-24 seconds. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the constants.\n\nLet me use the exact value of \u0127: 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nGamma = 0.32 GeV = 0.32 * 1.602176634e-10 J = 0.32 * 1.602176634e-10 = let me compute this:\n\n0.32 * 1.602176634e-10 = 5.1269652288e-11 J.\n\nTau = (1.0545718e-34) / (5.1269652288e-11) = approx 2.057e-24 seconds.\n\nSo, 1.0545718e-34 /5.1269652288e-11 = let me compute this division more accurately.\n\nCompute 1.0545718e-34 /5.1269652288e-11 = (1.0545718 /5.1269652288 ) * 1e-23.\n\n1.0545718 /5.1269652288 \u2248 0.2057.\n\nSo tau \u2248 0.2057e-23 s = 2.057e-24 s. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps seem correct.\n\nSo the final L is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15 m).\n\nWait, but why is there a slight discrepancy? Let me check the calculation of gamma * beta again. Because in the earlier step, I got gamma * beta = 6.59048, leading to 6.59048 * 3e8 * 2.057e-24 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it as:\n\ngamma * beta = 6.59048.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\ntau = 2.057e-24 s.\n\nSo L = 6.59048 * 3e8 * 2.057e-24.\n\nCompute 6.59048 * 3e8 = 1.977144e9.\n\nMultiply by 2.057e-24:\n\n1.977144e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.977144 * 2.057) * 1e-15.\n\nAs before, 1.977144 * 2.057 \u2248 4.066985.\n\nSo L \u22484.066985e-15 m.\n\nBut the option is 4.0655e-15, which is a bit lower.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma * beta is a bit lower due to more precise beta. Let me compute beta more accurately.\n\nEarlier, I approximated beta as 0.988572, but perhaps it's a bit less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula for beta.\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 / E^2 )).\n\nWait, because gamma = E/(m c^2), and beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E )^2 ). But in natural units, c=1, so beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2).\n\nSo, m =1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV.\n\nSo beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.9887 as before.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps using the exact value of gamma and beta.\n\nLet me compute gamma * beta using more precise values.\n\ngamma = E/m = 8 /1.2 = 20/3 \u2248 6.6666666667.\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(0.9775) \u2248 0.98871486.\n\nSo gamma * beta = (20/3) * 0.98871486 = 6.666666667 * 0.98871486.\n\nCompute this precisely:\n\n6.666666667 * 0.98871486.\n\nLet me compute 6 * 0.98871486 = 5.93228916.\n\n0.666666667 * 0.98871486 = ?\n\n0.6 * 0.98871486 = 0.593228916.\n\n0.066666667 * 0.98871486 \u2248 0.065914324.\n\nAdding: 0.593228916 + 0.065914324 = 0.65914324.\n\nSo total gamma * beta = 5.93228916 + 0.65914324 = 6.5914324.\n\nSo gamma * beta \u22486.5914324.\n\nNow, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\ntau = 2.057e-24 s.\n\nSo, 6.5914324 * 3e8 = 1.97742972e9 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.057e-24 s:\n\n1.97742972e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.97742972 * 2.057) * 1e-15.\n\nCompute 1.97742972 * 2.057:\n\nLet me compute this with more precision.\n\n1.97742972 * 2.057:\n\n= 1.97742972 * 2 + 1.97742972 * 0.05 + 1.97742972 * 0.007.\n\n= 3.95485944 + 0.098871486 + 0.013842008.\n\nAdding:\n\n3.95485944 + 0.098871486 = 4.053730926.\n\n4.053730926 + 0.013842008 = 4.067572934.\n\nSo L \u22484.067572934e-15 m.\n\nBut the option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps I should check if my initial calculation of Gamma in J was correct.\n\nWait, Gamma is 320 MeV. Let me compute that again.\n\n320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\n1 GeV = 1.602176634e-10 J.\n\nSo Gamma = 0.32 * 1.602176634e-10 = 5.1269652288e-11 J.\n\nTau = \u0127 / Gamma = 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s / 5.1269652288e-11 J.\n\nCompute that division:\n\n1.0545718e-34 / 5.1269652288e-11.\n\nLet me compute 1.0545718 / 5.1269652288 \u2248 0.2057.\n\nSo tau = 0.2057e-23 s = 2.057e-24 s. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute gamma * beta * c * tau as:\n\ngamma * beta = 6.5914324.\n\nc = 299792458 m/s. Oh wait, I've been using c=3e8 m/s as an approximation, but perhaps using the exact value (299792458 m/s) would change the result a tiny bit.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCompute c = 2.99792458e8 m/s.\n\ngamma * beta = 6.5914324.\n\nSo, 6.5914324 * 2.99792458e8 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6 * 2.99792458e8 = 1.79875475e9.\n\n0.5914324 * 2.99792458e8 = ?\n\n0.5 * 2.99792458e8 = 1.49896229e8.\n\n0.0914324 * 2.99792458e8 \u2248 approx 2.741e7.\n\nSo, 1.49896229e8 + 2.741e7 \u2248 1.773e8.\n\nSo total gamma * beta * c \u2248 1.79875475e9 + 1.773e8 \u2248 1.97605475e9 m/s.\n\nNow, multiply by tau: 1.97605475e9 * 2.057e-24.\n\nSo 1.97605475 * 2.057 = ?\n\nCompute:\n\n1.97605475 * 2 = 3.9521095.\n\n1.97605475 * 0.057 = approximately 0.112755.\n\nAdding together: 3.9521095 + 0.112755 \u2248 4.0648645.\n\nSo L \u22484.0648645e-15 m.\n\nWhich is approximately 4.0649e-15 m.\n\nBut the option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that's very close.\n\nHmm, perhaps the slight difference comes from using more precise c. So, using the exact c, the result is 4.0649e-15, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15).\n\nSo the correct answer must be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \\( X \\), we use the formula for the decay length:\n\n\\[\nL = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor,\n- \\( \\beta = v/c \\) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light,\n- \\( \\tau \\) is the proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \\( \\tau \\)\nThe proper lifetime \\( \\tau \\) is related to the total decay width \\( \\Gamma \\) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( \\Gamma = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.32 \\, \\text{GeV} = 0.32 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{J} = 5.1264 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{J} \\),\n- \\( \\hbar = 1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s} \\),\n\nwe calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34}}{5.1264 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 2.057 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\( \\gamma \\) and \\( \\beta \\)\nThe Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( E = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and \\( m = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} \\).
