      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with these buffer solutions and phosphate calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe problem says we have a solution with 200 cm\u00b3 (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, no, orthophosphate is HPO4^2- I think. Because ortho, meta, para refer to substituents in aromatic compounds, but in phosphoric acid, the different forms are called ortho, dihydrogen phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, etc.\n\nWait, let me get that straight. H3PO4 is triply deprotonated to form PO4^3-, but the various forms are H3PO4 (ortho), H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (orthophosphate, but maybe sometimes called phosphate). So in this solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nI remember that when you mix a weak acid with its conjugate base, you get a buffer solution. Here, KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (since K is the spectator ion), and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (since Na+ is the spectator). So we have a buffer system of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nThe question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.\n\nSo the plan is to calculate the concentrations of each salt, then use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, and then use that to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, since we have a buffer solution, maybe the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are known, and we can find the ratio using the Ka values.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the moles of each substance.\n\nFor KH2PO4:\nMolar mass (Mw) is given as 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.00734 mol.\n\nWait, let me compute that accurately. 1 / 136.09 is approximately 0.00734.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\nMolar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005607 mol.\n\nWait, wait. Let me calculate that again. 1 divided by 177.99 is approximately 0.005607.\n\nWait, but wait. Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. So the formula is Na2(HPO4)\u00b72H2O. So each mole of this compound gives one mole of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo the moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 is 0.00734 mol.\n\nThe moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 0.005607 mol.\n\nThe solution volume is 200 cm\u00b3 = 0.2 liters. So the concentrations are:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005607 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.028035 M.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but wait. Because in solution, HPO4^2- can dissociate further. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so the relevant dissociations are:\n\nH3PO4 \u2194 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)\nH2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)\nHPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)\n\nSo the HPO4^2- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become PO4^3- or as a base, accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-.\n\nIn the solution, the dominant species will depend on the pH. Since we have a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH will be determined by the pKa2 value, because that's the one between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nSo the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies here. The equation is:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nWait, wait. The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, [base] is [HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 M, [acid] is [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M.\n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log(0.028035 / 0.0367)\n\nCompute pKa2: Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.208.\n\nNow compute the ratio: 0.028035 / 0.0367 \u2248 0.764.\n\nLog(0.764) is approximately -0.115. Because log(0.7586)= -0.116, which is about 0.764. So log(0.764) \u2248 -0.115.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 + (-0.115) \u2248 7.093.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the solution, the HPO4^2- is in equilibrium with H2PO4^- and PO4^3-, but in the buffer solution, the concentrations are primarily determined by the buffer components. So the concentrations we calculated earlier (0.028 M HPO4^2- and 0.0367 M H2PO4^-) are the initial concentrations before considering the dissociation. But since it's a buffer, the ratio between these two is determined by the pH, which in turn is determined by the pKa and their concentrations.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the initial concentrations are accurate, and we can use the pH to find the degree of dissociation.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is the same as we calculated, 0.028035 M, but that's 2.8e-2 M, which is much larger than any of the options given (which are around 1e-7 M). So that can't be right. So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the concentration of HPO4^2- from the salts, but about the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution, considering the dissociation of the other species.\n\nWait, let me think again. The initial solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nH2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (but that's the reverse reaction of the second dissociation step). Wait, no, the second dissociation is H2PO4^- \u2192 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). So in solution, some of the H2PO4^- will dissociate to form HPO4^2-.\n\nBut wait, the solution is a buffer, so the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will resist changes in pH, but their concentrations are determined by the buffer equation.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The problem statement says \"the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution\". Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So perhaps the initial calculation is correct, but the options are way lower. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recheck.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4: K is 39.10, H2 is 2.016, P is 30.97, O4 is 64. So 39.10 + 2.016 + 30.97 + (16*4) = 39.10 +2.016=41.116 +30.97=72.086 +64=136.086 g/mol. So 1g is about 0.007337 mol.\n\nSimilarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: Na is 22.99 each, so 2*22.99=45.98. HPO4 is H:1, P:30.97, O4:64. So HPO4 is 1+30.97+64=95.97. So 45.98 +95.97=141.95. Then 2 H2O is 2*(2*1.008 +16) = 2*(2.016 +16)=2*(18.016)=36.032. So total is 141.95 +36.032=177.982 g/mol. So 1g is 1 / 177.982 \u2248 0.005607 mol.\n\nSo the initial concentrations are correct.\n\nSo the concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M, [HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 M.\n\nBut wait, according to the buffer equation, the pH is around 7.093, which is close to the pKa2 of 7.208. So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is about 0.764, which makes sense.\n\nBut the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is 0.028035 M, but that's about 2.8e-2 M, which is way higher than any of the options given (all are around 1e-7 M). So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions in solution, considering that some of the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are dissociating into other forms.\n\nWait, no. Because in the solution, the buffer system would maintain the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- according to the Henderson equation. So perhaps the actual concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the pH and the concentrations of the buffer components.\n\nWait, but that's what I calculated earlier. So maybe I'm not considering that HPO4^2- can further dissociate into PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but that's another dissociation step. The third Ka is 1.8e-12. So in solution, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-.\n\nSo perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is being adjusted by this. But wait, the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution suggests that the pH is around 7.09, which is higher than pKa2 (7.208), so HPO4^2- is the base and H2PO4^- is the acid. So at pH 7.09, which is just below pKa2, so the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is less than 1, which aligns with our calculation.\n\nBut in any case, the concentration of HPO4^2- is about 0.028 M, which is way higher than the options given. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-), not HPO4^2-? Because PO4^3- is the orthophosphate ion.\n\nOh wait! I think I made a mistake here. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, not HPO4^2-. Because when you have HPO4^2-, that's hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is orthophosphate. So perhaps the question is asking for [PO4^3-], not [HPO4^2-].\n\nAh, that makes more sense. Because the options are in the 1e-7 range, which would fit with the third dissociation step, which has a very small Ka.\n\nSo I need to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nSo to find [PO4^3-], I can consider the third dissociation step: HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12. The pH of the solution is about 7.093.\n\nSo using the expression for Ka3: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can solve for [PO4^3-].\n\nWe have Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.093) \u2248 8.28e-8 M.\n\nSo rearranging:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nPlugging the numbers in:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.28e-8)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = approximately 5.0463e-14.\n\nDivide that by 8.28e-8: 5.0463e-14 / 8.28e-8 \u2248 6.097e-7 M.\n\nWait, but let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = let me compute 0.028035 * 1.8e-12.\n\n0.028035 * 1.8 = 0.050463 \u2192 0.050463e-12 = 5.0463e-14.\n\nThen 5.0463e-14 / 8.28e-8 = (5.0463 / 8.28) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0463 / 8.28 \u2248 0.609 \u2192 0.609e-6 = 6.09e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate [H+] more accurately.\n\npH is 7.093, so [H+] = 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093) \u2248 1e-7 * 0.873 \u2248 8.73e-8 M.\n\nSo [H+] is about 8.73e-8 M.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.73e-8).\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = let's compute 1.8 * 0.028035 = 0.050463 \u2192 5.0463e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.73e-8.\n\nSo 5.0463e-14 / 8.73e-8 = (5.0463 / 8.73) * 1e-6 \u2192 approximately (0.578) * 1e-6 \u2192 5.78e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's about 5.78e-7 M, which is close to option B (5.48e-7) and option D (3.97e-7).\n\nHmm, perhaps I should compute more precisely.\n\nLet me calculate [H+] more accurately.\n\npH = 7.093 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.093) = ?\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.093). Let me break it down:\n\n7.093 = 7 + 0.093.\n\n10^(-7) = 1e-7.\n\n10^(-0.093) \u2248 0.875. Because log(0.875) \u2248 -0.064, but let me get a better approximation.\n\nWait, I can use natural logarithm approximation or Taylor series, but perhaps it's easier to compute 10^(-0.093) \u2248 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794, but 0.093 is 0.1 - 0.007.\n\nSo 10^(-0.093) \u2248 10^(-0.1) * 10^(0.007) \u2248 0.794 * 1.016 \u2248 0.806.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 1e-7 * 0.806 \u2248 8.06e-8 M.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.06e-8) = ?\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 1.8 * 0.028035 = 0.050463 \u2192 5.0463e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.06e-8: 5.0463e-14 / 8.06e-8 = (5.0463 / 8.06) * 1e-6 \u2192 approximately 0.626 * 1e-6 \u2192 6.26e-7 M.\n\nHmm, that's about 6.26e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nBut wait, let's compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 5.0463 / 8.06.\n\n5.0463 \u00f7 8.06:\n\n8.06 goes into 5.0463 about 0.626 times.\n\nSo 0.626e-6 = 6.26e-7 M.\n\nSo the closest option would be A) 6.24e-7.\n\nBut wait, let me check all steps again for any possible mistake.\n\nWait, the initial moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005607 mol. The concentration is 0.005607 / 0.2 L = 0.028035 M.\n\nThen, using Ka3 = 1.8e-12 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]\n\nWhich is (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.06e-8).\n\nWait, 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.\n\n5.0463e-14 divided by 8.06e-8 = 6.26e-7.\n\nBut the options are A)6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, C)2.81e-7, D)3.97e-7.\n\nSo option A is the closest. But wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH more accurately.\n\nEarlier, I estimated the pH using the Henderson equation as 7.093. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nThe Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\npKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2192 let's compute that accurately.\n\nlog(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) \u2192 log(6.2) \u2248 0.7924, so pKa2 = 7.2076.\n\nThe ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.028035 / 0.0367 \u2192 let's compute that accurately.\n\n0.028035 / 0.0367 \u2192 let's compute 0.028035 \u00f7 0.0367.\n\n0.028035 \u00f7 0.0367 = 0.764 (approximately).\n\nBut more accurately: 0.028035 \u00f7 0.0367.\n\nWell, 0.0367 * 0.764 = 0.0367 * 0.7 = 0.02569, 0.0367 * 0.06 = 0.002202, 0.0367 * 0.004 = 0.0001468. Sum: 0.02569 + 0.002202=0.027892 + 0.0001468=0.0280388, which is very close to 0.028035. So the ratio is exactly 0.764.\n\nSo log(0.764) \u2192 let's compute this accurately.\n\nlog(0.764) = log(764 \u00d71e-3) = log(764) -3.\n\nLog(764) is approximately 2.8838 (since 10^2.8838 \u2248 764).\n\nSo log(764) = 2.8838 \u2192 log(0.764) = 2.8838 -3 = -0.1162.\n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log(ratio) \u2192 7.2076 + (-0.1162) = 7.0914.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^(-7.0914) \u2192 let's compute this accurately.\n\n10^(-7.0914) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0914).\n\n10^(-0.0914) = ?\n\nWe can compute this using the fact that ln(10^(-0.0914)) = -0.0914 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.0914 * 2.3026 \u2248 -0.2105.\n\nSo e^(-0.2105) \u2248 0.8107.\n\nSo 10^(-0.0914) \u2248 0.8107.\n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.8107 \u2248 8.107e-8 M.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.107e-8).\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.107e-8.\n\nSo 5.0463e-14 / 8.107e-8 = (5.0463 / 8.107) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0463 \u00f7 8.107 \u2248 0.6226.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 0.6226e-6 \u2192 6.226e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which matches closely.\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028035 M is incorrect, because HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3-, and H2PO4^- can come from H3PO4. But no, in this solution, the buffer is made from adding H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total concentration of phosphate species.\n\nWait, but I think the initial approach is correct. The buffer solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the pH is determined by their ratio. Then, the [PO4^3-] is determined by the third dissociation step.\n\nSo the answer should be approximately 6.22e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nSo the correct answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with these buffer solutions and phosphate calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe problem says we have a solution with 200 cm\u00b3 (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, no, orthophosphate is HPO4^2- I think. Because ortho, meta, para refer to substituents in aromatic compounds, but in phosphoric acid, the different forms are called ortho, dihydrogen phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, etc.\n\nWait, let me get that straight. H3PO4 is triply deprotonated to form PO4^3-, but the various forms are H3PO4 (ortho), H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (orthophosphate, but maybe sometimes called phosphate). So in this solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nI remember that when you mix a weak acid with its conjugate base, you get a buffer solution. Here, KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (since K is the spectator ion), and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (since Na+ is the spectator). So we have a buffer system of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nThe question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.\n\nSo the plan is to calculate the concentrations of each salt, then use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, and then use that to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, since we have a buffer solution, maybe the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are known, and we can find the ratio using the Ka values.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the moles of each substance.\n\nFor KH2PO4:\nMolar mass (Mw) is given as 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.00734 mol.\n\nWait, let me compute that accurately. 1 / 136.09 is approximately 0.00734.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\nMolar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005607 mol.\n\nWait, wait. Let me calculate that again. 1 divided by 177.99 is approximately 0.005607.\n\nWait, but wait. Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. So the formula is Na2(HPO4)\u00b72H2O. So each mole of this compound gives one mole of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo the moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 is 0.00734 mol.\n\nThe moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 0.005607 mol.\n\nThe solution volume is 200 cm\u00b3 = 0.2 liters. So the concentrations are:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005607 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.028035 M.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but wait. Because in solution, HPO4^2- can dissociate further. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so the relevant dissociations are:\n\nH3PO4 \u2194 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)\nH2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)\nHPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)\n\nSo the HPO4^2- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become PO4^3- or as a base, accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-.\n\nIn the solution, the dominant species will depend on the pH. Since we have a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH will be determined by the pKa2 value, because that's the one between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nSo the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies here. The equation is:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nWait, wait. The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, [base] is [HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 M, [acid] is [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M.\n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log(0.028035 / 0.0367)\n\nCompute pKa2: Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.208.\n\nNow compute the ratio: 0.028035 / 0.0367 \u2248 0.764.\n\nLog(0.764) is approximately -0.115. Because log(0.7586)= -0.116, which is about 0.764. So log(0.764) \u2248 -0.115.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 + (-0.115) \u2248 7.093.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the solution, the HPO4^2- is in equilibrium with H2PO4^- and PO4^3-, but in the buffer solution, the concentrations are primarily determined by the buffer components. So the concentrations we calculated earlier (0.028 M HPO4^2- and 0.0367 M H2PO4^-) are the initial concentrations before considering the dissociation. But since it's a buffer, the ratio between these two is determined by the pH, which in turn is determined by the pKa and their concentrations.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the initial concentrations are accurate, and we can use the pH to find the degree of dissociation.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is the same as we calculated, 0.028035 M, but that's 2.8e-2 M, which is much larger than any of the options given (which are around 1e-7 M). So that can't be right. So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the concentration of HPO4^2- from the salts, but about the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution, considering the dissociation of the other species.\n\nWait, let me think again. The initial solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nH2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (but that's the reverse reaction of the second dissociation step). Wait, no, the second dissociation is H2PO4^- \u2192 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). So in solution, some of the H2PO4^- will dissociate to form HPO4^2-.\n\nBut wait, the solution is a buffer, so the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will resist changes in pH, but their concentrations are determined by the buffer equation.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The problem statement says \"the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution\". Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So perhaps the initial calculation is correct, but the options are way lower. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recheck.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4: K is 39.10, H2 is 2.016, P is 30.97, O4 is 64. So 39.10 + 2.016 + 30.97 + (16*4) = 39.10 +2.016=41.116 +30.97=72.086 +64=136.086 g/mol. So 1g is about 0.007337 mol.\n\nSimilarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: Na is 22.99 each, so 2*22.99=45.98. HPO4 is H:1, P:30.97, O4:64. So HPO4 is 1+30.97+64=95.97. So 45.98 +95.97=141.95. Then 2 H2O is 2*(2*1.008 +16) = 2*(2.016 +16)=2*(18.016)=36.032. So total is 141.95 +36.032=177.982 g/mol. So 1g is 1 / 177.982 \u2248 0.005607 mol.\n\nSo the initial concentrations are correct.\n\nSo the concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M, [HPO4^2-] = 0.028035 M.\n\nBut wait, according to the buffer equation, the pH is around 7.093, which is close to the pKa2 of 7.208. So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is about 0.764, which makes sense.\n\nBut the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is 0.028035 M, but that's about 2.8e-2 M, which is way higher than any of the options given (all are around 1e-7 M). So I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions in solution, considering that some of the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are dissociating into other forms.\n\nWait, no. Because in the solution, the buffer system would maintain the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- according to the Henderson equation. So perhaps the actual concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the pH and the concentrations of the buffer components.\n\nWait, but that's what I calculated earlier. So maybe I'm not considering that HPO4^2- can further dissociate into PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but that's another dissociation step. The third Ka is 1.8e-12. So in solution, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-.\n\nSo perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is being adjusted by this. But wait, the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution suggests that the pH is around 7.09, which is higher than pKa2 (7.208), so HPO4^2- is the base and H2PO4^- is the acid. So at pH 7.09, which is just below pKa2, so the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is less than 1, which aligns with our calculation.\n\nBut in any case, the concentration of HPO4^2- is about 0.028 M, which is way higher than the options given. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-), not HPO4^2-? Because PO4^3- is the orthophosphate ion.\n\nOh wait! I think I made a mistake here. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, not HPO4^2-. Because when you have HPO4^2-, that's hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is orthophosphate. So perhaps the question is asking for [PO4^3-], not [HPO4^2-].\n\nAh, that makes more sense. Because the options are in the 1e-7 range, which would fit with the third dissociation step, which has a very small Ka.\n\nSo I need to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nSo to find [PO4^3-], I can consider the third dissociation step: HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12. The pH of the solution is about 7.093.\n\nSo using the expression for Ka3: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can solve for [PO4^3-].\n\nWe have Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.093) \u2248 8.28e-8 M.\n\nSo rearranging:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nPlugging the numbers in:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.28e-8)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = approximately 5.0463e-14.\n\nDivide that by 8.28e-8: 5.0463e-14 / 8.28e-8 \u2248 6.097e-7 M.\n\nWait, but let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = let me compute 0.028035 * 1.8e-12.\n\n0.028035 * 1.8 = 0.050463 \u2192 0.050463e-12 = 5.0463e-14.\n\nThen 5.0463e-14 / 8.28e-8 = (5.0463 / 8.28) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0463 / 8.28 \u2248 0.609 \u2192 0.609e-6 = 6.09e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate [H+] more accurately.\n\npH is 7.093, so [H+] = 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093) \u2248 1e-7 * 0.873 \u2248 8.73e-8 M.\n\nSo [H+] is about 8.73e-8 M.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.73e-8).\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = let's compute 1.8 * 0.028035 = 0.050463 \u2192 5.0463e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.73e-8.\n\nSo 5.0463e-14 / 8.73e-8 = (5.0463 / 8.73) * 1e-6 \u2192 approximately (0.578) * 1e-6 \u2192 5.78e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's about 5.78e-7 M, which is close to option B (5.48e-7) and option D (3.97e-7).\n\nHmm, perhaps I should compute more precisely.\n\nLet me calculate [H+] more accurately.\n\npH = 7.093 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.093) = ?\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.093). Let me break it down:\n\n7.093 = 7 + 0.093.\n\n10^(-7) = 1e-7.\n\n10^(-0.093) \u2248 0.875. Because log(0.875) \u2248 -0.064, but let me get a better approximation.\n\nWait, I can use natural logarithm approximation or Taylor series, but perhaps it's easier to compute 10^(-0.093) \u2248 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794, but 0.093 is 0.1 - 0.007.\n\nSo 10^(-0.093) \u2248 10^(-0.1) * 10^(0.007) \u2248 0.794 * 1.016 \u2248 0.806.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 1e-7 * 0.806 \u2248 8.06e-8 M.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.06e-8) = ?\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 1.8 * 0.028035 = 0.050463 \u2192 5.0463e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.06e-8: 5.0463e-14 / 8.06e-8 = (5.0463 / 8.06) * 1e-6 \u2192 approximately 0.626 * 1e-6 \u2192 6.26e-7 M.\n\nHmm, that's about 6.26e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nBut wait, let's compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 5.0463 / 8.06.\n\n5.0463 \u00f7 8.06:\n\n8.06 goes into 5.0463 about 0.626 times.\n\nSo 0.626e-6 = 6.26e-7 M.\n\nSo the closest option would be A) 6.24e-7.\n\nBut wait, let me check all steps again for any possible mistake.\n\nWait, the initial moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005607 mol. The concentration is 0.005607 / 0.2 L = 0.028035 M.\n\nThen, using Ka3 = 1.8e-12 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]\n\nWhich is (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.06e-8).\n\nWait, 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.\n\n5.0463e-14 divided by 8.06e-8 = 6.26e-7.\n\nBut the options are A)6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, C)2.81e-7, D)3.97e-7.\n\nSo option A is the closest.

Sum: 0.02569 + 0.002202=0.027892 + 0.0001468=0.0280388, which is very close to 0.028035. So the ratio is exactly 0.764.\n\nSo log(0.764) \u2192 let's compute this accurately.\n\nlog(0.764) = log(764 \u00d71e-3) = log(764) -3.\n\nLog(764) is approximately 2.8838 (since 10^2.8838 \u2248 764).\n\nSo log(764) = 2.8838 \u2192 log(0.764) = 2.8838 -3 = -0.1162.\n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log(ratio) \u2192 7.2076 + (-0.1162) = 7.0914.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^(-7.0914) \u2192 let's compute this accurately.\n\n10^(-7.0914) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0914).\n\n10^(-0.0914) = ?\n\nWe can compute this using the fact that ln(10^(-0.0914)) = -0.0914 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.0914 * 2.3026 \u2248 -0.2105.\n\nSo e^(-0.2105) \u2248 0.8107.\n\nSo 10^(-0.0914) \u2248 0.8107.\n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.8107 \u2248 8.107e-8 M.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.107e-8).\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = 5.0463e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.107e-8.\n\nSo 5.0463e-14 / 8.107e-8 = (5.0463 / 8.107) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0463 \u00f7 8.107 \u2248 0.6226.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 0.6226e-6 \u2192 6.226e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which matches closely.\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028035 M is incorrect, because HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3-, and H2PO4^- can come from H3PO4. But no, in this solution, the buffer is made from adding H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total concentration of phosphate species.\n\nWait, but I think the initial approach is correct. The buffer solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the pH is determined by their ratio. Then, the [PO4^3-] is determined by the third dissociation step.\n\nSo the answer should be approximately 6.22e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).\n\nSo the correct answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound, and the total volume is 200.00 cm\u00b3 (0.2 L).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me start by reading the question carefully.\n\nSo, the problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3. That's 200 mL, right? And it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25\u00b0C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.\n\nWait, wait, orthophosphate is the conjugate base, right? So phosphate ions are PO4^3-. But how do we get that from the given substances?\n\nI remember that KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). When dissolved in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become HPO4^2-, or accept a proton to become H3PO4. So, H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion.\n\nOn the other hand, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4\u00b72H2O). When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3- or accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.\n\nSo, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. These are adjacent species in the phosphate ion's dissociation series. Because they're in the same solution, I think they'll form a buffer solution. That makes me think about the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates pH to the ratio of the concentrations of a base and its conjugate acid.\n\nWait, but the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, not HPO4^2- or H2PO4^- directly. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think again.\n\nOrthophosphate is PO4^3-. To get that, HPO4^2- must lose a proton. So, the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the dissociation of HPO4^2-.\n\nBut wait, in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So, the phosphate species present are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But at 25\u00b0C, the solution's pH will determine which species are predominant.\n\nWait, but given that we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, the solution is likely a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So, the pH is determined by the pKa2 of H3PO4, since H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.\n\nThe Ka values are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, pKa1 is log(1/(7.5e-3)) which is about 2.12, pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) which is about 7.21, and pKa3 is around 11.74.\n\nSince we're dealing with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the relevant pKa is pKa2, 7.21. So the solution's pH is around 7.21. But wait, the actual pH depends on the ratio of the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.\n\nLet me think about the buffer equation. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me recall: the acid is H2PO4^- because it can donate a proton (to become HPO4^2-), so H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So yes, the equation should be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the concentration of PO4^3-, which comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-. So, we need to find [PO4^3-].\n\nHPO4^2- can act as an acid (donate a proton) to become PO4^3- or as a base (accept a proton) to become H2PO4^-.\n\nSo, the dissociation of HPO4^2- is: HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. So, the expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].\n\nBut in the solution, the pH is determined by the buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the [H+] is related to the pH, which is around pKa2. Let's compute that first.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n\nThe solution volume is 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters.\n\nWe have 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nLet me compute the moles of each.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007344 mol.\n\nEach mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^- and one mole of K+.\n\nSimilarly, for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005613 mol.\n\nEach mole of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2- and two moles of Na+.\n\nSo, in solution, the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007344 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03672 M.\n\nThe concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028065 M.\n\nNow, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\npKa2 is log(6.2e-8) \u2192 wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is about 7.208.\n\nSo, pH = 7.208 + log(0.028065 / 0.03672)\n\nLet me calculate the ratio: 0.028065 / 0.03672 \u2248 0.7646.\n\nLog(0.7646) is approximately -0.115.\n\nSo, pH \u2248 7.208 - 0.115 \u2248 7.093.\n\nSo, pH is approximately 7.093.\n\nNow, knowing the pH, we can find the [H+] in solution.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.093) \u2248 8.27e-8 M.\n\nNow, we need to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nPO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-:\n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWe have [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.028065 M, [H+] \u2248 8.27e-8 M.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.27e-8)\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 \u2248 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.27e-8: 5.0517e-14 / 8.27e-8 \u2248 6.11e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's about 6.11e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a calculation error somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check the [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] concentrations.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007344 mol.\n\nVolume is 0.2 L, so concentration is 0.03672 M.\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005613 mol.\n\nConcentration: 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nThe ratio is 0.028065 / 0.03672 = approximately 0.7646.\n\nLog(0.7646) is about log(3/4)= -0.1249, but let me calculate it more accurately.\n\nWait, 10^(-0.115) is about 0.764, so the pH is correct.\n\nThen [H+] is 10^(-7.093) \u2192 let me compute that more accurately.\n\npH =7.093 \u2192 H+ = 1e-7.093 = 1e-7 * 1e-0.093 \u2192 1e-7 * approx 0.876 \u2192 8.76e-8 M.\n\nWait, earlier I approximated it as 8.27e-8. Hmm, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.093):\n\n7.093 = 7 + 0.093.\n\n10^(-7) is 1e-7.\n\n10^(-0.093) is approximately 10^(-0.09) \u2248 0.871, because 10^0.1 is about 1.258, so 10^-0.09 is about 1/(1.258^(0.9)) \u2192 wait, perhaps a better way is to use logarithm tables or a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute ln(10^0.093) = 0.093 * ln(10) \u2248 0.093 * 2.3026 \u2248 0.214.\n\nSo e^0.214 \u2248 1.238. So 10^0.093 = e^(ln(10^0.093)) = e^(0.214) \u2248 1.238. So 10^-0.093 \u2248 1/1.238 \u2248 0.807.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 1e-7 * 0.807 = 8.07e-8 M.\n\nSo using this more precise value, [H+] is 8.07e-8.\n\nNow, let's compute [PO4^3-]:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.07e-8.\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.\n\n5.0517e-14 / 8.07e-8 = approximately 6.26e-7.\n\nWait, 8.07e-8 is 8.07 x 10^-8.\n\nSo 5.0517e-14 / 8.07e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.07) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 / 8.07 \u2248 0.626.\n\nSo 0.626e-6 = 6.26e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.\n\nBut wait, let me check the exact calculation.\n\nWait, 5.0517e-14 divided by 8.07e-8.\n\nLet me compute 5.0517e-14 / 8.07e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.07) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 \u00f7 8.07 \u2248 0.626.\n\nSo 0.626e-6 is 6.26e-7.\n\nBut option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close, considering the approximations in the pH calculation.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe I should calculate [H+] more accurately.\n\nAnother way: the pH was calculated as 7.093. So, [H+] = 10^-7.093.\n\nCalculating 10^7.093 = 10^7 * 10^0.093.\n\n10^0.093: let's calculate it more precisely.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series or logarithm tables. Alternatively, using a calculator approach.\n\nBut since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can remember that log(1.23) is about 0.0899.\n\nWait, let me think: 10^0.09 is approximately 1.23.\n\nWait, 10^0.09 \u2192 take natural logs: ln(10^0.09) = 0.09 * ln(10) \u2248 0.09 * 2.3026 \u2248 0.2072.\n\ne^0.2072 \u2248 1.229. So, 10^0.09 \u2248 1.229.\n\nSo 10^-0.09 \u2248 1/1.229 \u2248 0.813.\n\nSo, 10^-7.093 = 10^(-7) * 10^-0.093.\n\nWait, 0.093 is a bit more than 0.09. Let's approximate 10^-0.093 \u2248 10^(-0.09 -0.003) = 10^-0.09 * 10^-0.003.\n\nWe have 10^-0.09 \u2248 0.813.\n\n10^-0.003: ln(10^-0.003) = -0.003 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.006908. So e^-0.006908 \u2248 1 - 0.006908 \u2248 0.9931.\n\nSo, 10^-0.003 \u2248 0.9931.\n\nSo, 10^-0.093 \u2248 0.813 * 0.9931 \u2248 0.808.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 1e-7 * 0.808 = 8.08e-8 M.\n\nSo, using this more accurate [H+], let's recalculate [PO4^3-].\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.08e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.08e-8.\n\n5.0517e-14 / 8.08e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 / 8.08 \u2248 0.6256.\n\nSo, 0.6256e-6 = 6.256e-7 M.\n\nThat's approximately 6.26e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: when we have a solution with both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the actual concentration of HPO4^2- isn't just the moles from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, because H2PO4^- can deprotonate to form HPO4^2- and vice versa, depending on the pH. But in this case, the pH is close to pKa2, so the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a ratio of about 1.3:1, which is what we used in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nBut when calculating [PO4^3-], we need to consider the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution, which is influenced by the buffer. Wait, but in the calculation, I used the initial concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, no, the buffer equation gives the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] as 0.7646, which we used to calculate pH. But when calculating [PO4^3-], we used [HPO4^2-] as 0.028065 M, which is the initial concentration. But in reality, the actual [HPO4^2-] is higher because some of the H2PO4^- has deprotonated to become HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, this might be a point where I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial moles of H2PO4^- are from KH2PO4: 0.007344 mol.\n\nThe initial moles of HPO4^2- are from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 0.005613 mol.\n\nBut in solution, some of the H2PO4^- will deprotonate to form HPO4^2-, and some of the HPO4^2- will deprotonate to form PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but the buffer system is mainly between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the concentrations are adjusted based on the pH. So, the total concentration of phosphate species (H2PO4^- + HPO4^2-) is the sum of the initial moles of both, but their individual concentrations change based on pH.\n\nWait, no. Because the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- initially, their concentrations are fixed by their amounts, but the pH will determine how much each is present.\n\nWait, actually, the buffer equation tells us that the ratio of their concentrations determines the pH. So, the concentrations [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] are in a specific ratio based on the pH.\n\nBut when calculating the [PO4^3-], I used the actual concentration of HPO4^2- as per the initial moles, which might not be correct. Because some of HPO4^2- would have further deprotonated into PO4^3-.\n\nWait, so perhaps I need to model this more accurately.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet [H2PO4^-] = a\n\n[HPO4^2-] = b\n\n[PO4^3-] = c\n\nWe know that the solution contains 0.03672 M a (from KH2PO4) plus any change from dissociation. But wait, no, the initial a is 0.03672 M, and initial b is 0.028065 M. But in solution, some a can become b, and some b can become c.\n\nWait, but in the buffer solution, the main equilibria are between a and b, and between b and c.\n\nSo, the first equilibrium is H2PO4^- \u2194 HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2 = 6.2e-8).\n\nThe second equilibrium is HPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3 = 1.8e-12).\n\nAt pH 7.093, which is around pKa2, the concentration of a and b are in the ratio determined by the buffer equation.\n\nBut when we're considering the concentration of c (PO4^3-), it's determined by the second equilibrium.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to first find the ratio of a and b, then find [H+] from that, then use that [H+] to find c from the second equilibrium.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier. So, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider that the total concentration of HPO4^2- includes the initial amount plus some from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but in the buffer solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a ratio determined by the pH. So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives us the ratio of [b]/[a] = 10^(pH - pKa2) = 10^(7.093 -7.208) = 10^(-0.115) \u2248 0.7646.\n\nSo, [b] = 0.7646 [a].\n\nBut wait, the initial moles of a and b are fixed. So, perhaps I should set up the equations:\n\nTotal a + b = initial a + initial b.\n\nWait, no, because some a becomes b, and some b becomes c. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the majority of HPO4^2- remains as HPO4^2- because the pH is near pKa2, so the concentration of PO4^3- is very low. But perhaps the exact calculation is needed.\n\nLet me think about the total phosphate species.\n\nThe total phosphate in solution comes from both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nEach mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.\n\nEach mole of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, the total initial moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are 0.007344 mol and 0.005613 mol, respectively.\n\nBut in solution, these will interconvert based on the pH.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet x be the concentration of HPO4^2- that comes from H2PO4^- dissociation.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to consider the equilibrium.\n\nThe buffer solution has:\n\na = [H2PO4^-] = initial a + x - y\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the situation as a buffer solution, where the concentrations of a and b are in a certain ratio, and then find the concentration of c based on the second dissociation.\n\nIn this case, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, I found the pH as approximately 7.093, which gives [H+] as 8.08e-8 M.\n\nThen, for the dissociation of HPO4^2- to PO4^3-, I used [HPO4^2-] as 0.028065 M, which is the initial concentration.\n\nBut wait, in reality, some of the HPO4^2- would have converted to PO4^3-.\n\nSo, the actual [HPO4^2-] is lower than the initial 0.028065 M because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but in the solution, the total phosphate species would be the sum of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.\n\nBut the initial moles are 0.007344 mol H2PO4^- and 0.005613 mol HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, the total initial moles of phosphate are 0.012957 mol.\n\nBut in solution, some H2PO4^- will convert to HPO4^2-, and some HPO4^2- will convert to PO4^3-.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this with variables.\n\nLet me let the change in HPO4^2- be y. So, some of the HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.\n\nThe equilibrium for the second dissociation (HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-) is governed by Ka3.\n\nSo, at equilibrium:\n\n[HPO4^2-] = initial [HPO4^2-] - y \u2248 0.028065 - y.\n\n[PO4^3-] = y.\n\nSimilarly, the first dissociation (H2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2-) is governed by Ka2.\n\nAt equilibrium, [H2PO4^-] = initial [H2PO4^-] + y \u2248 0.03672 + y.\n\nWait, no, because when HPO4^2- dissociates, it produces PO4^3- and H+. The H+ comes from both dissociations.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps I can proceed.\n\nThe total concentration of H+ comes from both dissociations.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to consider that the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, and then calculate [PO4^3-] based on that.\n\nAlternatively, since the pH is close to pKa2, the [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.7646 times [H2PO4^-].\n\nWait, but the initial [H2PO4^-] is 0.03672 M, so [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.03672 * 0.7646 \u2248 0.028065 M, which matches the initial calculation.\n\nSo, that suggests that the initial concentrations are already in the correct ratio for the buffer. Therefore, the [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M, and [H2PO4^-] is 0.03672 M.\n\nIn that case, when considering the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-, the [HPO4^2-] used in the calculation should be the actual concentration after considering the buffer. So, I think using 0.028065 M for [HPO4^2-] is correct.\n\nSo, the calculation for [PO4^3-] is correct as before, giving approximately 6.26e-7 M, which is very close to option A's 6.24e-7.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I used the correct Ka3 value. The problem states that the Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother possible point of error is the calculation of moles. Let me double-check the moles.\n\nFor KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.\n\n136.09 g/mol is approximately 136.1 g/mol.\n\n1.00 / 136.1 = approximately 0.007344 mol.\n\nYes.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005613 mol.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the moles are correct.\n\nAnother point: the solution volume is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 L. Correct.\n\nSo, the concentrations are correctly calculated.\n\nSo, the final concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.26e-7 M, which is option A (6.24e-7).\n\nWait, but the options are A:6.24e-7, B:5.48e-7, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should recalculate the [PO4^3-] more precisely.\n\nLet me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.08e-8: 5.0517e-14 / 8.08e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 /8.08 \u2248 0.6256.\n\nSo, 0.6256e-6 = 6.256e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.26e-7 M.\n\nSo, the closest option is A:6.24e-7.\n\nBut why is there a slight discrepancy? Maybe because of more precise pH calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more exact values for the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nLet me recompute the ratio more accurately.\n\n[HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028065 / 0.03672 = 0.7646.\n\nlog(0.7646) = ?\n\nUsing a calculator (in mind), log(0.7) is -0.1549, log(0.76) is approximately -0.117.\n\nWait, more accurately, 10^(-0.115) is 0.7646.\n\nSo, pH = pKa2 + log(ratio) = 7.208 + (-0.115) = 7.093.\n\nSo, [H+] = 10^-7.093 = 8.07e-8 M.\n\nThen, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.07e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.07e-8: 5.0517e-14 /8.07e-8 = (5.0517 /8.07) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 /8.07 = 0.6256.\n\nSo, 0.6256e-6 = 6.256e-7 M.\n\nWhich is about 6.26e-7 M.\n\nSo, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So, the answer should be A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me start by reading the question carefully.\n\nSo, the problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3. That's 200 mL, right? And it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25\u00b0C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.\n\nWait, wait, orthophosphate is the conjugate base, right? So phosphate ions are PO4^3-. But how do we get that from the given substances?\n\nI remember that KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). When dissolved in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become HPO4^2-, or accept a proton to become H3PO4. So, H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion.\n\nOn the other hand, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4\u00b72H2O). When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3- or accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.\n\nSo, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. These are adjacent species in the phosphate ion's dissociation series. Because they're in the same solution, I think they'll form a buffer solution. That makes me think about the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates pH to the ratio of the concentrations of a base and its conjugate acid.\n\nWait, but the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, not HPO4^2- or H2PO4^- directly. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think again.\n\nOrthophosphate is PO4^3-. To get that, HPO4^2- must lose a proton. So, the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the dissociation of HPO4^2-.\n\nBut wait, in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So, the phosphate species present are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But at 25\u00b0C, the solution's pH will determine which species are predominant.\n\nWait, but given that we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, the solution is likely a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So, the pH is determined by the pKa2 of H3PO4, since H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.\n\nThe Ka values are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, pKa1 is log(1/(7.5e-3)) which is about 2.12, pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) which is about 7.21, and pKa3 is around 11.74.\n\nSince we're dealing with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the relevant pKa is pKa2, 7.21. So the solution's pH is around 7.21. But wait, the actual pH depends on the ratio of the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.\n\nLet me think about the buffer equation. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me recall: the acid is H2PO4^- because it can donate a proton (to become HPO4^2-), so H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So yes, the equation should be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the concentration of PO4^3-, which comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-. So, we need to find [PO4^3-].\n\nHPO4^2- can act as an acid (donate a proton) to become PO4^3- or as a base (accept a proton) to become H2PO4^-.\n\nSo, the dissociation of HPO4^2- is: HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. So, the expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].\n\nBut in the solution, the pH is determined by the buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the [H+] is related to the pH, which is around pKa2. Let's compute that first.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n\nThe solution volume is 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters.\n\nWe have 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nLet me compute the moles of each.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007344 mol.\n\nEach mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^- and one mole of K+.\n\nSimilarly, for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005613 mol.\n\nEach mole of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2- and two moles of Na+.\n\nSo, in solution, the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007344 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03672 M.\n\nThe concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028065 M.\n\nNow, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\npKa2 is log(6.2e-8) \u2192 wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is about 7.208.\n\nSo, pH = 7.208 + log(0.028065 / 0.03672)\n\nLet me calculate the ratio: 0.028065 / 0.03672 \u2248 0.7646.\n\nLog(0.7646) is approximately -0.115.\n\nSo, pH \u2248 7.208 - 0.115 \u2248 7.093.\n\nSo, pH is approximately 7.093.\n\nNow, knowing the pH, we can find the [H+] in solution.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.093) \u2248 8.27e-8 M.\n\nNow, we need to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nPO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-:\n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWe have [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.028065 M, [H+] \u2248 8.27e-8 M.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.27e-8)\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 \u2248 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.27e-8: 5.0517e-14 / 8.27e-8 \u2248 6.11e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's about 6.11e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a calculation error somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check the [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] concentrations.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007344 mol.\n\nVolume is 0.2 L, so concentration is 0.03672 M.\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005613 mol.\n\nConcentration: 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nThe ratio is 0.028065 / 0.03672 = approximately 0.7646.\n\nLog(0.7646) is about log(3/4)= -0.1249, but let me calculate it more accurately.\n\nWait, 10^(-0.115) is about 0.764, so the pH is correct.\n\nThen [H+] is 10^(-7.093) \u2192 let me compute that more accurately.\n\npH =7.093 \u2192 H+ = 1e-7.093 = 1e-7 * 1e-0.093 \u2192 1e-7 * approx 0.876 \u2192 8.76e-8 M.\n\nWait, earlier I approximated it as 8.27e-8. Hmm, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.093):\n\n7.093 = 7 + 0.093.\n\n10^(-7) is 1e-7.\n\n10^(-0.093) is approximately 10^(-0.09) \u2248 0.871, because 10^0.1 is about 1.258, so 10^-0.09 is about 1/(1.258^(0.9)) \u2192 wait, perhaps a better way is to use logarithm tables or a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute ln(10^0.093) = 0.093 * ln(10) \u2248 0.093 * 2.3026 \u2248 0.214.\n\nSo e^0.214 \u2248 1.238. So 10^0.093 = e^(ln(10^0.093)) = e^(0.214) \u2248 1.238. So 10^-0.093 \u2248 1/1.238 \u2248 0.807.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 1e-7 * 0.807 = 8.07e-8 M.\n\nSo using this more precise value, [H+] is 8.07e-8.\n\nNow, let's compute [PO4^3-]:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.07e-8.\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.\n\n5.0517e-14 / 8.07e-8 = approximately 6.26e-7.\n\nWait, 8.07e-8 is 8.07 x 10^-8.\n\nSo 5.0517e-14 / 8.07e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.07) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 / 8.07 \u2248 0.626.\n\nSo 0.626e-6 = 6.26e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.\n\nBut wait, let me check the exact calculation.\n\nWait, 5.0517e-14 divided by 8.07e-8.\n\nLet me compute 5.0517e-14 / 8.07e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.07) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 \u00f7 8.07 \u2248 0.626.\n\nSo 0.626e-6 is 6.26e-7.\n\nBut option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close, considering the approximations in the pH calculation.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe I should calculate [H+] more accurately.\n\nAnother way: the pH was calculated as 7.093. So, [H+] = 10^-7.093.\n\nCalculating 10^7.093 = 10^7 * 10^0.093.\n\n10^0.093: let's calculate it more precisely.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series or logarithm tables. Alternatively, using a calculator approach.\n\nBut since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can remember that log(1.23) is about 0.0899.\n\nWait, let me think: 10^0.09 is approximately 1.23.\n\nWait, 10^0.09 \u2192 take natural logs: ln(10^0.09) = 0.09 * ln(10) \u2248 0.09 * 2.3026 \u2248 0.2072.\n\ne^0.2072 \u2248 1.229. So, 10^0.09 \u2248 1.229.\n\nSo 10^-0.09 \u2248 1/1.229 \u2248 0.813.\n\nSo, 10^-7.093 = 10^(-7) * 10^-0.093.\n\nWait, 0.093 is a bit more than 0.09. Let's approximate 10^-0.093 \u2248 10^(-0.09 -0.003) = 10^-0.09 * 10^-0.003.\n\nWe have 10^-0.09 \u2248 0.813.\n\n10^-0.003: ln(10^-0.003) = -0.003 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.006908. So e^-0.006908 \u2248 1 - 0.006908 \u2248 0.9931.\n\nSo, 10^-0.003 \u2248 0.9931.\n\nSo, 10^-0.093 \u2248 0.813 * 0.9931 \u2248 0.808.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 1e-7 * 0.808 = 8.08e-8 M.\n\nSo, using this more accurate [H+], let's recalculate [PO4^3-].\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.08e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.08e-8.\n\n5.0517e-14 / 8.08e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 / 8.08 \u2248 0.6256.\n\nSo, 0.6256e-6 = 6.256e-7 M.\n\nThat's approximately 6.26e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: when we have a solution with both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the actual concentration of HPO4^2- isn't just the moles from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, because H2PO4^- can deprotonate to form HPO4^2- and vice versa, depending on the pH. But in this case, the pH is close to pKa2, so the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a ratio of about 1.3:1, which is what we used in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nBut when calculating [PO4^3-], we need to consider the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution, which is influenced by the buffer. Wait, but in the calculation, I used the initial concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, no, the buffer equation gives the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] as 0.7646, which we used to calculate pH. But when calculating [PO4^3-], we used [HPO4^2-] as 0.028065 M, which is the initial concentration. But in reality, the actual [HPO4^2-] is higher because some of the H2PO4^- has deprotonated to become HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, this might be a point where I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial moles of H2PO4^- are from KH2PO4: 0.007344 mol.\n\nThe initial moles of HPO4^2- are from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 0.005613 mol.\n\nBut in solution, some of the H2PO4^- will deprotonate to form HPO4^2-, and some of the HPO4^2- will deprotonate to form PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but the buffer system is mainly between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the concentrations are adjusted based on the pH. So, the total concentration of phosphate species (H2PO4^- + HPO4^2-) is the sum of the initial moles of both, but their individual concentrations change based on pH.\n\nWait, no. Because the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- initially, their concentrations are fixed by their amounts, but the pH will determine how much each is present.\n\nWait, actually, the buffer equation tells us that the ratio of their concentrations determines the pH. So, the concentrations [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] are in a specific ratio based on the pH.\n\nBut when calculating the [PO4^3-], I used the actual concentration of HPO4^2- as per the initial moles, which might not be correct. Because some of HPO4^2- would have further deprotonated into PO4^3-.\n\nWait, so perhaps I need to model this more accurately.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet [H2PO4^-] = a\n\n[HPO4^2-] = b\n\n[PO4^3-] = c\n\nWe know that the solution contains 0.03672 M a (from KH2PO4) plus any change from dissociation. But wait, no, the initial a is 0.03672 M, and initial b is 0.028065 M. But in solution, some a can become b, and some b can become c.\n\nWait, but in the buffer solution, the main equilibria are between a and b, and between b and c.\n\nSo, the first equilibrium is H2PO4^- \u2194 HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2 = 6.2e-8).\n\nThe second equilibrium is HPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3 = 1.8e-12).\n\nAt pH 7.093, which is around pKa2, the concentration of a and b are in the ratio determined by the buffer equation.\n\nBut when we're considering the concentration of c (PO4^3-), it's determined by the second equilibrium.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to first find the ratio of a and b, then find [H+] from that, then use that [H+] to find c from the second equilibrium.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier. So, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider that the total concentration of HPO4^2- includes the initial amount plus some from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but in the buffer solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a ratio determined by the pH. So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives us the ratio of [b]/[a] = 10^(pH - pKa2) = 10^(7.093 -7.208) = 10^(-0.115) \u2248 0.7646.\n\nSo, [b] = 0.7646 [a].\n\nBut wait, the initial moles of a and b are fixed. So, perhaps I should set up the equations:\n\nTotal a + b = initial a + initial b.\n\nWait, no, because some a becomes b, and some b becomes c. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the majority of HPO4^2- remains as HPO4^2- because the pH is near pKa2, so the concentration of PO4^3- is very low. But perhaps the exact calculation is needed.\n\nLet me think about the total phosphate species.\n\nThe total phosphate in solution comes from both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nEach mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.\n\nEach mole of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, the total initial moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are 0.007344 mol and 0.005613 mol, respectively.\n\nBut in solution, these will interconvert based on the pH.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet x be the concentration of HPO4^2- that comes from H2PO4^- dissociation.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to consider the equilibrium.\n\nThe buffer solution has:\n\na = [H2PO4^-] = initial a + x - y\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the situation as a buffer solution, where the concentrations of a and b are in a certain ratio, and then find the concentration of c based on the second dissociation.\n\nIn this case, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, I found the pH as approximately 7.093, which gives [H+] as 8.08e-8 M.\n\nThen, for the dissociation of HPO4^2- to PO4^3-, I used [HPO4^2-] as 0.028065 M, which is the initial concentration.\n\nBut wait, in reality, some of the HPO4^2- would have converted to PO4^3-.\n\nSo, the actual [HPO4^2-] is lower than the initial 0.028065 M because some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but in the solution, the total phosphate species would be the sum of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.\n\nBut the initial moles are 0.007344 mol H2PO4^- and 0.005613 mol HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, the total initial moles of phosphate are 0.012957 mol.\n\nBut in solution, some H2PO4^- will convert to HPO4^2-, and some HPO4^2- will convert to PO4^3-.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this with variables.\n\nLet me let the change in HPO4^2- be y. So, some of the HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.\n\nThe equilibrium for the second dissociation (HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-) is governed by Ka3.\n\nSo, at equilibrium:\n\n[HPO4^2-] = initial [HPO4^2-] - y \u2248 0.028065 - y.\n\n[PO4^3-] = y.\n\nSimilarly, the first dissociation (H2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2-) is governed by Ka2.\n\nAt equilibrium, [H2PO4^-] = initial [H2PO4^-] + y \u2248 0.03672 + y.\n\nWait, no, because when HPO4^2- dissociates, it produces PO4^3- and H+. The H+ comes from both dissociations.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps I can proceed.\n\nThe total concentration of H+ comes from both dissociations.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to consider that the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, and then calculate [PO4^3-] based on that.\n\nAlternatively, since the pH is close to pKa2, the [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.7646 times [H2PO4^-].\n\nWait, but the initial [H2PO4^-] is 0.03672 M, so [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.03672 * 0.7646 \u2248 0.028065 M, which matches the initial calculation.\n\nSo, that suggests that the initial concentrations are already in the correct ratio for the buffer. Therefore, the [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M, and [H2PO4^-] is 0.03672 M.\n\nIn that case, when considering the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-, the [HPO4^2-] used in the calculation should be the actual concentration after considering the buffer. So, I think using 0.028065 M for [HPO4^2-] is correct.\n\nSo, the calculation for [PO4^3-] is correct as before, giving approximately 6.26e-7 M, which is very close to option A's 6.24e-7.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I used the correct Ka3 value. The problem states that the Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother possible point of error is the calculation of moles. Let me double-check the moles.\n\nFor KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.\n\n136.09 g/mol is approximately 136.1 g/mol.\n\n1.00 / 136.1 = approximately 0.007344 mol.\n\nYes.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005613 mol.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the moles are correct.\n\nAnother point: the solution volume is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 L. Correct.\n\nSo, the concentrations are correctly calculated.\n\nSo, the final concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.26e-7 M, which is option A (6.24e-7).\n\nWait, but the options are A:6.24e-7, B:5.48e-7, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should recalculate the [PO4^3-] more precisely.\n\nLet me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.08e-8: 5.0517e-14 / 8.08e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 /8.08 \u2248 0.6256.\n\nSo, 0.6256e-6 = 6.256e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.26e-7 M.\n\nSo, the closest option is A:6.24e-7.\n\nBut why is there a slight discrepancy? Maybe because of more precise pH calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use more exact values for the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nLet me recompute the ratio more accurately.\n\n[HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028065 / 0.03672 = 0.7646.\n\nlog(0.7646) = ?\n\nUsing a calculator (in mind), log(0.7) is -0.1549, log(0.76) is approximately -0.117.\n\nWait, more accurately, 10^(-0.115) is 0.7646.\n\nSo, pH = pKa2 + log(ratio) = 7.208 + (-0.115) = 7.093.\n\nSo, [H+] = 10^-7.093 = 8.07e-8 M.\n\nThen, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.07e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.07e-8: 5.0517e-14 /8.07e-8 = (5.0517 /8.07) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 /8.07 = 0.6256.\n\nSo, 0.6256e-6 = 6.256e-7 M.\n\nWhich is about 6.26e-7 M.\n\nSo, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So, the answer should be A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the buffer system formed by KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and ion concentrations, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.\n\nThe problem says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3 (which is 200 mL or 0.2 liters). In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25\u00b0C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?), but wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4. Wait, no, the ions are different. Hmm, orthophosphate ions\u2014maybe they refer to HPO4^2-? Or PO4^3-? I think in this context, since we're dealing with the dissociation of H3PO4, the orthophosphate ion would be PO4^3-, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the ortho might refer to HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, H3PO4 can lose three protons: H3PO4 \u2192 H+ + H2PO4^-; H2PO4^- \u2192 H+ + HPO4^2-; HPO4^2- \u2192 H+ + PO4^3-. So the species present here would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and maybe some PO4^3- if the solution is very basic. But in the given problem, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. \n\nKH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, so when dissolved, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, which when dissolved, gives Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's more likely that the ions are the various deprotonated forms. So perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Or is it about the sum of all phosphate species?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-? Because orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, so the conjugate base would be H2PO4^-, then HPO4^2-, then PO4^3-.\n\nWait, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-. Or maybe the question is referring to the concentration of all phosphate species, but that seems unlikely. The problem states \"orthophosphate ions\", which I think refers to PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but in a solution containing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are the two main species here, what's the concentration of orthophosphate ions? Maybe the term \"orthophosphate\" is a bit ambiguous here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed, and see where the problem leads. \n\nSo, the solution contains two components: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Let's compute the moles of each.\n\nFirst, moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight is 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007344 mol.\n\nSimilarly, moles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005613 mol.\n\nWait, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: the formula is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. So when it dissolves, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- and 2 H2O. So each mole of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, in solution, the moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 will be 0.007344 mol, and moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4 will be 0.005613 mol.\n\nWait, but the total solution is 200 mL (0.2 L). So concentrations would be:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007344 / 0.2 = 0.03672 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.\n\nWait, but wait. Are there any other sources of phosphate ions? Well, perhaps some dissociation occurs. But given that H3PO4 is a weak acid, and the solution is a buffer solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nBut the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but if it's deprotonated, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps \"orthophosphate ions\" refers to HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.\n\nWait, another approach: the problem gives the Ka values for H3PO4. So maybe I should consider the buffer solution and use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nThe buffer is made of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but H2PO4^- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (gaining a proton to become H3PO4). But in this case, the main buffer system is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2-) would use the Ka2 value. Because H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.\n\nSo the pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson equation, which would help in finding the concentration of HPO4^2- or H2PO4^- if needed. But the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I'm not sure about.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions, which is what I calculated earlier as 0.028065 M. But wait, that's only the initial concentration. Because the solution is a buffer, the actual concentrations may shift based on the pH. So perhaps I need to calculate the pH first, then find the concentration of HPO4^2- or PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial concentrations are H2PO4^- = 0.03672 M and HPO4^2- = 0.028065 M. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\npKa2 is the negative log of Ka2. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = log(1/6.2) + 7.8 (since 1e-7 is pH7, 6.2e-8 is 7.2 something). Let me calculate it precisely.\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8 \u2192 pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = approximately 7.208.\n\nSo, pH = 7.208 + log(0.028065 / 0.03672). Let me compute that ratio.\n\n0.028065 / 0.03672 \u2248 0.764. Log(0.764) \u2248 -0.115.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.208 -0.115 \u2248 7.093.\n\nSo the solution has a pH around 7.09.\n\nNow, what's the concentration of orthophosphate ions? If orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, then in the buffer solution, the concentration of HPO4^2- would be determined by the Henderson equation, but wait, isn't that already considered when calculating the pH?\n\nWait, no. The initial concentrations are the ones before considering any dissociation. But in reality, some of the H2PO4^- may dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+.\n\nBut wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation already takes that into account. Because when you have a buffer, the ratio of conjugate base to acid is equal to 10^(pH - pKa). So in this case, the pH is 7.093, which is close to pKa2 of 7.208, so the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is about 10^(7.093 - 7.208) = 10^(-0.115) \u2248 0.764, which is what we had before. So the actual concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are in that ratio, but their sum is the sum of the initial moles.\n\nWait, but wait. The total concentration of phosphate species is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [H3PO4] + [PO4^3-]. But in this solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, with H3PO4 and PO4^3- being negligible because H3PO4 is a weak acid and PO4^3- is a very weak base.\n\nSo the initial concentrations are:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.03672 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M.\n\nBut because the solution is a buffer, some H2PO4^- will dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+ (but since we've already accounted for that in the buffer equation, perhaps the concentrations are as they are.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem is simply to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-, then perhaps we need to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because in the solution, with pH around 7.09, which is slightly acidic, the PO4^3- concentration would be very low because it's the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, and the solution is not very basic.\n\nBut let's see. The third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So pKa3 is about 11.74.\n\nSo, for the third dissociation, the equilibrium is:\n\n[HPO4^2-] * Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-].\n\nBut since the solution's pH is ~7.09, [H+] is 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.23e-8 M.\n\nSo, rearranging for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nBut wait, no. The formula is [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nPlugging the numbers:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M.\n\n[H+] = 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.23e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.23e-8.\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 \u2248 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.23e-8: 5.0517e-14 / 8.23e-8 \u2248 6.136e-7 M.\n\nWait, so that's approximately 6.14e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the numbers more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute [H+]: pH is 7.093, so [H+] = 10^-7.093.\n\n10^0.093 is about 1.24 (since 10^0.1 \u2248 1.258, so 0.093 is a bit less, say ~1.23).\n\nSo 10^-7.093 = 10^(-7 -0.093) = 10^-7 * 10^-0.093 \u2248 1e-7 * 0.83 \u2248 8.3e-8 M.\n\nWait, more accurately: 10^(-0.093) = 1 / 10^(0.093).\n\nCompute 0.093 * ln(10) \u2248 0.093 * 2.3026 \u2248 0.214.\n\ne^0.214 \u2248 1.238, so 1/1.238 \u2248 0.807.\n\nSo 10^-0.093 \u2248 0.807.\n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.807 \u2248 8.07e-8 M.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.07e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = let's compute 1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517, so 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.07e-8: 5.0517e-14 / 8.07e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.07) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 /8.07 \u2248 0.626.\n\nSo 0.626e-6 = 6.26e-7 M.\n\nHmm, that's 6.26e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7 M), but wait, let me check the exact numbers again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact moles and volume.\n\nWait, the initial moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005613 mol in 0.2 L, so 0.028065 M.\n\nBut wait, the buffer solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but when we calculate the [H+], we can use the Henderson equation.\n\nWait, let me recompute the pH using exact values.\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\npKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) = let's compute that accurately.\n\nlog(6.2) = 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076.\n\npKa2 = 7.2076.\n\nSo the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is (0.028065)/(0.03672) = 0.7642.\n\nlog(0.7642) = approximately -0.115.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 - 0.115 = 7.0926.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^-7.0926.\n\nLet me compute 10^-7.0926 exactly.\n\nWait, 10^0.0926 = ?\n\nWait, 10^0.09 is approximately 1.23, 10^0.0926 is a bit higher. Let me use natural logarithm:\n\nln(10^x) = x * ln(10), so 10^x = e^(x ln 10).\n\nx = 0.0926 \u2192 x ln10 \u2248 0.0926 * 2.302585 \u2248 0.213.\n\ne^0.213 \u2248 1.237.\n\nSo 10^0.0926 \u2248 1.237, so 10^-0.0926 \u2248 0.808.\n\nThus, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.808 \u2248 8.08e-8 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.08e-8).\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.08e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = 5.0517e-14 / 8.08e-8 = (5.0517 /8.08 ) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 /8.08 \u2248 0.6256.\n\nSo 0.6256e-6 \u2192 6.256e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.26e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. Close enough considering rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which species contributes to orthophosphate. Because in the solution, the majority of phosphate is as H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-, is present in very low concentration.\n\nSo the answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB) 5.48x10^-7 M \n\nC) 2.81x10^-7 M\n\nD) 3.97x10^-7 M \n\nSo 6.24e-7 is the closest to our calculation of 6.26e-7.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute [PO4^3-] more accurately.\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M.\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[H+] = 8.08e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.08e-8.\n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = let's compute 1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517, so 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.08e-8.\n\nSo 5.0517e-14 / 8.08e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 / 8.08 = let's compute that.\n\n8.08 * 0.625 = 5.05, because 8 *0.625=5, 0.08*0.625=0.05, so 5.05. So 5.0517 is 0.0017 more than 5.05.\n\nSo 0.625 + (0.0017 /8.08) \u2248 0.625 + 0.00021 \u2248 0.6252.\n\nSo 0.6252 * 1e-6 = 6.252e-7 M.\n\nWhich rounds to 6.25e-7 M. The option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider the exact value of [HPO4^2-]. Let me recalculate the exact moles.\n\nMolar mass of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005613 mol.\n\nSo [HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 L = 0.028065 M.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.25e-7 M, so the correct option is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and ion concentrations, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.\n\nThe problem says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3 (which is 200 mL or 0.2 liters). In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25\u00b0C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?), but wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4. Wait, no, the ions are different. Hmm, orthophosphate ions\u2014maybe they refer to HPO4^2-? Or PO4^3-? I think in this context, since we're dealing with the dissociation of H3PO4, the orthophosphate ion would be PO4^3-, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the ortho might refer to HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, H3PO4 can lose three protons: H3PO4 \u2192 H+ + H2PO4^-; H2PO4^- \u2192 H+ + HPO4^2-; HPO4^2- \u2192 H+ + PO4^3-. So the species present here would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and maybe some PO4^3- if the solution is very basic. But in the given problem, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. \n\nKH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, so when dissolved, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, which when dissolved, gives Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's more likely that the ions are the various deprotonated forms. So perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Or is it about the sum of all phosphate species?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-? Because orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, so the conjugate base would be H2PO4^-, then HPO4^2-, then PO4^3-.\n\nWait, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-. Or maybe the question is referring to the concentration of all phosphate species, but that seems unlikely. The problem states \"orthophosphate ions\", which I think refers to PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but in a solution containing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are the two main species here, what's the concentration of orthophosphate ions? Maybe the term \"orthophosphate\" is a bit ambiguous here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed, and see where the problem leads. \n\nSo, the solution contains two components: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Let's compute the moles of each.\n\nFirst, moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight is 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007344 mol.\n\nSimilarly, moles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005613 mol.\n\nWait, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: the formula is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. So when it dissolves, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- and 2 H2O. So each mole of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, in solution, the moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 will be 0.007344 mol, and moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4 will be 0.005613 mol.\n\nWait, but the total solution is 200 mL (0.2 L). So concentrations would be:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007344 / 0.2 = 0.03672 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.\n\nWait, but wait. Are there any other sources of phosphate ions? Well, perhaps some dissociation occurs. But given that H3PO4 is a weak acid, and the solution is a buffer solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nBut the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but if it's deprotonated, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps \"orthophosphate ions\" refers to HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.\n\nWait, another approach: the problem gives the Ka values for H3PO4. So maybe I should consider the buffer solution and use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nThe buffer is made of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but H2PO4^- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (gaining a proton to become H3PO4). But in this case, the main buffer system is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2-) would use the Ka2 value. Because H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.\n\nSo the pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson equation, which would help in finding the concentration of HPO4^2- or H2PO4^- if needed. But the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I'm not sure about.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions, which is what I calculated earlier as 0.028065 M. But wait, that's only the initial concentration. Because the solution is a buffer, the actual concentrations may shift based on the pH. So perhaps I need to calculate the pH first, then find the concentration of HPO4^2- or PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial concentrations are H2PO4^- = 0.03672 M and HPO4^2- = 0.028065 M. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\npKa2 is the negative log of Ka2. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = log(1/6.2) + 7.8 (since 1e-7 is pH7, 6.2e-8 is 7.2 something). Let me calculate it precisely.\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8 \u2192 pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = approximately 7.208.\n\nSo, pH = 7.208 + log(0.028065 / 0.03672). Let me compute that ratio.\n\n0.028065 / 0.03672 \u2248 0.764. Log(0.764) \u2248 -0.115.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.208 -0.115 \u2248 7.093.\n\nSo the solution has a pH around 7.09.\n\nNow, what's the concentration of orthophosphate ions? If orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, then in the buffer solution, the concentration of HPO4^2- would be determined by the Henderson equation, but wait, isn't that already considered when calculating the pH?\n\nWait, no. The initial concentrations are the ones before considering any dissociation. But in reality, some of the H2PO4^- may dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+.\n\nBut wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation already takes that into account. Because when you have a buffer, the ratio of conjugate base to acid is equal to 10^(pH - pKa). So in this case, the pH is 7.093, which is close to pKa2 of 7.208, so the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is about 10^(7.093 - 7.208) = 10^(-0.115) \u2248 0.764, which is what we had before. So the actual concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are in that ratio, but their sum is the sum of the initial moles.\n\nWait, but wait. The total concentration of phosphate species is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [H3PO4] + [PO4^3-]. But in this solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, with H3PO4 and PO4^3- being negligible because H3PO4 is a weak acid and PO4^3- is a very weak base.\n\nSo the initial concentrations are:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.03672 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M.\n\nBut because the solution is a buffer, some H2PO4^- will dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+ (but since we've already accounted for that in the buffer equation, perhaps the concentrations are as they are.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem is simply to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-, then perhaps we need to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because in the solution, with pH around 7.09, which is slightly acidic, the PO4^3- concentration would be very low because it's the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, and the solution is not very basic.\n\nBut let's see. The third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So pKa3 is about 11.74.\n\nSo, for the third dissociation, the equilibrium is:\n\n[HPO4^2-] * Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-].\n\nBut since the solution's pH is ~7.09, [H+] is 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.23e-8 M.\n\nSo, rearranging for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nBut wait, no. The formula is [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nPlugging the numbers:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M.\n\n[H+] = 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.23e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.23e-8.\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 \u2248 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.23e-8: 5.0517e-14 / 8.23e-8 \u2248 6.136e-7 M.\n\nWait, so that's approximately 6.14e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the numbers more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute [H+]: pH is 7.093, so [H+] = 10^-7.093.\n\n10^0.093 is about 1.24 (since 10^0.1 \u2248 1.258, so 0.093 is a bit less, say ~1.23).\n\nSo 10^-7.093 = 10^(-7 -0.093) = 10^-7 * 10^-0.093 \u2248 1e-7 * 0.83 \u2248 8.3e-8 M.\n\nWait, more accurately: 10^(-0.093) = 1 / 10^(0.093).\n\nCompute 0.093 * ln(10) \u2248 0.093 * 2.3026 \u2248 0.214.\n\ne^0.214 \u2248 1.238, so 1/1.238 \u2248 0.807.\n\nSo 10^-0.093 \u2248 0.807.\n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.807 \u2248 8.07e-8 M.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.07e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = let's compute 1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517, so 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.07e-8: 5.0517e-14 / 8.07e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.07) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 /8.07 \u2248 0.626.\n\nSo 0.626e-6 = 6.26e-7 M.\n\nHmm, that's 6.26e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7 M), but wait, let me check the exact numbers again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact moles and volume.\n\nWait, the initial moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005613 mol in 0.2 L, so 0.028065 M.\n\nBut wait, the buffer solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but when we calculate the [H+], we can use the Henderson equation.\n\nWait, let me recompute the pH using exact values.\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\npKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) = let's compute that accurately.\n\nlog(6.2) = 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076.\n\npKa2 = 7.2076.\n\nSo the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is (0.028065)/(0.03672) = 0.7642.\n\nlog(0.7642) = approximately -0.115.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 - 0.115 = 7.0926.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^-7.0926.\n\nLet me compute 10^-7.0926 exactly.\n\nWait, 10^0.0926 = ?\n\nWait, 10^0.09 is approximately 1.23, 10^0.0926 is a bit higher. Let me use natural logarithm:\n\nln(10^x) = x * ln(10), so 10^x = e^(x ln 10).\n\nx = 0.0926 \u2192 x ln10 \u2248 0.0926 * 2.302585 \u2248 0.213.\n\ne^0.213 \u2248 1.237.\n\nSo 10^0.0926 \u2248 1.237, so 10^-0.0926 \u2248 0.808.\n\nThus, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.808 \u2248 8.08e-8 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.08e-8).\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.08e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = 5.0517e-14 / 8.08e-8 = (5.0517 /8.08 ) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 /8.08 \u2248 0.6256.\n\nSo 0.6256e-6 \u2192 6.256e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.26e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. Close enough considering rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which species contributes to orthophosphate. Because in the solution, the majority of phosphate is as H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-, is present in very low concentration.\n\nSo the answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB) 5.48x10^-7 M \n\nC) 2.81x10^-7 M\n\nD) 3.97x10^-7 M \n\nSo 6.24e-7 is the closest to our calculation of 6.26e-7.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute [PO4^3-] more accurately.\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M.\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[H+] = 8.08e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.08e-8.\n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = let's compute 1.8 * 0.028065 = 0.050517, so 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.08e-8.\n\nSo 5.0517e-14 / 8.08e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.08) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0517 / 8.08 = let's compute that.\n\n8.08 * 0.625 = 5.05, because 8 *0.625=5, 0.08*0.625=0.05, so 5.05. So 5.0517 is 0.0017 more than 5.05.\n\nSo 0.625 + (0.0017 /8.08) \u2248 0.625 + 0.00021 \u2248 0.6252.\n\nSo 0.6252 * 1e-6 = 6.252e-7 M.\n\nWhich rounds to 6.25e-7 M. The option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider the exact value of [HPO4^2-]. Let me recalculate the exact moles.\n\nMolar mass of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005613 mol.\n\nSo [HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 L = 0.028065 M.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.25e-7 M, so the correct option is A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound, with molecular weights 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The temperature is 25\u00b0C. The Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.\n\nHmm, I remember that orthophosphate ion is PO4^3- right? So I need to find [PO4^3-] in the solution.\n\nWait, but I think this has to do with the phosphate buffer system. Because we have two different phosphate salts. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think is H2PO4^- when dissolved. And Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which I think gives HPO4^2- when dissolved. So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nOh wait, but orthophosphate is the PO4^3- form. Hmm. So maybe the solution involves some kind of equilibrium between these ions.\n\nI think the phosphate buffer system involves HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- because those are the two adjacent species in the dissociation steps. So the presence of both would mean that the solution is a buffer, and perhaps the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used here.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-, which is another step. Let me think about the dissociation steps of H3PO4.\n\nH3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps:\n\n1. H3PO4 \u2194 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)\n2. H2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)\n3. HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)\n\nSo each step releases a proton and the next ion.\n\nIn the solution, we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Let me figure out what each contributes.\n\nKH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2(HPO4)\u00b72H2O, so each formula unit gives one HPO4^2- ion).\n\nSo in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nI think the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH would be determined by their concentrations and the Ka2 value.\n\nWait, but the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the next deprotonated form. So maybe I need to consider the third dissociation step, which is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3=1.8e-12.\n\nBut wait, if the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH would be around the pKa2 of H3PO4. Let me calculate that. pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) which is approximately 7.207. So the solution should be near pH 7.2.\n\nBut the question is about PO4^3-, which is the product of the third dissociation. Since Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), the concentration of PO4^3- should be very low. Because at pH 7.2, which is much lower than the pKa3 (which is about 11.2, since pKa3 = log(1.8e-12) is around 11.26), the third deprotonation is not favorable. So PO4^3- would be minimal.\n\nWait, but how much exactly? Let's think about the approach.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n\nMolarity is moles divided by volume in liters.\n\nSo for KH2PO4:\n\nMolar mass = 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007346 mol.\n\nSame for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\n\nMolar mass = 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005612 mol.\n\nSo the solution has:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03673 M\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005612 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02806 M\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula for KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^-, so each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-.\n\nSimilarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2- per mole of the salt.\n\nSo yes, the concentrations are as above.\n\nNow, since these two are present in solution, they form a buffer. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nThe relevant Ka is Ka2 (6.2e-8) because the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nSo pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.207.\n\nSo pH = 7.207 + log(0.02806 / 0.03673)\n\nCalculating the ratio: 0.02806 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.765.\n\nLog(0.765) is approximately -0.115.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.207 - 0.115 \u2248 7.092.\n\nWait, that's the pH. Now, I need to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nPO4^3- comes from the third dissociation step: HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so the extent of this reaction is very low.\n\nThe concentration of PO4^3- would depend on the concentration of HPO4^2- and the H+ concentration, which is determined by the pH.\n\nSo, using the third dissociation:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nBut [H+] can be found from pH. pH is 7.092, so [H+] = 10^(-7.092) \u2248 8.25e-8 M.\n\nWait, let me compute that accurately.\n\npH = 7.092 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.092) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092) \u2248 1e-7 * 0.86 \u2248 8.6e-8 M.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 10^-0.092.\n\n0.092 is approximately 0.09.\n\n10^(-0.09) is about 0.812.\n\nSo 10^(-7.092) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.092) \u2248 8.6e-8 M.\n\nWait, actually, 0.092 is 0.092.\n\nLet me use logarithm tables or calculator-like thinking.\n\nLog(8.6e-8) is -7.075. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that [H+] is approximately 8.6e-8 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nPlugging the numbers in:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M.\n\n[H+] is 8.6e-8 M.\n\nSo:\n\n(1.8e-12) * 0.02806 / 8.6e-8.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 \u2248 5.05e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.6e-8.\n\nSo 5.05e-14 / 8.6e-8 = (5.05 /8.6) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.587 * 1e-6 = 5.87e-7 M.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, 1.8e-12 multiplied by 0.02806:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = (1.8 * 0.02806) e-12 \u2248 0.050508e-12 = 5.0508e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.6e-8:\n\n5.0508e-14 /8.6e-8 = (5.0508 /8.6) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0508 /8.6 \u2248 0.587.\n\nSo 0.587e-6 = 5.87e-7 M.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the choices are around 6e-7, 5.48e-7, 2.8e-7, etc.\n\nSo 5.87e-7 is close to option A (6.24e-7) or option B (5.48e-7).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the [H+] calculation.\n\nWait, the pH was 7.092, so [H+] is 10^(-7.092).\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.092) more accurately.\n\n10^(-7.092) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092).\n\nCompute 10^(-0.092): \n\nWe can use the approximation that ln(10^x) = x ln(10). Or perhaps using the Taylor series for log.\n\nAlternatively, remember that 10^0.09 \u2248 1.23, so 10^(-0.09) \u2248 0.812.\n\nBut 0.092 is a bit more, so let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing natural logarithm: ln(10^0.092) = 0.092 * ln(10) \u2248 0.092 * 2.3026 \u2248 0.2117.\n\nSo e^0.2117 \u2248 1.235.\n\nSo 10^0.092 \u2248 1.235, so 10^(-0.092) \u2248 1 /1.235 \u2248 0.810.\n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.810 \u2248 8.1e-8 M.\n\nWait, that's more precise. So let's recalculate:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.1e-8)\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02806 = approx 5.05e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.1e-8.\n\nSo 5.05e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.05/8.1) * 1e-6.\n\n5.05 \u00f78.1 \u2248 0.623.\n\nSo 0.623e-6 = 6.23e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's about 6.23e-7, which is very close to option A, which is 6.24e-7 M.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I account for all the moles correctly?\n\nWait, the solution volume is 0.2 liters, right?\n\nSo moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 1g /136.09g/mol \u2248 0.007346 mol. So concentration is 0.03673 M.\n\nMoles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1g /177.99g/mol \u2248 0.005612 mol. So concentration is 0.02806 M.\n\nSo the calculations of their concentrations are correct.\n\nWait, but wait: When you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, does the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- affect each other's concentration? Because they might form some H3PO4 or PO4^3-.\n\nBut since the pH is around 7.09, which is below the pKa3 of about 11.26, the third dissociation is not favored. So the majority of HPO4^2- remains as HPO4^2-, and only a tiny amount converts to PO4^3-.\n\nSo our calculation for [PO4^3-] is correct.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 6.23e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7). But looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is a bit lower. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the steps.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compute [H+] precisely.\n\npH = 7.092.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.092) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092).\n\nCompute 10^(-0.092):\n\nWe can use the Taylor expansion for 10^x around x=0.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to use logarithm tables or known values.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator-like approach.\n\nWait, 10^0.092 is approximately 1.235, as I thought before. So 10^(-0.092) is 1/1.235 \u2248 0.810.\n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.810 = 8.1e-8 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.1e-8)\n\nCalculating numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.1e-8.\n\nSo 5.0508e-14 / 8.1e-8 = (5.0508 / 8.1) )e-6.\n\n5.0508 \u00f78.1 \u2248 0.6235.\n\nSo 0.6235e-6 = 6.235e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.24e-7 M. That's option A.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me think again. The problem states that the solution contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nSo each contributes a certain number of moles. But when they are dissolved in solution, they can react with each other. For example, H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can react to form H3PO4 and PO4^3-.\n\nBut wait, the reaction between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is: H2PO4^- + HPO4^2- \u2194 2 H2O + H3PO4 + PO4^3- ?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the phosphate species can undergo further reactions, but I think that the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because they're the ones present in the solution. The other species (H3PO4 and PO4^3-) are in much lower concentrations.\n\nBut in this case, since the solution is buffered, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by their initial amounts, with the pH adjusted by the buffer.\n\nSo the approach I took before is correct.\n\nHmm, but looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7 M, which is roughly half of 6.2e-7.\n\nIs there a mistake in the calculation? Let me recompute the numbers.\n\nWait, moles of HPO4^2-: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.\n\n177.99 is approximately 178 g/mol. So 1/178 \u2248 0.005618 mol.\n\nSo 0.005618 mol in 0.2 L is 0.02809 M.\n\nSimilarly, KH2PO4: 1g/136.09 \u2248 0.007346 mol \u2192 0.03673 M.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nWhich is 7.207 + log(0.02809/0.03673) = 7.207 + log(0.765).\n\nLog(0.765) is about -0.115.\n\nSo pH = 7.092.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^-7.092 \u2248 8.1e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.1e-8) = ?\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 5.056e-14.\n\n5.056e-14 / 8.1e-8 = 5.056 /8.1 = approximately 0.6242, so 0.6242e-6 \u2192 6.242e-7 M.\n\nWhich is 6.24e-7 M. So option A is 6.24e-7, which matches.\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB) 5.48x10^-7 M \n\nC) 2.81x10^-7 M\n\nD) 3.97x10^-7 M \n\nSo the correct answer would be A.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait another thing. I think I forgot that the solution is a buffer, and the actual concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- might not be exactly what I calculated because they might react with each other to form H3PO4 or PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the buffer equation assumes that the concentrations are as they are, and the pH is determined by them. The reaction between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would be minimal because the buffer system is in equilibrium.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the orthophosphate (PO4^3-) comes from both the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- through their respective dissociations. But that's not the case because both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can donate a proton to form PO4^3- only via the third dissociation.\n\nWait, no. H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, which can then donate another to become PO4^3-.\n\nBut in the solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, the approach should be correct.\n\nHmm. I think the correct answer is A) 6.24e-7 M.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The temperature is 25\u00b0C. The Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.\n\nHmm, I remember that orthophosphate ion is PO4^3- right? So I need to find [PO4^3-] in the solution.\n\nWait, but I think this has to do with the phosphate buffer system. Because we have two different phosphate salts. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think is H2PO4^- when dissolved. And Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which I think gives HPO4^2- when dissolved. So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nOh wait, but orthophosphate is the PO4^3- form. Hmm. So maybe the solution involves some kind of equilibrium between these ions.\n\nI think the phosphate buffer system involves HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- because those are the two adjacent species in the dissociation steps. So the presence of both would mean that the solution is a buffer, and perhaps the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used here.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-, which is another step. Let me think about the dissociation steps of H3PO4.\n\nH3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps:\n\n1. H3PO4 \u2194 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)\n2. H2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)\n3. HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)\n\nSo each step releases a proton and the next ion.\n\nIn the solution, we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Let me figure out what each contributes.\n\nKH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2(HPO4)\u00b72H2O, so each formula unit gives one HPO4^2- ion).\n\nSo in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nI think the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH would be determined by their concentrations and the Ka2 value.\n\nWait, but the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the next deprotonated form. So maybe I need to consider the third dissociation step, which is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3=1.8e-12.\n\nBut wait, if the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH would be around the pKa2 of H3PO4. Let me calculate that. pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) which is approximately 7.207. So the solution should be near pH 7.2.\n\nBut the question is about PO4^3-, which is the product of the third dissociation. Since Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), the concentration of PO4^3- should be very low. Because at pH 7.2, which is much lower than the pKa3 (which is about 11.2, since pKa3 = log(1.8e-12) is around 11.26), the third deprotonation is not favorable. So PO4^3- would be minimal.\n\nWait, but how much exactly? Let's think about the approach.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n\nMolarity is moles divided by volume in liters.\n\nSo for KH2PO4:\n\nMolar mass = 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007346 mol.\n\nSame for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\n\nMolar mass = 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005612 mol.\n\nSo the solution has:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03673 M\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005612 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02806 M\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula for KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^-, so each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-.\n\nSimilarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2- per mole of the salt.\n\nSo yes, the concentrations are as above.\n\nNow, since these two are present in solution, they form a buffer. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nThe relevant Ka is Ka2 (6.2e-8) because the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nSo pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.207.\n\nSo pH = 7.207 + log(0.02806 / 0.03673)\n\nCalculating the ratio: 0.02806 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.765.\n\nLog(0.765) is approximately -0.115.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.207 - 0.115 \u2248 7.092.\n\nWait, that's the pH. Now, I need to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nPO4^3- comes from the third dissociation step: HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so the extent of this reaction is very low.\n\nThe concentration of PO4^3- would depend on the concentration of HPO4^2- and the H+ concentration, which is determined by the pH.\n\nSo, using the third dissociation:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nBut [H+] can be found from pH. pH is 7.092, so [H+] = 10^(-7.092) \u2248 8.25e-8 M.\n\nWait, let me compute that accurately.\n\npH = 7.092 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.092) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092) \u2248 1e-7 * 0.86 \u2248 8.6e-8 M.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 10^-0.092.\n\n0.092 is approximately 0.09.\n\n10^(-0.09) is about 0.812.\n\nSo 10^(-7.092) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.092) \u2248 8.6e-8 M.\n\nWait, actually, 0.092 is 0.092.\n\nLet me use logarithm tables or calculator-like thinking.\n\nLog(8.6e-8) is -7.075. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that [H+] is approximately 8.6e-8 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nPlugging the numbers in:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M.\n\n[H+] is 8.6e-8 M.\n\nSo:\n\n(1.8e-12) * 0.02806 / 8.6e-8.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 \u2248 5.05e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.6e-8.\n\nSo 5.05e-14 / 8.6e-8 = (5.05 /8.6) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.587 * 1e-6 = 5.87e-7 M.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, 1.8e-12 multiplied by 0.02806:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.02806 = (1.8 * 0.02806) e-12 \u2248 0.050508e-12 = 5.0508e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.6e-8:\n\n5.0508e-14 /8.6e-8 = (5.0508 /8.6) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0508 /8.6 \u2248 0.587.\n\nSo 0.587e-6 = 5.87e-7 M.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the choices are around 6e-7, 5.48e-7, 2.8e-7, etc.\n\nSo 5.87e-7 is close to option A (6.24e-7) or option B (5.48e-7).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the [H+] calculation.\n\nWait, the pH was 7.092, so [H+] is 10^(-7.092).\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.092) more accurately.\n\n10^(-7.092) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092).\n\nCompute 10^(-0.092): \n\nWe can use the approximation that ln(10^x) = x ln(10). Or perhaps using the Taylor series for log.\n\nAlternatively, remember that 10^0.09 \u2248 1.23, so 10^(-0.09) \u2248 0.812.\n\nBut 0.092 is a bit more, so let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing natural logarithm: ln(10^0.092) = 0.092 * ln(10) \u2248 0.092 * 2.3026 \u2248 0.2117.\n\nSo e^0.2117 \u2248 1.235.\n\nSo 10^0.092 \u2248 1.235, so 10^(-0.092) \u2248 1 /1.235 \u2248 0.810.\n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.810 \u2248 8.1e-8 M.\n\nWait, that's more precise. So let's recalculate:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.1e-8)\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02806 = approx 5.05e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.1e-8.\n\nSo 5.05e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.05/8.1) * 1e-6.\n\n5.05 \u00f78.1 \u2248 0.623.\n\nSo 0.623e-6 = 6.23e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's about 6.23e-7, which is very close to option A, which is 6.24e-7 M.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I account for all the moles correctly?\n\nWait, the solution volume is 0.2 liters, right?\n\nSo moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 1g /136.09g/mol \u2248 0.007346 mol. So concentration is 0.03673 M.\n\nMoles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1g /177.99g/mol \u2248 0.005612 mol. So concentration is 0.02806 M.\n\nSo the calculations of their concentrations are correct.\n\nWait, but wait: When you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, does the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- affect each other's concentration? Because they might form some H3PO4 or PO4^3-.\n\nBut since the pH is around 7.09, which is below the pKa3 of about 11.26, the third dissociation is not favored. So the majority of HPO4^2- remains as HPO4^2-, and only a tiny amount converts to PO4^3-.\n\nSo our calculation for [PO4^3-] is correct.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 6.23e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7). But looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is a bit lower. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the steps.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's compute [H+] precisely.\n\npH = 7.092.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.092) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.092).\n\nCompute 10^(-0.092):\n\nWe can use the Taylor expansion for 10^x around x=0.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to use logarithm tables or known values.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator-like approach.\n\nWait, 10^0.092 is approximately 1.235, as I thought before. So 10^(-0.092) is 1/1.235 \u2248 0.810.\n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.810 = 8.1e-8 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.1e-8)\n\nCalculating numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02806 = 5.0508e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.1e-8.\n\nSo 5.0508e-14 / 8.1e-8 = (5.0508 / 8.1) )e-6.\n\n5.0508 \u00f78.1 \u2248 0.6235.\n\nSo 0.6235e-6 = 6.235e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.24e-7 M. That's option A.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me think again. The problem states that the solution contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nSo each contributes a certain number of moles. But when they are dissolved in solution, they can react with each other. For example, H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can react to form H3PO4 and PO4^3-.\n\nBut wait, the reaction between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is: H2PO4^- + HPO4^2- \u2194 2 H2O + H3PO4 + PO4^3- ?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the phosphate species can undergo further reactions, but I think that the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because they're the ones present in the solution. The other species (H3PO4 and PO4^3-) are in much lower concentrations.\n\nBut in this case, since the solution is buffered, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by their initial amounts, with the pH adjusted by the buffer.\n\nSo the approach I took before is correct.\n\nHmm, but looking at the options, option D is 3.97e-7 M, which is roughly half of 6.2e-7.\n\nIs there a mistake in the calculation? Let me recompute the numbers.\n\nWait, moles of HPO4^2-: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.\n\n177.99 is approximately 178 g/mol. So 1/178 \u2248 0.005618 mol.\n\nSo 0.005618 mol in 0.2 L is 0.02809 M.\n\nSimilarly, KH2PO4: 1g/136.09 \u2248 0.007346 mol \u2192 0.03673 M.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nWhich is 7.207 + log(0.02809/0.03673) = 7.207 + log(0.765).\n\nLog(0.765) is about -0.115.\n\nSo pH = 7.092.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^-7.092 \u2248 8.1e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.1e-8) = ?\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 5.056e-14.\n\n5.056e-14 / 8.1e-8 = 5.056 /8.1 = approximately 0.6242, so 0.6242e-6 \u2192 6.242e-7 M.\n\nWhich is 6.24e-7 M. So option A is 6.24e-7, which matches.\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB) 5.48x10^-7 M \n\nC) 2.81x10^-7 M\n\nD) 3.97x10^-7 M \n\nSo the correct answer would be A.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait another thing. I think I forgot that the solution is a buffer, and the actual concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- might not be exactly what I calculated because they might react with each other to form H3PO4 or PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the buffer equation assumes that the concentrations are as they are, and the pH is determined by them. The reaction between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would be minimal because the buffer system is in equilibrium.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the orthophosphate (PO4^3-) comes from both the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- through their respective dissociations. But that's not the case because both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can donate a proton to form PO4^3- only via the third dissociation.\n\nWait, no. H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, which can then donate another to become PO4^3-.\n\nBut in the solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, the approach should be correct.\n\nHmm. I think the correct answer is A) 6.24e-7 M.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species and use the given equilibrium constants. The solution contains 1.00 g each of KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O, dissolved in 200.00 cm\u00b3 (0.2 L). The molecular weights are 136.09 g/mol for KH\u2082PO\u2084 and 177.99 g/mol for Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The dissociation steps of H\u2083PO\u2084 are:\n\n1.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let's see what the question says. Hmm.\n\nThe solution has a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which I know is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH\u2082PO\u2084 and 1.00 g of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH\u2082PO\u2084 and 177.99 g/mol for Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, and the Ka values for H\u2083PO\u2084 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. \n\nWait, so I'm looking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO\u2084^3-? Or maybe HPO\u2084^2-? Hmm. Orthophosphate is H\u2083PO\u2084, but in solution, it dissociates into H\u2082PO\u2084^- and then further. Wait, the species in solution would depend on the pH. Since we have both KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084, which are two different salts, they will contribute to the phosphate species in the solution. \n\nKH\u2082PO\u2084 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H\u2082PO\u2084^- ions. Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O is sodium phosphate dihydrate, but wait, the formula is Na\u2082HPO\u2084, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO\u2084^2-.\n\nSo the solution contains H\u2082PO\u2084^- and HPO\u2084^2- ions. These are conjugate acid-base pairs. I remember that when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can get a buffer solution. So here, H\u2082PO\u2084^- is the acid, and HPO\u2084^2- is the conjugate base. \n\nSo the buffer system is H\u2082PO\u2084^- (acid) and HPO\u2084^2- (base). The Ka for the acid H\u2082PO\u2084^- would be Ka2, because H\u2083PO\u2084 has three dissociation steps: first H3PO4 \u2192 H2PO4^- + H+ (Ka1), then H2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2), and HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3). So the relevant Ka here is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.\n\nIn a buffer solution, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, I'm not asked for pH, but the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's mostly in the form of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- at neutral pH. Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are the PO4^3- ions? Or perhaps HPO4^2-? Or maybe the problem considers orthophosphate as HPO4^2-? Hmm, no, I think orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.\n\nWait, no, actually, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. So the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^3-? No, wait, H3PO4 is the acid, which loses a proton to become H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and finally PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the question is asking for PO4^3- concentration.\n\nBut wait, in the solution, we have H\u2082PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. The PO4^3- concentration would be very low because Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2. So the majority of the phosphate species are HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the concentration of all phosphate species, but no, the question specifies orthophosphate ions. So I think it's PO4^3-.\n\nBut if that's the case, then since the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the PO4^3- concentration would be minimal because it's the third dissociation. So to find PO4^3-, I might need to consider the third dissociation step. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is the conjugate base in the buffer.\n\nWait, no, the question says orthophosphate ions, which is the fully deprotonated form, so PO4^3-. Hmm. But in a buffer solution with pH around pKa2, which is around 7.2 (since Ka2 is 6.2e-8, pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) \u2248 7.21), the PO4^3- concentration would be very low because the solution's pH is not very high (maybe around 7.2). So PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation, which is much less likely. So perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible, but the question wants it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, which is HPO4^2-? Wait, no, HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion, not the ortho. Ortho would be PO4^3-.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- H3PO4 \u2192 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)\n- H2PO4^- \u2192 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)\n- HPO4^2- \u2192 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)\n\nSo orthophosphate is PO4^3-.\n\nBut in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. So PO4^3- would be formed from the further dissociation of HPO4^2-.\n\nBut since the pH is around the pKa2 (7.2), the concentration of HPO4^2- is higher than PO4^3-. So PO4^3- is going to be very low.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate it? Let me think. Since I have a buffer solution, the pH can be found, and then I can find the concentration of PO4^3- using Ka3 and the pH.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is just expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- and not PO4^3-. Hmm, but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is considering orthophosphate as HPO4^2-? I'm not entirely sure. Let me re-read the question. It says, \"the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution.\" Orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-? Or is it HPO4^2-? Because sometimes, people might refer to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I should double-check what orthophosphate refers to. Oh, right, orthophosphate is H3PO4. So the ion would be the conjugate base. So the phosphate ion is PO4^3-.\n\nBut in solution, considering the pH, how much of that is present?\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n\nI have 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nLet's calculate the moles of each.\n\nFor KH2PO4:\n\nMolar mass = 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007343 mol.\n\nSo, moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007343.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\n\nMolar mass is 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005617 mol.\n\nSo, moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005617.\n\nThe total volume is 0.2 L.\n\nSo, the concentrations are:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007343 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.036715 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.028085 M.\n\nNow, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer system between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base):\n\npH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid])\n\npKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.207.\n\nSo, pH = 7.207 + log(0.028085 / 0.036715)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.028085 / 0.036715 \u2248 0.766.\n\nLog(0.766) \u2248 -0.114.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.207 - 0.114 \u2248 7.093.\n\nNow, knowing the pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation.\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nThe reaction is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nSo, Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWe know Ka3 is 1.8e-12. [HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M. [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.093) \u2248 8.27e-8 M.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.27e-8)\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 \u2248 5.055e-14.\n\nDivide by denominator: 5.055e-14 / 8.27e-8 \u2248 6.116e-7 M.\n\nWait, but that's about 6.1e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, when I calculated [H+], pH is 7.093. So [H+] is 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093) \u2248 1e-7 * 0.825 \u2248 8.25e-8. So that's correct.\n\nThen, (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) = 5.055e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.25e-8: 5.055e-14 / 8.25e-8 = (5.055 / 8.25) * 1e-6.\n\n5.055 / 8.25 \u2248 0.6125. So 0.6125e-6 = 6.125e-7 M.\n\nSo that would be approximately 6.125e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7), but not exactly. Let me see if I made any mistakes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the exact [H+], not approximate. Let me compute 10^(-7.093) more accurately.\n\npH =7.093 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093). \n\n10^(-0.093) \u2248 0.825, as before. So [H+] \u2248 8.25e-8.\n\nAnother thing: when I calculated [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-], I assumed that all the salts dissociate completely. Is that correct? Well, since these are group 1 salts (K+ and Na+ are spectator ions), they should dissociate completely, so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what about activity coefficients and such? Probably beyond the scope of this problem. So I think my approach is correct.\n\nHmm, but let me check the initial moles again.\n\nKH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol.\n\nLet me compute that precisely.\n\n136.09 g/mol is approximately 136.09. So 1 / 136.09 = approx 0.007335 mol. Wait, earlier I got 0.007343. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\n136.09 * 0.007343 = approx 1.0000. So perhaps 0.007343 is accurate.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1g /177.99 g/mol.\n\n177.99 * 0.005617 = approx 1.000. So correct.\n\nWait, but let me compute 1 / 177.99 exactly.\n\n1 \u00f7 177.99 \u2248 0.005617 mol. So that's correct.\n\nSo the concentrations are [H2PO4^-] \u2248 0.0367 M and [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.028085 M.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nWhich is 7.207 + log(0.028085/0.036715)\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n0.028085 / 0.036715 \u2248 0.766.\n\nLog(0.766) = ?\n\nLog(0.7) is -0.155, log(0.766)= let's compute it more accurately.\n\nLog(7.66) \u2248 0.8848, so log(0.766)= 0.8848 -1 = -0.1152.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.207 - 0.1152 = 7.0918.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^(-7.0918) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0918).\n\n10^(-0.0918) = 1/(10^0.0918) \u2248 1/(1.238) \u2248 0.807.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 8.07e-8 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.07e-8)\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.055e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.07e-8: 5.055e-14 / 8.07e-8 \u2248 6.265e-7 M.\n\nSo that's approximately 6.26e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. That's very close.\n\nWait, but why did my initial calculation give 6.12e-7 and now it's 6.26e-7? Because I used a more precise [H+], which is 8.07e-8 instead of 8.25e-8.\n\nAh, so the more accurate [H+] is 8.07e-8, which gives a higher [PO4^3-], bringing the value closer to 6.26e-7.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option A: 6.24e-7 M.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the question is indeed asking for PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total orthophosphate as the sum of all phosphate species. But the question specifies orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not considering PO4^3- but HPO4^2-? But that would be the concentration of HPO4^2- which is 0.028 M, which is way higher than the options.\n\nWait, the options are all around 1e-7 M, so it's definitely about PO4^3-.\n\nSo the calculation leads me to approximately 6.26e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7 M).\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let's see what the question says. Hmm.\n\nThe solution has a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which I know is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH\u2082PO\u2084 and 1.00 g of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH\u2082PO\u2084 and 177.99 g/mol for Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, and the Ka values for H\u2083PO\u2084 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. \n\nWait, so I'm looking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO\u2084^3-? Or maybe HPO\u2084^2-? Hmm. Orthophosphate is H\u2083PO\u2084, but in solution, it dissociates into H\u2082PO\u2084^- and then further. Wait, the species in solution would depend on the pH. Since we have both KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084, which are two different salts, they will contribute to the phosphate species in the solution. \n\nKH\u2082PO\u2084 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H\u2082PO\u2084^- ions. Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O is sodium phosphate dihydrate, but wait, the formula is Na\u2082HPO\u2084, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO\u2084^2-.\n\nSo the solution contains H\u2082PO\u2084^- and HPO\u2084^2- ions. These are conjugate acid-base pairs. I remember that when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can get a buffer solution. So here, H\u2082PO\u2084^- is the acid, and HPO\u2084^2- is the conjugate base. \n\nSo the buffer system is H\u2082PO\u2084^- (acid) and HPO\u2084^2- (base). The Ka for the acid H\u2082PO\u2084^- would be Ka2, because H\u2083PO\u2084 has three dissociation steps: first H3PO4 \u2192 H2PO4^- + H+ (Ka1), then H2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2), and HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3). So the relevant Ka here is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.\n\nIn a buffer solution, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, I'm not asked for pH, but the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's mostly in the form of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- at neutral pH. Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are the PO4^3- ions? Or perhaps HPO4^2-? Or maybe the problem considers orthophosphate as HPO4^2-? Hmm, no, I think orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.\n\nWait, no, actually, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. So the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^3-? No, wait, H3PO4 is the acid, which loses a proton to become H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and finally PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the question is asking for PO4^3- concentration.\n\nBut wait, in the solution, we have H\u2082PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. The PO4^3- concentration would be very low because Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2. So the majority of the phosphate species are HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the concentration of all phosphate species, but no, the question specifies orthophosphate ions. So I think it's PO4^3-.\n\nBut if that's the case, then since the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the PO4^3- concentration would be minimal because it's the third dissociation. So to find PO4^3-, I might need to consider the third dissociation step. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is the conjugate base in the buffer.\n\nWait, no, the question says orthophosphate ions, which is the fully deprotonated form, so PO4^3-. Hmm. But in a buffer solution with pH around pKa2, which is around 7.2 (since Ka2 is 6.2e-8, pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) \u2248 7.21), the PO4^3- concentration would be very low because the solution's pH is not very high (maybe around 7.2). So PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation, which is much less likely. So perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible, but the question wants it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, which is HPO4^2-? Wait, no, HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion, not the ortho. Ortho would be PO4^3-.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- H3PO4 \u2192 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)\n- H2PO4^- \u2192 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)\n- HPO4^2- \u2192 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)\n\nSo orthophosphate is PO4^3-.\n\nBut in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. So PO4^3- would be formed from the further dissociation of HPO4^2-.\n\nBut since the pH is around the pKa2 (7.2), the concentration of HPO4^2- is higher than PO4^3-. So PO4^3- is going to be very low.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate it? Let me think. Since I have a buffer solution, the pH can be found, and then I can find the concentration of PO4^3- using Ka3 and the pH.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is just expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- and not PO4^3-. Hmm, but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is considering orthophosphate as HPO4^2-? I'm not entirely sure. Let me re-read the question. It says, \"the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution.\" Orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-? Or is it HPO4^2-? Because sometimes, people might refer to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I should double-check what orthophosphate refers to. Oh, right, orthophosphate is H3PO4. So the ion would be the conjugate base. So the phosphate ion is PO4^3-.\n\nBut in solution, considering the pH, how much of that is present?\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n\nI have 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n\nLet's calculate the moles of each.\n\nFor KH2PO4:\n\nMolar mass = 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007343 mol.\n\nSo, moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007343.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\n\nMolar mass is 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005617 mol.\n\nSo, moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005617.\n\nThe total volume is 0.2 L.\n\nSo, the concentrations are:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007343 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.036715 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.028085 M.\n\nNow, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer system between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base):\n\npH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid])\n\npKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.207.\n\nSo, pH = 7.207 + log(0.028085 / 0.036715)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.028085 / 0.036715 \u2248 0.766.\n\nLog(0.766) \u2248 -0.114.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.207 - 0.114 \u2248 7.093.\n\nNow, knowing the pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation.\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nThe reaction is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nSo, Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWe know Ka3 is 1.8e-12. [HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M. [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.093) \u2248 8.27e-8 M.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.27e-8)\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 \u2248 5.055e-14.\n\nDivide by denominator: 5.055e-14 / 8.27e-8 \u2248 6.116e-7 M.\n\nWait, but that's about 6.1e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, when I calculated [H+], pH is 7.093. So [H+] is 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093) \u2248 1e-7 * 0.825 \u2248 8.25e-8. So that's correct.\n\nThen, (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) = 5.055e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.25e-8: 5.055e-14 / 8.25e-8 = (5.055 / 8.25) * 1e-6.\n\n5.055 / 8.25 \u2248 0.6125. So 0.6125e-6 = 6.125e-7 M.\n\nSo that would be approximately 6.125e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7), but not exactly. Let me see if I made any mistakes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the exact [H+], not approximate. Let me compute 10^(-7.093) more accurately.\n\npH =7.093 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093). \n\n10^(-0.093) \u2248 0.825, as before. So [H+] \u2248 8.25e-8.\n\nAnother thing: when I calculated [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-], I assumed that all the salts dissociate completely. Is that correct? Well, since these are group 1 salts (K+ and Na+ are spectator ions), they should dissociate completely, so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but what about activity coefficients and such? Probably beyond the scope of this problem. So I think my approach is correct.\n\nHmm, but let me check the initial moles again.\n\nKH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol.\n\nLet me compute that precisely.\n\n136.09 g/mol is approximately 136.09. So 1 / 136.09 = approx 0.007335 mol. Wait, earlier I got 0.007343. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\n136.09 * 0.007343 = approx 1.0000. So perhaps 0.007343 is accurate.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1g /177.99 g/mol.\n\n177.99 * 0.005617 = approx 1.000. So correct.\n\nWait, but let me compute 1 / 177.99 exactly.\n\n1 \u00f7 177.99 \u2248 0.005617 mol. So that's correct.\n\nSo the concentrations are [H2PO4^-] \u2248 0.0367 M and [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.028085 M.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nWhich is 7.207 + log(0.028085/0.036715)\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n0.028085 / 0.036715 \u2248 0.766.\n\nLog(0.766) = ?\n\nLog(0.7) is -0.155, log(0.766)= let's compute it more accurately.\n\nLog(7.66) \u2248 0.8848, so log(0.766)= 0.8848 -1 = -0.1152.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.207 - 0.1152 = 7.0918.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^(-7.0918) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0918).\n\n10^(-0.0918) = 1/(10^0.0918) \u2248 1/(1.238) \u2248 0.807.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 8.07e-8 M.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / (8.07e-8)\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 5.055e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.07e-8: 5.055e-14 / 8.07e-8 \u2248 6.265e-7 M.\n\nSo that's approximately 6.26e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M. That's very close.\n\nWait, but why did my initial calculation give 6.12e-7 and now it's 6.26e-7? Because I used a more precise [H+], which is 8.07e-8 instead of 8.25e-8.\n\nAh, so the more accurate [H+] is 8.07e-8, which gives a higher [PO4^3-], bringing the value closer to 6.26e-7.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option A: 6.24e-7 M.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the question is indeed asking for PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total orthophosphate as the sum of all phosphate species. But the question specifies orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not considering PO4^3- but HPO4^2-? But that would be the concentration of HPO4^2- which is 0.028 M, which is way higher than the options.\n\nWait, the options are all around 1e-7 M, so it's definitely about PO4^3-.\n\nSo the calculation leads me to approximately 6.26e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7 M).\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The solution contains H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b (from KH\u2082PO\u2084) and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b (from Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O), which are conjugate acid-base pairs.

But I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm\u00b3 (which is 200 mL) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- I think) in this solution. Oh wait, wait. Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in the context of these salts, the ions are different. Hmm, I might get that confused.\n\nI remember that KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is sodium dihydrogen phosphate, but wait, wait. No, wait: Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. Let me get the formulas right. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (which is H2PO4^-). Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water. So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions.\n\nWait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? But in solution, it's more likely to be in its dissociated forms. So maybe the problem is actually asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-? Or perhaps I'm getting confused with the terminology. Let me check.\n\nOrthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it can dissociate. The phosphate ion is PO4^3-, but in acidic solutions, it's in the form of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- depending on pH. Since the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, respectively, this must be a buffer solution. Because when you have a weak acid and its conjugate base, it's a buffer.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm. Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but the solution doesn't have H3PO4, it has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Unless under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says, \"the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution.\" Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's more likely to dissociate. So perhaps the problem is a typo, but I think it's more likely that it's asking about the HPO4^2- concentration. Alternatively, maybe they're considering the concentration of PO4^3- as orthophosphate, but that's unlikely. I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- (which is the conjugate acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base). So the buffer system is H2PO4^- / HPO4^2-.\n\nSince both are present, the solution is a buffer, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But the problem is asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution. Because orthophosphate is H3PO4, which isn't present here. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-? No, I don't think so. HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and the fully deprotonated form is phosphate (PO4^3-). So orthophosphate is H3PO4, which is the fully protonated form. But in solution, it's not present in significant amounts because it's a weak acid. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions.\n\nSo the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Let's calculate the moles of each.\n\nFirst, calculate moles of KH2PO4. The molar mass (Mw) is given as 136.09 g/mol. We have 1.00 g, so moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007335 mol.\n\nSimilarly, for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, the Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005605 mol.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is the formula. So the molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005605 mol.\n\nNow, the solution volume is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 L.\n\nSo the concentration of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) is 0.007335 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.036675 M.\n\nThe concentration of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O) is 0.005605 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.028025 M.\n\nWait, but wait, in solution, these might react. Because the solution is a buffer, but the concentrations are from the salts. But in reality, the solution will have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in certain concentrations, but their ratio depends on the pH.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, then the concentration is 0.028025 M. But that's not one of the options. The options are in the 1e-7 range, which is way smaller.\n\nWait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh, wait. Wait a minute, maybe I got the salts wrong. Let me double-check the dissociation of each salt.\n\nKH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.\n\nSo in solution, the concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider the dissociation of H2PO4^- in solution. Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The first dissociation is H3PO4 \u2192 H+ + H2PO4^-. The second is H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2-. The third is HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe given Ka values are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. The system is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nSo the pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, the question isn't asking about pH; it's asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-, but wait, no. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-, but that's not present in this solution. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate, but I think that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually referring to the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution, which would be 0.028025 M. But that's about 0.028 M, which is much larger than the options given (which are around 1e-7 M). So that can't be right. There's a disconnect here.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating the molarity. Let me re-calculate.\n\nFor KH2PO4:\n\nMoles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007335 mol.\n\nVolume is 200 mL = 0.2 L.\n\nConcentration = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M H2PO4^-.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\n\nMoles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005605 mol.\n\nConcentration = 0.005605 / 0.2 \u2248 0.028025 M HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but the options are way smaller. So I'm probably missing something here.\n\nAh! Wait a minute, perhaps the solution is not simply the sum of the ions from the salts, but considering the dissociation of H2PO4^- into H+ and HPO4^2-.\n\nBecause in solution, H2PO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become HPO4^2-.\n\nSo the total concentration of HPO4^2- would be the sum of what comes from the Na2HPO4 and the dissociation of H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but if the solution is a buffer, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would apply. Let me think about that.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).\n\nIn this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.\n\nSo the pH of the solution can be found using the ratio of moles of base to acid.\n\nWait, let's calculate the pH first.\n\npKa2 is the relevant one here because we're dealing with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8 \u2192 pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.208.\n\nMoles of H2PO4^- = 0.007335 mol.\n\nMoles of HPO4^2- = 0.005605 mol.\n\nSo [base]/[acid] = (0.005605)/(0.007335) \u2248 0.764.\n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log(0.764) \u2248 7.208 + (-0.114) \u2248 7.094.\n\nNow, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I'm now confused about. Alternatively, perhaps it's asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the actual concentrations considering the dissociation.\n\nThe initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M.\n\nBut in solution, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, so the actual [HPO4^2-] will be higher than the initial amount from Na2HPO4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial concentrations are from the salts. The H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, which would increase the [HPO4^2-].\n\nBut because the solution is a buffer, the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is determined by the pH and pKa2.\n\nWait, but we already calculated the pH, so maybe we can find the exact concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should set up the equilibrium.\n\nLet me think. The reaction is H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2-.\n\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 6.2e-8.\n\nFrom the buffer calculation, we found pH \u22487.094. So [H+] = 1e-7.094 \u2248 8.2e-8.\n\nSo substituting into the Ka2 expression:\n\n6.2e-8 = (8.2e-8) * [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-].\n\nWe can solve for [HPO4^2-] in terms of [H2PO4^-].\n\n[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 / 8.2e-8) * [H2PO4^-] \u2248 (0.756) [H2PO4^-].\n\nBut wait, the initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M.\n\nWait, but in reality, the H2PO4^- can dissociate, so the actual [HPO4^2-] is higher than 0.028025 M.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the total concentration of phosphate species.\n\nThe total phosphate concentration is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But in this solution, since the pH is around 7, H3PO4 is negligible, and PO4^3- is also negligible because Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is way lower. So the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nLet me denote the initial concentrations from the salts as [H2PO4^-]0 = 0.036675 M and [HPO4^2-]0 = 0.028025 M.\n\nBut in solution, some H2PO4^- will dissociate to form more HPO4^2-.\n\nLet x be the amount of H2PO4^- that dissociates per liter.\n\nSo:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 - x\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 + x\n\nBut from the buffer equation, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2) = 10^(7.094 - 7.208) \u2248 10^(-0.114) \u2248 0.756.\n\nSo (0.028025 + x)/(0.036675 - x) \u2248 0.756.\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\nMultiply both sides by (0.036675 - x):\n\n0.028025 + x = 0.756*(0.036675 - x)\n\n0.028025 + x = 0.756*0.036675 - 0.756 x\n\nCalculate 0.756 * 0.036675:\n\n0.756 * 0.036675 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n0.7 * 0.036675 = 0.0256725.\n\n0.056 * 0.036675 \u2248 0.002054.\n\nSo total \u2248 0.0256725 + 0.002054 = 0.0277265.\n\nSo,\n\n0.028025 + x \u2248 0.0277265 - 0.756 x.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n0.028025 - 0.0277265 + x + 0.756 x \u2248 0.\n\n0.0002985 + x (1 + 0.756) \u2248 0.\n\nx (1.756) \u2248 -0.0002985.\n\nWait, that gives x \u2248 -0.0002985 / 1.756 \u2248 -0.0001702.\n\nNegative x implies that the initial assumption is wrong; perhaps some HPO4^2- will accept a proton to form H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, maybe I should set it up differently. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2) \u2248 0.756.\n\nSo [HPO4^2-] = 0.756 [H2PO4^-].\n\nLet me let [H2PO4^-] = y.\n\nThen [HPO4^2-] = 0.756 y.\n\nThe total phosphate from both salts is y + 0.756 y = (1 + 0.756) y = 1.756 y.\n\nBut the total moles from the salts are:\n\nTotal moles = 0.007335 + 0.005605 = 0.01294 mol.\n\nConcentration is 0.01294 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0647 M.\n\nSo 1.756 y = 0.0647 \u2192 y = 0.0647 / 1.756 \u2248 0.0368 M.\n\nThen [HPO4^2-] = 0.756 * 0.0368 \u2248 0.0278 M.\n\nWait, that's about 0.0278 M. But the options are way smaller. So I'm clearly missing something here.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is H3PO4, which is not present, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the concentration of HPO4^2- in a different way.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the solution is in equilibrium, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the second dissociation.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting results. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the buffer solution but about the concentration of HPO4^2- after considering the dissociation from H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but the H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4, which is 0.036675 M. And the HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which is 0.028025 M.\n\nBut in solution, some H2PO4^- will dissociate into H+ and HPO4^2-.\n\nLet me let x be the concentration of H2PO4^- that dissociates.\n\nSo:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 - x\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 + x\n\nThe Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 6.2e-8.\n\nWe can find [H+] using the pH. Wait, but we calculated the pH earlier as approximately 7.094, so [H+] = 1e-7.094 \u2248 8.2e-8.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n6.2e-8 = (8.2e-8) * (0.028025 + x) / (0.036675 - x)\n\nMultiply both sides by (0.036675 - x):\n\n6.2e-8 * (0.036675 - x) = 8.2e-8 * (0.028025 + x)\n\nDivide both sides by 1e-8:\n\n6.2*(0.036675 - x) = 8.2*(0.028025 + x)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n6.2 * 0.036675 \u2248 0.2282.\n\n6.2*(-x) = -6.2 x.\n\n8.2 * 0.028025 \u2248 0.2298.\n\n8.2 * x = 8.2 x.\n\nSo:\n\n0.2282 - 6.2 x = 0.2298 + 8.2 x\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n0.2282 - 0.2298 = 8.2 x + 6.2 x\n\n-0.0016 = 14.4 x \u2192 x \u2248 -0.0016 /14.4 \u2248 -0.0001111.\n\nNegative x suggests that the assumption is incorrect. So perhaps x is negative, meaning that HPO4^2- is accepting a proton, i.e., some of it is converting back to H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because in a buffer, the ratio is fixed. Maybe I should approach it using the Henderson equation again.\n\nWait, the Henderson equation says pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nWe found pH \u22487.094, pKa2=7.208.\n\nSo 7.094 =7.208 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\n\u2192 log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) = 7.094 -7.208 = -0.114 \u2192 [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(-0.114) \u2248 0.756.\n\nSo [HPO4^2-] = 0.756 [H2PO4^-].\n\nThe total concentration of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is the sum of their initial concentrations from the salts, plus any changes from dissociation. Wait, but the initial concentrations are from the salts, and the dissociation will shift them.\n\nWait, perhaps the total concentration is the sum of [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] which is fixed by the moles from the salts plus any changes from dissociation.\n\nWait, but the total moles are fixed. So perhaps the sum [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = initial sum.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because some H2PO4^- dissociates into HPO4^2-, so the sum would be:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = initial_H2PO4 - x\n\n[HPO4^2-] = initial_HPO4 + x\n\nSo sum = (initial_H2PO4 -x) + (initial_HPO4 +x) = initial_H2PO4 + initial_HPO4.\n\nWhich is 0.036675 + 0.028025 = 0.0647 M.\n\nSo [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.0647 M.\n\nAnd [HPO4^2-] = 0.756 [H2PO4^-].\n\nSo substituting:\n\n[H2PO4^-] + 0.756 [H2PO4^-] = 0.0647.\n\n\u2192 1.756 [H2PO4^-] = 0.0647 \u2192 [H2PO4^-] \u2248 0.0647 / 1.756 \u2248 0.0368 M.\n\nThen [HPO4^2-] = 0.756 * 0.0368 \u2248 0.0278 M.\n\nBut again, this gives [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.0278 M, which is way larger than the options provided. So I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about the buffer solution but about the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the third dissociation, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is considering that HPO4^2- can further dissociate into PO4^3- and H+, but that's governed by Ka3, which is 1.8e-12, a very small value. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible.\n\nWait, but the problem is about orthophosphate, which I'm getting confused about. Alternatively, perhaps the question is misworded and actually refers to the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but the options are in the 1e-7 range. So maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- ions considering that some of them are dissociating further into PO4^3-.\n\nBut given that Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, the [PO4^3-] would be tiny, but perhaps that's what the question is referring to as orthophosphate.\n\nWait, but orthophosphate is H3PO4, which is the fully protonated form. But in solution, especially in a basic buffer like this, it's mostly deprotonated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, let's think: in the solution, [HPO4^2-] is 0.0278 M. The dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+ is governed by Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo, let me write the equilibrium:\n\nHPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.\n\nWe know [H+] is 8.2e-8, from the pH calculation.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nSubstituting:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0278) / (8.2e-8) \u2248 (5.004e-14) / 8.2e-8 \u2248 6.102e-7 M.\n\nAh! So the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.1e-7 M. Looking at the options:\n\nOption A is 6.24e-7, which is close.\n\nBut wait, let me do the calculation more precisely.\n\n[HPO4^2-] was approximately 0.0278 M.\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[H+] = 8.2e-8.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0278) / (8.2e-8).\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.0278 = 5.004e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.2e-8: 5.004e-14 / 8.2e-8 = (5.004 /8.2) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.610 * 1e-6 = 6.10e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.1e-7 M. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but another point: when I calculated [HPO4^2-], I assumed that the buffer equation gives [HPO4^2-] = 0.0278 M. But perhaps I should use more precise numbers.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate the buffer equation more accurately.\n\nWe had:\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.756 * [H2PO4^-].\n\nAnd [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.0647 M.\n\nSo,\n\n[H2PO4^-] + 0.756 [H2PO4^-] = 0.0647 \u2192 1.756 [H2PO4^-] = 0.0647 \u2192 [H2PO4^-] = 0.0647 / 1.756 \u2248 0.0368 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.756 * 0.0368 \u2248 0.0278 M.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0278) / (8.2e-8) = ?\n\nLet me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.0278 = 5.004e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.2e-8:\n\n5.004e-14 / 8.2e-8 = (5.004 /8.2) * 1e-6.\n\n5.004 /8.2 \u2248 0.61024.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 6.1024e-7 M.\n\nOption A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm\u00b3 (which is 200 mL) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- I think) in this solution. Oh wait, wait. Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in the context of these salts, the ions are different. Hmm, I might get that confused.\n\nI remember that KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is sodium dihydrogen phosphate, but wait, wait. No, wait: Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. Let me get the formulas right. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (which is H2PO4^-). Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water. So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions.\n\nWait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? But in solution, it's more likely to be in its dissociated forms. So maybe the problem is actually asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-? Or perhaps I'm getting confused with the terminology. Let me check.\n\nOrthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it can dissociate. The phosphate ion is PO4^3-, but in acidic solutions, it's in the form of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- depending on pH. Since the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, respectively, this must be a buffer solution. Because when you have a weak acid and its conjugate base, it's a buffer.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm. Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but the solution doesn't have H3PO4, it has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Unless under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says, \"the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution.\" Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's more likely to dissociate. So perhaps the problem is a typo, but I think it's more likely that it's asking about the HPO4^2- concentration. Alternatively, maybe they're considering the concentration of PO4^3- as orthophosphate, but that's unlikely. I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- (which is the conjugate acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base). So the buffer system is H2PO4^- / HPO4^2-.\n\nSince both are present, the solution is a buffer, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But the problem is asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution. Because orthophosphate is H3PO4, which isn't present here. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-? No, I don't think so. HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and the fully deprotonated form is phosphate (PO4^3-). So orthophosphate is H3PO4, which is the fully protonated form. But in solution, it's not present in significant amounts because it's a weak acid. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions.\n\nSo the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Let's calculate the moles of each.\n\nFirst, calculate moles of KH2PO4. The molar mass (Mw) is given as 136.09 g/mol. We have 1.00 g, so moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007335 mol.\n\nSimilarly, for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, the Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005605 mol.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is the formula. So the molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005605 mol.\n\nNow, the solution volume is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 L.\n\nSo the concentration of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) is 0.007335 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.036675 M.\n\nThe concentration of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O) is 0.005605 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.028025 M.\n\nWait, but wait, in solution, these might react. Because the solution is a buffer, but the concentrations are from the salts. But in reality, the solution will have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in certain concentrations, but their ratio depends on the pH.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, then the concentration is 0.028025 M. But that's not one of the options. The options are in the 1e-7 range, which is way smaller.\n\nWait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh, wait. Wait a minute, maybe I got the salts wrong. Let me double-check the dissociation of each salt.\n\nKH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.\n\nSo in solution, the concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider the dissociation of H2PO4^- in solution. Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The first dissociation is H3PO4 \u2192 H+ + H2PO4^-. The second is H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2-. The third is HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe given Ka values are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. The system is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nSo the pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, the question isn't asking about pH; it's asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-, but wait, no. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-, but that's not present in this solution. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate, but I think that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually referring to the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution, which would be 0.028025 M. But that's about 0.028 M, which is much larger than the options given (which are around 1e-7 M). So that can't be right. There's a disconnect here.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating the molarity. Let me re-calculate.\n\nFor KH2PO4:\n\nMoles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007335 mol.\n\nVolume is 200 mL = 0.2 L.\n\nConcentration = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M H2PO4^-.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\n\nMoles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005605 mol.\n\nConcentration = 0.005605 / 0.2 \u2248 0.028025 M HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but the options are way smaller. So I'm probably missing something here.\n\nAh! Wait a minute, perhaps the solution is not simply the sum of the ions from the salts, but considering the dissociation of H2PO4^- into H+ and HPO4^2-.\n\nBecause in solution, H2PO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become HPO4^2-.\n\nSo the total concentration of HPO4^2- would be the sum of what comes from the Na2HPO4 and the dissociation of H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but if the solution is a buffer, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would apply. Let me think about that.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).\n\nIn this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.\n\nSo the pH of the solution can be found using the ratio of moles of base to acid.\n\nWait, let's calculate the pH first.\n\npKa2 is the relevant one here because we're dealing with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8 \u2192 pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.208.\n\nMoles of H2PO4^- = 0.007335 mol.\n\nMoles of HPO4^2- = 0.005605 mol.\n\nSo [base]/[acid] = (0.005605)/(0.007335) \u2248 0.764.\n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log(0.764) \u2248 7.208 + (-0.114) \u2248 7.094.\n\nNow, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I'm now confused about. Alternatively, perhaps it's asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the actual concentrations considering the dissociation.\n\nThe initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M.\n\nBut in solution, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, so the actual [HPO4^2-] will be higher than the initial amount from Na2HPO4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial concentrations are from the salts. The H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, which would increase the [HPO4^2-].\n\nBut because the solution is a buffer, the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is determined by the pH and pKa2.\n\nWait, but we already calculated the pH, so maybe we can find the exact concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should set up the equilibrium.\n\nLet me think. The reaction is H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2-.\n\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 6.2e-8.\n\nFrom the buffer calculation, we found pH \u22487.094. So [H+] = 1e-7.094 \u2248 8.2e-8.\n\nSo substituting into the Ka2 expression:\n\n6.2e-8 = (8.2e-8) * [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-].\n\nWe can solve for [HPO4^2-] in terms of [H2PO4^-].\n\n[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 / 8.2e-8) * [H2PO4^-] \u2248 (0.756) [H2PO4^-].\n\nBut wait, the initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M.\n\nWait, but in reality, the H2PO4^- can dissociate, so the actual [HPO4^2-] is higher than 0.028025 M.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the total concentration of phosphate species.\n\nThe total phosphate concentration is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But in this solution, since the pH is around 7, H3PO4 is negligible, and PO4^3- is also negligible because Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is way lower. So the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nLet me denote the initial concentrations from the salts as [H2PO4^-]0 = 0.036675 M and [HPO4^2-]0 = 0.028025 M.\n\nBut in solution, some H2PO4^- will dissociate to form more HPO4^2-.\n\nLet x be the amount of H2PO4^- that dissociates per liter.\n\nSo:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 - x\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 + x\n\nBut from the buffer equation, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2) = 10^(7.094 - 7.208) \u2248 10^(-0.114) \u2248 0.756.\n\nSo (0.028025 + x)/(0.036675 - x) \u2248 0.756.\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\nMultiply both sides by (0.036675 - x):\n\n0.028025 + x = 0.756*(0.036675 - x)\n\n0.028025 + x = 0.756*0.036675 - 0.756 x\n\nCalculate 0.756 * 0.036675:\n\n0.756 * 0.036675 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n0.7 * 0.036675 = 0.0256725.\n\n0.056 * 0.036675 \u2248 0.002054.\n\nSo total \u2248 0.0256725 + 0.002054 = 0.0277265.\n\nSo,\n\n0.028025 + x \u2248 0.0277265 - 0.756 x.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n0.028025 - 0.0277265 + x + 0.756 x \u2248 0.\n\n0.0002985 + x (1 + 0.756) \u2248 0.\n\nx (1.756) \u2248 -0.0002985.\n\nWait, that gives x \u2248 -0.0002985 / 1.756 \u2248 -0.0001702.\n\nNegative x implies that the initial assumption is wrong; perhaps some HPO4^2- will accept a proton to form H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, maybe I should set it up differently. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2) \u2248 0.756.\n\nSo [HPO4^2-] = 0.756 [H2PO4^-].\n\nLet me let [H2PO4^-] = y.\n\nThen [HPO4^2-] = 0.756 y.\n\nThe total phosphate from both salts is y + 0.756 y = (1 + 0.756) y = 1.756 y.\n\nBut the total moles from the salts are:\n\nTotal moles = 0.007335 + 0.005605 = 0.01294 mol.\n\nConcentration is 0.01294 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0647 M.\n\nSo 1.756 y = 0.0647 \u2192 y = 0.0647 / 1.756 \u2248 0.0368 M.\n\nThen [HPO4^2-] = 0.756 * 0.0368 \u2248 0.0278 M.\n\nWait, that's about 0.0278 M. But the options are way smaller. So I'm clearly missing something here.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is H3PO4, which is not present, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the concentration of HPO4^2- in a different way.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the solution is in equilibrium, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the second dissociation.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting results. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the buffer solution but about the concentration of HPO4^2- after considering the dissociation from H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but the H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4, which is 0.036675 M. And the HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which is 0.028025 M.\n\nBut in solution, some H2PO4^- will dissociate into H+ and HPO4^2-.\n\nLet me let x be the concentration of H2PO4^- that dissociates.\n\nSo:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.036675 - x\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 + x\n\nThe Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 6.2e-8.\n\nWe can find [H+] using the pH. Wait, but we calculated the pH earlier as approximately 7.094, so [H+] = 1e-7.094 \u2248 8.2e-8.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n6.2e-8 = (8.2e-8) * (0.028025 + x) / (0.036675 - x)\n\nMultiply both sides by (0.036675 - x):\n\n6.2e-8 * (0.036675 - x) = 8.2e-8 * (0.028025 + x)\n\nDivide both sides by 1e-8:\n\n6.2*(0.036675 - x) = 8.2*(0.028025 + x)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n6.2 * 0.036675 \u2248 0.2282.\n\n6.2*(-x) = -6.2 x.\n\n8.2 * 0.028025 \u2248 0.2298.\n\n8.2 * x = 8.2 x.\n\nSo:\n\n0.2282 - 6.2 x = 0.2298 + 8.2 x\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n0.2282 - 0.2298 = 8.2 x + 6.2 x\n\n-0.0016 = 14.4 x \u2192 x \u2248 -0.0016 /14.4 \u2248 -0.0001111.\n\nNegative x suggests that the assumption is incorrect. So perhaps x is negative, meaning that HPO4^2- is accepting a proton, i.e., some of it is converting back to H2PO4^-.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because in a buffer, the ratio is fixed. Maybe I should approach it using the Henderson equation again.\n\nWait, the Henderson equation says pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nWe found pH \u22487.094, pKa2=7.208.\n\nSo 7.094 =7.208 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\n\u2192 log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) = 7.094 -7.208 = -0.114 \u2192 [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(-0.114) \u2248 0.756.\n\nSo [HPO4^2-] = 0.756 [H2PO4^-].\n\nThe total concentration of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is the sum of their initial concentrations from the salts, plus any changes from dissociation. Wait, but the initial concentrations are from the salts, and the dissociation will shift them.\n\nWait, perhaps the total concentration is the sum of [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] which is fixed by the moles from the salts plus any changes from dissociation.\n\nWait, but the total moles are fixed. So perhaps the sum [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = initial sum.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because some H2PO4^- dissociates into HPO4^2-, so the sum would be:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = initial_H2PO4 - x\n\n[HPO4^2-] = initial_HPO4 + x\n\nSo sum = (initial_H2PO4 -x) + (initial_HPO4 +x) = initial_H2PO4 + initial_HPO4.\n\nWhich is 0.036675 + 0.028025 = 0.0647 M.\n\nSo [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.0647 M.\n\nAnd [HPO4^2-] = 0.756 [H2PO4^-].\n\nSo substituting:\n\n[H2PO4^-] + 0.756 [H2PO4^-] = 0.0647.\n\n\u2192 1.756 [H2PO4^-] = 0.0647 \u2192 [H2PO4^-] \u2248 0.0647 / 1.756 \u2248 0.0368 M.\n\nThen [HPO4^2-] = 0.756 * 0.0368 \u2248 0.0278 M.\n\nBut again, this gives [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.0278 M, which is way larger than the options provided. So I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about the buffer solution but about the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the third dissociation, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is considering that HPO4^2- can further dissociate into PO4^3- and H+, but that's governed by Ka3, which is 1.8e-12, a very small value. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible.\n\nWait, but the problem is about orthophosphate, which I'm getting confused about. Alternatively, perhaps the question is misworded and actually refers to the concentration of HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but the options are in the 1e-7 range. So maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- ions considering that some of them are dissociating further into PO4^3-.\n\nBut given that Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, the [PO4^3-] would be tiny, but perhaps that's what the question is referring to as orthophosphate.\n\nWait, but orthophosphate is H3PO4, which is the fully protonated form. But in solution, especially in a basic buffer like this, it's mostly deprotonated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, let's think: in the solution, [HPO4^2-] is 0.0278 M. The dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+ is governed by Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nSo, let me write the equilibrium:\n\nHPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.\n\nWe know [H+] is 8.2e-8, from the pH calculation.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nSubstituting:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0278) / (8.2e-8) \u2248 (5.004e-14) / 8.2e-8 \u2248 6.102e-7 M.\n\nAh! So the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.1e-7 M. Looking at the options:\n\nOption A is 6.24e-7, which is close.\n\nBut wait, let me do the calculation more precisely.\n\n[HPO4^2-] was approximately 0.0278 M.\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[H+] = 8.2e-8.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0278) / (8.2e-8).\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.0278 = 5.004e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.2e-8: 5.004e-14 / 8.2e-8 = (5.004 /8.2) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.610 * 1e-6 = 6.10e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.1e-7 M. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but another point: when I calculated [HPO4^2-], I assumed that the buffer equation gives [HPO4^2-] = 0.0278 M. But perhaps I should use more precise numbers.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate the buffer equation more accurately.\n\nWe had:\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.756 * [H2PO4^-].\n\nAnd [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.0647 M.\n\nSo,\n\n[H2PO4^-] + 0.756 [H2PO4^-] = 0.0647 \u2192 1.756 [H2PO4^-] = 0.0647 \u2192 [H2PO4^-] = 0.0647 / 1.756 \u2248 0.0368 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.756 * 0.0368 \u2248 0.0278 M.\n\nSo,\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0278) / (8.2e-8) = ?\n\nLet me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.0278 = 5.004e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.2e-8:\n\n5.004e-14 / 8.2e-8 = (5.004 /8.2) * 1e-6.\n\n5.004 /8.2 \u2248 0.61024.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 6.1024e-7 M.\n\nOption A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the correct answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the buffer system formed by KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions can be a little tricky. But let's see what I can do.\n\nThe problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.\n\nWait, wait. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but the ions are HPO4^2- and PO4^3-. So the orthophosphate ion would be PO4^3-? Or is it HPO4^2-? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look that up. Oh right, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, so PO4^3-.\n\nBut wait, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think is H2PO4^- (because K+ is the counterion). And Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, so that's HPO4^2- (with Na+ as counterions). So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nAh, so this is a buffer solution. Buffer solutions are made from a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. H3PO4 is a weak acid, and it can donate protons in steps. So the species in the solution are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, let me think about the dissociation steps. H3PO4 is triprotic. It dissociates in three steps:\n\n1. H3PO4 \u2194 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)\n2. H2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)\n3. HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)\n\nSo in the solution, we have H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). So the buffer is between the second and third dissociation steps. Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the buffer is between the first and second dissociation. Because KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (from H3PO4 losing one H+) and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (from H2PO4^- losing another H+). So the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which corresponds to Ka2, because that's the step between them. So the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.\n\nSo the buffer equation would be based on Ka2. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation comes to mind: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.\n\nBut wait, the question isn't about the pH. It's about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Hmm, so how does that come into play?\n\nOrthophosphate is PO4^3-. To get that, we need to consider the dissociation of HPO4^2- into H+ and PO4^3-. That's the third dissociation step, with Ka3 of 1.8e-12. So, in the solution, some of the HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3-.\n\nBut the concentration of PO4^3- will be very low because Ka3 is very small. So maybe I can approximate that [PO4^3-] is equal to [HPO4^2-] multiplied by Ka3, assuming that the dissociation is minimal.\n\nWait, but the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So, the PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2- in solution. But the presence of H2PO4^- will affect the pH, which in turn affects how much HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, then use that to find the pH, and then use that pH to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n2. Find concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH (using Ka2).\n4. Using the pH, calculate the concentration of PO4^3- from the dissociation of HPO4^2- (using Ka3).\n5. Find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nStep 1: Moles of each compound.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 is given as 136.09 g/mol. We have 1.00 g.\n\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007345 mol.\n\nSimilarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005614 mol.\n\nStep 2: Concentrations in solution.\n\nVolume is 200 mL = 0.2 L.\n\nConcentration of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007345 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036725 M.\n\nConcentration of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 0.005614 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02807 M.\n\nStep 3: Use Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nKa2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = log(1/6.2) + 7.978 (since 1e-8 has pKa 8, and 6.2 is 0.62e1, so log(6.2) is ~0.792, so pKa2 \u2248 7.978 - 0.792? Wait, wait, no. pKa is -log(Ka).\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.209. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nLog(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 + log( (0.02807) / (0.036725) )\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.02807 / 0.036725 \u2248 0.7646.\n\nLog(0.7646) is approximately -0.115.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.2076 - 0.115 \u2248 7.0926.\n\nSo pH is about 7.09.\n\nStep 4: Calculate [PO4^3-] using Ka3.\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12. The reaction is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.\n\nWe can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] ) / [H+].\n\nWe know [HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M, and [H+] is 10^-pH. pH is 7.09, so [H+] = 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.12e-8 M.\n\nSo plug in the numbers:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.12e-8)\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 \u2248 5.0526e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.12e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 5.0526e-14 / 8.12e-8 \u2248 6.223e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's about 6.22e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps using exact pH calculation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact calculation of the ratio.\n\nWait, when I calculated the ratio, 0.02807 / 0.036725, let me compute that more accurately.\n\n0.02807 / 0.036725 = ?\n\nLet me compute it:\n\n0.02807 \u00f7 0.036725.\n\nLet me write both as 2807 / 36725.\n\nLet me compute 2807 \u00f7 36725.\n\n2807 \u00f7 36725 \u2248 0.07647? Wait, no, wait. 36725 \u00d7 0.076 is about 2789. So 0.07647 is approximately 0.0765? Wait, but earlier I thought it was around 0.7646.\n\nWait no, wait. 2807 is approximately 0.02807, and 36725 is 0.036725. So 0.02807 / 0.036725 = 0.7646? Oh wait, wait, no: 0.02807 is about 0.028, 0.0367 is about 0.0367. 0.028 / 0.0367 = approx 0.764. Oh yes, that's correct. So the ratio is 0.7646.\n\nSo log(0.7646) is log(7.646e-1) = log(7.646) + log(1e-1) = 0.8844 -1 = -0.1156.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 + (-0.1156) = 7.092.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^-7.092 \u2248 8.1e-8 M.\n\nNow, compute [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M.\n\nSo (1.8e-12) * 0.02807 = 5.0526e-14.\n\nDivide by [H+] = 8.1e-8:\n\n5.0526e-14 / 8.1e-8 = (5.0526 /8.1 ) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0526 /8.1 \u2248 0.6237.\n\nSo 0.6237e-6 M = 6.237e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions can be a little tricky. But let's see what I can do.\n\nThe problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.\n\nWait, wait. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but the ions are HPO4^2- and PO4^3-. So the orthophosphate ion would be PO4^3-? Or is it HPO4^2-? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look that up. Oh right, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, so PO4^3-.\n\nBut wait, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think is H2PO4^- (because K+ is the counterion). And Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, so that's HPO4^2- (with Na+ as counterions). So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nAh, so this is a buffer solution. Buffer solutions are made from a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. H3PO4 is a weak acid, and it can donate protons in steps. So the species in the solution are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, let me think about the dissociation steps. H3PO4 is triprotic. It dissociates in three steps:\n\n1. H3PO4 \u2194 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)\n2. H2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)\n3. HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)\n\nSo in the solution, we have H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). So the buffer is between the second and third dissociation steps. Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the buffer is between the first and second dissociation. Because KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (from H3PO4 losing one H+) and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (from H2PO4^- losing another H+). So the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which corresponds to Ka2, because that's the step between them. So the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.\n\nSo the buffer equation would be based on Ka2. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation comes to mind: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.\n\nBut wait, the question isn't about the pH. It's about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Hmm, so how does that come into play?\n\nOrthophosphate is PO4^3-. To get that, we need to consider the dissociation of HPO4^2- into H+ and PO4^3-. That's the third dissociation step, with Ka3 of 1.8e-12. So, in the solution, some of the HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3-.\n\nBut the concentration of PO4^3- will be very low because Ka3 is very small. So maybe I can approximate that [PO4^3-] is equal to [HPO4^2-] multiplied by Ka3, assuming that the dissociation is minimal.\n\nWait, but the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So, the PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2- in solution. But the presence of H2PO4^- will affect the pH, which in turn affects how much HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, then use that to find the pH, and then use that pH to find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O.\n2. Find concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH (using Ka2).\n4. Using the pH, calculate the concentration of PO4^3- from the dissociation of HPO4^2- (using Ka3).\n5. Find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nStep 1: Moles of each compound.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 is given as 136.09 g/mol. We have 1.00 g.\n\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007345 mol.\n\nSimilarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005614 mol.\n\nStep 2: Concentrations in solution.\n\nVolume is 200 mL = 0.2 L.\n\nConcentration of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007345 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036725 M.\n\nConcentration of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 0.005614 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02807 M.\n\nStep 3: Use Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nKa2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = log(1/6.2) + 7.978 (since 1e-8 has pKa 8, and 6.2 is 0.62e1, so log(6.2) is ~0.792, so pKa2 \u2248 7.978 - 0.792? Wait, wait, no. pKa is -log(Ka).\n\nKa2 = 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.209. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nLog(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 + log( (0.02807) / (0.036725) )\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.02807 / 0.036725 \u2248 0.7646.\n\nLog(0.7646) is approximately -0.115.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.2076 - 0.115 \u2248 7.0926.\n\nSo pH is about 7.09.\n\nStep 4: Calculate [PO4^3-] using Ka3.\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12. The reaction is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nThe expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.\n\nWe can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] ) / [H+].\n\nWe know [HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M, and [H+] is 10^-pH. pH is 7.09, so [H+] = 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.12e-8 M.\n\nSo plug in the numbers:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.12e-8)\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 \u2248 5.0526e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.12e-8.\n\nSo [PO4^3-] \u2248 5.0526e-14 / 8.12e-8 \u2248 6.223e-7 M.\n\nWait, that's about 6.22e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps using exact pH calculation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact calculation of the ratio.\n\nWait, when I calculated the ratio, 0.02807 / 0.036725, let me compute that more accurately.\n\n0.02807 / 0.036725 = ?\n\nLet me compute it:\n\n0.02807 \u00f7 0.036725.\n\nLet me write both as 2807 / 36725.\n\nLet me compute 2807 \u00f7 36725.\n\n2807 \u00f7 36725 \u2248 0.07647? Wait, no, wait. 36725 \u00d7 0.076 is about 2789. So 0.07647 is approximately 0.0765? Wait, but earlier I thought it was around 0.7646.\n\nWait no, wait. 2807 is approximately 0.02807, and 36725 is 0.036725. So 0.02807 / 0.036725 = 0.7646? Oh wait, wait, no: 0.02807 is about 0.028, 0.0367 is about 0.0367. 0.028 / 0.0367 = approx 0.764. Oh yes, that's correct. So the ratio is 0.7646.\n\nSo log(0.7646) is log(7.646e-1) = log(7.646) + log(1e-1) = 0.8844 -1 = -0.1156.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 + (-0.1156) = 7.092.\n\nSo [H+] = 10^-7.092 \u2248 8.1e-8 M.\n\nNow, compute [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M.\n\nSo (1.8e-12) * 0.02807 = 5.0526e-14.\n\nDivide by [H+] = 8.1e-8:\n\n5.0526e-14 / 8.1e-8 = (5.0526 /8.1 ) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0526 /8.1 \u2248 0.6237.\n\nSo 0.6237e-6 M = 6.237e-7 M.\n\nWhich is approximately 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The question is about orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.\n\nSo the concentration is about 6.24e-7 M, which matches option A.\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps using the approximation that [PO4^3-] is negligible compared to [HPO4^2-], but in this case, we're correctly applying the formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the buffer pH affects the degree of dissociation.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: considering the solution as a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is around 7.09. Now, HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+, but the concentration of H+ is 8.1e-8, so let's compute [PO4^3-].\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M.\n\nThe reaction is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].\n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nPlugging the numbers in, as before, gives ~6.24e-7 M.\n\nSo the answer should be A) 6.24x10^-7 M.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\nB)5.48x10^-7\nC)2.81x10^-7\nD)3.97x10^-7\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-.\n\nThe problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm\u00b3 (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, and we're given the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.\n\nWait, so H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It can donate three protons. The first dissociation is H3PO4 \u2192 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1). The second is H2PO4^- \u2192 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2). The third is HPO4^2- \u2192 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3).\n\nIn this solution, we have two phosphate species: KH2PO4 (which is K+ H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O (which is 2 Na+ HPO4^2- plus two H2O). So, these are the dihydrogen phosphate and hydrogen phosphate ions. \n\nI think this is a buffer solution problem because we have two adjacent species in the dissociation series of H3PO4. Specifically, H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are involved. So the solution is a buffer between the first and second dissociation steps.\n\nThe buffer equation is probably the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid would be H2PO4^- and the base would be HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but wait, the HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-, because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-. So yes, HPO4^2- is the base and H2PO4^- is the acid in this buffer system. So the relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. The pKa2 would be log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.207.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the pKa is calculated as -log(Ka). So for Ka2=6.2e-8, pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that. Log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 0.79 - 7 (since 1e-7 is 7) would be about 7.21? Wait, no: 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8. So log(6.2) is approximately 0.792, so the exponent is -8. So log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) \u2192 0.792 -8 = -7.208. So pKa is 7.208.\n\nWait, no, pKa is the negative log of Ka. So pKa2 = -log(Ka2) = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.208. Got it.\n\nNow, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nBut wait, we don't know the pH yet. Hmm. So perhaps we can find the pH using another approach. Alternatively, maybe the solution is to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- (orthophosphate), which is the third deprotonation. But wait, in this solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, wait. The problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. But in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but can any of them further dissociate to form PO4^3-? Let's think. HPO4^2- can lose another H+ to become PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low compared to HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, perhaps the orthophosphate concentration comes from the HPO4^2- dissociating further. But since Ka3 is so small, the contribution would be minimal. So, the main source is the HPO4^2- in solution.\n\nWait, but wait. Maybe the solution is considering the system in terms of all phosphate species. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a bit more complicated because we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which will affect the pH and the concentrations of each phosphate species.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the moles of each phosphate species in solution.\n2. Determine the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n3. Use the buffer equation to find the pH.\n4. Then, determine the concentration of PO4^3- using the Ka3 value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and then find the pH, which would then help in determining the concentrations of PO4^3-.\n\nLet me compute the moles first.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007336 mol.\n\nSimilarly, moles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005604 mol.\n\nWait, but wait. The formula for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is Na2(HPO4)\u00b72H2O. So the formula unit is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. So each mole of this substance provides one mole of HPO4^2-.\n\nSimilarly, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.\n\nSo, in solution, the moles of H2PO4^- are approximately 0.007336 mol, and the moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005604 mol.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. The solution's volume is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005604 / 0.2 = 0.02802 M.\n\nWait, but that's the initial concentrations. However, these will react with water, but considering the buffer system, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation will help find the pH, which in turn affects the distribution of phosphate species.\n\nSo, applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\npH = 7.208 + log(0.02802 / 0.03668).\n\nCompute the ratio: 0.02802 / 0.03668 \u2248 0.764.\n\nLog(0.764) \u2248 -0.116.\n\nSo, pH \u2248 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the pH of the solution.\n\nNow, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nBecause HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-. The reaction is:\n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+.\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nThe expression for Ka3 is [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].\n\nWe can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nWe have Ka3 = 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02802 M (but wait, no. Because in solution, some HPO4^2- will dissociate. But wait, the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.02802 M, but when considering the pH, we can find the actual concentration after considering the H+ ions.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAt pH 7.092, the H+ concentration is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.092) \u2248 8.27e-8 M.\n\nSo [H+] = 8.27e-8.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / (8.27e-8).\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02802 \u2248 5.0436e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.27e-8: 5.0436e-14 / 8.27e-8 \u2248 6.095e-7.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] \u2248 6.1e-7 M.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me recompute that.\n\nThe ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02802 / 0.03668.\n\nCalculating that: 0.02802 / 0.03668 = 0.764.\n\nLog(0.764) is about log(0.764) = log(7.64e-1) = log(7.64) + log(1e-1) \u2192 0.8843 - 1 = -0.1157.\n\nSo, pH = 7.208 - 0.1157 = 7.0923.\n\nWhich is about 7.09.\n\nSo [H+] is 10^(-7.09) \u2248 8.27e-8 M.\n\nThen, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / 8.27e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02802 = 5.0436e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.27e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0436e-14 / 8.27e-8 = approximately 6.095e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in any step?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exact values without approximations.\n\nLet me recalculate the moles.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007336 mol.\n\nMolar mass of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005604 mol.\n\nConcentration of H2PO4^-: 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.\n\nConcentration of HPO4^2-: 0.005604 / 0.2 = 0.02802 M.\n\nSo, the ratio is 0.02802 / 0.03668 = 0.764.\n\nLog(0.764) is approximately -0.116.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.092) \u2248 8.27e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / 8.27e-8.\n\nCalculate 1.8e-12 * 0.02802:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.02802 = (1.8 * 0.02802) * 1e-12 = (0.050436) * 1e-12 = 5.0436e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.27e-8:\n\n5.0436e-14 / 8.27e-8 = (5.0436 / 8.27) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0436 / 8.27 is approximately 0.609.\n\nSo 0.609e-6 = 6.09e-7 M.\n\nHmm, none of the options exactly match this. The closest is option A: 6.24e-7, but that's a bit higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the exact pH without rounding.\n\nLet me compute the exact ratio and the exact pH.\n\nThe ratio is 0.02802 / 0.03668 = 0.764.\n\nWait, let me compute log(0.764) more accurately.\n\nLog(0.764) = log(7.64 * 1e-1) = log(7.64) + log(1e-1) = 0.8843 -1 = -0.1157.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 -0.1157 =7.0923.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.0923).\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.0923):\n\nFirst, 7.0923 = 7 + 0.0923.\n\nSo 10^(-7.0923) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.0923).\n\nCompute 10^(-0.0923):\n\nln(10^(-0.0923))= -0.0923 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.0923 * 2.3026 \u2248 -0.2125.\n\nSo exp(-0.2125) \u2248 0.808.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 10^(-0.0923) using a calculator approach.\n\nI know that 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794. 0.0923 is a bit less than 0.1, so 10^(-0.0923) is a bit higher than 0.794. Let's approximate it as 0.808.\n\nSo, 10^(-7.0923) \u2248 8.08e-8 M.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 8.27e-8. Let me check with more precise calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: using log tables or a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of 10^(-0.0923) as approximately e^(-0.0923 * ln(10)).\n\nln(10) is about 2.302585.\n\nSo, 0.0923 * 2.302585 \u2248 0.2125.\n\nSo, e^(-0.2125) \u2248 1 - 0.2125 + (0.2125^2)/2 - (0.2125^3)/6.\n\nWait, using the Taylor series for e^-x where x is 0.2125.\n\ne^-x \u2248 1 - x + x\u00b2/2 - x\u00b3/6 + x^4/24 - ...\n\nx=0.2125:\n\n1st term: 1\n\n2nd: -0.2125 \u2192 0.7875\n\n3rd: (0.2125)^2 / 2 \u2192 0.045156/2 = 0.022578 \u2192 0.810078\n\n4th: -(0.2125)^3 /6 \u2192 0.009594 /6 \u2248 0.001599 \u2192 subtract that: 0.810078 - 0.001599 \u2248 0.808479.\n\n5th term: (0.2125)^4 /24 \u2192 (0.002035) /24 \u2248 0.00008479 \u2192 add that: 0.8085638.\n\nSo, e^-0.2125 \u2248 0.80856.\n\nSo, 10^(-0.0923) \u2248 0.80856.\n\nThus, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.80856 \u2248 8.0856e-8 M.\n\nSo, [H+] = 8.0856e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / (8.0856e-8).\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02802 = 5.0436e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.0856e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0436e-14 / 8.0856e-8 = (5.0436 / 8.0856) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0436 / 8.0856 \u2248 0.6237.\n\nSo, 0.6237e-6 = 6.237e-7 M.\n\nAh, that's about 6.24e-7 M, which matches option A.\n\nWait, but why did I get a different result when I used a slightly less accurate [H+] earlier? Because I approximated [H+] as 8.27e-8, which gave me 6.09e-7. But using a more accurate [H+] of 8.0856e-8 gives me 6.237e-7, which rounds to 6.24e-7.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB)5.48x10^-7 M \n\nC)2.81x10^-7 M \n\nD)3.97x10^-7 M \n\nSo, option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Are there any other factors I might have missed?\n\nAnother thing to consider: the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. But when they're in solution, they can form a buffer, which affects the pH, which in turn affects the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but the approach I took considered all that. So, yes, the concentration of PO4^3- is about 6.24e-7 M, so option A is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-.\n\nThe problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm\u00b3 (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25\u00b0C, and we're given the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.\n\nWait, so H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It can donate three protons. The first dissociation is H3PO4 \u2192 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1). The second is H2PO4^- \u2192 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2). The third is HPO4^2- \u2192 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3).\n\nIn this solution, we have two phosphate species: KH2PO4 (which is K+ H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O (which is 2 Na+ HPO4^2- plus two H2O). So, these are the dihydrogen phosphate and hydrogen phosphate ions. \n\nI think this is a buffer solution problem because we have two adjacent species in the dissociation series of H3PO4. Specifically, H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are involved. So the solution is a buffer between the first and second dissociation steps.\n\nThe buffer equation is probably the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid would be H2PO4^- and the base would be HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but wait, the HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-, because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-. So yes, HPO4^2- is the base and H2PO4^- is the acid in this buffer system. So the relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. The pKa2 would be log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.207.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the pKa is calculated as -log(Ka). So for Ka2=6.2e-8, pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that. Log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 0.79 - 7 (since 1e-7 is 7) would be about 7.21? Wait, no: 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8. So log(6.2) is approximately 0.792, so the exponent is -8. So log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) \u2192 0.792 -8 = -7.208. So pKa is 7.208.\n\nWait, no, pKa is the negative log of Ka. So pKa2 = -log(Ka2) = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.208. Got it.\n\nNow, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).\n\nBut wait, we don't know the pH yet. Hmm. So perhaps we can find the pH using another approach. Alternatively, maybe the solution is to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- (orthophosphate), which is the third deprotonation. But wait, in this solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, wait. The problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. But in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but can any of them further dissociate to form PO4^3-? Let's think. HPO4^2- can lose another H+ to become PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low compared to HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, perhaps the orthophosphate concentration comes from the HPO4^2- dissociating further. But since Ka3 is so small, the contribution would be minimal. So, the main source is the HPO4^2- in solution.\n\nWait, but wait. Maybe the solution is considering the system in terms of all phosphate species. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a bit more complicated because we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which will affect the pH and the concentrations of each phosphate species.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the moles of each phosphate species in solution.\n2. Determine the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n3. Use the buffer equation to find the pH.\n4. Then, determine the concentration of PO4^3- using the Ka3 value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and then find the pH, which would then help in determining the concentrations of PO4^3-.\n\nLet me compute the moles first.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007336 mol.\n\nSimilarly, moles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005604 mol.\n\nWait, but wait. The formula for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is Na2(HPO4)\u00b72H2O. So the formula unit is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. So each mole of this substance provides one mole of HPO4^2-.\n\nSimilarly, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.\n\nSo, in solution, the moles of H2PO4^- are approximately 0.007336 mol, and the moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005604 mol.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. The solution's volume is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters.\n\nSo, concentrations:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005604 / 0.2 = 0.02802 M.\n\nWait, but that's the initial concentrations. However, these will react with water, but considering the buffer system, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation will help find the pH, which in turn affects the distribution of phosphate species.\n\nSo, applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\npH = 7.208 + log(0.02802 / 0.03668).\n\nCompute the ratio: 0.02802 / 0.03668 \u2248 0.764.\n\nLog(0.764) \u2248 -0.116.\n\nSo, pH \u2248 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.\n\nWait, but wait, that's the pH of the solution.\n\nNow, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nBecause HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-. The reaction is:\n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+.\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nThe expression for Ka3 is [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].\n\nWe can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nWe have Ka3 = 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02802 M (but wait, no. Because in solution, some HPO4^2- will dissociate. But wait, the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.02802 M, but when considering the pH, we can find the actual concentration after considering the H+ ions.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAt pH 7.092, the H+ concentration is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.092) \u2248 8.27e-8 M.\n\nSo [H+] = 8.27e-8.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / (8.27e-8).\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02802 \u2248 5.0436e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.27e-8: 5.0436e-14 / 8.27e-8 \u2248 6.095e-7.\n\nSo, [PO4^3-] \u2248 6.1e-7 M.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me recompute that.\n\nThe ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02802 / 0.03668.\n\nCalculating that: 0.02802 / 0.03668 = 0.764.\n\nLog(0.764) is about log(0.764) = log(7.64e-1) = log(7.64) + log(1e-1) \u2192 0.8843 - 1 = -0.1157.\n\nSo, pH = 7.208 - 0.1157 = 7.0923.\n\nWhich is about 7.09.\n\nSo [H+] is 10^(-7.09) \u2248 8.27e-8 M.\n\nThen, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / 8.27e-8.\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02802 = 5.0436e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.27e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0436e-14 / 8.27e-8 = approximately 6.095e-7 M.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in any step?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exact values without approximations.\n\nLet me recalculate the moles.\n\nMolar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol.\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007336 mol.\n\nMolar mass of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 177.99 g/mol.\n\nMoles: 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005604 mol.\n\nConcentration of H2PO4^-: 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.\n\nConcentration of HPO4^2-: 0.005604 / 0.2 = 0.02802 M.\n\nSo, the ratio is 0.02802 / 0.03668 = 0.764.\n\nLog(0.764) is approximately -0.116.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.092) \u2248 8.27e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / 8.27e-8.\n\nCalculate 1.8e-12 * 0.02802:\n\n1.8e-12 * 0.02802 = (1.8 * 0.02802) * 1e-12 = (0.050436) * 1e-12 = 5.0436e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.27e-8:\n\n5.0436e-14 / 8.27e-8 = (5.0436 / 8.27) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0436 / 8.27 is approximately 0.609.\n\nSo 0.609e-6 = 6.09e-7 M.\n\nHmm, none of the options exactly match this. The closest is option A: 6.24e-7, but that's a bit higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the exact pH without rounding.\n\nLet me compute the exact ratio and the exact pH.\n\nThe ratio is 0.02802 / 0.03668 = 0.764.\n\nWait, let me compute log(0.764) more accurately.\n\nLog(0.764) = log(7.64 * 1e-1) = log(7.64) + log(1e-1) = 0.8843 -1 = -0.1157.\n\nSo pH = 7.208 -0.1157 =7.0923.\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.0923).\n\nLet me compute 10^(-7.0923):\n\nFirst, 7.0923 = 7 + 0.0923.\n\nSo 10^(-7.0923) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.0923).\n\nCompute 10^(-0.0923):\n\nln(10^(-0.0923))= -0.0923 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.0923 * 2.3026 \u2248 -0.2125.\n\nSo exp(-0.2125) \u2248 0.808.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 10^(-0.0923) using a calculator approach.\n\nI know that 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794. 0.0923 is a bit less than 0.1, so 10^(-0.0923) is a bit higher than 0.794. Let's approximate it as 0.808.\n\nSo, 10^(-7.0923) \u2248 8.08e-8 M.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 8.27e-8. Let me check with more precise calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: using log tables or a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of 10^(-0.0923) as approximately e^(-0.0923 * ln(10)).\n\nln(10) is about 2.302585.\n\nSo, 0.0923 * 2.302585 \u2248 0.2125.\n\nSo, e^(-0.2125) \u2248 1 - 0.2125 + (0.2125^2)/2 - (0.2125^3)/6.\n\nWait, using the Taylor series for e^-x where x is 0.2125.\n\ne^-x \u2248 1 - x + x\u00b2/2 - x\u00b3/6 + x^4/24 - ...\n\nx=0.2125:\n\n1st term: 1\n\n2nd: -0.2125 \u2192 0.7875\n\n3rd: (0.2125)^2 / 2 \u2192 0.045156/2 = 0.022578 \u2192 0.810078\n\n4th: -(0.2125)^3 /6 \u2192 0.009594 /6 \u2248 0.001599 \u2192 subtract that: 0.810078 - 0.001599 \u2248 0.808479.\n\n5th term: (0.2125)^4 /24 \u2192 (0.002035) /24 \u2248 0.00008479 \u2192 add that: 0.8085638.\n\nSo, e^-0.2125 \u2248 0.80856.\n\nSo, 10^(-0.0923) \u2248 0.80856.\n\nThus, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.80856 \u2248 8.0856e-8 M.\n\nSo, [H+] = 8.0856e-8.\n\nNow, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / (8.0856e-8).\n\nCalculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02802 = 5.0436e-14.\n\nDenominator: 8.0856e-8.\n\nSo, 5.0436e-14 / 8.0856e-8 = (5.0436 / 8.0856) * 1e-6.\n\n5.0436 / 8.0856 \u2248 0.6237.\n\nSo, 0.6237e-6 = 6.237e-7 M.\n\nAh, that's about 6.24e-7 M, which matches option A.\n\nWait, but why did I get a different result when I used a slightly less accurate [H+] earlier? Because I approximated [H+] as 8.27e-8, which gave me 6.09e-7. But using a more accurate [H+] of 8.0856e-8 gives me 6.237e-7, which rounds to 6.24e-7.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but wait, the options are:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB)5.48x10^-7 M \n\nC)2.81x10^-7 M \n\nD)3.97x10^-7 M \n\nSo, option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Are there any other factors I might have missed?\n\nAnother thing to consider: the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. But when they're in solution, they can form a buffer, which affects the pH, which in turn affects the concentration of PO4^3-.\n\nWait, but the approach I took considered all that. So, yes, the concentration of PO4^3- is about 6.24e-7 M, so option A is correct.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we analyze the given data and apply relevant chemical principles:\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Solution Composition**:\n   - Volume: 200.00 cm\u00b3 (0.2 L).\n   - Mass of KH\u2082PO\u2084: 1.00 g (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol).\n   - Mass of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O: 1.00 g (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol).\n\n2. **Phosphate Species**:\n   - KH\u2082PO\u2084 dissociates into K\u207a and H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b.\n   - Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O dissociates into 2Na\u207a and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b.\n\n3. **Moles of Phosphate Species**:\n   - Moles of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Moles} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Molar Mass}} = \\frac{1.00}{136.09} \\approx 0.007336 \\, \\text{mol}.\n     \\]\n   - Moles of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Moles} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Molar Mass}} = \\frac{1.00}{177.99} \\approx 0.005604 \\, \\text{mol}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Concentrations in Solution**:\n   - \\([H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b]\\):  \n     \\[\n     [H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b] = \\frac{\\text{Moles}}{\\text{Volume (L)}} = \\frac{0.007336}{0.2} \\approx 0.03668 \\, \\text{M}.\n     \\]\n   - \\([HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b]\\):  \n     \\[\n     [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] = \\frac{\\text{Moles}}{\\text{Volume (L)}} = \\frac{0.005604}{0.2} \\approx 0.02802 \\, \\text{M}.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Buffer System and pH Calculation**:\n   - The solution is a buffer involving H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b (acid) and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b (base), with the second dissociation constant of H\u2083PO\u2084 (\\(K_a2 = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8}\\)).\n   - Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{pH} = \\text{p}K_a2 + \\log\\left(\\frac{[HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b]}{[H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b]}\\right).\n     \\]\n   - \\(\\text{p}K_a2 = -\\log(K_a2) = -\\log(6.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\approx 7.208\\).\n   - Ratio:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{[HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b]}{[H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b]} = \\frac{0.02802}{0.03668} \\approx 0.764.\n     \\]\n   - \\(\\log(0.764) \\approx -0.116\\), so:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Concentration of PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b**:\n   - PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b is formed when HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b loses a proton:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b} \\leftrightarrow \\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b} + \\text{H\u207a}.\n     \\]\n   - The third dissociation constant of H\u2083PO\u2084 is \\(K_a3 = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12}\\).\n   - Using the expression for \\(K_a3\\):  \n     \\[\n     K_a3 = \\frac{[\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}][\\text{H\u207a}]}{[\\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b}]}.\n     \\]\n   - Rearranging for \\([\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}]\\):  \n     \\[\n     [\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}] = \\frac{K_a3 \\cdot [\\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b}]}{[\\text{H\u207a}]}.\n     \\]\n   - \\([\\text{H\u207a}] = 10^{-\\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \\approx 8.0856 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{M}\\).\n   - Substituting values:  \n     \\[\n     [\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}] = \\frac{(1.8 \\times 10^{-12}) \\cdot (0.02802)}{8.0856 \\times 10^{-8}}.\n     \\]\n   - Numerator:  \n     \\[\n     1.8 \\times 10^{-12} \\cdot 0.02802 \\approx 5.0436 \\times 10^{-14}.\n     \\]\n   - Denominator:  \n     \\[\n     8.0856 \\times 10^{-8}.\n     \\]\n   - Final calculation:  \n     \\[\n     [\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}] = \\frac{5.0436 \\times 10^{-14}}{8.0856 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 6.24 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}.\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution is approximately **6.24 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 M**, which corresponds to **Option A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
