      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but let's try to think it through. Alright, the question is about stars with and without dark spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels.\n\nHmm, let's start by breaking down the problem. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, does that mean the spots are cooler regions? Because if the overall temperature goes down, the spots must be areas where the temperature is lower than the surrounding photosphere.\n\nThe main point of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Without spots, this ratio is higher, and it decreases when spots are present. The ratio they're talking about is level 1 to level 2, I think. So when the star has spots, the ratio drops.\n\nThe problem asks for the factor by which this ratio changes. So, when the star doesn't have spots (normal state), what's the ratio compared to when it does have spots.\n\nI remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n2/n1) is equal to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Here, g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of the levels, and E2 > E1 because higher energy is level 2.\n\nWait, but in the problem, when the Teff decreases, the ratio decreases. So let me think: when the temperature goes down, how does the ratio of n2 to n1 change?\n\nThe exponent is -(E2-E1)/(kT). If temperature T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp of a more negative number is smaller. So the ratio n2/n1 would decrease because the exponential factor is getting smaller. That makes sense because lower temperatures mean fewer atoms have enough energy to be in the higher energy level. So when the star has spots, T_eff drops, so the ratio (n2/n1) goes down.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So we have to compare the ratios at 6000 K and 5500 K.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The star isn't uniformly at 5500 K. 40% of its surface is covered by spots, which I assume are cooler, and the rest is at 6000 K. But the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, but for the purpose of this problem, maybe we can model it as the star having an average temperature of 5500 K. Or perhaps, more accurately, the problem is considering the photosphere as a single temperature, which is the effective temperature. So perhaps when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall emission is such that the effective temperature is 5500 K.\n\nWait, but the star's photosphere is in LTE, so each region (spot and non-spot) is in LTE, but the overall observed flux is a combination of these regions. But when they talk about the ratio of Ti atoms, are they considering the average over the entire photosphere? Hmm, maybe not. Because the spots are cooler, the Ti atoms in the spots would be in a different ratio than the rest. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K, so perhaps the question is treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature, say T_spot, and the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. The overall effective temperature would be a combination of these two areas. So 40% of the surface is at T_spot, 60% at 6000 K. But the problem states that the overall effective temperature is 5500 K, so perhaps we can find T_spot from that.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't ask for the spot temperature; it's more about the ratio of the Ti levels when the star is spotted versus not. So maybe the question is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. Alternatively, perhaps the star's average temperature is 5500 K when 40% spots are present, but each spot has a lower temperature, and the rest is 6000 K.\n\nBut the way the problem is phrased, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So maybe the effective temperature is an average of the two regions. Hmm, but how is the effective temperature calculated? It's the fourth root of the average of the fourth powers of the temperatures, weighted by area. Because flux is proportional to T^4.\n\nSo the effective temperature T_eff is given by:\n\nT_eff^4 = (f * T_spot^4 + (1-f) * T_unspotted^4 )\n\nWhere f is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. In this case, f = 0.4.\n\nWait, so when the star has 40% spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So,\n\n5500^4 = 0.4 * T_spot^4 + 0.6 * 6000^4.\n\nWait, that's an equation we can solve for T_spot. But do we need T_spot for this problem? Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem is about the ratio of Ti levels in the photosphere. When spots are present, the photosphere has a mix of areas at different temperatures. But in LTE, each region emits according to its own temperature. But the question says that the ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels decreases when the star has spots.\n\nWait, but the ratio in the photosphere would be a weighted average of the ratios in the spotted and unspotted regions. Because the spots and the surrounding photosphere are at different temperatures, their Ti level ratios would be different.\n\nBut the problem says that the overall ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the entire photosphere is at 6000 K, so the ratio is based on 6000 K. When spots are present, part of the photosphere is at a lower temperature (T_spot), and part is at 6000 K.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio, it decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the effective temperature is 5500 K, so the photosphere is considered as a single temperature of 5500 K when spots are present. Because otherwise, if the photosphere is a mix of temperatures, the ratio would be a combination of the two. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is treated as being at 5500 K.\n\nBut wait, that might not make sense. Because the spots are cooler than the surrounding, so the overall Teff would be lower. But the question says the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered.\n\nSo perhaps the way to model this is that the observed effective temperature is 5500 K, which is an average of the two regions. So the star's photosphere is a mix of two regions: 40% at T_spot and 60% at 6000 K.\n\nBut how does that affect the observed ratio of Ti levels?\n\nWait, but the question says that in the photosphere, when there are spots, the ratio decreases. So perhaps the ratio is a combination of the two regions. Let me think: the ratio without spots is n1/n2 (or n2/n1, depending on which level is higher) at 6000 K. When spots are present, the ratio would be a combination of the ratios at 6000 K and T_spot.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the combined ratio is lower than when all the photosphere is at 6000 K.\n\nBut the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels. Let's denote level 1 as lower energy and level 2 as higher. So the ratio n2/n1 is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ).\n\nWhen T decreases, exp becomes smaller, so n2/n1 decreases. So if the photosphere is a mix of T1=6000 and T2 (lower), then the overall ratio would be a weighted average of the individual ratios.\n\nWait, but how exactly? Because each region's ratio is n2/n1 for that temperature, and the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average, perhaps?\n\nWait, no, because the number of atoms depends on the area and the temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is a sum over the contributions from each region, but considering their emission.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, so the ratio is evaluated at 5500 K. Let's check that.\n\nIn that case, the ratio when spots are present would be at T=5500 K, and when not present, T=6000 K. So the factor would be (ratio at 6000) / (ratio at 5500) = [ (g2/g1) exp(-dE/(k*6000)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-dE/(k*5500)) ] = exp( dE/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nWait, but dE is E2-E1. Let me compute that exponent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the factor is the ratio of the ratios: (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.\n\nWhich would be [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ] = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )\n\nWait, let's compute the exponent.\n\nE2-E1 is the energy difference. The wavelength is 1448 \u00c5, so we can find the energy using E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant, c speed of light. 1448 \u00c5 is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nE = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) ) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1.448e-7) )\n\nCalculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.\n\nDivide by denominator 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.\n\nBut 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E in eV is 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nSo E2-E1 \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nNow, the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)\n\nk is Boltzmann constant, 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nCompute (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500 / (3.3e7) ) = approx 1.515e-5 1/K.\n\nSo the exponent becomes:\n\n8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * 1.515e-5 1/K.\n\nCompute 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = approx 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99413 K.\n\nMultiply by 1.515e-5: 99413 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 1.504.\n\nSo the exponent is about 1.504.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.504) \u2248 e^1.504 \u2248 4.5.\n\nBecause e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.48, which is approximately 4.5.\n\nSo the ratio when the star has no spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it does have spots.\n\nWait, but the question is, what's the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So that's (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = 4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So that's the answer.\n",

So let me think: when the temperature goes down, how does the ratio of n2 to n1 change?\n\nThe exponent is -(E2-E1)/(kT). If temperature T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp of a more negative number is smaller. So the ratio n2/n1 would decrease because the exponential factor is getting smaller. That makes sense because lower temperatures mean fewer atoms have enough energy to be in the higher energy level.

The wavelength is 1448 \u00c5, so we can find the energy using E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant, c speed of light. 1448 \u00c5 is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nE = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) ) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1.448e-7) )\n\nCalculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.\n\nDivide by denominator 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.\n\nBut 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E in eV is 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nSo E2-E1 \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nNow, the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)\n\nk is Boltzmann constant, 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nCompute (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500 / (3.3e7) ) = approx 1.515e-5 1/K.\n\nSo the exponent becomes:\n\n8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * 1.515e-5 1/K.\n\nCompute 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = approx 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 99413 K.\n\nMultiply by 1.515e-5: 99413 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 1.504.\n\nSo the exponent is about 1.504.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.504) \u2248 e^1.504 \u2248 4.5.\n\nBecause e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.48, which is approximately 4.5.\n\nSo the ratio when the star has no spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it does have spots.\n\nWait, but the question is, what's the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So that's (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = 4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So that's the answer.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( g_2 \\) and \\( g_1 \\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \\( E_2 - E_1 \\) is the energy difference between the levels, \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \\( T \\) is the temperature.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. When the star has no spots, the effective temperature \\( T \\) is 6000 K.\n2. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature \\( T \\) decreases to 5500 K.\n3. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5, which allows us to calculate the energy difference \\( E_2 - E_1 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the energy difference \\( E_2 - E_1 \\)\nThe energy difference is derived from the wavelength using the relation:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) is Planck's constant (\\( 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s} \\)), \\( c \\) is the speed of light (\\( 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)), and \\( \\lambda = 1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5} = 1448 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m} \\). Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34})(3 \\times 10^8)}{1448 \\times 10^{-10}} = 1.373 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}.\n\\]\n\nConverting to electron volts (\\( 1 \\, \\text{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\)):\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1.373 \\times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 8.57 \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( E_2 - E_1 = 8.57 \\, \\text{eV} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the Boltzmann factors\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)_{6000}}{\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)_{5500}} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k \\cdot 6000}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k \\cdot 5500}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000}\\right)\\right).\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( E_2 - E_1 = 8.57 \\, \\text{eV} \\) and \\( k = 8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/K} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \\frac{8.57}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 99413 \\, \\text{K}.\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate \\( \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\cdot 6000} = \\frac{500}{33000000} \\approx 1.515 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{K}^{-1}.\n\\]\n\nNow, compute the exponent:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000}\\right) = 99413 \\cdot 1.515 \\times 10^{-5} \\approx 1.504.\n\\]\n\nFinally, calculate the factor:\n\n\\[\n\\exp(1.504) \\approx 4.5.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to tackle. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe question is about a star's properties when it has spots versus when it doesn't. So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. \n\nWait, but I think I should clarify: the spots are cooler regions, right? So when the spots cover part of the surface, the star's overall emission changes. But how does that affect the photospheric effective temperature? Oh, right, the effective temperature is related to the total luminosity. When spots cover part of the surface, the star emits less total flux, so the effective temperature decreases. But I think the question says that when the spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K.\n\nNow, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is given as level 1 to level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The task is to find the factor by which this ratio changes\u2014no spots to when it has spots. So, factor = ratio without spots / ratio with spots.\n\nHmm. Okay, the ratio is about the populations of two energy levels. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. \n\nSince the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I can use the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations. The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. Let me think: the ratio is n1/n2. So if n1/n2 decreases, that means either n1 goes down, n2 goes up, or both. How does temperature affect this ratio?\n\nThe Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Let's denote \u0394E = E2 - E1. So, if \u0394E is positive (which it is, since E2 is higher), then as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, making the ratio larger. So, a higher temperature leads to a higher ratio of n1/n2 because the exponential term increases. \n\nWait, no. Let me get this right. The ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ). So, if T increases, exp(-\u0394E/(k T)) increases because the denominator is bigger, making the exponent less negative. So, n1/n2 increases when T increases. So, when the star has spots, its overall Teff is lower (5500 K vs 6000 K). So, the ratio n1/n2 would be lower when Teff is lower. Which matches the observation in the question: the ratio decreases when there are spots.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But are the spots themselves cooler? Because the presence of spots reduces the overall Teff. So, the photosphere without spots is at 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. \n\nWait, no, maybe that's not exactly accurate. Because the star's surface is a mix of spotted and unspotted regions. But the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere as a whole. Hmm, but wait, when the star has spots, some regions are cooler (spots) and others are hotter (the rest). But the overall photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. So, does that mean that the entire photosphere's average temperature is lower, or is the effective temperature an average of the flux?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying things by assuming that the entire photosphere's temperature drops to 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the presence of spots affects the observed spectrum because the spots are cooler and emit less flux, but the photosphere itself isn't uniformly at 5500 K. Hmm, but the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is spotted. So perhaps the effective temperature is the average, but the actual temperature of the unspotted regions remains at 6000 K.\n\nWait, but if the spots cover 40% of the surface, then the remaining 60% is at 6000 K. Let me think about the effective temperature. The effective temperature of a star is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 Teff^4. So, the total luminosity is the sum of the contributions from the spotted and unspotted regions.\n\nSo, when 40% is spotted, the total luminosity is:\n\nL = 0.6 * L_unspotted + 0.4 * L_spotted.\n\nAssuming that the unspotted regions have Teff 6000 K, and the spotted regions have a lower Teff, say T_spot. Then,\n\nL_unspotted = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 * 0.6,\n\nL_spotted = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 (T_spot)^4 * 0.4.\n\nWait, no, because each region has its own area. So the total luminosity would be:\n\nL = (0.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * (T_spot)^4) * 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3.\n\nAnd the overall Teff is 5500 K, so:\n\nL = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 (5500)^4.\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4 = (5500)^4.\n\nSo, I can solve for T_spot.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the ratio of Ti levels in the photosphere. If the photosphere is a mix of regions at 6000 K and cooler spots, perhaps the observed ratio is a combination of the two. But the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So maybe the assumption is that the photosphere's temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise. But that's perhaps an approximation, because in reality, the star's surface is not at uniform temperature.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can model the ratio as being determined by the effective temperature. Because the observed ratio is in the photosphere, which is now at 5500 K when spots are present.\n\nSo, the ratio when no spots: T1 = 6000 K.\n\nRatio when spots: T2 = 5500 K.\n\nThe ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), multiplied by (g1/g2). But the question says that the ratio decreases when spots are present, so T is lower. So, the ratio n1/n2 is lower.\n\nBut the problem gives that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. So, I can compute the energy difference \u0394E from the wavelength.\n\nThe energy of a photon is E = hc/\u03bb. So, \u0394E = hc / \u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 m.\n\nCompute \u0394E:\n\n\u0394E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) \n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approx 1.373e-18 J.\n\nBut wait, to make it in terms of eV because that's easier for Boltzmann factors. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo \u0394E in eV is (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nHmm, that seems high. Wait, 1448 \u00c5 is about 0.1448 nm, which is in the near UV. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo, \u0394E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) \n\n6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDivided by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 /1.448e-7 \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nWhich is 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 8.57 eV. Hmm, that's correct. So \u0394E is about 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, but that's a pretty large energy difference between the two levels. But okay, perhaps that's the case.\n\nNow, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant (8.617e-5 eV/K).\n\nSo, for each temperature (6000 K and 5500 K), compute the exponent.\n\nFirst, for T1 = 6000 K:\n\n\u0394E/(k T1) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) \n\nCalculate denominator: 8.617e-5 * 6e3 = 0.517 eV.\n\nSo, 8.57 / 0.517 \u2248 16.58.\n\nSo the exponent is -16.58.\n\nSimilarly for T2 = 5500 K:\n\n\u0394E/(k T2) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 *5500) \n\nDenominator: 8.617e-5 *5.5e3 = 0.4739 eV.\n\n8.57 / 0.4739 \u2248 18.11.\n\nExponent is -18.11.\n\nNow, the ratio n1/n2 without spots is proportional to exp(-16.58), and with spots exp(-18.11).\n\nWait, but wait: the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ). Assuming that the statistical weights g1 and g2 are the same (if they're not given), perhaps we can ignore them or assume they're equal, so the ratio is just the exponential term.\n\nSo the ratio without spots is exp(-16.58), with spots exp(-18.11). So the ratio when no spots is R1 = exp(-16.58), with spots R2 = exp(-18.11). The factor is R1/R2.\n\nSo factor = exp(-16.58)/exp(-18.11) )= exp(18.11 -16.58) = exp(1.53).\n\nExp(1.53) is approximately e^1.53. Since e^1 \u2248 2.718, e^0.53 is about 1.7, so 2.718 * 1.7 \u2248 4.62. So about 4.6.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is close. So the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations for accuracy.\n\nCompute the denominator for T1: 8.617e-5 *6000 = 0.51702 eV.\n\n\u0394E is 8.57 eV.\n\nSo 8.57 / 0.51702 \u2248 16.57.\n\nSimilarly, T2 is 5500 K: 8.617e-5 *5500 = 0.473935 eV.\n\n8.57 / 0.473935 \u2248 18.10.\n\nSo the exponents are -16.57 and -18.10.\n\nFactor is exp(18.10 -16.57) = exp(1.53) \u2248 4.60.\n\nSo the ratio without spots is about 4.6 times higher than when spots are present. So the factor is approximately 4.6, which is option C: ~4.5.\n",

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. Let me think: the ratio is n1/n2. So if n1/n2 decreases, that means either n1 goes down, n2 goes up, or both. How does temperature affect this ratio?\n\nThe Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Let's denote \u0394E = E2 - E1. So, if \u0394E is positive (which it is, since E2 is higher), then as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, making the ratio larger. So, a higher temperature leads to a higher ratio of n1/n2 because the exponential term increases. \n\nWait, no. Let me get this right. The ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ). So, if T increases, exp(-\u0394E/(k T)) increases because the denominator is bigger, making the exponent less negative. So, n1/n2 increases when T increases. So, when the star has spots, its overall Teff is lower (5500 K vs 6000 K). So, the ratio n1/n2 would be lower when Teff is lower. Which matches the observation in the question: the ratio decreases when there are spots.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But are the spots themselves cooler? Because the presence of spots reduces the overall Teff. So, the photosphere without spots is at 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. \n\nWait, no, maybe that's not exactly accurate. Because the star's surface is a mix of spotted and unspotted regions. But the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere as a whole. Hmm, but wait, when the star has spots, some regions are cooler (spots) and others are hotter (the rest). But the overall photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. So, does that mean that the entire photosphere's average temperature is lower, or is the effective temperature an average of the flux?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying things by assuming that the entire photosphere's temperature drops to 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the presence of spots affects the observed spectrum because the spots are cooler and emit less flux, but the photosphere itself isn't uniformly at 5500 K. Hmm, but the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is spotted. So perhaps the effective temperature is the average, but the actual temperature of the unspotted regions remains at 6000 K.\n\nWait, but if the spots cover 40% of the surface, then the remaining 60% is at 6000 K. Let me think about the effective temperature. The effective temperature of a star is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 Teff^4. So, the total luminosity is the sum of the contributions from the spotted and unspotted regions.\n\nSo, when 40% is spotted, the total luminosity is:\n\nL = 0.6 * L_unspotted + 0.4 * L_spotted.\n\nAssuming that the unspotted regions have Teff 6000 K, and the spotted regions have a lower Teff, say T_spot. Then,\n\nL_unspotted = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 * 0.6,\n\nL_spotted = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 (T_spot)^4 * 0.4.\n\nWait, no, because each region has its own area. So the total luminosity would be:\n\nL = (0.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * (T_spot)^4) * 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3.\n\nAnd the overall Teff is 5500 K, so:\n\nL = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 (5500)^4.\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4 = (5500)^4.\n\nSo, I can solve for T_spot.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the ratio of Ti levels in the photosphere. If the photosphere is a mix of regions at 6000 K and cooler spots, perhaps the observed ratio is a combination of the two. But the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So maybe the assumption is that the photosphere's temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise. But that's perhaps an approximation, because in reality, the star's surface is not at uniform temperature.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can model the ratio as being determined by the effective temperature. Because the observed ratio is in the photosphere, which is now at 5500 K when spots are present.\n\nSo, the ratio when no spots: T1 = 6000 K.\n\nRatio when spots: T2 = 5500 K.\n\nThe ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), multiplied by (g1/g2). But the question says that the ratio decreases when spots are present, so T is lower. So, the ratio n1/n2 is lower.\n\nBut the problem gives that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. So, I can compute the energy difference \u0394E from the wavelength.\n\nThe energy of a photon is E = hc/\u03bb. So, \u0394E = hc / \u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 m.\n\nCompute \u0394E:\n\n\u0394E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) \n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approx 1.373e-18 J.\n\nBut wait, to make it in terms of eV because that's easier for Boltzmann factors. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.\n\nSo \u0394E in eV is (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nHmm, that seems high. Wait, 1448 \u00c5 is about 0.1448 nm, which is in the near UV. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo, \u0394E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) \n\n6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDivided by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 /1.448e-7 \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nWhich is 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 8.57 eV. Hmm, that's correct. So \u0394E is about 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, but that's a pretty large energy difference between the two levels. But okay, perhaps that's the case.\n\nNow, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant (8.617e-5 eV/K).\n\nSo, for each temperature (6000 K and 5500 K), compute the exponent.\n\nFirst, for T1 = 6000 K:\n\n\u0394E/(k T1) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) \n\nCalculate denominator: 8.617e-5 * 6e3 = 0.517 eV.\n\nSo, 8.57 / 0.517 \u2248 16.58.\n\nSo the exponent is -16.58.\n\nSimilarly for T2 = 5500 K:\n\n\u0394E/(k T2) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 *5500) \n\nDenominator: 8.617e-5 *5.5e3 = 0.4739 eV.\n\n8.57 / 0.4739 \u2248 18.11.\n\nExponent is -18.11.\n\nNow, the ratio n1/n2 without spots is proportional to exp(-16.58), and with spots exp(-18.11).\n\nWait, but wait: the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ). Assuming that the statistical weights g1 and g2 are the same (if they're not given), perhaps we can ignore them or assume they're equal, so the ratio is just the exponential term.\n\nSo the ratio without spots is exp(-16.58), with spots exp(-18.11). So the ratio when no spots is R1 = exp(-16.58), with spots R2 = exp(-18.11). The factor is R1/R2.\n\nSo factor = exp(-16.58)/exp(-18.11) )= exp(18.11 -16.58) = exp(1.53).\n\nExp(1.53) is approximately e^1.53. Since e^1 \u2248 2.718, e^0.53 is about 1.7, so 2.718 * 1.7 \u2248 4.62. So about 4.6.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is close. So the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations for accuracy.\n\nCompute the denominator for T1: 8.617e-5 *6000 = 0.51702 eV.\n\n\u0394E is 8.57 eV.\n\nSo 8.57 / 0.51702 \u2248 16.57.\n\nSimilarly, T2 is 5500 K: 8.617e-5 *5500 = 0.473935 eV.\n\n8.57 / 0.473935 \u2248 18.10.\n\nSo the exponents are -16.57 and -18.10.\n\nFactor is exp(18.10 -16.57) = exp(1.53) \u2248 4.60.\n\nSo the ratio without spots is about 4.6 times higher than when spots are present. So the factor is approximately 4.6, which is option C: ~4.5.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are the statistical weights, \\(\\Delta E\\) is the energy difference between the levels, \\(k\\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature. The statistical weights are assumed to be constant, so the ratio depends only on the exponential term.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\(\\Delta E\\)\nThe transition corresponds to a wavelength of \\(1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\). The energy difference \\(\\Delta E\\) is calculated using the relation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s}\\) is Planck's constant, \\(c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) is the speed of light, and \\(\\lambda = 1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5} = 1.448 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nAlright, the problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on the surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. \n\nThe question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near-infrared or maybe even UV? Wait, 1448 \u00c5 is 144.8 nm, which is in the extreme ultraviolet. Hmm, but the exact wavelength might be more about the calculation than the context here.\n\nThe problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. That means we can use the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels.\n\nSo, the Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T) )\n\nWhere:\nn2 = number of atoms in level 2\nn1 = number in level 1\ng2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels\nE2 and E1 are their energies\nk is Boltzmann's constant\nT is the temperature\n\nBut wait, the problem says the ratio n1/n2 (or is it n2/n1?) decreases when the star has spots. Wait, the observed ratio is n1/n2, and when spots are present, the ratio decreases. So, when spots are present, the star is cooler (5500 K), and n1/n2 is lower. Without spots, the star is hotter (6000 K), so the ratio is higher.\n\nWait, the question is about the ratio when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, the ratio when no spots is R1, and with spots is R2. The factor is R1/R2.\n\nWait, no. The ratio when spots are present is lower. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So, the ratio without spots is higher, so R1/R2 is greater than 1.\n\nWait, let me get that right. The observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So, with spots, n1/n2 is lower. Without spots, it's higher. So the factor by which it changes is R = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.\n\nWhich would be (n1/n2)_hot / (n1/n2)_cool.\n\nSince n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, because n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, the ratio R = [ (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nThe g1/g2 terms cancel out because they are the same in numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, R = exp( (E2-E1)/k [1/T1 - 1/T2] )\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, R = [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, since R = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, but (E2 - E1) is the energy difference between the two levels. But we know the wavelength \u03bb of the transition. The energy difference \u0394E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, E2 - E1 = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, substituting that in, R = exp( (hc/(\u03bb k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nHmm, that's a way to compute it.\n\nBut let's get the numbers right. Let me note down the given temperatures. When no spots, Teff is 6000 K (T1), and when spots are present, it's 5500 K (T2).\n\nSo, 1/T1 is 1/6000 and 1/T2 is 1/5500.\n\nSo, let's compute the exponent:\n\n(h c)/(\u03bb k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )\n\nWait, but \u03bb is given as 1448 \u00c5. 1 \u00c5 is 1e-10 meters, so 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m.\n\nh is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J s.\n\nc is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.\n\nk is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\nSo, let's compute (h c)/(\u03bb k):\n\nh c = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) = 1.9878e-25 J m.\n\n\u03bb k = (1448e-10 m)(1.38e-23 J/K) = 1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n1448e-10 is 1.448e-7 m.\n\n1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448 * 1.38 * 1e-30 J m/K.\n\n1.448 * 1.38 \u2248 2. So approximately 2e-30 J m/K.\n\nWait, let me calculate more accurately:\n\n1448 * 1.38 = ?\n\n1448 * 1.38:\n\n1448 * 1 =1448\n\n1448 * 0.38 = 549.  So 1448 + 549 = 1997.\n\nSo, 1997e-30 J m/K.\n\nWait, 1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 = (1448 * 1.38) * 1e-33?\n\nWait, 1e-10 * 1e-23 = 1e-33.\n\nWait, no: 1e-10 * 1e-23 = 1e-33? No, 1e-10 is 10^-10, 1e-23 is 10^-23, so 10^-(10+23) = 10^-33.\n\nSo, 1448 * 1.38 = approximately 1997, so (1448e-10 m)(1.38e-23 J/K) )= 1997e-33 J m/K.\n\nWait, but h c is 1.9878e-25 J m.\n\nSo, (h c)/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1997e-33) ) = (1.9878 / 1997) * 1e8.\n\n1.9878 / 1997 is approximately 0.001, since 1997 is about 2e3, so 1.9878e-3 / 2 \u2248 1e-3.\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately:\n\n1.9878e-25 / 1997e-33 = (1.9878 / 1997) * 1e8.\n\n1.9878 / 1997 \u2248 0.000995 \u2248 1e-3.\n\nSo, 1e-3 * 1e8 = 1e5.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me compute the exponents again.\n\nWait, 1e-25 / 1e-33 = 1e8.\n\nSo, (h c)/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1997e-33) ) = (1.9878 / 1997) * 1e8.\n\n1.9878 divided by 1997 is approximately 0.001 (since 1997 * 0.001 is 1.997, which is close to 1.9878). So, 0.001 * 1e8 = 1e5.\n\nSo, (h c)/(\u03bb k) \u2248 1e5.\n\nWait, that seems high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nSo, now the exponent is (h c)/(\u03bb k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2).\n\nT1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nCompute 1/6000 - 1/5500.\n\n1/6000 = approx 0.000166667.\n\n1/5500 = approx 0.000181818.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, 1/6000 is 0.000166667, and 1/5500 is 0.000181818. So, 1/6000 is less than 1/5500 because 6000>5500.\n\nWait, but 1/6000 - 1/5500 is negative.\n\nWait, 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151.\n\nSo, the exponent becomes 1e5 * (-0.000015151) \u2248 -1.5151.\n\nSo, R = exp( -1.5151 )\n\nWhat's exp(-1.5151)? Let me think.\n\nExp(1.5151) is about e^1.5 is about 4.48, e^0.0151 is about 1.0152. So, 4.48 * 1.0152 \u2248 4.55. So exp(-1.5151) is 1/4.55 \u2248 0.2197.\n\nSo, R \u2248 0.2197.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the ratio R is [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots.\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, let me recheck.\n\nEarlier, I had R = [n1/n2]_T1 / [n1/n2]_T2.\n\nWhich is [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nSo, the g's cancel, and it becomes exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, but in the exponent, I have (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, (E2-E1) is hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, the exponent is (hc/(\u03bb k)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is positive or negative?\n\nIn our case, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\n1/T1 is 0.000166667, 1/T2 is 0.000181818.\n\nSo, (1/T1 -1/T2 ) is negative: -0.000015151.\n\nSo, the exponent is (1e5) * (-0.000015151) = -1.5151.\n\nSo, R = exp(-1.5151) \u2248 0.2197.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher. So, the factor is R = (no spots) / (with spots) = higher value.\n\nSo, R is about 0.2197, which is less than 1. But that can't be, because when the star is hotter, the ratio should be higher.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the ratio. Let me recheck.\n\nThe ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, E2 is higher than E1 because it's an energy level. So, E2-E1 is positive.\n\nSo, when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp(...) increases, so n1/n2 increases.\n\nWait, but when T is higher, the ratio n1/n2 is higher, which means more atoms are in the lower level.\n\nSo, when the star is hotter (no spots), the ratio is higher.\n\nSo, when the star has spots (cooler), the ratio is lower.\n\nSo, the factor R is (n1/n2)_hot / (n1/n2)_cool = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool) )\n\nWait, wait, no.\n\nWait, the ratio n1/n2 for T_hot is R_hot = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_hot) )\n\nSimilarly, R_cool = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_cool) )\n\nSo, R = R_hot / R_cool = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool) )\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n(1e5) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 ) = 1e5 * ( (5500 -6000 )/(6000 * 5500) )\n\nWhich is 1e5 * (-500) / (33,000,000 )\n\n= 1e5 * (-5e2) / 3.3e7.\n\nSo, 1e5 * (-5e2) = -5e7.\n\nDivided by 3.3e7: -5e7 /3.3e7 \u2248 -1.515.\n\nSo, exponent is -1.515.\n\nSo, exp(-1.515) \u2248 0.219.\n\nSo, R = 0.219.\n\nWait, but the question is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it has spots. So, if R is 0.219, that would mean the ratio without spots is 0.219 times the ratio with spots. But that can't be because when the star is hotter, the ratio is higher, so without spots, it's higher, meaning R should be greater than 1.\n\nAh! I think I messed up the ratio. Let me think again.\n\nWait, R is [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots.\n\nBut [n1/n2]_no_spots is higher than [n1/n2]_with_spots.\n\nSo, R should be a number greater than 1.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, R is approximately 0.219, which is less than 1. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent sign.\n\nWait, let's recompute the exponent.\n\nThe exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k) * (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool )\n\nE2 - E1 is positive.\n\n1/T_hot (T_hot = 6000 K) is less than 1/T_cool (5500 K), because 1/6000 < 1/5500.\n\nSo, (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool ) is negative.\n\nThus, the exponent is positive multiplied by a negative, giving a negative.\n\nSo, the exponent is negative, so exp(negative) is less than 1.\n\nWhich would make R = exp(negative) < 1, which implies [n1/n2]_no_spots is less than [n1/n2]_with_spots, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, that can't be right. The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when the star is cooler, ratio is lower.\n\nSo, [n1/n2]_no_spots > [n1/n2]_with_spots.\n\nSo, R should be greater than 1.\n\nBut according to the calculation, R is 0.219, which is less than 1. That suggests a mistake in the setup.\n\nHmm. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up T1 and T2.\n\nWait, in the problem, when the star has spots, the temperature is 5500 K. So, T2 is 5500 K, and T1 is 6000 K.\n\nBut in the exponent, I used 1/T1 - 1/T2, which is 1/6000 - 1/5500 = negative.\n\nSo, the exponent is negative, leading to R being less than 1. But that's not possible, because without spots, the ratio is higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used 1/T_cool - 1/T_hot.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nThe ratio R is [n1/n2]_T1 / [n1/n2]_T2.\n\nWhich is [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nBut if I have T1 as 6000 K and T2 as 5500 K, then 1/T1 < 1/T2.\n\nSo, 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative.\n\nSo, the exponent is negative, which makes R < 1.\n\nBut this would imply that [n1/n2]_T1 < [n1/n2]_T2, which is the opposite of what the problem states.\n\nAh! I think I see the issue. Maybe I have the ratio backwards.\n\nThe problem says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots.\n\nSo, when the star has spots (cooler), (n1/n2)_cool < (n1/n2)_hot.\n\nWhich implies that (n1/n2)_hot / (n1/n2)_cool = R.\n\nWhich is greater than 1.\n\nBut according to the calculation, R is 0.219, which is less than 1. So, something's wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the energy levels are reversed. Maybe E1 is higher than E2.\n\nWait, the problem states that the transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. So, the photon emitted has this wavelength when going from E2 to E1.\n\nWait, so when an electron transitions from E2 to E1, it emits a photon of wavelength 1448 \u00c5.\n\nSo, E2 > E1.\n\nSo, E2 - E1 = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, that part was correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that I should have used (E1 - E2) instead?\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nn1 is the number of atoms in level 1, n2 in level 2.\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nBecause, in the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp(...) increases, so n1/n2 increases.\n\nSo, when the star is hotter, n1/n2 is higher. So, [n1/n2]_hot > [n1/n2]_cool.\n\nSo, the ratio R = [n1/n2]_hot / [n1/n2]_cool = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool) )\n\nWait, let's compute that again.\n\nCompute (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool )\n\nWhich is (hc/(\u03bb k)) * (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool )\n\nWait, T_hot is 6000 K, T_cool is 5500 K.\n\nSo, 1/T_hot = 1/6000 \u2248 0.000166667\n\n1/T_cool = 1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818\n\nSo, 1/T_hot - 1/T_cool = 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151\n\nSo, the exponent is (1e5) * (-0.000015151) \u2248 -1.5151.\n\nSo, R = exp(-1.5151) \u2248 0.2197.\n\nBut that can't be right because the ratio should be higher when hotter.\n\nWait, this suggests that R is about 0.22, which would mean that [n1/n2]_hot is 0.22 times [n1/n2]_cool, which contradicts the expectation.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think about another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio the other way around. Let's compute [n1/n2]_cool / [n1/n2]_hot.\n\nWhich would be exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_cool - 1/T_hot) )\n\nWhich is exp( (1e5) * (0.000181818 - 0.000166667) )\n\nWhich is exp(1e5 * 0.000015151 ) = exp(1.5151 )\n\nWhich is approximately 4.55.\n\nSo, [n1/n2]_cool / [n1/n2]_hot = 4.55.\n\nWhich implies that [n1/n2]_hot = [n1/n2]_cool / 4.55.\n\nSo, [n1/n2]_hot is less than [n1/n2]_cool.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when the star is hotter, the ratio should be higher.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting results. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of (h c)/(\u03bb k).\n\nLet me recalculate (h c)/(\u03bb k):\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m\n\nk = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nSo,\n\nh c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m\n\n\u03bb k = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448 * 1.38e-30 J m/K.\n\n1.448 * 1.38 \u2248 1.997.\n\nSo, \u03bb k \u2248 1.997e-30 J m/K.\n\nSo, (h c)/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.997e-30) \u2248 1e5.\n\nBecause 1e-25 / 1e-30 is 1e5.\n\nSo, that part seems correct.\n\nSo, (h c)/(\u03bb k) = 1e5.\n\nThen, (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool ) = 1/6000 - 1/5500 = -500/(6000*5500) = let's compute it as numbers.\n\nCompute 6000 *5500 = 33,000,000.\n\nSo, 1/6000 = 5500/(33,000,000) = 5500 / 3.3e7 = 0.000166667.\n\n1/5500 = 6000/(33e6) = 0.000181818.\n\nSo, 1/6000 -1/5500 = (5500 - 6000)/(33e6) ) = (-500)/(33e6) )= -500/(3.3e7) \u2248 -1.515e-5.\n\nSo, (h c)/(\u03bb k) * (1/T_hot -1/T_cool) ) = 1e5 * (-1.515e-5 )= -1.515.\n\nSo, R = exp( -1.515 ) \u2248 0.219.\n\nBut that can't be right because without spots, the ratio should be higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the inverse ratio. The problem says that the ratio of the number of Ti in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star is cooler, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So, without spots, the ratio is higher.\n\nSo, the factor R is [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots = 0.219, which would imply the ratio without spots is 0.219 times the ratio with spots, which is impossible because the ratio should be higher when the star is hotter.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself confused here. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the factor is [n2/n1]_no_spots / [n2/n1]_with_spots.\n\nBecause the problem states the ratio n1/n2 decreases, so [n1/n2]_no_spots > [n1/n2]_with_spots.\n\nSo, [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots = R.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, [n1/n2]_no_spots = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )\n\nSimilarly, [n1/n2]_with_spots = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nSo, R = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( (1e5) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nWhich is exp(1e5 * (-1.515e-5) ) = exp(-1.515) \u2248 0.219.\n\nWhich is less than 1. So, that can't be.\n\nWait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, the ratio is lower. So, [n1/n2]_no_spots is higher than [n1/n2]_with_spots.\n\nWhich implies that R = [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots = something greater than 1.\n\nBut according to the calculation, it's 0.219. Which is less than 1.\n\nThis suggests that the ratio without spots is 0.219 times the ratio with spots, which would mean the ratio is lower when there's no spots. Which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the energy difference the wrong way.\n\nWait, in the Boltzmann equation, n2 is higher energy than n1. So, if the star is hotter, more atoms are in the higher energy level, so n2 increases. So, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWait, wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify.\n\nIn the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nWhere \u0394E = E2 - E1.\n\nSo, if \u0394E is positive (E2 > E1), then n2/n1 decreases as T increases.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nAt higher T, the exponential term is larger because \u0394E/(k T) is smaller (since T is larger). So, exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ) becomes larger as T increases.\n\nWait, no, wait: \u0394E/(k T) is a positive number. So, -\u0394E/(k T) is negative. As T increases, the magnitude of the exponent decreases, so the exponential approaches 1.\n\nSo, for higher T, exp(-x) where x is smaller (since x=\u0394E/(k T)), so exp(-x) increases.\n\nSo, n2/n1 increases with T.\n\nSo, when T is higher, more atoms are in the higher energy level (n2), so n2/n1 increases.\n\nTherefore, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) decreases as T increases.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, if the star is hotter, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.\n\nSo, when the star is cooler (with spots), the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Wait, that's not right because according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, n1/n2 increases.\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nAs T increases, exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ) increases, because the exponent becomes less negative.\n\nSo, n2/n1 increases with T.\n\nThus, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) decreases with T.\n\nWait, so when T increases, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots (cooler), the ratio n1/n2 is lower.\n\nSo, when the star is cooler, n1/n2 is lower, which according to the above, would be when T is lower, but according to the equation, n1/n2 decreases as T increases.\n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up.\n\nLet me think of a concrete example.\n\nSuppose E2 > E1.\n\nAt T = 1000 K, the exponent is -\u0394E/(k * 1000).\n\nAt T = 6000 K, the exponent is -\u0394E/(k *6000).\n\nSo, at higher T, the exponent is less negative, so exp is larger.\n\nThus, n2/n1 is larger at higher T, so n1/n2 is smaller at higher T.\n\nSo, when T increases, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nSo, when the star has spots (T=5500 K), n1/n2 is higher than when T=6000 K.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\"\n\nSo, when the star is cooler (spots), n1/n2 is lower than when it's hotter.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, when T increases, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nSo, when T is higher (no spots), n1/n2 is lower.\n\nWhen T is lower (spots), n1/n2 is higher.\n\nBut the problem says the opposite. So, perhaps I have the ratio backwards.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem refers to n2/n1 as the ratio. Let me check.\n\nThe problem says: \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2).\"\n\nIt doesn't specify which way, but when the star has spots, this ratio decreases.\n\nSo, if the ratio is n1/n2, and it decreases when spots are present, that would mean when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower.\n\nWhich contradicts the Boltzmann equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1.\n\nIf the ratio is n2/n1, and when spots are present, the ratio decreases.\n\nThen, when T is lower, n2/n1 is lower.\n\nWhich would be consistent with the Boltzmann equation.\n\nBecause, as T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, so the ratio n2/n1 is lower when the star is cooler.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem refers to the ratio n2/n1.\n\nBut the question says, \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2).\"\n\nIt doesn't specify, but perhaps in the problem, the ratio is taken as n2/n1.\n\nSo, in that case, when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases.\n\nSo, the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\nSo, the factor R is [n2/n1]_no_spots / [n2/n1]_with_spots.\n\nWhich is [ (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWhich is exp( -\u0394E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBecause (1/T1 -1/T2 ) is negative, so - (1/T1 -1/T2 ) = 1/T2 -1/T1.\n\nSo, R = exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 -1/T1) )\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\n\u0394E is hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = (hc/(\u03bb k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000 )\n\nWhich is (1e5) * ( (6000 -5500)/(5500 *6000) )\n\n= 1e5 * (500)/(33e6) )\n\n= 1e5 * 5e2 / 3.3e7.\n\nWait, 5e2 is 500.\n\nSo, 1e5 * 500 = 5e7.\n\n5e7 / 3.3e7 \u2248 1.515.\n\nSo, R = exp(1.515) \u2248 4.55.\n\nSo, the factor is approximately 4.55.\n\nWhich is one of the options, option C is ~4.5.\n\nSo, the answer would be option C.\n",

They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near-infrared or maybe even UV? Wait, 1448 \u00c5 is 144.8 nm, which is in the extreme ultraviolet. Hmm, but the exact wavelength might be more about the calculation than the context here.\n\nThe problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. That means we can use the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels.\n\nSo, the Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T) )\n\nWhere:\nn2 = number of atoms in level 2\nn1 = number in level 1\ng2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels\nE2 and E1 are their energies\nk is Boltzmann's constant\nT is the temperature\n\nBut wait, the problem says the ratio n1/n2 (or is it n2/n1?) decreases when the star has spots. Wait, the observed ratio is n1/n2, and when spots are present, the ratio decreases. So, when spots are present, the star is cooler (5500 K), and n1/n2 is lower. Without spots, the star is hotter (6000 K), so the ratio is higher.\n\nWait, the question is about the ratio when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, the ratio when no spots is R1, and with spots is R2. The factor is R1/R2.\n\nWait, no. The ratio when spots are present is lower. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So, the ratio without spots is higher, so R1/R2 is greater than 1.\n\nWait, let me get that right. The observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So, with spots, n1/n2 is lower. Without spots, it's higher. So the factor by which it changes is R = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.\n\nWhich would be (n1/n2)_hot / (n1/n2)_cool.\n\nSince n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, because n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, the ratio R = [ (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nThe g1/g2 terms cancel out because they are the same in numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, R = exp( (E2-E1)/k [1/T1 - 1/T2] )\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, R = [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, since R = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, but (E2 - E1) is the energy difference between the two levels. But we know the wavelength \u03bb of the transition. The energy difference \u0394E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, E2 - E1 = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, substituting that in, R = exp( (hc/(\u03bb k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nHmm, that's a way to compute it.\n\nBut let's get the numbers right. Let me note down the given temperatures. When no spots, Teff is 6000 K (T1), and when spots are present, it's 5500 K (T2).\n\nSo, 1/T1 is 1/6000 and 1/T2 is 1/5500.\n\nSo, let's compute the exponent:\n\n(h c)/(\u03bb k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )\n\nWait, but \u03bb is given as 1448 \u00c5. 1 \u00c5 is 1e-10 meters, so 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m.\n\nh is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J s.\n\nc is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.\n\nk is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\nSo, let's compute (h c)/(\u03bb k):\n\nh c = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) = 1.9878e-25 J m.\n\n\u03bb k = (1448e-10 m)(1.38e-23 J/K) = 1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n1448e-10 is 1.448e-7 m.\n\n1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448 * 1.38 * 1e-30 J m/K.\n\n1.448 * 1.38 \u2248 2. So approximately 2e-30 J m/K.\n\nWait, let me calculate more accurately:\n\n1448 * 1.38 = ?\n\n1448 * 1.38:\n\n1448 * 1 =1448\n\n1448 * 0.38 = 549.  So 1448 + 549 = 1997.\n\nSo, 1997e-30 J m/K.\n\nWait, 1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 = (1448 * 1.38) * 1e-33?\n\nWait, 1e-10 * 1e-23 = 1e-33.\n\nWait, no: 1e-10 * 1e-23 = 1e-33? No, 1e-10 is 10^-10, 1e-23 is 10^-23, so 10^-(10+23) = 10^-33.\n\nSo, 1448 * 1.38 = approximately 1997, so (1448e-10 m)(1.38e-23 J/K) )= 1997e-33 J m/K.\n\nWait, but h c is 1.9878e-25 J m.\n\nSo, (h c)/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1997e-33) ) = (1.9878 / 1997) * 1e8.\n\n1.9878 / 1997 is approximately 0.001, since 1997 is about 2e3, so 1.9878e-3 / 2 \u2248 1e-3.\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately:\n\n1.9878e-25 / 1997e-33 = (1.9878 / 1997) * 1e8.\n\n1.9878 / 1997 \u2248 0.000995 \u2248 1e-3.\n\nSo, 1e-3 * 1e8 = 1e5.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me compute the exponents again.\n\nWait, 1e-25 / 1e-33 = 1e8.\n\nSo, (h c)/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1997e-33) ) = (1.9878 / 1997) * 1e8.\n\n1.9878 divided by 1997 is approximately 0.001 (since 1997 * 0.001 is 1.997, which is close to 1.9878). So, 0.001 * 1e8 = 1e5.\n\nSo, (h c)/(\u03bb k) \u2248 1e5.\n\nWait, that seems high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nSo, now the exponent is (h c)/(\u03bb k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2).\n\nT1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nCompute 1/6000 - 1/5500.\n\n1/6000 = approx 0.000166667.\n\n1/5500 = approx 0.000181818.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, 1/6000 is 0.000166667, and 1/5500 is 0.000181818. So, 1/6000 is less than 1/5500 because 6000>5500.\n\nWait, but 1/6000 - 1/5500 is negative.\n\nWait, 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151.\n\nSo, the exponent becomes 1e5 * (-0.000015151) \u2248 -1.5151.\n\nSo, R = exp( -1.5151 )\n\nWhat's exp(-1.5151)? Let me think.\n\nExp(1.5151) is about e^1.5 is about 4.48, e^0.0151 is about 1.0152. So, 4.48 * 1.0152 \u2248 4.55. So exp(-1.5151) is 1/4.55 \u2248 0.2197.\n\nSo, R \u2248 0.2197.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the ratio R is [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots.\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, let me recheck.\n\nEarlier, I had R = [n1/n2]_T1 / [n1/n2]_T2.\n\nWhich is [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nSo, the g's cancel, and it becomes exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, but in the exponent, I have (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWait, (E2-E1) is hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, the exponent is (hc/(\u03bb k)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is positive or negative?\n\nIn our case, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\n1/T1 is 0.000166667, 1/T2 is 0.000181818.\n\nSo, (1/T1 -1/T2 ) is negative: -0.000015151.\n\nSo, the exponent is (1e5) * (-0.000015151) = -1.5151.\n\nSo, R = exp(-1.5151) \u2248 0.2197.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher. So, the factor is R = (no spots) / (with spots) = higher value.\n\nSo, R is about 0.2197, which is less than 1. But that can't be, because when the star is hotter, the ratio should be higher.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the ratio. Let me recheck.\n\nThe ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWait, E2 is higher than E1 because it's an energy level. So, E2-E1 is positive.\n\nSo, when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp(...) increases, so n1/n2 increases.\n\nWait, but when T is higher, the ratio n1/n2 is higher, which means more atoms are in the lower level.\n\nSo, when the star is hotter (no spots), the ratio is higher.\n\nSo, when the star has spots (cooler), the ratio is lower.\n\nSo, the factor R is (n1/n2)_hot / (n1/n2)_cool = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool) )\n\nWait, wait, no.\n\nWait, the ratio n1/n2 for T_hot is R_hot = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_hot) )\n\nSimilarly, R_cool = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_cool) )\n\nSo, R = R_hot / R_cool = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool) )\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n(1e5) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 ) = 1e5 * ( (5500 -6000 )/(6000 * 5500) )\n\nWhich is 1e5 * (-500) / (33,000,000 )\n\n= 1e5 * (-5e2) / 3.3e7.\n\nSo, 1e5 * (-5e2) = -5e7.\n\nDivided by 3.3e7: -5e7 /3.3e7 \u2248 -1.515.\n\nSo, exponent is -1.515.\n\nSo, exp(-1.515) \u2248 0.219.\n\nSo, R = 0.219.\n\nWait, but the question is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it has spots. So, if R is 0.219, that would mean the ratio without spots is 0.219 times the ratio with spots. But that can't be because when the star is hotter, the ratio is higher, so without spots, it's higher, meaning R should be greater than 1.\n\nAh! I think I messed up the ratio. Let me think again.\n\nWait, R is [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots.\n\nBut [n1/n2]_no_spots is higher than [n1/n2]_with_spots.\n\nSo, R should be a number greater than 1.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, R is approximately 0.219, which is less than 1. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent sign.\n\nWait, let's recompute the exponent.\n\nThe exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k) * (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool )\n\nE2 - E1 is positive.\n\n1/T_hot (T_hot = 6000 K) is less than 1/T_cool (5500 K), because 1/6000 < 1/5500.\n\nSo, (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool ) is negative.\n\nThus, the exponent is positive multiplied by a negative, giving a negative.\n\nSo, the exponent is negative, so exp(negative) is less than 1.\n\nWhich would make R = exp(negative) < 1, which implies [n1/n2]_no_spots is less than [n1/n2]_with_spots, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, that can't be right. The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when the star is cooler, ratio is lower.\n\nSo, [n1/n2]_no_spots > [n1/n2]_with_spots.\n\nSo, R should be greater than 1.\n\nBut according to the calculation, R is 0.219, which is less than 1. That suggests a mistake in the setup.\n\nHmm. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up T1 and T2.\n\nWait, in the problem, when the star has spots, the temperature is 5500 K. So, T2 is 5500 K, and T1 is 6000 K.\n\nBut in the exponent, I used 1/T1 - 1/T2, which is 1/6000 - 1/5500 = negative.\n\nSo, the exponent is negative, leading to R being less than 1. But that's not possible, because without spots, the ratio is higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have used 1/T_cool - 1/T_hot.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nThe ratio R is [n1/n2]_T1 / [n1/n2]_T2.\n\nWhich is [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nBut if I have T1 as 6000 K and T2 as 5500 K, then 1/T1 < 1/T2.\n\nSo, 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative.\n\nSo, the exponent is negative, which makes R < 1.\n\nBut this would imply that [n1/n2]_T1 < [n1/n2]_T2, which is the opposite of what the problem states.\n\nAh! I think I see the issue. Maybe I have the ratio backwards.\n\nThe problem says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots.\n\nSo, when the star has spots (cooler), (n1/n2)_cool < (n1/n2)_hot.\n\nWhich implies that (n1/n2)_hot / (n1/n2)_cool = R.\n\nWhich is greater than 1.\n\nBut according to the calculation, R is 0.219, which is less than 1. So, something's wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the energy levels are reversed. Maybe E1 is higher than E2.\n\nWait, the problem states that the transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. So, the photon emitted has this wavelength when going from E2 to E1.\n\nWait, so when an electron transitions from E2 to E1, it emits a photon of wavelength 1448 \u00c5.\n\nSo, E2 > E1.\n\nSo, E2 - E1 = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, that part was correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that I should have used (E1 - E2) instead?\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nn1 is the number of atoms in level 1, n2 in level 2.\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nBecause, in the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp(...) increases, so n1/n2 increases.\n\nSo, when the star is hotter, n1/n2 is higher. So, [n1/n2]_hot > [n1/n2]_cool.\n\nSo, the ratio R = [n1/n2]_hot / [n1/n2]_cool = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool) )\n\nWait, let's compute that again.\n\nCompute (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool )\n\nWhich is (hc/(\u03bb k)) * (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool )\n\nWait, T_hot is 6000 K, T_cool is 5500 K.\n\nSo, 1/T_hot = 1/6000 \u2248 0.000166667\n\n1/T_cool = 1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818\n\nSo, 1/T_hot - 1/T_cool = 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151\n\nSo, the exponent is (1e5) * (-0.000015151) \u2248 -1.5151.\n\nSo, R = exp(-1.5151) \u2248 0.2197.\n\nBut that can't be right because the ratio should be higher when hotter.\n\nWait, this suggests that R is about 0.22, which would mean that [n1/n2]_hot is 0.22 times [n1/n2]_cool, which contradicts the expectation.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think about another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio the other way around. Let's compute [n1/n2]_cool / [n1/n2]_hot.\n\nWhich would be exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_cool - 1/T_hot) )\n\nWhich is exp( (1e5) * (0.000181818 - 0.000166667) )\n\nWhich is exp(1e5 * 0.000015151 ) = exp(1.5151 )\n\nWhich is approximately 4.55.\n\nSo, [n1/n2]_cool / [n1/n2]_hot = 4.55.\n\nWhich implies that [n1/n2]_hot = [n1/n2]_cool / 4.55.\n\nSo, [n1/n2]_hot is less than [n1/n2]_cool.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when the star is hotter, the ratio should be higher.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting results. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of (h c)/(\u03bb k).\n\nLet me recalculate (h c)/(\u03bb k):\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m\n\nk = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nSo,\n\nh c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m\n\n\u03bb k = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448 * 1.38e-30 J m/K.\n\n1.448 * 1.38 \u2248 1.997.\n\nSo, \u03bb k \u2248 1.997e-30 J m/K.\n\nSo, (h c)/(\u03bb k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.997e-30) \u2248 1e5.\n\nBecause 1e-25 / 1e-30 is 1e5.\n\nSo, that part seems correct.\n\nSo, (h c)/(\u03bb k) = 1e5.\n\nThen, (1/T_hot - 1/T_cool ) = 1/6000 - 1/5500 = -500/(6000*5500) = let's compute it as numbers.\n\nCompute 6000 *5500 = 33,000,000.\n\nSo, 1/6000 = 5500/(33,000,000) = 5500 / 3.3e7 = 0.000166667.\n\n1/5500 = 6000/(33e6) = 0.000181818.\n\nSo, 1/6000 -1/5500 = (5500 - 6000)/(33e6) ) = (-500)/(33e6) )= -500/(3.3e7) \u2248 -1.515e-5.\n\nSo, (h c)/(\u03bb k) * (1/T_hot -1/T_cool) ) = 1e5 * (-1.515e-5 )= -1.515.\n\nSo, R = exp( -1.515 ) \u2248 0.219.\n\nBut that can't be right because without spots, the ratio should be higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the inverse ratio. The problem says that the ratio of the number of Ti in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star is cooler, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So, without spots, the ratio is higher.\n\nSo, the factor R is [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots = 0.219, which would imply the ratio without spots is 0.219 times the ratio with spots, which is impossible because the ratio should be higher when the star is hotter.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself confused here. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the factor is [n2/n1]_no_spots / [n2/n1]_with_spots.\n\nBecause the problem states the ratio n1/n2 decreases, so [n1/n2]_no_spots > [n1/n2]_with_spots.\n\nSo, [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots = R.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, [n1/n2]_no_spots = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )\n\nSimilarly, [n1/n2]_with_spots = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nSo, R = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( (1e5) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nWhich is exp(1e5 * (-1.515e-5) ) = exp(-1.515) \u2248 0.219.\n\nWhich is less than 1. So, that can't be.\n\nWait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, the ratio is lower. So, [n1/n2]_no_spots is higher than [n1/n2]_with_spots.\n\nWhich implies that R = [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots = something greater than 1.\n\nBut according to the calculation, it's 0.219. Which is less than 1.\n\nThis suggests that the ratio without spots is 0.219 times the ratio with spots, which would mean the ratio is lower when there's no spots. Which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the energy difference the wrong way.\n\nWait, in the Boltzmann equation, n2 is higher energy than n1. So, if the star is hotter, more atoms are in the higher energy level, so n2 increases. So, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWait, wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify.\n\nIn the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nWhere \u0394E = E2 - E1.\n\nSo, if \u0394E is positive (E2 > E1), then n2/n1 decreases as T increases.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nAt higher T, the exponential term is larger because \u0394E/(k T) is smaller (since T is larger). So, exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ) becomes larger as T increases.\n\nWait, no, wait: \u0394E/(k T) is a positive number. So, -\u0394E/(k T) is negative. As T increases, the magnitude of the exponent decreases, so the exponential approaches 1.\n\nSo, for higher T, exp(-x) where x is smaller (since x=\u0394E/(k T)), so exp(-x) increases.\n\nSo, n2/n1 increases with T.\n\nSo, when T is higher, more atoms are in the higher energy level (n2), so n2/n1 increases.\n\nTherefore, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) decreases as T increases.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, if the star is hotter, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.\n\nSo, when the star is cooler (with spots), the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Wait, that's not right because according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, n1/n2 increases.\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nn2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nAs T increases, exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ) increases, because the exponent becomes less negative.\n\nSo, n2/n1 increases with T.\n\nThus, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) decreases with T.\n\nWait, so when T increases, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the star has spots (cooler), the ratio n1/n2 is lower.\n\nSo, when the star is cooler, n1/n2 is lower, which according to the above, would be when T is lower, but according to the equation, n1/n2 decreases as T increases.\n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up.\n\nLet me think of a concrete example.\n\nSuppose E2 > E1.\n\nAt T = 1000 K, the exponent is -\u0394E/(k * 1000).\n\nAt T = 6000 K, the exponent is -\u0394E/(k *6000).\n\nSo, at higher T, the exponent is less negative, so exp is larger.\n\nThus, n2/n1 is larger at higher T, so n1/n2 is smaller at higher T.\n\nSo, when T increases, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nSo, when the star has spots (T=5500 K), n1/n2 is higher than when T=6000 K.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\"\n\nSo, when the star is cooler (spots), n1/n2 is lower than when it's hotter.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, when T increases, n1/n2 decreases.\n\nSo, when T is higher (no spots), n1/n2 is lower.\n\nWhen T is lower (spots), n1/n2 is higher.\n\nBut the problem says the opposite. So, perhaps I have the ratio backwards.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem refers to n2/n1 as the ratio. Let me check.\n\nThe problem says: \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2).\"\n\nIt doesn't specify which way, but when the star has spots, this ratio decreases.\n\nSo, if the ratio is n1/n2, and it decreases when spots are present, that would mean when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower.\n\nWhich contradicts the Boltzmann equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1.\n\nIf the ratio is n2/n1, and when spots are present, the ratio decreases.\n\nThen, when T is lower, n2/n1 is lower.\n\nWhich would be consistent with the Boltzmann equation.\n\nBecause, as T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, so the ratio n2/n1 is lower when the star is cooler.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem refers to the ratio n2/n1.\n\nBut the question says, \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2).\"\n\nIt doesn't specify, but perhaps in the problem, the ratio is taken as n2/n1.\n\nSo, in that case, when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases.\n\nSo, the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\nSo, the factor R is [n2/n1]_no_spots / [n2/n1]_with_spots.\n\nWhich is [ (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ]\n\nWhich is exp( -\u0394E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWhich is exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBecause (1/T1 -1/T2 ) is negative, so - (1/T1 -1/T2 ) = 1/T2 -1/T1.\n\nSo, R = exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 -1/T1) )\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\n\u0394E is hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = (hc/(\u03bb k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000 )\n\nWhich is (1e5) * ( (6000 -5500)/(5500 *6000) )\n\n= 1e5 * (500)/(33e6) )\n\n= 1e5 * 5e2 / 3.3e7.\n\nWait, 5e2 is 500.\n\nSo, 1e5 * 500 = 5e7.\n\n5e7 / 3.3e7 \u2248 1.515.\n\nSo, R = exp(1.515) \u2248 4.55.\n\nSo, the factor is approximately 4.55.\n\nWhich is one of the options, option C is ~4.5.\n\nSo, the answer would be option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) using the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the populations of levels 1 and 2, \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are their statistical weights, \\(\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\\) is the energy difference, \\(k\\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. This implies that the ratio is higher when the star is hotter (no spots, \\(T_1 = 6000 \\, \\text{K}\\)) and lower when the star is cooler (with spots, \\(T_2 = 5500 \\, \\text{K}\\)).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nThe problem says that there's a star with certain characteristics: a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. \n\nWait, but why does the effective temperature decrease when spots cover part of the surface? Oh right, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when spots cover part of the star's surface, the total emitted radiation is less, hence the effective temperature goes down. But the way it's calculated is a bit tricky. The effective temperature is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates luminosity to temperature. \n\nSo the star's luminosity when there are spots would be less, but the question is about the temperature of the photosphere. Wait, but the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Hmm. Maybe I should think about how the presence of spots affects the average temperature. Since spots are cooler, the average Teff goes down.\n\nNow, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.\n\nI remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the population of atomic energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E2>E1, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, the problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when T decreases, what happens to the ratio?\n\nLet me think: The ratio n1/n2 depends exponentially on T. If T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, because (E2-E1)/(k*T) increases. So if E2-E1 is positive, the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential term smaller. So n1/n2 would decrease. Because when T is lower, higher energy levels are less populated compared to lower ones.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T drops from 6000 K to 5500 K, the ratio n1/n2 becomes smaller. So when the star is without spots (T=6000), the ratio is higher than when it has spots (T=5500).\n\nSo the ratio when no spots (R1) is higher than when spots are present (R2). So the factor is R1/R2. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes\u2014so we need to compute R1/R2.\n\nBut wait, the energy difference between the levels (\u0394E) is related to the wavelength of the transition. The problem says the transition corresponds to about 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near-ultraviolet or perhaps far-UV. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/\u03bb. So \u0394E = hc/\u03bb. \n\nCalculating \u0394E: h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo \u0394E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) \u2248 1.373e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut wait, we can also express \u0394E in terms of temperature. Alternatively, since we're dealing with the Boltzmann factor, perhaps we can find the ratio of the Boltzmann factors at two different temperatures.\n\nLet me think: The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(k*T) ), because n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1. So the ratio without spots is R1 = exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ), and with spots R2 = exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ), where T1 is 6000 K and T2 is 5500 K.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T decreases, the ratio R decreases, which makes sense because as T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, so R is smaller.\n\nSo the factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2 = exp( [\u0394E/(k T1) - \u0394E/(k T2)] ) = exp( \u0394E/(k) [1/(T1) - 1/(T2)] )\n\nWait, no. Let me re-derive. The ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) )\nR2 = (g1/g2) exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) )\n\nSo the ratio R1/R2 = [exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ] = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nWait, because [exp(a)]/[exp(b)] = exp(a - b). So, if a is -\u0394E/(k T1) and b is -\u0394E/(k T2), then a - b = (-\u0394E/(k T1)) - (-\u0394E/(k T2)) ) = \u0394E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the signs. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, R1 is at T1=6000, R2 at T2=5500.\n\nR1/R2 = [exp(-\u0394E/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-\u0394E/(k T2)) ] = exp( [ -\u0394E/(k T1) + \u0394E/(k T2) ] )\n\nFactor out \u0394E/(k): exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )\n\nWait, yes. Because -a + b = b -a = (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) * (\u0394E/(k)).\n\nSo, the exponent is (\u0394E/(k)) * (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )\n\nBut since T2 < T1, 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1, so (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive. And \u0394E is positive because E2>E1. So the exponent is positive. So R1/R2 is exp( positive ), which is greater than 1. So the ratio increases, which aligns with the problem statement that when the star has spots (T2), R is lower than when it doesn't (T1).\n\nSo the factor is exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me compute the exponent more carefully.\n\nWe have:\n\n\u0394E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo let me compute (\u0394E)/(k) = (hc)/(\u03bb k)\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J s\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m\nk = Boltzmann constant = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nSo (\u0394E)/(k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 )\n\nLet me compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1448e-33 * 1.38e-23 = Let me compute 1448 * 1.38 = approx 1995.84, so 1995.84e-56? Wait, wait, perhaps better to compute in exponents.\n\nWait, 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m. So denominator is 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = (1.448 * 1.38) * 1e-30 m\u00b7J/K.\n\nWait, 1.448 * 1.38 \u2248 1.448 * 1.38. Let's compute: 1.448 * 1.38 = (1.4 *1.38) + (0.048 *1.38). 1.4 *1.38=1.932, 0.048 *1.38\u22480.065. So total \u22481.997.\n\nSo denominator is approximately 1.997e-30 m\u00b7J/K.\n\nWait, but numerator is 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo (\u0394E)/(k) = (1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1.997e-30 m\u00b7J/K ) )\n\nWait, J\u00b7m divided by m\u00b7J/K is (J m) / (m J/K) ) = K.\n\nWait, the units: (J\u00b7m) / (m\u00b7J/K) ) = K.\n\nSo, the value is (1.9878e-25) / (1.997e-30) ) \u2248 (approx 1e5) because 1e-25 / 1e-30 = 1e5. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\n1.9878e-25 / 1.997e-30 \u2248 (1.9878 / 1.997) * 1e5 \u2248 approx 1.0 * 1e5 = 1e5 K.\n\nWait, 1.9878 / 1.997 is about 0.996, so it's about 99600 K. Let me just take it as approximately 1e5 K.\n\nSo, (\u0394E)/(k) \u2248 1e5 K.\n\nWait, that's a rough estimate. Let me get more precise.\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1448 * 1.38e-33 J\u00b7m/K.\n\n1448 * 1.38 = let's compute:\n\n1448 * 1 = 1448.\n\n1448 * 0.38 = 1448 * 0.3 = 434.4, 1448 *0.08=115.84 \u2192 434.4+115.84=550.24. So 1448 + 550.24=1998.24.\n\nSo denominator is 1998.24e-33 J\u00b7m/K \u2192 1.99824e-30 J\u00b7m/K.\n\nSo (\u0394E/k) = (1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1.99824e-30 J\u00b7m/K) ) \u2192 the J\u00b7m cancels out, and we get:\n\n(1.9878e-25) / (1.99824e-30) ) K \u2248 (1.9878 / 1.99824) ) * (1e5) \u2192 approx (0.995) * 1e5 \u2192 ~99,500 K.\n\nSo approximately 99,500 K, which I'll round to 1e5 K for simplicity.\n\nSo (\u0394E)/(k) \u2248 1e5 K.\n\nNow, the exponent is (\u0394E/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )\n\nSo T1=6000 K, T2=5500 K.\n\nCompute 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1/5500) - (1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500 / (33,000,000) ) = 5/(330,000) ) \u2248 1.515e-5.\n\nWait, let's compute that exactly:\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818 (since 1/5500 = 1/(5.5e3) = approx 1.818e-4 )\n\n1/6000 \u2248 1.6667e-4.\n\nSo 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (1.818e-4) - (1.6667e-4) = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5.\n\nSo, exponent = (1e5 K) * (1.513e-5 ) = 1.513e0 = approx 1.513.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(1.513) \u2248 e^1.513.\n\nWhat's e^1.513?

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nThe problem says that there's a star with certain characteristics: a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. \n\nWait, but why does the effective temperature decrease when spots cover part of the surface? Oh right, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when spots cover part of the star's surface, the total emitted radiation is less, hence the effective temperature goes down. But the way it's calculated is a bit tricky. The effective temperature is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates luminosity to temperature. \n\nSo the star's luminosity when there are spots would be less, but the question is about the temperature of the photosphere. Wait, but the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Hmm. Maybe I should think about how the presence of spots affects the average temperature. Since spots are cooler, the average Teff goes down.\n\nNow, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.\n\nI remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the population of atomic energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E2>E1, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWait, the problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when T decreases, what happens to the ratio?\n\nLet me think: The ratio n1/n2 depends exponentially on T. If T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, because (E2-E1)/(k*T) increases. So if E2-E1 is positive, the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential term smaller. So n1/n2 would decrease. Because when T is lower, higher energy levels are less populated compared to lower ones.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T drops from 6000 K to 5500 K, the ratio n1/n2 becomes smaller. So when the star is without spots (T=6000), the ratio is higher than when it has spots (T=5500).\n\nSo the ratio when no spots (R1) is higher than when spots are present (R2). So the factor is R1/R2. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes\u2014so we need to compute R1/R2.\n\nBut wait, the energy difference between the levels (\u0394E) is related to the wavelength of the transition. The problem says the transition corresponds to about 1448 \u00c5, which is in the near-ultraviolet or perhaps far-UV. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/\u03bb. So \u0394E = hc/\u03bb. \n\nCalculating \u0394E: h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo \u0394E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) \u2248 1.373e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut wait, we can also express \u0394E in terms of temperature. Alternatively, since we're dealing with the Boltzmann factor, perhaps we can find the ratio of the Boltzmann factors at two different temperatures.\n\nLet me think: The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(k*T) ), because n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1. So the ratio without spots is R1 = exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ), and with spots R2 = exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ), where T1 is 6000 K and T2 is 5500 K.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T decreases, the ratio R decreases, which makes sense because as T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, so R is smaller.\n\nSo the factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2 = exp( [\u0394E/(k T1) - \u0394E/(k T2)] ) = exp( \u0394E/(k) [1/(T1) - 1/(T2)] )\n\nWait, no. Let me re-derive. The ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(k T) )\n\nSo R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) )\nR2 = (g1/g2) exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) )\n\nSo the ratio R1/R2 = [exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ] = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nWait, because [exp(a)]/[exp(b)] = exp(a - b). So, if a is -\u0394E/(k T1) and b is -\u0394E/(k T2), then a - b = (-\u0394E/(k T1)) - (-\u0394E/(k T2)) ) = \u0394E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the signs. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, R1 is at T1=6000, R2 at T2=5500.\n\nR1/R2 = [exp(-\u0394E/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-\u0394E/(k T2)) ] = exp( [ -\u0394E/(k T1) + \u0394E/(k T2) ] )\n\nFactor out \u0394E/(k): exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )\n\nWait, yes. Because -a + b = b -a = (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) * (\u0394E/(k)).\n\nSo, the exponent is (\u0394E/(k)) * (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )\n\nBut since T2 < T1, 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1, so (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive. And \u0394E is positive because E2>E1. So the exponent is positive. So R1/R2 is exp( positive ), which is greater than 1. So the ratio increases, which aligns with the problem statement that when the star has spots (T2), R is lower than when it doesn't (T1).\n\nSo the factor is exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me compute the exponent more carefully.\n\nWe have:\n\n\u0394E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo let me compute (\u0394E)/(k) = (hc)/(\u03bb k)\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J s\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m\nk = Boltzmann constant = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nSo (\u0394E)/(k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 )\n\nLet me compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1448e-33 * 1.38e-23 = Let me compute 1448 * 1.38 = approx 1995.84, so 1995.84e-56? Wait, wait, perhaps better to compute in exponents.\n\nWait, 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m. So denominator is 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = (1.448 * 1.38) * 1e-30 m\u00b7J/K.\n\nWait, 1.448 * 1.38 \u2248 1.448 * 1.38. Let's compute: 1.448 * 1.38 = (1.4 *1.38) + (0.048 *1.38). 1.4 *1.38=1.932, 0.048 *1.38\u22480.065. So total \u22481.997.\n\nSo denominator is approximately 1.997e-30 m\u00b7J/K.\n\nWait, but numerator is 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo (\u0394E)/(k) = (1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1.997e-30 m\u00b7J/K ) )\n\nWait, J\u00b7m divided by m\u00b7J/K is (J m) / (m J/K) ) = K.\n\nWait, the units: (J\u00b7m) / (m\u00b7J/K) ) = K.\n\nSo, the value is (1.9878e-25) / (1.997e-30) ) \u2248 (approx 1e5) because 1e-25 / 1e-30 = 1e5. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\n1.9878e-25 / 1.997e-30 \u2248 (1.9878 / 1.997) * 1e5 \u2248 approx 1.0 * 1e5 = 1e5 K.\n\nWait, 1.9878 / 1.997 is about 0.996, so it's about 99600 K. Let me just take it as approximately 1e5 K.\n\nSo, (\u0394E)/(k) \u2248 1e5 K.\n\nWait, that's a rough estimate. Let me get more precise.\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1448 * 1.38e-33 J\u00b7m/K.\n\n1448 * 1.38 = let's compute:\n\n1448 * 1 = 1448.\n\n1448 * 0.38 = 1448 * 0.3 = 434.4, 1448 *0.08=115.84 \u2192 434.4+115.84=550.24. So 1448 + 550.24=1998.24.\n\nSo denominator is 1998.24e-33 J\u00b7m/K \u2192 1.99824e-30 J\u00b7m/K.\n\nSo (\u0394E/k) = (1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1.99824e-30 J\u00b7m/K) ) \u2192 the J\u00b7m cancels out, and we get:\n\n(1.9878e-25) / (1.99824e-30) ) K \u2248 (1.9878 / 1.99824) ) * (1e5) \u2192 approx (0.995) * 1e5 \u2192 ~99,500 K.\n\nSo approximately 99,500 K, which I'll round to 1e5 K for simplicity.\n\nSo (\u0394E)/(k) \u2248 1e5 K.\n\nNow, the exponent is (\u0394E/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )\n\nSo T1=6000 K, T2=5500 K.\n\nCompute 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1/5500) - (1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500 / (33,000,000) ) = 5/(330,000) ) \u2248 1.515e-5.\n\nWait, let's compute that exactly:\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818 (since 1/5500 = 1/(5.5e3) = approx 1.818e-4 )\n\n1/6000 \u2248 1.6667e-4.\n\nSo 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (1.818e-4) - (1.6667e-4) = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5.\n\nSo, exponent = (1e5 K) * (1.513e-5 ) = 1.513e0 = approx 1.513.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(1.513) \u2248 e^1.513.\n\nWhat's e^1.513?

When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels\u2014level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.\n\nWait, so the ratio N1/N2 goes down when there are spots. The problem says that the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5, which is in the ultraviolet range, I think. Also, the photosphere is in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. So the Saha equation and Boltzmann equation should be relevant here.\n\nLet me think about what affects the ratio of two energy levels. The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So if E2 is higher than E1, then when temperature increases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases because the exponent becomes more negative.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me clarify: the Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight. So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Oh wait no, wait. Let me get that right.\n\nThe correct Boltzmann distribution is (n_j / n_i) = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) ). So if E_j > E_i, then higher temperature makes the exponential less negative, so the ratio n_j/n_i increases.\n\nSo in our problem, the ratio of N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2>E1. So when the temperature changes, this ratio changes.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014what's the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The problem says when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower\u20145500 K. So when the star has spots, the temperature is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K.\n\nSo the ratio without spots is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 6000) )\nAnd with spots, it's (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 5500) )\n\nBut the question is, when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher or lower than when it does. The problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower. That implies that when T is lower, the ratio N1/N2 is lower.\n\nWait, but let's think about how the ratio N1/N2 depends on T. Since E2>E1, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So as T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases because the denominator is larger. So the exponential term becomes smaller (since exponent is smaller positive number, so e^smaller is smaller). So N1/N2 would decrease as T increases. Because, for higher T, the ratio n1/n2 is lower.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's say E2 > E1. So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nIf T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller, so the exponent is smaller. So exp(...) is smaller. So n1/n2 decreases as T increases.\n\nSo when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K) than when it doesn't (6000 K). So when T is lower, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so the exponential term is larger, so n1/n2 is larger. Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that doesn't match my initial thought.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio N1/N2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, as T increases, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So if when T is lower, the ratio N1/N2 is lower, that would mean that with lower T, the ratio is lower. Which contradicts the Boltzmann equation as I thought. So perhaps I got the ratio backwards.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Let me define the ratio as N1/N2. So for a higher T, the ratio is lower. So when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio is higher. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that would mean that when T is lower, the ratio is lower. Which contradicts the expectation. Hmm, maybe I got the energy levels mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about which level is higher. If E2 is higher than E1, then when T increases, more atoms will be excited to E2. So the population of E2 increases, so the ratio N1/N2 decreases.\n\nBut according to the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio N1/N2 is lower. So in that case, when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. Which would imply that higher T makes N1/N2 higher. But according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T should make N1/N2 lower because more atoms are excited to higher levels, thus N2 increases relative to N1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the ratio backwards. Let me re-examine. The ratio given is N1/N2. So when T increases, N2 increases more than N1, so N1/N2 decreases. So when T is higher, N1/N2 is lower. So when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is higher. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that would mean that when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower, which contradicts the expectation.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition corresponds to a certain wavelength. The given wavelength is 1448 \u00c5, which is about 144.8 nm, in the UV. Ti I (neutral Ti) has a transition in that range. So the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the relation E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo let's compute E = hc/(lambda), where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. But since we're dealing with ratios, maybe we don't need the exact energy, but perhaps the ratio of the exponentials.\n\nWait, but to compute the factor by which the ratio changes, perhaps we can model it using the ratio of the Boltzmann factors at T1 and T2.\n\nSo the ratio without spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )\n\nThe ratio with spots is R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nThe factor we're looking for is R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nBecause R1/R2 = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nSo the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWe can compute (E2-E1) using E=hc/lambda.\n\nSo let's compute (E2-E1) = hc/(lambda)\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nlambda = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) \u2248 1.373e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut wait, we can express this in terms of eV because it might be easier, but maybe it's not necessary. Alternatively, since we're dealing with the ratio, perhaps we can compute the exponent in terms of (1/T1 - 1/T2) multiplied by (E2-E1)/k.\n\nWait, the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute (E2-E1) = hc/lambda = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) = (1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1.448e-7 m) ) = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nk is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) \u2248 9.95e4 K.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) \u2248 99500 K.\n\nNow, 1/T1 = 1/6000 \u2248 0.00016667 K^-1\n\n1/T2 = 1/5500 \u2248 0.00018182 K^-1\n\nSo (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (0.00016667 - 0.00018182) = -0.00001515 K^-1\n\nWait, no, because T1 is higher than T2, 1/T1 is less than 1/T2. So 1/T1 -1/T2 is negative.\n\nSo the exponent becomes (99500 K) * (-0.00001515 K^-1) \u2248 -1.506.\n\nSo the exponent is about -1.506.\n\nSo the factor R1/R2 = exp( -1.506 ) \u2248 e^-1.506 \u2248 0.221.\n\nWait, but wait. R1 is the ratio without spots (T=6000 K), R2 is with spots (T=5500 K). So R1 = N1/N2 without spots, R2 = N1/N2 with spots.\n\nThe problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R2 < R1.\n\nWhich would imply that R1/R2 is greater than 1, because R1 is larger than R2.\n\nBut according to our calculation, R1/R2 is about 0.221, which is less than 1. That can't be right. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the signs. Let me recheck.\n\nThe exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nE2-E1 is positive, because E2>E1.\n\n1/T1 is smaller than 1/T2 because T1 > T2.\n\nSo (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative.\n\nSo the exponent is positive * negative = negative.\n\nSo exp(negative) is a small number less than 1.\n\nWait, but that would imply R1/R2 is less than 1, so R1 < R2. But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio R = N1/N2 decreases. So R2 is lower than R1.\n\nWait, so R1 is higher than R2, so R1/R2 is greater than 1. But according to the calculation, it's about 0.221, which is less than 1. So this is a contradiction.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, wait. Let's think again. The ratio when spots are present is lower. So R2 < R1. So R1/R2 > 1. But according to the calculation, the ratio is about 0.221, which is less than 1. So that's a problem.\n\nAh, wait. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, (E2-E1) = hc/lambda.\n\nLet me compute it again.\n\nh = 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s (exact)\nc = 299792458 m/s (exact)\nlambda = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nE = h c / lambda = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / 1.448e-7.\n\nLet me compute numerator: 6.62607e-34 * 3e8 \u2248 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m / 1.448e-7 m = approximately 1.373e-18 J.\n\nSo (E2-E1) = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nk = 1.380649e-23 J/K.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) = (1.373e-18)/(1.38e-23) \u2248 (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 \u2248 approx 0.995 * 1e5 = 99500 K. So that part is correct.\n\n1/T1 = 1/6000 = 0.0001666667 K^-1\n\n1/T2 = 1/5500 \u2248 0.0001818182 K^-1\n\nSo (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (0.0001666667 - 0.0001818182) = -0.0000151515 K^-1.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = 99500 * (-0.0000151515) = \n\nLet me compute 99500 * 0.0000151515.\n\n0.0000151515 is approximately 1.51515e-5.\n\nSo 99500 * 1.51515e-5 = \n\nCompute 99500 * 1.51515e-5.\n\nWell, 99500 = 9.95e4.\n\nSo 9.95e4 * 1.51515e-5 = 9.95 * 1.51515e-1.\n\n9.95 * 1.51515 \u2248 15.04.\n\nSo 15.04e-1 = 1.504.\n\nBut since the sign was negative, it's -1.504.\n\nSo the exponent is -1.504.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(-1.504) \u2248 e^-1.504 \u2248 0.221.\n\nBut that would mean R1 = 0.221 * R2.\n\nSo R1 is smaller than R2. But that's conflicting with the problem statement, which says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R2 < R1. So R1/R2 must be greater than 1.\n\nWait, this suggests that my approach is incorrect. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I got the ratio backwards. Maybe the ratio being considered is N2/N1, not N1/N2.\n\nLet me think again. The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher, with spots, it's lower.\n\nIf the ratio is N2/N1, then when T increases, N2/N1 increases because more atoms are in the higher energy state.\n\nSo when the star has spots, T is lower, so N2/N1 would decrease, making N2/N1 lower. So the ratio N2/N1 with spots is lower than without spots.\n\nBut the problem says the ratio of N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio N1/N2 is lower when the star has spots, that would mean that N2 increases relative to N1 when the star has spots, which doesn't make sense because the temperature is lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Maybe the ratio is N1/N2, and when the star has spots (lower T), this ratio is lower. So R2 < R1.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, when T increases, N1/N2 decreases. So higher T leads to lower R1. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so R2 should be higher than R1.\n\nBut the problem says R2 < R1, which contradicts this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon at 1448 \u00c5. So E2 is higher than E1. So when an atom is in level 2, it can transition to level 1, emitting a photon. But that shouldn't affect the ratio; the energy levels are fixed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the excitation temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the star's atmosphere is being heated or cooled, but the problem says the overall photospheric Teff decreases.\n\nWait, but when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the entire photosphere's temperature is lower. So the photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So the photosphere's temperature is 5500 K when the star has spots, and 6000 K otherwise.\n\nSo the photosphere's T is 6000 K without spots, 5500 K with spots.\n\nSo the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T is 6000 K: R1 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) )\n\nWhen T is 5500 K: R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) )\n\nThe factor is R1 / R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, R1/R2 is [exp( (E2-E1)/(k * T1) ) ] / [exp( (E2-E1)/(k * T2) ) ]\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nAs before, but let's compute it correctly.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the sign earlier. Let me re-express this.\n\nLet me compute (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -500/(3.3e7) ) = approximately -1.515e-5.\n\nSo (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) is (99500 K) * (-1.515e-5 K^-1) ) = -1.504.\n\nSo the exponent is -1.504.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(-1.504) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo R1 is 0.221 times R2.\n\nWhich means R1 < R2.\n\nBut the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So R2 < R1.\n\nWhich contradicts the calculation. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio being considered is N2/N1, not N1/N2. Let me try that.\n\nIf the ratio is N2/N1, then when T increases, N2/N1 increases because more atoms are in higher energy states.\n\nSo R1 (without spots) would be N2/N1 at 6000 K, and R2 (with spots) would be N2/N1 at 5500 K.\n\nSo R1 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) )\n\nR2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) )\n\nFactor is R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nWhich is same as before: exp( -1.504 ) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo R1 = 0.221 * R2 \u2192 R2 = R1 / 0.221 \u2248 4.52 R1.\n\nSo R2 is about 4.5 times R1.\n\nSo the ratio N2/N1 increases when the star has spots, which would mean that the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots.\n\nWhich aligns with the problem statement. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the factor by which the ratio N1/N2 changes is R1 / R2 = 0.221.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So it's R1 / R2 = 0.221, which is about 1/4.52.\n\nSo the ratio N1/N2 without spots is 0.221 times that with spots. So the factor is approximately 0.221, which is about 1/4.52. So the factor is approximately 4.52.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as: \"the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.\"\n\nSo the factor is (R1)/(R2) = 0.221 \u2192 approximately 0.22. But the options are all greater than 1.\n\nWait, no, wait. The problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R2 < R1. So R1/R2 is greater than 1.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, when considering N2/N1, R1 is 0.221 R2. So R2 = R1 / 0.221 \u2248 4.5 R1.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to approach it step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So R2 (with spots) < R1 (without spots).\n\nWe need to find the factor by which R1 is larger than R2. So factor = R1/R2.\n\nIf R1 is larger than R2, the factor is greater than 1.\n\nBut according to the calculation, when considering N1/N2 as the ratio, R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nWhich is exp( (99500) * (-1.515e-5) ) = exp(-1.504) \u2248 0.221. So R1 = 0.221 R2 \u2192 R2 = R1 / 0.221 \u2248 4.52 R1.\n\nWhich would mean that R2 is larger than R1, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nSo perhaps I'm using the wrong ratio. Let's think about it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is N2/N1, and when the star has spots, the ratio increases, meaning N2/N1 is higher when T is lower. Which would imply that N1/N2 is lower, which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo in that case, R1 = N2/N1 at 6000 K.\n\nR2 = N2/N1 at 5500 K.\n\nSo the factor is R2/R1 = exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/5500 - 1/6000) )\n\nWhich is the same as R2/R1 = exp( (99500) * (1.515e-5) ) = exp(1.504) \u2248 4.51.\n\nSo R2 is about 4.5 times R1.\n\nWhich would mean that N2/N1 increases when T decreases (when the star has spots), which means that N1/N2 decreases. Which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo the ratio of N2/N1 increases by a factor of about 4.5 when the star has spots. Therefore, the ratio N1/N2 decreases by a factor of 1/4.5, so the ratio without spots is 0.221 times that with spots.\n\nBut the question is, what's the factor by which this ratio (N1/N2) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So it's R1/R2 = 0.221, which is about 1/4.5 \u2192 so the factor is 0.221, but none of the options are less than 1.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nA) ~1.1\n\nB) ~7.8\n\nC) ~4.5\n\nD) ~2.9\n\nHmm, so none of the options are less than 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the ratio being considered is (n1/n2) without spots divided by (n1/n2) with spots.\n\nSo the factor is R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) = exp( -1.504 ) \u2248 0.221.\n\nWhich is about 0.22, so the ratio without spots is 0.22 times that with spots. So the factor is about 0.22, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the factor is the inverse: R2/R1 \u2248 4.5, which is option C.\n\nBut the question asks for the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So if R1 is without spots, R2 is with spots.\n\nIf R1 = 0.221 R2 \u2192 R1/R2 = 0.221 \u2192 factor is about 0.22, but the options don't have that.\n\nBut if the factor is R2/R1 \u2248 4.5, which is option C, and that's the factor when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.\"\n\nSo the ratio is R1/R2 = 0.221, which is about 1/4.5. So the factor is approximately 0.22, but none of the options match that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent.\n\nWait, let me recompute the exponent.\n\n(E2-E1)/(k) = 1.373e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K \u2248 99500 K.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) = 99500 K.\n\nThen, (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -500 / 3.3e7 \u2248 -1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) = 99500 * (-1.515e-5) \u2248 -1.504.\n\nSo exponent is -1.504.\n\nSo exp(-1.504) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo R1/R2 = 0.221.\n\nBut the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so R2 < R1.\n\nWhich would imply R1/R2 is greater than 1. But according to this, it's less than 1. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the spots are present, the overall effective temperature of the star is lower. But the spots themselves are cooler, so the surrounding photosphere might be hotter? Or does the presence of spots affect the overall photospheric temperature?\n\nWait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K in that case.\n\nSo when the star has spots, the photosphere is cooler. So the ratio N1/N2 in the photosphere is lower because the temperature is lower.\n\nWait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSince E2-E1 is positive, a lower T would make the exponent larger, so the ratio N1/N2 would be larger.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I've mixed up the energy levels. Maybe E1 is higher than E2. So E1 > E2.\n\nIn that case, the exponent becomes (E2-E1) = negative. So when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes a larger negative number, making the exponential smaller. So N1/N2 would decrease as T increases.\n\nWait, but if E1 > E2, then level 1 is higher. So the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which is a drop in energy, emitting a photon at 1448 \u00c5.\n\nIn that case, the Boltzmann factor would be:\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nBut since E2 < E1, (E2-E1) is negative. So the exponent is negative.\n\nSo when T increases, the exponent (negative) becomes less negative, so the exponential is larger. So n1/n2 increases with T.\n\nSo when the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 is lower.\n\nWhich matches the problem statement. So that would make sense.\n\nAh, so perhaps I made a mistake in assuming E2 > E1. The problem says the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. So if the star emits a photon when an electron drops from level 2 to level 1, then E2 > E1. But if it's the other way around, level 1 to level 2, that would imply E1 < E2. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the energy of the photon emitted is E = E_upper - E_lower. So if the transition is from level 2 to level 1, then E2 > E1, and the photon energy is E2 - E1.\n\nBut if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, that would require E1 < E2, but that's not possible because it would require absorption of a photon. So in the context of stellar atmospheres, emission lines are transitions from higher to lower energy levels. So the Ti I line at 1448 \u00c5 is an emission line, so it's from level 2 to level 1, with E2 > E1.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So according to the earlier calculation, when T is lower (with spots), the ratio N1/N2 should be higher, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nSo perhaps the issue is that the effective temperature isn't the same as the local temperature where the line is formed. Or perhaps the presence of spots affects the continuum emission but not the line formation in the same way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the spots are present, the star's overall luminosity changes, but the line formation occurs in a region that is either hotter or cooler.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so the line formation is at the effective temperature given.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two levels is being observed, and when the spots are present, the overall photospheric temperature is lower, leading to a higher ratio of N1/N2. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would imply that N1/N2 is lower when T is lower, which is not possible under the Boltzmann equation.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the ratio being considered is N2/N1.\n\nSo when the star has spots, T is lower, so N2/N1 decreases, which implies that N1/N2 increases. But the problem says that the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the effective temperature given is the overall star's Teff, but the line is formed in a region where the local temperature is different. But the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so I think that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is formed in a region where the temperature is higher than the surrounding photosphere. But the problem doesn't suggest that.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible options.\n\nThe options are A: ~1.1, B: ~7.8, C: ~4.5, D: ~2.9.\n\nEarlier, when I calculated the factor R1/R2 (N1/N2 without spots compared to with spots), I got approximately 0.221, which is about 1/4.5. So the inverse is 4.5, which is option C.\n\nSo perhaps the factor is 4.5, meaning that without spots, the ratio is 4.5 times higher than when the spots are present.\n\nBut the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So R1 (without spots) is higher than R2 (with spots).\n\nSo the factor is R1/R2 = 4.5.\n\nWhich would be option C.\n\nSo the answer would be C) ~4.5.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (N1/N2) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we analyze the problem using the Boltzmann equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \\(E_2 > E_1\\) is the energy difference between the levels, \\(k\\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Without spots**: \\(T_1 = 6000 \\, \\text{K}\\).\n2. **With spots**: \\(T_2 = 5500 \\, \\text{K}\\).\n3.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, let's read it again.\n\nSo, the star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels\u2014level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.\n\nWait, so the ratio N1/N2 goes down when there are spots. The problem says that the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5, which is in the ultraviolet range, I think. Also, the photosphere is in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. So the Saha equation and Boltzmann equation should be relevant here.\n\nLet me think about what affects the ratio of two energy levels. The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So if E2 is higher than E1, then when temperature increases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases because the exponent becomes more negative.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me clarify: the Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight. So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Oh wait no, wait. Let me get that right.\n\nThe correct Boltzmann distribution is (n_j / n_i) = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) ). So if E_j > E_i, then higher temperature makes the exponential less negative, so the ratio n_j/n_i increases.\n\nSo in our problem, the ratio of N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2>E1. So when the temperature changes, this ratio changes.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014what's the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The problem says when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower\u20145500 K. So when the star has spots, the temperature is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K.\n\nSo the ratio without spots is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 6000) )\nAnd with spots, it's (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 5500) )\n\nBut the question is, when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher or lower than when it does. The problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower. That implies that when T is lower, the ratio N1/N2 is lower.\n\nWait, but let's think about how the ratio N1/N2 depends on T. Since E2>E1, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So as T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases because the denominator is larger. So the exponential term becomes smaller (since exponent is smaller positive number, so e^smaller is smaller). So N1/N2 would decrease as T increases. Because, for higher T, the ratio n1/n2 is lower.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's say E2 > E1. So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nIf T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller, so the exponent is smaller. So exp(...) is smaller. So n1/n2 decreases as T increases.\n\nSo when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K) than when it doesn't (6000 K). So when T is lower, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so the exponential term is larger, so n1/n2 is larger. Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that doesn't match my initial thought.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio N1/N2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, as T increases, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So if when T is lower, the ratio N1/N2 is lower, that would mean that with lower T, the ratio is lower. Which contradicts the Boltzmann equation as I thought. So perhaps I got the ratio backwards.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Let me define the ratio as N1/N2. So for a higher T, the ratio is lower. So when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio is higher. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that would mean that when T is lower, the ratio is lower. Which contradicts the expectation. Hmm, maybe I got the energy levels mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about which level is higher. If E2 is higher than E1, then when T increases, more atoms will be excited to E2. So the population of E2 increases, so the ratio N1/N2 decreases.\n\nBut according to the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio N1/N2 is lower. So in that case, when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. Which would imply that higher T makes N1/N2 higher. But according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T should make N1/N2 lower because more atoms are excited to higher levels, thus N2 increases relative to N1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the ratio backwards. Let me re-examine. The ratio given is N1/N2. So when T increases, N2 increases more than N1, so N1/N2 decreases. So when T is higher, N1/N2 is lower. So when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is higher. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that would mean that when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower, which contradicts the expectation.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition corresponds to a certain wavelength. The given wavelength is 1448 \u00c5, which is about 144.8 nm, in the UV. Ti I (neutral Ti) has a transition in that range. So the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the relation E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo let's compute E = hc/(lambda), where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. But since we're dealing with ratios, maybe we don't need the exact energy, but perhaps the ratio of the exponentials.\n\nWait, but to compute the factor by which the ratio changes, perhaps we can model it using the ratio of the Boltzmann factors at T1 and T2.\n\nSo the ratio without spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )\n\nThe ratio with spots is R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )\n\nThe factor we're looking for is R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nBecause R1/R2 = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]\n\n= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nSo the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nWe can compute (E2-E1) using E=hc/lambda.\n\nSo let's compute (E2-E1) = hc/(lambda)\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nlambda = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) \u2248 1.373e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut wait, we can express this in terms of eV because it might be easier, but maybe it's not necessary. Alternatively, since we're dealing with the ratio, perhaps we can compute the exponent in terms of (1/T1 - 1/T2) multiplied by (E2-E1)/k.\n\nWait, the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute (E2-E1) = hc/lambda = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) = (1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m) / (1.448e-7 m) ) = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nk is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) \u2248 9.95e4 K.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) \u2248 99500 K.\n\nNow, 1/T1 = 1/6000 \u2248 0.00016667 K^-1\n\n1/T2 = 1/5500 \u2248 0.00018182 K^-1\n\nSo (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (0.00016667 - 0.00018182) = -0.00001515 K^-1\n\nWait, no, because T1 is higher than T2, 1/T1 is less than 1/T2. So 1/T1 -1/T2 is negative.\n\nSo the exponent becomes (99500 K) * (-0.00001515 K^-1) \u2248 -1.506.\n\nSo the exponent is about -1.506.\n\nSo the factor R1/R2 = exp( -1.506 ) \u2248 e^-1.506 \u2248 0.221.\n\nWait, but wait. R1 is the ratio without spots (T=6000 K), R2 is with spots (T=5500 K). So R1 = N1/N2 without spots, R2 = N1/N2 with spots.\n\nThe problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R2 < R1.\n\nWhich would imply that R1/R2 is greater than 1, because R1 is larger than R2.\n\nBut according to our calculation, R1/R2 is about 0.221, which is less than 1. That can't be right. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the signs. Let me recheck.\n\nThe exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)\n\nE2-E1 is positive, because E2>E1.\n\n1/T1 is smaller than 1/T2 because T1 > T2.\n\nSo (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative.\n\nSo the exponent is positive * negative = negative.\n\nSo exp(negative) is a small number less than 1.\n\nWait, but that would imply R1/R2 is less than 1, so R1 < R2. But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio R = N1/N2 decreases. So R2 is lower than R1.\n\nWait, so R1 is higher than R2, so R1/R2 is greater than 1. But according to the calculation, it's about 0.221, which is less than 1. So this is a contradiction.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, wait. Let's think again. The ratio when spots are present is lower. So R2 < R1. So R1/R2 > 1. But according to the calculation, the ratio is about 0.221, which is less than 1. So that's a problem.\n\nAh, wait. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, (E2-E1) = hc/lambda.\n\nLet me compute it again.\n\nh = 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s (exact)\nc = 299792458 m/s (exact)\nlambda = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nE = h c / lambda = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / 1.448e-7.\n\nLet me compute numerator: 6.62607e-34 * 3e8 \u2248 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nSo 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m / 1.448e-7 m = approximately 1.373e-18 J.\n\nSo (E2-E1) = 1.373e-18 J.\n\nk = 1.380649e-23 J/K.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) = (1.373e-18)/(1.38e-23) \u2248 (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 \u2248 approx 0.995 * 1e5 = 99500 K. So that part is correct.\n\n1/T1 = 1/6000 = 0.0001666667 K^-1\n\n1/T2 = 1/5500 \u2248 0.0001818182 K^-1\n\nSo (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (0.0001666667 - 0.0001818182) = -0.0000151515 K^-1.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = 99500 * (-0.0000151515) = \n\nLet me compute 99500 * 0.0000151515.\n\n0.0000151515 is approximately 1.51515e-5.\n\nSo 99500 * 1.51515e-5 = \n\nCompute 99500 * 1.51515e-5.\n\nWell, 99500 = 9.95e4.\n\nSo 9.95e4 * 1.51515e-5 = 9.95 * 1.51515e-1.\n\n9.95 * 1.51515 \u2248 15.04.\n\nSo 15.04e-1 = 1.504.\n\nBut since the sign was negative, it's -1.504.\n\nSo the exponent is -1.504.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(-1.504) \u2248 e^-1.504 \u2248 0.221.\n\nBut that would mean R1 = 0.221 * R2.\n\nSo R1 is smaller than R2. But that's conflicting with the problem statement, which says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R2 < R1. So R1/R2 must be greater than 1.\n\nWait, this suggests that my approach is incorrect. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I got the ratio backwards. Maybe the ratio being considered is N2/N1, not N1/N2.\n\nLet me think again. The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher, with spots, it's lower.\n\nIf the ratio is N2/N1, then when T increases, N2/N1 increases because more atoms are in the higher energy state.\n\nSo when the star has spots, T is lower, so N2/N1 would decrease, making N2/N1 lower. So the ratio N2/N1 with spots is lower than without spots.\n\nBut the problem says the ratio of N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio N1/N2 is lower when the star has spots, that would mean that N2 increases relative to N1 when the star has spots, which doesn't make sense because the temperature is lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Maybe the ratio is N1/N2, and when the star has spots (lower T), this ratio is lower. So R2 < R1.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, when T increases, N1/N2 decreases. So higher T leads to lower R1. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so R2 should be higher than R1.\n\nBut the problem says R2 < R1, which contradicts this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon at 1448 \u00c5. So E2 is higher than E1. So when an atom is in level 2, it can transition to level 1, emitting a photon. But that shouldn't affect the ratio; the energy levels are fixed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the excitation temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the star's atmosphere is being heated or cooled, but the problem says the overall photospheric Teff decreases.\n\nWait, but when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the entire photosphere's temperature is lower. So the photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So the photosphere's temperature is 5500 K when the star has spots, and 6000 K otherwise.\n\nSo the photosphere's T is 6000 K without spots, 5500 K with spots.\n\nSo the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T is 6000 K: R1 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) )\n\nWhen T is 5500 K: R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) )\n\nThe factor is R1 / R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, R1/R2 is [exp( (E2-E1)/(k * T1) ) ] / [exp( (E2-E1)/(k * T2) ) ]\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )\n\nAs before, but let's compute it correctly.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the sign earlier. Let me re-express this.\n\nLet me compute (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -500/(3.3e7) ) = approximately -1.515e-5.\n\nSo (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) is (99500 K) * (-1.515e-5 K^-1) ) = -1.504.\n\nSo the exponent is -1.504.\n\nSo R1/R2 = exp(-1.504) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo R1 is 0.221 times R2.\n\nWhich means R1 < R2.\n\nBut the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So R2 < R1.\n\nWhich contradicts the calculation. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio being considered is N2/N1, not N1/N2. Let me try that.\n\nIf the ratio is N2/N1, then when T increases, N2/N1 increases because more atoms are in higher energy states.\n\nSo R1 (without spots) would be N2/N1 at 6000 K, and R2 (with spots) would be N2/N1 at 5500 K.\n\nSo R1 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) )\n\nR2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) )\n\nFactor is R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nWhich is same as before: exp( -1.504 ) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo R1 = 0.221 * R2 \u2192 R2 = R1 / 0.221 \u2248 4.52 R1.\n\nSo R2 is about 4.5 times R1.\n\nSo the ratio N2/N1 increases when the star has spots, which would mean that the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots.\n\nWhich aligns with the problem statement. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the factor by which the ratio N1/N2 changes is R1 / R2 = 0.221.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So it's R1 / R2 = 0.221, which is about 1/4.52.\n\nSo the ratio N1/N2 without spots is 0.221 times that with spots. So the factor is approximately 0.221, which is about 1/4.52. So the factor is approximately 4.52.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as: \"the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.\"\n\nSo the factor is (R1)/(R2) = 0.221 \u2192 approximately 0.22. But the options are all greater than 1.\n\nWait, no, wait. The problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R2 < R1. So R1/R2 is greater than 1.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, when considering N2/N1, R1 is 0.221 R2. So R2 = R1 / 0.221 \u2248 4.5 R1.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to approach it step by step.\n\nThe problem statement says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So R2 (with spots) < R1 (without spots).\n\nWe need to find the factor by which R1 is larger than R2. So factor = R1/R2.\n\nIf R1 is larger than R2, the factor is greater than 1.\n\nBut according to the calculation, when considering N1/N2 as the ratio, R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/6000 - 1/5500) )\n\nWhich is exp( (99500) * (-1.515e-5) ) = exp(-1.504) \u2248 0.221. So R1 = 0.221 R2 \u2192 R2 = R1 / 0.221 \u2248 4.52 R1.\n\nWhich would mean that R2 is larger than R1, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nSo perhaps I'm using the wrong ratio. Let's think about it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is N2/N1, and when the star has spots, the ratio increases, meaning N2/N1 is higher when T is lower. Which would imply that N1/N2 is lower, which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo in that case, R1 = N2/N1 at 6000 K.\n\nR2 = N2/N1 at 5500 K.\n\nSo the factor is R2/R1 = exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/5500 - 1/6000) )\n\nWhich is the same as R2/R1 = exp( (99500) * (1.515e-5) ) = exp(1.504) \u2248 4.51.\n\nSo R2 is about 4.5 times R1.\n\nWhich would mean that N2/N1 increases when T decreases (when the star has spots), which means that N1/N2 decreases. Which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo the ratio of N2/N1 increases by a factor of about 4.5 when the star has spots. Therefore, the ratio N1/N2 decreases by a factor of 1/4.5, so the ratio without spots is 0.221 times that with spots.\n\nBut the question is, what's the factor by which this ratio (N1/N2) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So it's R1/R2 = 0.221, which is about 1/4.5 \u2192 so the factor is 0.221, but none of the options are less than 1.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nA) ~1.1\n\nB) ~7.8\n\nC) ~4.5\n\nD) ~2.9\n\nHmm, so none of the options are less than 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the ratio being considered is (n1/n2) without spots divided by (n1/n2) with spots.\n\nSo the factor is R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) = exp( -1.504 ) \u2248 0.221.\n\nWhich is about 0.22, so the ratio without spots is 0.22 times that with spots. So the factor is about 0.22, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the factor is the inverse: R2/R1 \u2248 4.5, which is option C.\n\nBut the question asks for the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So if R1 is without spots, R2 is with spots.\n\nIf R1 = 0.221 R2 \u2192 R1/R2 = 0.221 \u2192 factor is about 0.22, but the options don't have that.\n\nBut if the factor is R2/R1 \u2248 4.5, which is option C, and that's the factor when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.\"\n\nSo the ratio is R1/R2 = 0.221, which is about 1/4.5. So the factor is approximately 0.22, but none of the options match that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent.\n\nWait, let me recompute the exponent.\n\n(E2-E1)/(k) = 1.373e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K \u2248 99500 K.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) = 99500 K.\n\nThen, (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -500 / 3.3e7 \u2248 -1.515e-5 K^-1.\n\nSo (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) = 99500 * (-1.515e-5) \u2248 -1.504.\n\nSo exponent is -1.504.\n\nSo exp(-1.504) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo R1/R2 = 0.221.\n\nBut the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so R2 < R1.\n\nWhich would imply R1/R2 is greater than 1. But according to this, it's less than 1. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the spots are present, the overall effective temperature of the star is lower. But the spots themselves are cooler, so the surrounding photosphere might be hotter? Or does the presence of spots affect the overall photospheric temperature?\n\nWait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K in that case.\n\nSo when the star has spots, the photosphere is cooler. So the ratio N1/N2 in the photosphere is lower because the temperature is lower.\n\nWait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSince E2-E1 is positive, a lower T would make the exponent larger, so the ratio N1/N2 would be larger.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I've mixed up the energy levels. Maybe E1 is higher than E2. So E1 > E2.\n\nIn that case, the exponent becomes (E2-E1) = negative. So when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes a larger negative number, making the exponential smaller. So N1/N2 would decrease as T increases.\n\nWait, but if E1 > E2, then level 1 is higher. So the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which is a drop in energy, emitting a photon at 1448 \u00c5.\n\nIn that case, the Boltzmann factor would be:\n\nn1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nBut since E2 < E1, (E2-E1) is negative. So the exponent is negative.\n\nSo when T increases, the exponent (negative) becomes less negative, so the exponential is larger. So n1/n2 increases with T.\n\nSo when the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 is lower.\n\nWhich matches the problem statement. So that would make sense.\n\nAh, so perhaps I made a mistake in assuming E2 > E1. The problem says the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. So if the star emits a photon when an electron drops from level 2 to level 1, then E2 > E1. But if it's the other way around, level 1 to level 2, that would imply E1 < E2. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the energy of the photon emitted is E = E_upper - E_lower. So if the transition is from level 2 to level 1, then E2 > E1, and the photon energy is E2 - E1.\n\nBut if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, that would require E1 < E2, but that's not possible because it would require absorption of a photon. So in the context of stellar atmospheres, emission lines are transitions from higher to lower energy levels. So the Ti I line at 1448 \u00c5 is an emission line, so it's from level 2 to level 1, with E2 > E1.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So according to the earlier calculation, when T is lower (with spots), the ratio N1/N2 should be higher, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nSo perhaps the issue is that the effective temperature isn't the same as the local temperature where the line is formed. Or perhaps the presence of spots affects the continuum emission but not the line formation in the same way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the spots are present, the star's overall luminosity changes, but the line formation occurs in a region that is either hotter or cooler.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so the line formation is at the effective temperature given.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two levels is being observed, and when the spots are present, the overall photospheric temperature is lower, leading to a higher ratio of N1/N2. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would imply that N1/N2 is lower when T is lower, which is not possible under the Boltzmann equation.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the ratio being considered is N2/N1.\n\nSo when the star has spots, T is lower, so N2/N1 decreases, which implies that N1/N2 increases. But the problem says that the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the effective temperature given is the overall star's Teff, but the line is formed in a region where the local temperature is different. But the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so I think that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is formed in a region where the temperature is higher than the surrounding photosphere. But the problem doesn't suggest that.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible options.\n\nThe options are A: ~1.1, B: ~7.8, C: ~4.5, D: ~2.9.\n\nEarlier, when I calculated the factor R1/R2 (N1/N2 without spots compared to with spots), I got approximately 0.221, which is about 1/4.5. So the inverse is 4.5, which is option C.\n\nSo perhaps the factor is 4.5, meaning that without spots, the ratio is 4.5 times higher than when the spots are present.\n\nBut the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So R1 (without spots) is higher than R2 (with spots).\n\nSo the factor is R1/R2 = 4.5.\n\nWhich would be option C.\n\nSo the answer would be C) ~4.5.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (N1/N2) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we analyze the problem using the Boltzmann equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \\(E_2 > E_1\\) is the energy difference between the levels, \\(k\\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Without spots**: \\(T_1 = 6000 \\, \\text{K}\\).\n2. **With spots**: \\(T_2 = 5500 \\, \\text{K}\\).\n3. The transition corresponds to a wavelength \\(\\lambda = 1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\), so the energy difference is:\n   \\[\n   E_2 - E_1 = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda},\n   \\]\n   where \\(h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s}\\) and \\(c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}\\). Substituting \\(\\lambda = 1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5} = 1.448 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}\\), we find:\n   \\[\n   E_2 - E_1 = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34})(3 \\times 10^8)}{1.448 \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 1.373 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}.\n   \\]\n   Using \\(k = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}\\), the term \\((E_2 - E_1)/k\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \\frac{1.373 \\times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23}} \\approx 99500 \\, \\text{K}.\n   \\]\n\n4. The ratio of the Boltzmann factors is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\\right),\n   \\]\n   where \\(R_1 = N_1/N_2\\) without spots and \\(R_2 = N_1/N_2\\) with spots.

The factor by which the ratio changes is:\n\\[\n\\frac{R_1}{R_2} \\approx 0.221.\n\\]\nThis implies that the ratio without spots is approximately \\(1/4.5\\) times the ratio with spots. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe factor is approximately **4.5**, corresponding to **Option C**.\n\nANSWER: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nAstronomers are studying a star with a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They noticed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5, and we can assume LTE.\n\nHmm, okay. So the main points are about how the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star's effective temperature changes. The star's temperature changes because of the spots, which I think are cooler regions on the star's surface.\n\nWait, when spots cover part of the surface, the overall effective temperature decreases. So without spots, Teff is 6000 K; with 40% coverage, it's 5500 K. But how does that affect the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels?\n\nI remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nIn this case, the ratio they're looking at is n1/n2 or n2/n1? Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let's see: when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K). So let me think about how temperature affects the ratio.\n\nThe ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if the temperature decreases, the exponential term would get smaller because T is in the denominator. Wait, because (E2 - E1) is positive if E2 is higher than E1. So when T decreases, exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ) decreases. That means n1/n2 would decrease. But the question says the ratio of n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So when the temperature is lower (spots present), the ratio is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher.\n\nWait, no. Let me get this straight. The ratio they observe is the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2, n1/n2. So when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when T decreases (from 6000 to 5500 K), n1/n2 decreases. So what does that imply about the energy levels? Let's see.\n\nn1 is the lower energy level, n2 is the higher. Because the ratio n1/n2 is decreasing with lower T, that suggests that as T decreases, the population in the lower level compared to the higher becomes less. Or wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if T goes down, the exponential term exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) becomes smaller because the denominator is smaller. So the ratio (n2/n1) would be (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). If T decreases, the exponent is more negative, so the exponential term is smaller. So n2/n1 would decrease. So the ratio n2/n1 is getting smaller, meaning that the population in level 2 is decreasing relative to level 1. So n1/n2 would be increasing if n2/n1 is decreasing. Wait, no, because n1/n2 is the inverse of n2/n1.\n\nWait, no: n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1). So if n2/n1 decreases, n1/n2 increases. So in the scenario where the star has spots, the Teff is lower, and n1/n2 increases? But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that's a contradiction. Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong.\n\nWait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when T was higher (6000 K). Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T increases, the ratio (n1/n2) would decrease because the exponential term becomes larger.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate. Let's say E2 is higher than E1. So E2 - E1 is positive.\n\nThe ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T increases, (E2-E1)/(kT) becomes smaller because T is bigger, so the exponent is smaller. So the exponential term becomes larger. So n1/n2 increases as T increases.\n\nWait, no. Because as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent is a smaller positive number. So exp(x) where x is smaller is a smaller value. Wait, no, exp(small positive) is a small number. Wait, no: exp(0) is 1. As x increases, exp(x) increases. So for (E2-E1)/(k T) being a positive number, when T increases, x decreases. So exp(x) decreases. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(x) would decrease as T increases.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's take a concrete example. Suppose E2-E1 = 10 eV, and T is 6000 K and then 5500 K.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think in terms of the exponent.\n\nThe exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T). Since E2 > E1, this is positive. So when T decreases, the denominator becomes smaller, so the exponent becomes larger. So exp(positive larger number) is larger. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) would increase when T decreases. Because the exponent is bigger.\n\nWait, so when T goes down, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp of that increases. So n1/n2 increases. But according to the problem statement, when T is lower (with spots), the ratio decreases. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2.\n\nWait, the problem says the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels. The wording says \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)\". So the ratio is n1/n2, as per the question. Because the first level is level 1, then level 2.\n\nSo if the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots, that means when T is lower (5500 K), n1/n2 is lower. So, without spots, at 6000 K, the ratio is higher.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent increases. So exp(...) increases, making n1/n2 larger. But according to the problem, when T is lower (spots present), n1/n2 is smaller. So that suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about which energy level is higher is wrong. Maybe E1 is higher than E2. So the energy levels could be in the opposite order.\n\nWait, that's possible. So perhaps level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. Then E1 - E2 is positive. So the exponent becomes (E2 - E1)/(k T) = -(E1-E2)/(k T). So the exponent is negative.\n\nSo n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nNow, when T decreases, the denominator is smaller, so (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes larger, so the negative exponent is more negative. So exp(-x) where x is larger is smaller. So n1/n2 decreases as T decreases. Which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo that would make sense. So in this case, level 1 is higher than level 2. So E1 > E2.\n\nSo now, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T decreases, this ratio decreases. Which aligns with the problem statement.\n\nSo now, to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star is without spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it has spots (T=5500 K).\n\nSo the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.\n\nWhich is [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E1-E2)/(k *6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E1-E2)/(k *5500) ) ]\n\nThe g1/g2 terms cancel out. So the factor becomes exp[ (E1-E2)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) ]\n\nWait, because when you divide the exponents, you subtract them. So:\n\nexp( [ -(E1-E2)/(k*6000) ) ] ) / exp( [ -(E1-E2)/(k*5500) ) ] ) = exp( [ (E1-E2)/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ] )\n\nWhich is the same as exp( (E1-E2)/(k) ( (6000 -5500) ) / (5500 *6000) ) )\n\nWait, let me compute 1/5500 - 1/6000. Let's compute that:\n\n1/5500 = approx 0.000181818\n\n1/6000 = approx 0.000166667\n\nSo 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151\n\nWhich is 1.5151e-5.\n\nSo the exponent is (E1-E2)/(k) * (1.5151e-5 )\n\nBut wait, I don't know the value of (E1-E2). The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. So the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the relation E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nYes, because the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and \u03bb is wavelength.\n\nSo (E1 - E2) = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo let's compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. Speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. Wavelength \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) )\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.372e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut wait, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So to convert Joules to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.\n\nSo E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nSo (E1-E2) is approximately 8.56 eV.\n\nNow, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\nSo (E1-E2)/(k) = 8.56 eV / (1.38e-23 J/K) * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J )\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, E1-E2 = 8.56 eV.\n\nConvert to J: 8.56 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.371e-18 J.\n\nThen, (E1-E2)/(k) = (1.371e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = (1.371 / 1.38) * 1e5 K \u2248 0.993 * 1e5 \u2248 9.93e4 K.\n\nWait, let me compute 1.371e-18 / 1.38e-23.\n\n1.371e-18 /1.38e-23 = (1.371 /1.38) * 1e5 \u2248 0.993 * 1e5 \u2248 99300 \u2248 9.93e4 K.\n\nSo (E1-E2)/(k) is approximately 9.93e4 K.\n\nNow, back to the exponent:\n\nExponent = (E1-E2)/(k) * (1/5500 -1/6000) )\n\nWhich is 9.93e4 K * (1.5151e-5 1/K )\n\nWait, 1/5500 is 1/(5.5e3) = approx 1.818e-4, but earlier I think I calculated the difference as 1.515e-5 1/K.\n\nWait, let's compute the exact difference: (1/5500) - (1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 1/(66,000) ) \u2248 1.51515e-5 1/K.\n\nSo the exponent is (9.93e4 K) * (1.51515e-5 1/K )\n\nMultiply those together:\n\n9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.93 * 1.515 ) * 1e-1.\n\nCompute 9.93 *1.515: 9 *1.5 is 13.5, 0.93*1.5 is about 1.395, so total around 14.895.\n\nWait, more accurately:\n\n9.93 *1.515:\n\n9 *1.515 = 13.635\n\n0.93 *1.515 = approximately 1.41045\n\nTotal: 13.635 +1.41045 \u2248 15.04545.\n\nSo 15.04545 * 1e-1 = 1.5045.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.5045.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.5045) \u2248 e^1.5045.\n\nI know that e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817. Let me compute e^1.5045.\n\n1.5045 is a bit more than 1.5, so e^1.5045 \u2248 4.5.\n\nWait, let me compute more accurately. Let's use a calculator approach.\n\nWe can approximate e^1.5045.\n\nWe know that ln(4.5) \u2248 1.50408. Let me check.\n\nWait, ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(4.5) is approximately 1.504077. Oh, wow, that's really close to our exponent of 1.5045.\n\nSo e^1.5045 \u2248 4.5003, which is about 4.5.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nSo the ratio (n1/n2) at 6000 K divided by that at 5500 K is about 4.5. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is 4.5 times higher than when it has spots. So the factor is ~4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nAstronomers are studying a star with a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They noticed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 \u00c5, and we can assume LTE.\n\nHmm, okay. So the main points are about how the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star's effective temperature changes. The star's temperature changes because of the spots, which I think are cooler regions on the star's surface.\n\nWait, when spots cover part of the surface, the overall effective temperature decreases. So without spots, Teff is 6000 K; with 40% coverage, it's 5500 K. But how does that affect the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels?\n\nI remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nIn this case, the ratio they're looking at is n1/n2 or n2/n1? Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let's see: when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K). So let me think about how temperature affects the ratio.\n\nThe ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if the temperature decreases, the exponential term would get smaller because T is in the denominator. Wait, because (E2 - E1) is positive if E2 is higher than E1. So when T decreases, exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ) decreases. That means n1/n2 would decrease. But the question says the ratio of n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So when the temperature is lower (spots present), the ratio is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher.\n\nWait, no. Let me get this straight. The ratio they observe is the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2, n1/n2. So when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when T decreases (from 6000 to 5500 K), n1/n2 decreases. So what does that imply about the energy levels? Let's see.\n\nn1 is the lower energy level, n2 is the higher. Because the ratio n1/n2 is decreasing with lower T, that suggests that as T decreases, the population in the lower level compared to the higher becomes less. Or wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if T goes down, the exponential term exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) becomes smaller because the denominator is smaller. So the ratio (n2/n1) would be (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). If T decreases, the exponent is more negative, so the exponential term is smaller. So n2/n1 would decrease. So the ratio n2/n1 is getting smaller, meaning that the population in level 2 is decreasing relative to level 1. So n1/n2 would be increasing if n2/n1 is decreasing. Wait, no, because n1/n2 is the inverse of n2/n1.\n\nWait, no: n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1). So if n2/n1 decreases, n1/n2 increases. So in the scenario where the star has spots, the Teff is lower, and n1/n2 increases? But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that's a contradiction. Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong.\n\nWait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when T was higher (6000 K). Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T increases, the ratio (n1/n2) would decrease because the exponential term becomes larger.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate. Let's say E2 is higher than E1. So E2 - E1 is positive.\n\nThe ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T increases, (E2-E1)/(kT) becomes smaller because T is bigger, so the exponent is smaller. So the exponential term becomes larger. So n1/n2 increases as T increases.\n\nWait, no. Because as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent is a smaller positive number. So exp(x) where x is smaller is a smaller value. Wait, no, exp(small positive) is a small number. Wait, no: exp(0) is 1. As x increases, exp(x) increases. So for (E2-E1)/(k T) being a positive number, when T increases, x decreases. So exp(x) decreases. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(x) would decrease as T increases.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's take a concrete example. Suppose E2-E1 = 10 eV, and T is 6000 K and then 5500 K.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think in terms of the exponent.\n\nThe exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T). Since E2 > E1, this is positive. So when T decreases, the denominator becomes smaller, so the exponent becomes larger. So exp(positive larger number) is larger. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) would increase when T decreases. Because the exponent is bigger.\n\nWait, so when T goes down, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp of that increases. So n1/n2 increases. But according to the problem statement, when T is lower (with spots), the ratio decreases. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2.\n\nWait, the problem says the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels. The wording says \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)\". So the ratio is n1/n2, as per the question. Because the first level is level 1, then level 2.\n\nSo if the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots, that means when T is lower (5500 K), n1/n2 is lower. So, without spots, at 6000 K, the ratio is higher.\n\nBut according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent increases. So exp(...) increases, making n1/n2 larger. But according to the problem, when T is lower (spots present), n1/n2 is smaller. So that suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about which energy level is higher is wrong. Maybe E1 is higher than E2. So the energy levels could be in the opposite order.\n\nWait, that's possible. So perhaps level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. Then E1 - E2 is positive. So the exponent becomes (E2 - E1)/(k T) = -(E1-E2)/(k T). So the exponent is negative.\n\nSo n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nNow, when T decreases, the denominator is smaller, so (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes larger, so the negative exponent is more negative. So exp(-x) where x is larger is smaller. So n1/n2 decreases as T decreases. Which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo that would make sense. So in this case, level 1 is higher than level 2. So E1 > E2.\n\nSo now, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )\n\nSo when T decreases, this ratio decreases. Which aligns with the problem statement.\n\nSo now, to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star is without spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it has spots (T=5500 K).\n\nSo the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.\n\nWhich is [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E1-E2)/(k *6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E1-E2)/(k *5500) ) ]\n\nThe g1/g2 terms cancel out. So the factor becomes exp[ (E1-E2)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) ]\n\nWait, because when you divide the exponents, you subtract them. So:\n\nexp( [ -(E1-E2)/(k*6000) ) ] ) / exp( [ -(E1-E2)/(k*5500) ) ] ) = exp( [ (E1-E2)/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ] )\n\nWhich is the same as exp( (E1-E2)/(k) ( (6000 -5500) ) / (5500 *6000) ) )\n\nWait, let me compute 1/5500 - 1/6000. Let's compute that:\n\n1/5500 = approx 0.000181818\n\n1/6000 = approx 0.000166667\n\nSo 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151\n\nWhich is 1.5151e-5.\n\nSo the exponent is (E1-E2)/(k) * (1.5151e-5 )\n\nBut wait, I don't know the value of (E1-E2). The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. So the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the relation E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nYes, because the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and \u03bb is wavelength.\n\nSo (E1 - E2) = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo let's compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. Speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. Wavelength \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) )\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.372e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut wait, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So to convert Joules to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.\n\nSo E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nSo (E1-E2) is approximately 8.56 eV.\n\nNow, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.\n\nSo (E1-E2)/(k) = 8.56 eV / (1.38e-23 J/K) * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J )\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, E1-E2 = 8.56 eV.\n\nConvert to J: 8.56 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.371e-18 J.\n\nThen, (E1-E2)/(k) = (1.371e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = (1.371 / 1.38) * 1e5 K \u2248 0.993 * 1e5 \u2248 9.93e4 K.\n\nWait, let me compute 1.371e-18 / 1.38e-23.\n\n1.371e-18 /1.38e-23 = (1.371 /1.38) * 1e5 \u2248 0.993 * 1e5 \u2248 99300 \u2248 9.93e4 K.\n\nSo (E1-E2)/(k) is approximately 9.93e4 K.\n\nNow, back to the exponent:\n\nExponent = (E1-E2)/(k) * (1/5500 -1/6000) )\n\nWhich is 9.93e4 K * (1.5151e-5 1/K )\n\nWait, 1/5500 is 1/(5.5e3) = approx 1.818e-4, but earlier I think I calculated the difference as 1.515e-5 1/K.\n\nWait, let's compute the exact difference: (1/5500) - (1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) ) = 1/(66,000) ) \u2248 1.51515e-5 1/K.\n\nSo the exponent is (9.93e4 K) * (1.51515e-5 1/K )\n\nMultiply those together:\n\n9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.93 * 1.515 ) * 1e-1.\n\nCompute 9.93 *1.515: 9 *1.5 is 13.5, 0.93*1.5 is about 1.395, so total around 14.895.\n\nWait, more accurately:\n\n9.93 *1.515:\n\n9 *1.515 = 13.635\n\n0.93 *1.515 = approximately 1.41045\n\nTotal: 13.635 +1.41045 \u2248 15.04545.\n\nSo 15.04545 * 1e-1 = 1.5045.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.5045.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.5045) \u2248 e^1.5045.\n\nI know that e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817. Let me compute e^1.5045.\n\n1.5045 is a bit more than 1.5, so e^1.5045 \u2248 4.5.\n\nWait, let me compute more accurately. Let's use a calculator approach.\n\nWe can approximate e^1.5045.\n\nWe know that ln(4.5) \u2248 1.50408. Let me check.\n\nWait, ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(4.5) is approximately 1.504077. Oh, wow, that's really close to our exponent of 1.5045.\n\nSo e^1.5045 \u2248 4.5003, which is about 4.5.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5.\n\nSo the ratio (n1/n2) at 6000 K divided by that at 5500 K is about 4.5. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is 4.5 times higher than when it has spots. So the factor is ~4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of LTE:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}\\right)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are their statistical weights, \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are their energies, \\(k\\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature. The ratio decreases when the star has spots, indicating that \\(E_1 > E_2\\), as the temperature decreases and the population in the higher energy level (\\(n_2\\)) becomes relatively smaller.\n\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{T=6000\\,\\text{K}}}{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{T=5500\\,\\text{K}}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann equation, the statistical weights \\(g_1/g_2\\) cancel out, leaving:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Factor} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000}\\right)\\right)\n\\]\n\nThe energy difference \\((E_1 - E_2)\\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \\(\\lambda = 1448\\,\\text{\u00c5}\\), which is calculated using \\(E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\), where \\(h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\text{J\u00b7s}\\) and \\(c = 3 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{m/s}\\). Converting \\(\\lambda = 1448\\,\\text{\u00c5}\\) to meters (\\(1448 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}\\)):\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34})(3 \\times 10^8)}{1448 \\times 10^{-10}} = 1.372 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\text{J}\n\\]\n\nConverting to electron volts (\\(1\\,\\text{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J}\\)):\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1.372 \\times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 8.56\\,\\text{eV}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\((E_1 - E_2)/k\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k} = \\frac{8.56\\,\\text{eV}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\text{J/K}} \\cdot \\frac{1\\,\\text{eV}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J}} \\approx 9.93 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{K}\n\\]\n\nThe term \\((1/5500 - 1/6000)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} \\approx 1.515 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the exponent:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Exponent} = (9.93 \\times 10^4)(1.515 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 1.5045\n\\]\n\nThus, the factor is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Factor} = \\exp(1.5045) \\approx 4.5\n\\]\n\nThis matches option C. Therefore, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe problem says that there's a star with certain characteristics. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the spots are making the star cooler on average.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels\u2014level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find out by what factor the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.\n\nWait, let me get the setup right. The ratio is N1/N2, where N1 is the number in level 1 and N2 in level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher. I need the factor by which it changes, so (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.\n\nIn LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nBut wait, the problem gives the ratio as N1/N2. So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, the ratio is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) multiplied by the ratio of the statistical weights (g1/g2).\n\nWait, but the transition wavelength is given as 1448 \u00c5. That must correspond to the energy difference between the two levels. So, the energy difference E2 - E1 can be found using the relation E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nHmm, let me calculate E2 - E1. The wavelength \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters. Let me compute the energy E.\n\nPlanck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) \n\nCalculating the numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nBut we often express energy in terms of eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, that seems high. Wait, wait, 1448 \u00c5 is in the near UV, which makes sense for such transitions. So, the energy difference is about 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, but wait, actually, maybe I should compute it in terms of kT. Because when I plug into the Boltzmann factor, the energy is divided by k*T, so perhaps it's better to compute (E2 - E1)/(k T) as a ratio.\n\nAlternatively, since k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo, let's compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for each temperature.\n\nBut wait, the star has two different effective temperatures: 6000 K and 5500 K. So, the ratio N1/N2 will depend on T.\n\nWait, but the problem says when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So, the spots are covering 40% of the surface, making the average T lower. But how does that affect the line formation?\n\nHmm, wait. The line formation occurs in the photosphere. So when there are spots, parts of the photosphere are cooler (the spots) and the rest are at the original 6000 K.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the overall effective temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K when 40% is covered. So, perhaps the model is that the star's surface is a combination of hotter and cooler regions. But wait, the problem says when the surface isn't covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the spots are cooler, so the average is lower.\n\nWait, but for the purpose of the question, the ratio of the Ti levels is observed in the photosphere. Are we assuming that the spots are at a lower temperature, so that the overall photosphere has an effective temperature of 5500 K? Or is the photosphere as a whole at 5500 K when spots are present?\n\nI think the problem is simplifying things by considering that the overall photosphere has an effective temperature of 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So, when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is 5500 K, and when not, 6000 K.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the spots are cooler regions, so the photosphere is a mix of regions with different temperatures. But the problem says the overall Teff is 5500 K, so maybe that's the average.\n\nBut the problem states that the stellar photosphere is in LTE, so each region (hot and cool) is in LTE, but the observed ratio is the overall average. Hmm, but the question says \"in the stellar photosphere when examining the ratio...\". So perhaps when the star has spots, the photosphere is at a lower temperature, so the ratio is calculated for T=5500 K.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the surface is not covered, the Teff is 6000 K, and when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, in each case, the photosphere's effective temperature is as given. So, when the star has spots, the photosphere is 5500 K, and when it doesn't, 6000 K.\n\nBut wait, no, that might not be correct. Because spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when 40% of the surface is covered, the average flux is lower, leading to an effective temperature of 5500 K. But the photosphere itself is a mix of 6000 K and a lower temperature (spot temperature). But the problem states that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering that the effective temperature is 5500 K, which is the overall average, and that the line formation is in LTE at that temperature. So the ratio N1/N2 would be calculated at 5500 K.\n\nBut wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. So, the ratio is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, if T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller (since T is in the denominator). So, exp of a smaller number is smaller. So, the ratio N1/N2 would decrease when T decreases.\n\nWait, but when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So, when T is 5500 K, N1/N2 is lower than when T is 6000 K.\n\nSo, the ratio without spots is at 6000 K, and with spots at 5500 K.\n\nThe question is: what's the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, factor = (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500.\n\nSince (N1/N2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), the ratio would be:\n\n[(g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) )] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ]\n\nThe (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/(6000) - 1/(5500)] )\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the ratio is (N1/N2)_6000 divided by (N1/N2)_5500. So, factor = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )\n\nWait, because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So, (E2-E1)/(k*6000) - (E2-E1)/(k*5500) = (E2-E1)/(k) [ (1/6000) - (1/5500) ) ]\n\nSo, compute [1/6000 - 1/5500] = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -500/(3.3e7) \u2248 -1.515e-5.\n\nSo, the exponent becomes (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5 )\n\nBut wait, E2-E1 is a positive number because E2 > E1 (since higher energy level). So, (E2-E1)/(k) is positive. Multiply by a negative exponent, so the entire exponent is negative.\n\nThus, the factor is exp( negative number ), which is less than 1. But wait, the factor is (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500. So, if N1/N2 is higher at 6000 K than at 5500 K, then the factor would be greater than 1.\n\nWait, let me think again. When T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases. So, exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases with T. Thus, N1/N2 increases with T.\n\nSo, when T is higher (6000 K), N1/N2 is higher. So, the ratio without spots (6000 K) is higher than when spots are present (5500 K). So, the factor is (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )\n\nWhich, as I computed earlier, is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5) )\n\nBut E2-E1 is positive, so this exponent is negative, so the factor is exp(-something). Let me compute the 'something' part.\n\nWait, let me compute (E2-E1)/(k) first. I calculated E2-E1 as about 8.57 eV.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Earlier, I computed E = hc/lambda, which is about 8.57 eV. But wait, that can't be right because 1448 \u00c5 is in the near UV, and transitions of that energy would be in the UV. But wait, for Ti neutral, such a high energy transition seems possible, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, hc is approximately 12400 eV\u00b7\u00c5. So, 12400 / 1448 \u2248 8.57 eV. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, E = 8.57 eV.\n\nBut wait, wait, wait. Because E = hc/lambda, which is the energy of a photon with wavelength lambda. So, if the transition is from level 2 to level 1, the energy of the photon emitted is E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV. So, E2 > E1.\n\nBut when we compute (E2-E1)/(k T), since E2-E1 is positive, and T is positive, so the term is positive.\n\nSo, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is positive, and when T increases, the exponent decreases (since it's divided by T), but wait, no: (E2-E1)/(k T) = (8.57 eV) / (k T), and k is in eV/K.\n\nWait, k is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So, let me compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for T=6000 K and T=5500 K.\n\nFirst, compute for T=6000 K:\n\n(E2-E1)/(k T) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) )\n\nCompute denominator: 8.617e-5 * 6000 = approx 0.517 eV.\n\nSo, 8.57 / 0.517 \u2248 16.58.\n\nSimilarly for T=5500 K:\n\nDenominator: 8.617e-5 *5500 = 0.4739 eV.\n\nSo, 8.57 / 0.4739 \u2248 18.1.\n\nWait, but that would mean that (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger for lower T. So, when T decreases, the exponent increases.\n\nWait, but when I plug into the ratio, it's (E2-E1)/(k T1) - (E2-E1)/(k T2) when T1 is higher and T2 lower.\n\nWait, going back to the factor:\n\nfactor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ] )\n\nWait, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nSo, (1/6000) - (1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -1.515e-5.\n\nSo, the exponent becomes (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (-1.515e-5 )\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nFirst, (8.57) / (8.617e-5 ) = approx 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 let's see, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 \u2248 8.57 * (1e5 / 8.617) \u2248 8.57 * 11605 \u2248 let me compute 8 * 11605 = 92840, 0.57 * 11605 \u2248 ~6615, so total approx 99455.\n\nSo, 8.57 / (8.617e-5 ) \u2248 ~99455 K.\n\nThen multiply by (-1.515e-5):\n\n99455 * (-1.515e-5) \u2248 99455 * (-0.00001515) \u2248 approximately -1.507.\n\nSo, the exponent is approximately -1.507.\n\nSo, factor = exp(-1.507) \u2248 e^(-1.507) \u2248 0.221.\n\nWait, but that would be the factor (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 = 0.221. But that's less than 1, which can't be right because N1/N2 should be higher at 6000 K than at 5500 K, so the ratio should be greater than 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )\n\nWait, but 1/6000 is less than 1/5500, so 1/6000 -1/5500 is negative. So, the exponent is negative, so the factor is exp(negative), which is less than 1. But that's a problem because when the star is hotter, N1/N2 should be higher, so the ratio (without spots) is higher than when it has spots. So, the factor should be greater than 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I have a sign error.\n\nWait, the ratio (N1/N2) is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent decreases, making the entire expression smaller. Wait, no, because when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller, so the exponent is smaller, so exp(small) is smaller. But that can't be right because if E is fixed, higher T would make the exponent (E/(k T)) smaller, so exp(E/(k T)) would be smaller, which would make N2/N1 smaller, so N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) would be larger. Wait, that makes sense.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative, so N2/N1 increases. Thus, N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) would decrease as T increases. Wait, no, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the ratio correctly. Let me define E = E2 - E1, which is positive.\n\nThen N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - E/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, E/(k T) decreases, so -E/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp( - E/(k T) ) increases. So, N2/N1 increases with T.\n\nThus, N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) would decrease with T.\n\nWait, that's opposite to what I thought earlier. So, if the temperature increases, N1/N2 decreases. But that's not what I observed earlier. Wait, no, let's think: if the temperature is higher, the higher energy state (level 2) is more populated. So, N2 increases relative to N1. So, N2/N1 increases, so N1/N2 decreases.\n\nSo, if the star's temperature is higher, N1/N2 is lower. So, when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is higher than when it doesn't have spots (higher T). Wait, no, this contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when T is higher (6000 K). But according to this, when T is higher, N1/N2 is lower. So, that would mean that when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K), N1/N2 is lower than when it has spots (T=5500 K), which would contradict the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.\"\n\nSo, when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when it doesn't. So, when T is lower (5500 K), N1/N2 is lower.\n\nBut according to the equation, when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher because N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( E/(k T) )\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, the Boltzmann equation is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWhich is the same as N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases. So, N1/N2 decreases when T increases. So, higher T gives lower N1/N2.\n\nSo, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), so N1/N2 is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the levels wrong. Maybe the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which would emit at 1448 \u00c5. So, level 2 is higher than level 1. So, E2 > E1.\n\nSo, when the star is hotter, more atoms are in higher energy levels, so N2 increases relative to N1. So, N1/N2 decreases.\n\nSo, when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe the transition is from level 2 to level 1, which would be emission. So, perhaps E1 is higher than E2. No, that's not possible because higher energy level is E2.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the ratio backwards. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 (N1/N2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, N1/N2 is lower than when they aren't. That would imply that when the star is cooler (spots present), N1/N2 is lower.\n\nBut according to the equation, N1/N2 is proportional to exp( E/(k T) ), where E=E2-E1.\n\nSo, when T decreases, E/(k T) increases, so exp(E/(k T)) increases, so N1/N2 increases. So, when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio N1/N2 is lower. So, this suggests that the ratio is decreasing when T decreases, which contradicts the equation.\n\nHmm, maybe I messed up the equation. Let me rederive.\n\nIn LTE, the ratio N2/N1 is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, N1/N2 = 1/( (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ) ) )\n\nWhich is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent decreases, so N1/N2 decreases.\n\nThus, when T is higher, N1/N2 is lower. So, when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K), N1/N2 is lower than when it has spots (T=5500 K). But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I have the ratio backwards. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says, \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)\"\u2014so N1/N2.\n\nAnd \"this ratio decreases when the star has spots.\" So, when the star has spots, N1/N2 is lower than when it doesn't. So, when T is lower (spots present), N1/N2 is lower.\n\nBut according to the equation, N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So, when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is higher, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is higher, so N1/N2 is higher.\n\nThis is a contradiction. So, perhaps I have the energy difference wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition corresponds to a photon emitted when moving from level 2 to level 1. So, E2 - E1 is the energy of the emitted photon, which is 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, but according to the equation, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases, so N1/N2 decreases.\n\nBut in the problem, when T is lower (spots present), N1/N2 is lower. So, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about what the transition wavelength implies. The transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon of wavelength 1448 \u00c5. So, E2 > E1.\n\nSo, in the equation, (E2-E1) is positive.\n\nSo, if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases. So, N1/N2 decreases.\n\nThus, when T is higher (no spots), N1/N2 is lower. When T is lower (spots), N1/N2 is higher. But the problem says that when spots are present, N1/N2 is lower. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the equation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is N2/N1, and the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, if N2/N1 is higher when T is higher, then when T is lower, N2/N1 is lower. So, the problem says the ratio (N2/N1) decreases when the star has spots.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)\"\u2014so N1/N2.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has the ratio as N2/N1, which would align with the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says the ratio decreases, but it's N2/N1. Because in that case, when T is higher, N2/N1 is higher, and when T is lower, N2/N1 is lower. So, when the star has spots, N2/N1 is lower. But the problem says the ratio (N1/N2) decreases when the star has spots. So, that's not matching.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try to re-express the problem.\n\nWe have:\n\n- When no spots: Teff = 6000 K.\n\n- When 40% spots: Teff =5500 K.\n\n- Ratio N1/N2 is observed to decrease when the star has spots.\n\nSo, when T is 6000 K, N1/N2 is higher than when T is 5500 K.\n\nBut according to the equation, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nAt higher T (6000 K), (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so exp(...) is smaller. So, N1/N2 is smaller at higher T.\n\nBut according to the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is lower. So, that's the opposite of what the equation suggests.\n\nThis suggests that either I'm applying the equation wrong, or perhaps the problem is considering the inverse ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is N2/N1, which would mean that when T increases, N2/N1 increases, so when the star has spots (lower T), N2/N1 is lower. So, the ratio N2/N1 decreases when the star has spots. But the problem says the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is correct, but I have a sign error in the equation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which would require absorbing a photon of 1448 \u00c5. So, E2 = E1 + 8.57 eV. So, in that case, the ratio N1/N2 would be (g1/g2) exp( E2-E1/(k T) )\n\nBut that's the same as before.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the excitation temperature, but I don't think so. The question says LTE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the change in the star's continuum emission affecting the line ratio. No, the problem says it's in the photosphere, so it's line formation in LTE.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck on the fact that according to the equation, N1/N2 should decrease when T increases, but the problem states that N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots (lower T), which would mean that when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower, which would imply that N1/N2 increases with T. But according to the equation, N1/N2 is proportional to exp( E/(k T) ), which would decrease as T increases.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the energy. Let me recompute E.\n\nE = hc / lambda.\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nlambda = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m.\n\nSo,\n\nE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So,\n\nE = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nSo, E = 8.57 eV.\n\nk = 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo, for T=6000 K,\n\nE/(k T) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 6000) \u2248 8.57 / (0.517) \u2248 16.58.\n\nFor T=5500 K,\n\nE/(k T) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 *5500) \u2248 8.57 / 0.4739 \u2248 18.1.\n\nSo, for each T, the exponent is 16.58 and 18.1 respectively.\n\nSo, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(E/(k T))\n\nAt 6000 K: exp(16.58) \u2248 exp(16) is about 8.89e7, but 16.58 is higher.\n\nWait, exp(16.58) is a huge number, like 1e7? Wait, no, exp(10) is about 22026, exp(15) is about 3.269e6, exp(16) is about 8.886e6, exp(17) is about 2.415e7, exp(18) is about 6.566e7.\n\nWait, so for 16.58, it's between exp(16) and exp(17), perhaps around 1.3e7.\n\nSimilarly, for 18.1, it's around 6.5e7.\n\nWait, but the exact numbers might not matter because we'll be taking the ratio.\n\nThe ratio (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 = exp( (E/(k*6000)) - (E/(k*5500)) )\n\n= exp( E/(k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )\n\nAs before, the exponent is negative, so the ratio is exp(-1.507) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo, the factor is approximately 0.221, meaning that when the star doesn't have spots (6000 K), the ratio is about 0.221 times the ratio when it has spots (5500 K). But this contradicts the problem statement, which says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower, implying that (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 > 1.\n\nBut according to this calculation, it's less than 1, which is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has the ratio inverted. Maybe it's N2/N1 that decreases when the star has spots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have the energy difference the wrong way. Suppose the transition is from level 1 to level 2, requiring a photon of 1448 \u00c5, so E2 = E1 + 8.57 eV. So, the equation N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nBut that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the ionization state. Wait, no, the problem says \"neutral atoms of Ti.\"\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 in the exponent somewhere. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when computing the exponent.\n\nWait, let's try to compute the ratio again.\n\nThe factor is:\n\nexp( (E/(k) ) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )\n\n= exp( (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) ) )\n\nCompute (8.57) / (8.617e-5) \u2248 99455 K.\n\nMultiply by (1/6000 -1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -1.515e-5.\n\nSo, 99455 * (-1.515e-5) = approximately -1.507.\n\nSo, exp(-1.507) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo, the factor is 0.221, meaning that when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is 0.221 times when it does have spots. So, the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which matches the problem statement.\n\nWait, no. Because (N1/N2)_6000 = 0.221 * (N1/N2)_5500.\n\nSo, (N1/N2)_6000 is lower than (N1/N2)_5500. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, (N1/N2)_5500 is lower than (N1/N2)_6000.\n\nWait, no, according to the calculation, (N1/N2)_6000 is 0.221 times (N1/N2)_5500. So, (N1/N2)_6000 = 0.221 * (N1/N2)_5500.\n\nSo, (N1/N2)_6000 is less than (N1/N2)_5500. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is higher. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Maybe the factor is (N1/N2)_5500 / (N1/N2)_6000 = 1/0.221 \u2248 4.524.\n\nSo, when the star has spots, the ratio is about 4.524 times higher than when it doesn't. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's compute the ratio of the ratios.\n\nThe factor is (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 = exp( (E/(k) ) [ (1/6000) - (1/5500) ] )\n\nAs calculated, this is exp(-1.507) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo, the ratio without spots is 0.221 times the ratio with spots. So, the ratio when the star doesn't have spots is lower than when it does. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning that when the star has spots, the ratio is lower.\n\nBut according to the calculation, the ratio is lower when the star doesn't have spots. So, this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal. Maybe the factor is (N1/N2)_5500 / (N1/N2)_6000 = 1/0.221 \u2248 4.524.\n\nSo, when the star has spots, the ratio is about 4.5 times higher than when it doesn't. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so this is not the case.\n\nI must be making a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about the ratio N1/N2, but about the reciprocal, N2/N1. Let me check.\n\nIf the ratio N2/N1 decreases when the star has spots, then when T is lower (spots present), N2/N1 is lower. Which would mean that when T is higher, N2/N1 is higher, which aligns with the equation.\n\nBut the problem says the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots, which would imply that when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. But according to the equation, N1/N2 increases when T decreases.\n\nSo, I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation as per the equation, despite the contradiction, and see which option matches.\n\nThe factor is approximately 0.221, which is about 1/4.524. So, the reciprocal is about 4.5, which is option C.\n\nBut the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would mean that (N1/N2)_5500 < (N1/N2)_6000. So, (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 = 0.221, which is less than 1, meaning (N1/N2)_6000 is smaller than (N1/N2)_5500. So, the ratio is lower when the star doesn't have spots, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the wavelength is in the opposite direction. Let me think about whether the transition is from a higher to lower level or vice versa.\n\nWait, the energy of the photon is E = hc/lambda. If the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 > E1, and the photon emitted has energy E2-E1 = hc/lambda.\n\nSo, the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the line strength, which depends on the number of atoms in the upper level. If more atoms are in the upper level (N2 increases), the line strength increases. But in this problem, the line ratio is N1/N2, which would decrease if N2 increases.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So, when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower.\n\nBut according to the equation, N1/N2 is proportional to exp( E/(k T) ), so when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher.\n\nThis is a contradiction. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the line is formed in a region where the temperature is lower than the effective temperature. But the problem says the photosphere is in LTE, so that shouldn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spots are not at a uniform temperature. But the problem says the overall Teff is 5500 K.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's proceed with the calculation and see which option matches.\n\nThe factor is exp(-1.507) \u2248 0.221. So, the ratio without spots is 0.221 times the ratio with spots. So, the factor by which it changes is approximately 0.221. But the options don't include that. The closest is option A: ~1.1, which is reciprocal.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the ratio as (N1/N2)_5500 / (N1/N2)_6000 = 1/0.221 \u2248 4.524, which is option C.\n\nSo, the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.\n\nBut the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So, the factor (without spots)/(with spots) would be greater than 1.\n\nBut according to the calculation, it's approximately 0.221, which is less than 1. So, perhaps the correct answer is the reciprocal.\n\nSo, the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe problem says that there's a star with certain characteristics. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the spots are making the star cooler on average.\n\nThe question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels\u2014level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find out by what factor the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.\n\nWait, let me get the setup right. The ratio is N1/N2, where N1 is the number in level 1 and N2 in level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher. I need the factor by which it changes, so (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.\n\nIn LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nBut wait, the problem gives the ratio as N1/N2. So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, the ratio is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) multiplied by the ratio of the statistical weights (g1/g2).\n\nWait, but the transition wavelength is given as 1448 \u00c5. That must correspond to the energy difference between the two levels. So, the energy difference E2 - E1 can be found using the relation E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nHmm, let me calculate E2 - E1. The wavelength \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters. Let me compute the energy E.\n\nPlanck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) \n\nCalculating the numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nBut we often express energy in terms of eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, that seems high. Wait, wait, 1448 \u00c5 is in the near UV, which makes sense for such transitions. So, the energy difference is about 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, but wait, actually, maybe I should compute it in terms of kT. Because when I plug into the Boltzmann factor, the energy is divided by k*T, so perhaps it's better to compute (E2 - E1)/(k T) as a ratio.\n\nAlternatively, since k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo, let's compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for each temperature.\n\nBut wait, the star has two different effective temperatures: 6000 K and 5500 K. So, the ratio N1/N2 will depend on T.\n\nWait, but the problem says when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So, the spots are covering 40% of the surface, making the average T lower. But how does that affect the line formation?\n\nHmm, wait. The line formation occurs in the photosphere. So when there are spots, parts of the photosphere are cooler (the spots) and the rest are at the original 6000 K.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the overall effective temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K when 40% is covered. So, perhaps the model is that the star's surface is a combination of hotter and cooler regions. But wait, the problem says when the surface isn't covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the spots are cooler, so the average is lower.\n\nWait, but for the purpose of the question, the ratio of the Ti levels is observed in the photosphere. Are we assuming that the spots are at a lower temperature, so that the overall photosphere has an effective temperature of 5500 K? Or is the photosphere as a whole at 5500 K when spots are present?\n\nI think the problem is simplifying things by considering that the overall photosphere has an effective temperature of 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So, when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is 5500 K, and when not, 6000 K.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the spots are cooler regions, so the photosphere is a mix of regions with different temperatures. But the problem says the overall Teff is 5500 K, so maybe that's the average.\n\nBut the problem states that the stellar photosphere is in LTE, so each region (hot and cool) is in LTE, but the observed ratio is the overall average. Hmm, but the question says \"in the stellar photosphere when examining the ratio...\". So perhaps when the star has spots, the photosphere is at a lower temperature, so the ratio is calculated for T=5500 K.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when the surface is not covered, the Teff is 6000 K, and when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, in each case, the photosphere's effective temperature is as given. So, when the star has spots, the photosphere is 5500 K, and when it doesn't, 6000 K.\n\nBut wait, no, that might not be correct. Because spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when 40% of the surface is covered, the average flux is lower, leading to an effective temperature of 5500 K. But the photosphere itself is a mix of 6000 K and a lower temperature (spot temperature). But the problem states that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering that the effective temperature is 5500 K, which is the overall average, and that the line formation is in LTE at that temperature. So the ratio N1/N2 would be calculated at 5500 K.\n\nBut wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. So, the ratio is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, if T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller (since T is in the denominator). So, exp of a smaller number is smaller. So, the ratio N1/N2 would decrease when T decreases.\n\nWait, but when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So, when T is 5500 K, N1/N2 is lower than when T is 6000 K.\n\nSo, the ratio without spots is at 6000 K, and with spots at 5500 K.\n\nThe question is: what's the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, factor = (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500.\n\nSince (N1/N2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), the ratio would be:\n\n[(g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) )] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ]\n\nThe (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/(6000) - 1/(5500)] )\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the ratio is (N1/N2)_6000 divided by (N1/N2)_5500. So, factor = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )\n\nWait, because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So, (E2-E1)/(k*6000) - (E2-E1)/(k*5500) = (E2-E1)/(k) [ (1/6000) - (1/5500) ) ]\n\nSo, compute [1/6000 - 1/5500] = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -500/(3.3e7) \u2248 -1.515e-5.\n\nSo, the exponent becomes (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5 )\n\nBut wait, E2-E1 is a positive number because E2 > E1 (since higher energy level). So, (E2-E1)/(k) is positive. Multiply by a negative exponent, so the entire exponent is negative.\n\nThus, the factor is exp( negative number ), which is less than 1. But wait, the factor is (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500. So, if N1/N2 is higher at 6000 K than at 5500 K, then the factor would be greater than 1.\n\nWait, let me think again. When T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases. So, exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases with T. Thus, N1/N2 increases with T.\n\nSo, when T is higher (6000 K), N1/N2 is higher. So, the ratio without spots (6000 K) is higher than when spots are present (5500 K). So, the factor is (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )\n\nWhich, as I computed earlier, is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5) )\n\nBut E2-E1 is positive, so this exponent is negative, so the factor is exp(-something). Let me compute the 'something' part.\n\nWait, let me compute (E2-E1)/(k) first. I calculated E2-E1 as about 8.57 eV.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Earlier, I computed E = hc/lambda, which is about 8.57 eV. But wait, that can't be right because 1448 \u00c5 is in the near UV, and transitions of that energy would be in the UV. But wait, for Ti neutral, such a high energy transition seems possible, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, hc is approximately 12400 eV\u00b7\u00c5. So, 12400 / 1448 \u2248 8.57 eV. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, E = 8.57 eV.\n\nBut wait, wait, wait. Because E = hc/lambda, which is the energy of a photon with wavelength lambda. So, if the transition is from level 2 to level 1, the energy of the photon emitted is E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV. So, E2 > E1.\n\nBut when we compute (E2-E1)/(k T), since E2-E1 is positive, and T is positive, so the term is positive.\n\nSo, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is positive, and when T increases, the exponent decreases (since it's divided by T), but wait, no: (E2-E1)/(k T) = (8.57 eV) / (k T), and k is in eV/K.\n\nWait, k is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So, let me compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for T=6000 K and T=5500 K.\n\nFirst, compute for T=6000 K:\n\n(E2-E1)/(k T) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) )\n\nCompute denominator: 8.617e-5 * 6000 = approx 0.517 eV.\n\nSo, 8.57 / 0.517 \u2248 16.58.\n\nSimilarly for T=5500 K:\n\nDenominator: 8.617e-5 *5500 = 0.4739 eV.\n\nSo, 8.57 / 0.4739 \u2248 18.1.\n\nWait, but that would mean that (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger for lower T. So, when T decreases, the exponent increases.\n\nWait, but when I plug into the ratio, it's (E2-E1)/(k T1) - (E2-E1)/(k T2) when T1 is higher and T2 lower.\n\nWait, going back to the factor:\n\nfactor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ] )\n\nWait, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.\n\nSo, (1/6000) - (1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -1.515e-5.\n\nSo, the exponent becomes (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (-1.515e-5 )\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nFirst, (8.57) / (8.617e-5 ) = approx 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 let's see, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 \u2248 8.57 * (1e5 / 8.617) \u2248 8.57 * 11605 \u2248 let me compute 8 * 11605 = 92840, 0.57 * 11605 \u2248 ~6615, so total approx 99455.\n\nSo, 8.57 / (8.617e-5 ) \u2248 ~99455 K.\n\nThen multiply by (-1.515e-5):\n\n99455 * (-1.515e-5) \u2248 99455 * (-0.00001515) \u2248 approximately -1.507.\n\nSo, the exponent is approximately -1.507.\n\nSo, factor = exp(-1.507) \u2248 e^(-1.507) \u2248 0.221.\n\nWait, but that would be the factor (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 = 0.221. But that's less than 1, which can't be right because N1/N2 should be higher at 6000 K than at 5500 K, so the ratio should be greater than 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )\n\nWait, but 1/6000 is less than 1/5500, so 1/6000 -1/5500 is negative. So, the exponent is negative, so the factor is exp(negative), which is less than 1. But that's a problem because when the star is hotter, N1/N2 should be higher, so the ratio (without spots) is higher than when it has spots. So, the factor should be greater than 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I have a sign error.\n\nWait, the ratio (N1/N2) is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent decreases, making the entire expression smaller. Wait, no, because when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller, so the exponent is smaller, so exp(small) is smaller. But that can't be right because if E is fixed, higher T would make the exponent (E/(k T)) smaller, so exp(E/(k T)) would be smaller, which would make N2/N1 smaller, so N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) would be larger. Wait, that makes sense.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nN2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative, so N2/N1 increases. Thus, N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) would decrease as T increases. Wait, no, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the ratio correctly. Let me define E = E2 - E1, which is positive.\n\nThen N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - E/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, E/(k T) decreases, so -E/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp( - E/(k T) ) increases. So, N2/N1 increases with T.\n\nThus, N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) would decrease with T.\n\nWait, that's opposite to what I thought earlier. So, if the temperature increases, N1/N2 decreases. But that's not what I observed earlier. Wait, no, let's think: if the temperature is higher, the higher energy state (level 2) is more populated. So, N2 increases relative to N1. So, N2/N1 increases, so N1/N2 decreases.\n\nSo, if the star's temperature is higher, N1/N2 is lower. So, when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is higher than when it doesn't have spots (higher T). Wait, no, this contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when T is higher (6000 K). But according to this, when T is higher, N1/N2 is lower. So, that would mean that when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K), N1/N2 is lower than when it has spots (T=5500 K), which would contradict the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots.\"\n\nSo, when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when it doesn't. So, when T is lower (5500 K), N1/N2 is lower.\n\nBut according to the equation, when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher because N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( E/(k T) )\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, the Boltzmann equation is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nWhich is the same as N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases. So, N1/N2 decreases when T increases. So, higher T gives lower N1/N2.\n\nSo, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), so N1/N2 is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the levels wrong. Maybe the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which would emit at 1448 \u00c5. So, level 2 is higher than level 1. So, E2 > E1.\n\nSo, when the star is hotter, more atoms are in higher energy levels, so N2 increases relative to N1. So, N1/N2 decreases.\n\nSo, when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe the transition is from level 2 to level 1, which would be emission. So, perhaps E1 is higher than E2. No, that's not possible because higher energy level is E2.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the ratio backwards. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 (N1/N2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, N1/N2 is lower than when they aren't. That would imply that when the star is cooler (spots present), N1/N2 is lower.\n\nBut according to the equation, N1/N2 is proportional to exp( E/(k T) ), where E=E2-E1.\n\nSo, when T decreases, E/(k T) increases, so exp(E/(k T)) increases, so N1/N2 increases. So, when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio N1/N2 is lower. So, this suggests that the ratio is decreasing when T decreases, which contradicts the equation.\n\nHmm, maybe I messed up the equation. Let me rederive.\n\nIn LTE, the ratio N2/N1 is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, N1/N2 = 1/( (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ) ) )\n\nWhich is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent decreases, so N1/N2 decreases.\n\nThus, when T is higher, N1/N2 is lower. So, when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K), N1/N2 is lower than when it has spots (T=5500 K). But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I have the ratio backwards. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says, \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)\"\u2014so N1/N2.\n\nAnd \"this ratio decreases when the star has spots.\" So, when the star has spots, N1/N2 is lower than when it doesn't. So, when T is lower (spots present), N1/N2 is lower.\n\nBut according to the equation, N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So, when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is higher, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is higher, so N1/N2 is higher.\n\nThis is a contradiction. So, perhaps I have the energy difference wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition corresponds to a photon emitted when moving from level 2 to level 1. So, E2 - E1 is the energy of the emitted photon, which is 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, but according to the equation, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nSo, when T increases, exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases, so N1/N2 decreases.\n\nBut in the problem, when T is lower (spots present), N1/N2 is lower. So, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about what the transition wavelength implies. The transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon of wavelength 1448 \u00c5. So, E2 > E1.\n\nSo, in the equation, (E2-E1) is positive.\n\nSo, if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases. So, N1/N2 decreases.\n\nThus, when T is higher (no spots), N1/N2 is lower. When T is lower (spots), N1/N2 is higher. But the problem says that when spots are present, N1/N2 is lower. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the equation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is N2/N1, and the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, if N2/N1 is higher when T is higher, then when T is lower, N2/N1 is lower. So, the problem says the ratio (N2/N1) decreases when the star has spots.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)\"\u2014so N1/N2.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has the ratio as N2/N1, which would align with the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says the ratio decreases, but it's N2/N1. Because in that case, when T is higher, N2/N1 is higher, and when T is lower, N2/N1 is lower. So, when the star has spots, N2/N1 is lower. But the problem says the ratio (N1/N2) decreases when the star has spots. So, that's not matching.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try to re-express the problem.\n\nWe have:\n\n- When no spots: Teff = 6000 K.\n\n- When 40% spots: Teff =5500 K.\n\n- Ratio N1/N2 is observed to decrease when the star has spots.\n\nSo, when T is 6000 K, N1/N2 is higher than when T is 5500 K.\n\nBut according to the equation, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nAt higher T (6000 K), (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so exp(...) is smaller. So, N1/N2 is smaller at higher T.\n\nBut according to the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is lower. So, that's the opposite of what the equation suggests.\n\nThis suggests that either I'm applying the equation wrong, or perhaps the problem is considering the inverse ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is N2/N1, which would mean that when T increases, N2/N1 increases, so when the star has spots (lower T), N2/N1 is lower. So, the ratio N2/N1 decreases when the star has spots. But the problem says the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is correct, but I have a sign error in the equation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which would require absorbing a photon of 1448 \u00c5. So, E2 = E1 + 8.57 eV. So, in that case, the ratio N1/N2 would be (g1/g2) exp( E2-E1/(k T) )\n\nBut that's the same as before.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the excitation temperature, but I don't think so. The question says LTE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the change in the star's continuum emission affecting the line ratio. No, the problem says it's in the photosphere, so it's line formation in LTE.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck on the fact that according to the equation, N1/N2 should decrease when T increases, but the problem states that N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots (lower T), which would mean that when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower, which would imply that N1/N2 increases with T. But according to the equation, N1/N2 is proportional to exp( E/(k T) ), which would decrease as T increases.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the energy. Let me recompute E.\n\nE = hc / lambda.\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nlambda = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m.\n\nSo,\n\nE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So,\n\nE = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 8.57 eV.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nSo, E = 8.57 eV.\n\nk = 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo, for T=6000 K,\n\nE/(k T) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 6000) \u2248 8.57 / (0.517) \u2248 16.58.\n\nFor T=5500 K,\n\nE/(k T) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 *5500) \u2248 8.57 / 0.4739 \u2248 18.1.\n\nSo, for each T, the exponent is 16.58 and 18.1 respectively.\n\nSo, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(E/(k T))\n\nAt 6000 K: exp(16.58) \u2248 exp(16) is about 8.89e7, but 16.58 is higher.\n\nWait, exp(16.58) is a huge number, like 1e7? Wait, no, exp(10) is about 22026, exp(15) is about 3.269e6, exp(16) is about 8.886e6, exp(17) is about 2.415e7, exp(18) is about 6.566e7.\n\nWait, so for 16.58, it's between exp(16) and exp(17), perhaps around 1.3e7.\n\nSimilarly, for 18.1, it's around 6.5e7.\n\nWait, but the exact numbers might not matter because we'll be taking the ratio.\n\nThe ratio (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 = exp( (E/(k*6000)) - (E/(k*5500)) )\n\n= exp( E/(k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )\n\nAs before, the exponent is negative, so the ratio is exp(-1.507) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo, the factor is approximately 0.221, meaning that when the star doesn't have spots (6000 K), the ratio is about 0.221 times the ratio when it has spots (5500 K). But this contradicts the problem statement, which says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower, implying that (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 > 1.\n\nBut according to this calculation, it's less than 1, which is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has the ratio inverted. Maybe it's N2/N1 that decreases when the star has spots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have the energy difference the wrong way. Suppose the transition is from level 1 to level 2, requiring a photon of 1448 \u00c5, so E2 = E1 + 8.57 eV. So, the equation N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )\n\nBut that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the ionization state. Wait, no, the problem says \"neutral atoms of Ti.\"\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 in the exponent somewhere. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when computing the exponent.\n\nWait, let's try to compute the ratio again.\n\nThe factor is:\n\nexp( (E/(k) ) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )\n\n= exp( (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) ) )\n\nCompute (8.57) / (8.617e-5) \u2248 99455 K.\n\nMultiply by (1/6000 -1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -1.515e-5.\n\nSo, 99455 * (-1.515e-5) = approximately -1.507.\n\nSo, exp(-1.507) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo, the factor is 0.221, meaning that when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is 0.221 times when it does have spots. So, the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which matches the problem statement.\n\nWait, no. Because (N1/N2)_6000 = 0.221 * (N1/N2)_5500.\n\nSo, (N1/N2)_6000 is lower than (N1/N2)_5500. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, (N1/N2)_5500 is lower than (N1/N2)_6000.\n\nWait, no, according to the calculation, (N1/N2)_6000 is 0.221 times (N1/N2)_5500. So, (N1/N2)_6000 = 0.221 * (N1/N2)_5500.\n\nSo, (N1/N2)_6000 is less than (N1/N2)_5500. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is higher. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Maybe the factor is (N1/N2)_5500 / (N1/N2)_6000 = 1/0.221 \u2248 4.524.\n\nSo, when the star has spots, the ratio is about 4.524 times higher than when it doesn't. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, this doesn't fit.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's compute the ratio of the ratios.\n\nThe factor is (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 = exp( (E/(k) ) [ (1/6000) - (1/5500) ] )\n\nAs calculated, this is exp(-1.507) \u2248 0.221.\n\nSo, the ratio without spots is 0.221 times the ratio with spots. So, the ratio when the star doesn't have spots is lower than when it does. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning that when the star has spots, the ratio is lower.\n\nBut according to the calculation, the ratio is lower when the star doesn't have spots. So, this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal. Maybe the factor is (N1/N2)_5500 / (N1/N2)_6000 = 1/0.221 \u2248 4.524.\n\nSo, when the star has spots, the ratio is about 4.5 times higher than when it doesn't. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so this is not the case.\n\nI must be making a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about the ratio N1/N2, but about the reciprocal, N2/N1. Let me check.\n\nIf the ratio N2/N1 decreases when the star has spots, then when T is lower (spots present), N2/N1 is lower. Which would mean that when T is higher, N2/N1 is higher, which aligns with the equation.\n\nBut the problem says the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots, which would imply that when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. But according to the equation, N1/N2 increases when T decreases.\n\nSo, I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation as per the equation, despite the contradiction, and see which option matches.\n\nThe factor is approximately 0.221, which is about 1/4.524. So, the reciprocal is about 4.5, which is option C.\n\nBut the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would mean that (N1/N2)_5500 < (N1/N2)_6000. So, (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 = 0.221, which is less than 1, meaning (N1/N2)_6000 is smaller than (N1/N2)_5500. So, the ratio is lower when the star doesn't have spots, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the wavelength is in the opposite direction. Let me think about whether the transition is from a higher to lower level or vice versa.\n\nWait, the energy of the photon is E = hc/lambda. If the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 > E1, and the photon emitted has energy E2-E1 = hc/lambda.\n\nSo, the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the line strength, which depends on the number of atoms in the upper level. If more atoms are in the upper level (N2 increases), the line strength increases. But in this problem, the line ratio is N1/N2, which would decrease if N2 increases.\n\nBut the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So, when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower.\n\nBut according to the equation, N1/N2 is proportional to exp( E/(k T) ), so when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher.\n\nThis is a contradiction. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the line is formed in a region where the temperature is lower than the effective temperature. But the problem says the photosphere is in LTE, so that shouldn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spots are not at a uniform temperature. But the problem says the overall Teff is 5500 K.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's proceed with the calculation and see which option matches.\n\nThe factor is exp(-1.507) \u2248 0.221. So, the ratio without spots is 0.221 times the ratio with spots. So, the factor by which it changes is approximately 0.221. But the options don't include that. The closest is option A: ~1.1, which is reciprocal.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the ratio as (N1/N2)_5500 / (N1/N2)_6000 = 1/0.221 \u2248 4.524, which is option C.\n\nSo, the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.\n\nBut the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So, the factor (without spots)/(with spots) would be greater than 1.\n\nBut according to the calculation, it's approximately 0.221, which is less than 1. So, perhaps the correct answer is the reciprocal.\n\nSo, the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, \\( N_1/N_2 \\), changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \\( T = 6000 \\, \\text{K} \\)) to having spots (effective temperature \\( T = 5500 \\, \\text{K} \\)).

Let's see what the question is about.\n\nSo, the problem is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Specifically, when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find by what factor this ratio changes\u2014comparing the no-spot case to the spot case.\n\nHmm. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The Boltzmann factor tells us how populations of energy levels change with temperature.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels (n1 and n2) is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is the energy, and k is Boltzmann's constant.\n\nIn this problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So, when spots cover part of the surface, the observed effective temperature of the star decreases because the spots are darker (cooler) regions. However, the question says that when the spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, I think the star's overall photosphere is at a lower temperature when spots are present.\n\nWait, but in the problem, when the spots are present, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So the entire star is now at a lower Teff. So the photosphere as a whole is now cooler.\n\nThe ratio of Ti atoms in two levels is given, and when there are spots, this ratio decreases. So, when the temperature is lower, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Let me think about what that means.\n\nIn the Boltzmann equation, the ratio (n1/n2) depends on the exponential term. Let's say level 1 is lower in energy than level 2. So E2 > E1. Then, the ratio is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). If the temperature T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term gets smaller. Thus, n1/n2 decreases when T decreases. Which aligns with the problem statement: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.\n\nSo, the ratio when no spots (T1=6000 K) compared to when spots are present (T2=5500 K) is (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2.\n\nWait, but wait: Let me clarify. The problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (T2), the ratio is lower. So (n1/n2)_T2 < (n1/n2)_T1.\n\nSo the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2.\n\nSo let me write the ratio of the two ratios. Let me denote:\n\nRatio1 = (n1/n2) at T1=6000 K.\n\nRatio2 = (n1/n2) at T2=5500 K.\n\nFactor = Ratio1 / Ratio2.\n\nSo, Factor = [ (g1/g2) exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ) ]\n\nSince (g1/g2) cancels out, Factor = exp( [\u0394E/(k)] (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )\n\nWait, wait, because:\n\nExp(-\u0394E/(k T1)) divided by Exp(-\u0394E/(k T2)) equals Exp[ (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ].\n\nBecause:\n\nExp(a) / Exp(b) = Exp(a - b) = Exp( (a) ) * Exp( -b )\n\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\nExp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) / Exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) = Exp[ (-\u0394E/(k T1)) - (-\u0394E/(k T2)) ) ]\n\n= Exp[ \u0394E/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]\n\nSo, Factor = Exp( (\u0394E/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nWait, let's compute the exponent: (\u0394E/(k)) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]\n\nWait, no, because when I have (-a)/(-b) it's +a/b. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, the exponent is [ (-\u0394E/(k T1)) - (-\u0394E/(k T2)) ) ] = (-\u0394E/(k T1)) + \u0394E/(k T2) ) = \u0394E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )\n\nSo, Factor = exp( [\u0394E/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBut wait, let's compute 1/T2 - 1/T1. Since T2 < T1, 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1, so 1/T2 -1/T1 is positive. So the exponent is positive, which would make the factor larger than 1. So the ratio Ratio1/Ratio2 is greater than 1, which makes sense because when T decreases, Ratio2 is smaller than Ratio1.\n\nSo, Factor = exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )\n\nBut wait, the problem gives the wavelength of the transition between the two energy levels as approximately 1448 \u00c5. So, the energy difference \u0394E can be found using the relation E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, let's compute \u0394E = hc / \u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nc is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters, because 1 \u00c5 is 1e-10 m.\n\nSo, let's compute hc/\u03bb.\n\nh*c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDivide by \u03bb: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approx 1.373e-18 J.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\nWait, 1448e-10 m is 1.448e-7 m. Wait no, wait 1448 \u00c5 is 1448 x 1e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo,\n\nh*c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\n\u0394E = h c / \u03bb = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m / 1.448e-7 m = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nNow, k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.\n\nSo, \u0394E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) \u2248 9.95e4 K.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately:\n\n1.373e-18 / 1.380649e-23 = (1.373 / 1.380649) * 1e5 \u2248 approximately 0.994 * 1e5 \u2248 99400 K.\n\nSo approximately 9.94e4 K.\n\nSo, now compute (\u0394E/(k)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000).\n\nCompute 1/5500 = approx 1.818e-4 per K.\n\n1/6000 = approx 1.6667e-4 per K.\n\nSo, 1/5500 -1/6000 = (1.818e-4 -1.6667e-4) = 0.1513e-4 per K.\n\nWhich is 1.513e-5 per K.\n\nMultiply by \u0394E/(k) \u2248 9.94e4 K:\n\n9.94e4 * 1.513e-5 = (9.94 * 1.513) * 1e-1.\n\nCompute 9.94 * 1.513:\n\nApprox 9.94 * 1.5 is 14.91, and 9.94 * 0.013 is about 0.129. So total approx 15.04.\n\nMultiply by 1e-1: 1.504.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.504.\n\nSo, Factor = exp(1.504) \u2248 e^1.504.\n\nWhat's e^1.504?\n\ne^1 is 2.71828.\n\ne^1.5 is about 4.4817.\n\nWait, but 1.504 is very close to 1.5, so e^1.504 \u2248 4.5.\n\nWait, let me compute more accurately.\n\nLet me recall that ln(4.5) is approximately 1.504.\n\nWait, because ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(4.5) is around 1.504. So e^1.504 is approximately 4.5.\n\nSo, the factor is about 4.5.\n\nLooking back at the options: option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when computing (1/5500 - 1/6000), I should compute accurately:\n\n1/5500 = 0.000181818...\n\n1/6000 = 0.000166666...\n\nSubtracting: 0.000181818 - 0.000166666 = 0.000015152.\n\nWhich is 1.5152e-5.\n\nMultiply by \u0394E/(k) = 99400 K:\n\n99400 * 1.5152e-5 = (99400 * 1.5152 ) * 1e-5.\n\nCompute 99400 * 1.5152:\n\nWell, 100,000 *1.5152 =151,520. But 99400 is 600 less than 100,000.\n\nSo 151520 - (600 *1.5152) = 151520 - 909.12 = 150,610.88.\n\nSo 150610.88 * 1e-5 = 15.061088.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 99400 is 9.94e4. 9.94e4 * 1.5152e-5 = (9.94 *1.5152) * 1e-1.\n\n9.94 *1.5152 is approximately:\n\n10 *1.5152=15.152, minus 0.06 *1.5152=0.0909. So 15.152 - 0.0909=15.0611.\n\nMultiply by 1e-1: 1.50611.\n\nSo exponent is 1.50611.\n\ne^1.50611 \u2248 e^1.504 is about 4.5.\n\nWait, but wait, e^1.504 is indeed about 4.5. Because ln(4.5) is approximately 1.5040774.\n\nSo e^1.504 \u22484.5.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5. So the correct answer is option C.\n",

Let me denote:\n\nRatio1 = (n1/n2) at T1=6000 K.\n\nRatio2 = (n1/n2) at T2=5500 K.\n\nFactor = Ratio1 / Ratio2.\n\nSo, Factor = [ (g1/g2) exp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ) ]\n\nSince (g1/g2) cancels out, Factor = exp( [\u0394E/(k)] (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )\n\nWait, wait, because:\n\nExp(-\u0394E/(k T1)) divided by Exp(-\u0394E/(k T2)) equals Exp[ (\u0394E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ].\n\nBecause:\n\nExp(a) / Exp(b) = Exp(a - b) = Exp( (a) ) * Exp( -b )\n\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\nExp( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) / Exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) = Exp[ (-\u0394E/(k T1)) - (-\u0394E/(k T2)) ) ]\n\n= Exp[ \u0394E/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]\n\nSo, Factor = Exp( (\u0394E/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nWait, let's compute the exponent: (\u0394E/(k)) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]\n\nWait, no, because when I have (-a)/(-b) it's +a/b. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, the exponent is [ (-\u0394E/(k T1)) - (-\u0394E/(k T2)) ) ] = (-\u0394E/(k T1)) + \u0394E/(k T2) ) = \u0394E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )\n\nSo, Factor = exp( [\u0394E/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )\n\nBut wait, let's compute 1/T2 - 1/T1. Since T2 < T1, 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1, so 1/T2 -1/T1 is positive. So the exponent is positive, which would make the factor larger than 1. So the ratio Ratio1/Ratio2 is greater than 1, which makes sense because when T decreases, Ratio2 is smaller than Ratio1.\n\nSo, Factor = exp( (\u0394E/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )\n\nBut wait, the problem gives the wavelength of the transition between the two energy levels as approximately 1448 \u00c5. So, the energy difference \u0394E can be found using the relation E = hc/\u03bb.\n\nSo, let's compute \u0394E = hc / \u03bb.\n\nh is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nc is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.\n\n\u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters, because 1 \u00c5 is 1e-10 m.\n\nSo, let's compute hc/\u03bb.\n\nh*c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDivide by \u03bb: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approx 1.373e-18 J.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately.\n\nWait, 1448e-10 m is 1.448e-7 m. Wait no, wait 1448 \u00c5 is 1448 x 1e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo,\n\nh*c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\n\u0394E = h c / \u03bb = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m / 1.448e-7 m = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 \u2248 1.373e-18 J.\n\nNow, k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.\n\nSo, \u0394E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) \u2248 9.95e4 K.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately:\n\n1.373e-18 / 1.380649e-23 = (1.373 / 1.380649) * 1e5 \u2248 approximately 0.994 * 1e5 \u2248 99400 K.\n\nSo approximately 9.94e4 K.\n\nSo, now compute (\u0394E/(k)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000).\n\nCompute 1/5500 = approx 1.818e-4 per K.\n\n1/6000 = approx 1.6667e-4 per K.\n\nSo, 1/5500 -1/6000 = (1.818e-4 -1.6667e-4) = 0.1513e-4 per K.\n\nWhich is 1.513e-5 per K.\n\nMultiply by \u0394E/(k) \u2248 9.94e4 K:\n\n9.94e4 * 1.513e-5 = (9.94 * 1.513) * 1e-1.\n\nCompute 9.94 * 1.513:\n\nApprox 9.94 * 1.5 is 14.91, and 9.94 * 0.013 is about 0.129. So total approx 15.04.\n\nMultiply by 1e-1: 1.504.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.504.\n\nSo, Factor = exp(1.504) \u2248 e^1.504.\n\nWhat's e^1.504?\n\ne^1 is 2.71828.\n\ne^1.5 is about 4.4817.\n\nWait, but 1.504 is very close to 1.5, so e^1.504 \u2248 4.5.\n\nWait, let me compute more accurately.\n\nLet me recall that ln(4.5) is approximately 1.504.\n\nWait, because ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(4.5) is around 1.504. So e^1.504 is approximately 4.5.\n\nSo, the factor is about 4.5.\n\nLooking back at the options: option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when computing (1/5500 - 1/6000), I should compute accurately:\n\n1/5500 = 0.000181818...\n\n1/6000 = 0.000166666...\n\nSubtracting: 0.000181818 - 0.000166666 = 0.000015152.\n\nWhich is 1.5152e-5.\n\nMultiply by \u0394E/(k) = 99400 K:\n\n99400 * 1.5152e-5 = (99400 * 1.5152 ) * 1e-5.\n\nCompute 99400 * 1.5152:\n\nWell, 100,000 *1.5152 =151,520. But 99400 is 600 less than 100,000.\n\nSo 151520 - (600 *1.5152) = 151520 - 909.12 = 150,610.88.\n\nSo 150610.88 * 1e-5 = 15.061088.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 99400 is 9.94e4. 9.94e4 * 1.5152e-5 = (9.94 *1.5152) * 1e-1.\n\n9.94 *1.5152 is approximately:\n\n10 *1.5152=15.152, minus 0.06 *1.5152=0.0909. So 15.152 - 0.0909=15.0611.\n\nMultiply by 1e-1: 1.50611.\n\nSo exponent is 1.50611.\n\ne^1.50611 \u2248 e^1.504 is about 4.5.\n\nWait, but wait, e^1.504 is indeed about 4.5. Because ln(4.5) is approximately 1.5040774.\n\nSo e^1.504 \u22484.5.\n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5. So the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from no spots (T\u2081 = 6000 K) to having spots (T\u2082 = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation under LTE.
