      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2)m\u03c9\u00b2r\u00b2. Hmm, I remember that the 3D harmonic oscillator is a common problem in quantum mechanics. The potential is spherically symmetric, which probably means that the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in a particular way.\n\nThe question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different energy expressions and multiplicities.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, no, in 3D, it's often treated as three independent 1D oscillators, so the energy is the sum of each direction's energy. Oh right, the energy for each direction is (n_i + 1/2)\u0127\u03c9, where n_i is the quantum number (0,1,2,...) for each direction. So the total energy E is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)\u0127\u03c9.\n\nWait, but wait! Alternatively, I remember that in 3D, the energy levels are characterized by a principal quantum number n, which is the sum of the three quantum numbers: n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy is (n + 3/2)\u0127\u03c9. Oh right, that's a more concise way to think about it. So each energy level corresponds to a specific n, and the degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions) depends on the number of ways you can get n from the sum of n_x, n_y, n_z.\n\nSo, the first thing is to figure out which state is the third excited state. The ground state is the lowest energy state. The ground state has n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z =0), so energy (3/2)\u0127\u03c9. The first excited state would be the next level, which is n=1. Then the second excited state is n=2, and the third excited state is n=3. So the energy for the third excited state is (3 + 3/2)\u0127\u03c9 = (9/2)\u0127\u03c9. That seems to match option A and C.\n\nNow, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy. The number of eigenfunctions for a given n is the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers (since n_x, n_y, n_z can be 0,1,2,...). So for n=3, how many triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) add up to 3?\n\nHmm, this is a combinatorics problem. The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n is (n + 3 - 1 choose 3 -1) ) = (n+2 choose 2). So for n=3, it's (3+2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10. That matches the first part of option A, which says energy (9/2)\u0127\u03c9 and 10 eigenfunctions. Option C says 3, which is wrong because 10 is the correct number.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is (9/2)\u0127\u03c9 and 10. So that should be the correct choice. Let me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B has an energy term involving pi^2 and 1/(m r^2), which doesn't look right for a harmonic oscillator. The energy should be proportional to \u0127\u03c9, not 1/r\u00b2. So B is out. Option D has the same wrong energy form as B, so that's also incorrect. Option C has the right energy but the wrong number of eigenfunctions, so it's out too.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the third excited state is n=3, energy (9/2)\u0127\u03c9, and 10 eigenfunctions.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that in such a system, the potential is V(r) = (1/2)m\u03c9\u00b2r\u00b2, right? And the force here obeys Hooke's law, so it's a spring-like force.\n\nThe question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that energy. The options are A to D. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find the energy of the third excited state. I recall that for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. The energy depends on the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, and n_z, but since it's isotropic, these directions are symmetric. So the energy levels are given by E = \u0127\u03c9(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Alternatively, another way I've seen it is E = \u0127\u03c9(2n + l + 3/2), but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, another approach is that in three dimensions, the energy levels can be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number. Oh right, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy is E = \u0127\u03c9(n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right.\n\nIn three dimensions, the energy levels are E = (n + l + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, but wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Because in each direction, the energy is (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, so adding them gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nWait, but that's the same as (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers, n = n_x + n_y + n_z. But wait, isn't n the principal quantum number in some contexts? Or perhaps in the 3D case, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers. Let me think.\n\nThe energy levels in a 3D isotropic oscillator are degenerate. The degeneracy depends on the value of the sum of the quantum numbers. So the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. And each n corresponds to a certain energy level.\n\nWait, no, wait another moment. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the quantum numbers. For a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels can be expressed as E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers in each direction. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the possible values of n are 0, 1, 2, etc. Each energy level corresponds to a particular n.\n\nThe ground state is when n = 0: E = (0 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nThe first excited state would be when n = 1: E = (1 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (5/2) \u0127\u03c9. The second excited state is n=2: (7/2) \u0127\u03c9. The third excited state is n=3: (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because when n increases, the energy level increases by steps. So ground state is n=0, first excited n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So the third excited state would have n=3, so E = (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. That makes sense.\n\nSo the first part of the question, the energy, is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. Looking at the options, option A has (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 as the first part, option C also. So that's a clue.\n\nNow, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. That's the degeneracy of the energy level. The degeneracy depends on how many different (n_x, n_y, n_z) combinations sum to the given n. For n=3, how many triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) are there where each n_i is a non-negative integer and their sum is 3.\n\nThis is a combinatorics problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. The formula for the number of solutions is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (3 + 2 choose 2) ) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.\n\nWait, so the third excited state has energy (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and 10 eigenfunctions. Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, 10. So that would be the correct choice.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making any mistake in the energy levels. Because sometimes, in some treatments, the energy is given as E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, which is the same as (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 where n = sum of the quantum numbers. So for n=3, E is (3 + 3/2) = 9/2. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that the energy levels can also be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number N, which is N = n_x + n_y + n_z + 3. But I'm not sure about that. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it with the hydrogen atom model. Hydrogen's energy depends on N = n_r + l + 1, but for harmonic oscillator, the approach is different.\n\nNo, the correct way is that in 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z, and E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So for n=0, E=3/2 \u0127\u03c9, which is ground state. So third excited state is n=3, E=9/2 \u0127\u03c9, and degeneracy is 10.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option A.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A) (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 , 10 \u2192 correct.\nOption C) (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, 3 \u2192 incorrect because degeneracy is 10, not 3.\n\nOther options have different energy expressions, so they're wrong.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that in such a system, the potential is V(r) = (1/2)m\u03c9\u00b2r\u00b2, right? And the force here obeys Hooke's law, so it's a spring-like force.\n\nThe question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that energy. The options are A to D. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find the energy of the third excited state. I recall that for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. The energy depends on the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, and n_z, but since it's isotropic, these directions are symmetric. So the energy levels are given by E = \u0127\u03c9(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Alternatively, another way I've seen it is E = \u0127\u03c9(2n + l + 3/2), but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, another approach is that in three dimensions, the energy levels can be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number. Oh right, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy is E = \u0127\u03c9(n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right.\n\nIn three dimensions, the energy levels are E = (n + l + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, but wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Because in each direction, the energy is (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, so adding them gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nWait, but that's the same as (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers, n = n_x + n_y + n_z. But wait, isn't n the principal quantum number in some contexts? Or perhaps in the 3D case, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers. Let me think.\n\nThe energy levels in a 3D isotropic oscillator are degenerate. The degeneracy depends on the value of the sum of the quantum numbers. So the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. And each n corresponds to a certain energy level.\n\nWait, no, wait another moment. I'm getting a bit confused.

So the possible values of n are 0, 1, 2, etc. Each energy level corresponds to a particular n.\n\nThe ground state is when n = 0: E = (0 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nThe first excited state would be when n = 1: E = (1 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (5/2) \u0127\u03c9. The second excited state is n=2: (7/2) \u0127\u03c9. The third excited state is n=3: (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because when n increases, the energy level increases by steps. So ground state is n=0, first excited n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So the third excited state would have n=3, so E = (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. That makes sense.\n\nSo the first part of the question, the energy, is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9.

The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. The formula for the number of solutions is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (3 + 2 choose 2) ) = (5 choose 2) = 10.

So for n=3, E is (3 + 3/2) = 9/2. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that the energy levels can also be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number N, which is N = n_x + n_y + n_z + 3. But I'm not sure about that.

Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, no, the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator has energy levels based on the sum of the three quantum numbers in each direction. So each direction (x, y, z) has a quantum number, say nx, ny, nz. So the total energy is E = \u0127\u03c9 (nx + ny + nz + 3/2). Because each direction contributes (n + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, so adding them gives (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nBut wait, another approach is to consider the oscillator in spherical coordinates.

So each N corresponds to a specific energy level.\n\nWait, but the third excited state. Oh, wait, I need to clarify: the ground state is the lowest energy, then first excited, second, etc. So the ground state would be N=0, because when all n_x, n_y, n_z are zero, their sum is zero.

The total quantum number is $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, and the energy can also be expressed as $E = \\hbar \\omega (N + \\frac{3}{2})$.\n\nThe third excited state corresponds to $N = 3$, as the ground state is $N = 0$, the first excited state is $N = 1$, the second excited state is $N = 2$, and the third excited state is $N = 3$. Substituting $N = 3$ into the energy formula, the energy of the third excited state is:\n\n\\[\nE = \\hbar \\omega \\left(3 + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega.\n\\]\n\nNext, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue $N = 3$ is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of solutions is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{N + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{3 + 2}{2} = \\binom{5}{2} = 10.\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.\n\nFrom the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Energy: $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$, Number of eigenfunctions: 10.**\n\nAnswer: A",

The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m \u03c9\u00b2 r\u00b2. I remember that in such a system, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, and n_z, but since it's isotropic, it's often easier to work with the radial quantum number.\n\nWait, right, in 3D, the energy levels are given by E = \u0127\u03c9(n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction, like n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Or is it (n_x + n_y + n_z) that gives the energy? Hmm, wait, no, maybe it's (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) times \u0127\u03c9. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, so adding them gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nSo the third excited state... Wait, I need to clarify. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0, but in 3D, the states are filled by increasing the sum n_x + n_y + n_z. The ground state is when all are zero, so n=0. The first excited state would have one quantum, like (1,0,0), (0,1,0), or (0,0,1), which are degenerate. The second excited state would have two quanta, so states like (2,0,0), (1,1,0), etc. But wait, I'm getting confused about how the excited states are counted.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the principal quantum number. In 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are labeled by n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each n corresponds to a certain energy. The ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state would be n=3.\n\nWait, no, wait: the ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, then n=2 is second excited, n=3 is third. So yes, third excited is n=3.\n\nSo the energy E would be (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. For n=3, E = (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. So that's the energy part.\n\nNow, the second part of the question: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue? That is, what's the degeneracy of the energy level E when n=3.\n\nThe degeneracy in 3D harmonic oscillator comes from the number of ways the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z can add up to n. For n=3, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z =3.\n\nSo the number of states is (3 + 3 -1 choose 3 -1 ) = (5 choose 2) = 10. Oh wait, wait, no, that's the formula for the number of ways to distribute n identical items into k bins, which is (n +k-1 choose k-1). So here, n=3, k=3 (x, y, z), so (3+3-1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.\n\nLooking at the options, option A says energy (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and 10 eigenfunctions. So that would be the correct choice.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The third excited state is n=3, yes. So the energy is (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9? Wait, no: E = \u0127\u03c9 (n + 3/2), because each direction contributes (n_i +1/2) \u0127\u03c9. So n=0 gives 3/2 \u0127\u03c9, n=1 gives 5/2, n=2 gives 7/2, n=3 gives 9/2. Yes, correct.\n\nSo the options: option A is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9, 10. So that's the one. The other options either have wrong energy or wrong degeneracy.\n",

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. I've studied a bit about harmonic oscillators, but I'm a bit rusty, so let me think this through.\n\nFirst, the potential given is V(r) = (1/2) m \u03c9\u00b2 r\u00b2. Oh right, that's the form of a harmonic oscillator potential. Since it's three-dimensional and isotropic, the potential depends only on the radial distance r. So the particle is moving in a system where the potential is the same in all directions.\n\nI remember that for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. The energy depends on the quantum numbers in each of the three dimensions. Wait, but in three dimensions, it's usually treated as three separate one-dimensional oscillators, each along x, y, and z axes. The total energy would be the sum of the energies from each direction.\n\nEach one-dimensional harmonic oscillator has energy levels given by E_n = (n + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...). So for three dimensions, the total energy E would be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n_x, n_y, n_z are the quantum numbers in each direction.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that the energy can be expressed in terms of a single quantum number N, which is the sum of the individual quantum numbers. So N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy becomes E = (N + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. That makes sense because each dimension contributes (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, so adding them together gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nThe question is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state and the excited states here? The ground state is the lowest energy, which corresponds to N=0, right? Because n_x = n_y = n_z =0. Then the first excited state would be N=1, second excited N=2, third excited N=3. Because each increment in N corresponds to the next higher energy level.\n\nSo for the third excited state, N=3.

So either A or C is correct.\n\nNext, the question asks how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue. That is, the degeneracy of the energy level. Degeneracy refers to the number of distinct eigenfunctions that share the same energy eigenvalue.\n\nIn three dimensions, the degeneracy for a given N is given by the number of ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers n_x, n_y, n_z. This is a combinatorial problem. The number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to distribute N indistinct items into 3 distinct boxes, allowing zeros. The formula for this is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (N+2 choose 2). So for N=3, it would be (3+2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.\n\nWait, let me make sure. For N=0: (0+2 choose 2)=1. Correct, only one state (0,0,0). For N=1: (3 choose 2)=3. That makes sense: (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). For N=2: (4 choose 2)=6. The states are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). Yeah, 6 states. So for N=3: (5 choose 2)=10. So the degeneracy is 10.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A says (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and 10 eigenfunctions. Option C says (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and 3 eigenfunctions. So the correct answer must be A.\n\nWait, but why would option C be an option? Maybe someone confuses the degeneracy with something else. Let me think again. Could the question have meant the third excited state in another way? No, the third excited state is N=3. Because the ground state is N=0 (first state), first excited N=1, second excited N=2, third excited N=3.\n\nSo the energy is (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and the degeneracy is 10.

So that's a harmonic oscillator, which I remember is a standard problem in quantum mechanics. The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy level.\n\nHmm. So I need to recall the energy levels of a 3D harmonic oscillator. I think in three dimensions, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, in 3D, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the total quantum number. Or wait, no, I think each direction (x, y, z) has its own quantum number, say nx, ny, nz. And the energy is E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Yeah, that makes sense because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, so when you add them up, it's (sum n_i + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9.\n\nWait, but sometimes the total quantum number is defined as n = nx + ny + nz. So E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Oh right, that's correct. So the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers.\n\nNow, the states are degenerate because multiple sets of (nx, ny, nz) can give the same sum n. So for each n, the number of states (degeneracy) is given by the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers. That's a combinatorics problem. The formula for the degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy) is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Wait, is that right? Or is it something else?\n\nWait, the degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Let me think about that. For example, when n=0, the degeneracy is (0+1)(0+2)/2 = 1*2/2 =1. That makes sense because the ground state is non-degenerate. For n=1, (2)(3)/2=3, which is correct. The first excited state has threefold degeneracy.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, wait, what's the order here. Let me think: the ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0. The first excited state is n=1, second excited is n=2, third excited is n=3. So the third excited state corresponds to n=3.\n\nSo the energy E for n=3 would be (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. So that's part of the answer.\n\nNow, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level is the degeneracy, which is (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2 = 4*5/2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.\n\nLooking at the options, option A says energy (9/2) \u0127\u03c9 and 10 eigenfunctions. That matches. Option C says 3 eigenfunctions, which would be wrong for n=3 because the degeneracy is 10.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option A.\n\nWait, let me double-check the energy. For n=3, E = (3 + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9 = (9/2) \u0127\u03c9. Yep. And the degeneracy is (3+1)(3+2)/2 = 4*5/2=10. So yes, option A.\n",

I remember that in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is symmetric in all directions, so the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, right, in 3D, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Or wait, no, each direction is a 1D oscillator, so maybe the total energy is the sum of the individual energies.\n\nWait, in the 3D case, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Or wait, another way: the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Because for each direction, the energy is (n_i + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, so adding them up gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z.\n\nSo the energy levels are quantized and depend on n, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0,1,2,...). Each state with a given n can have multiple eigenfunctions, each with different (n_x, n_y, n_z) combinations that add up to n.\n\nNow, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state and the excited states here?\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest energy. Since each direction contributes at least 1/2 \u0127\u03c9, the ground state is when all n_x, n_y, n_z are zero. So n = 0.

The first excited state is the next possible state, which is n=1. Then the second is n=2, and the third is n=3.

That is, how many distinct (n_x, n_y, n_z) triplets add up to n=3.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.\n\nWait, that's a combinatorics problem. The number of ways to distribute 3 indistinguishable units into 3 distinguishable variables (n_x, n_y, n_z), each >= 0.\n\nThe formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions is (n + k -1 choose k-1), where n is the number to distribute, and k is the number of variables. Here, n=3, k=3. So (3 +3 -1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10.\n\nWait, yes, because 5 choose 2 is 10. So there are 10 possible triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) that sum to 3.
