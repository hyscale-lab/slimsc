      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. Hmm, the question is about the probability of an atom decaying. They say that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have passed without decay, and we're being asked what the probability is for the next 150 minutes. Wait, does that mean the next 150 minutes from now, which would be 200 minutes total, or the next 150 after the initial 100, making it 250? No, I think it's the next 150 minutes after the current time. So, 50 minutes have already passed, and we're looking at the next 150, so total time would be 200 minutes.\n\nWait, but radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? Which means the probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. It's memoryless. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the probability. Or does it?\n\nWait, the initial statement says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So maybe that's the half-life or something else. Or perhaps it's the probability of decaying in the first 100 minutes. Hmm. Let me think about decay probabilities.\n\nI remember that the decay probability (or the fraction remaining) can be modeled using the exponential decay formula. The formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant, and t is time. The probability that the atom hasn't decayed after time t is e^(-\u03bbt), so the probability it has decayed is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).\n\nWait, but wait. The given data is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So P(100) = 0.32. That would mean that 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.32. So e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68), so \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nLet me calculate that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) which is about -0.4055. So \u03bb is 0.4055/100 = 0.004055 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is, after 50 minutes have passed without decay, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, so the next 150 minutes is 150 minutes from now, which is t=50 to t=200. So the time elapsed since the start is 200 minutes. But since decay is memoryless, the probability from now is for the next 150 minutes.\n\nWait, no, the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, regardless of previous time.\n\nWait, but the initial condition is that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 100 minutes. So now, 50 minutes have passed, and it's still not decayed. So the total time is 50 minutes, and we're looking at the next 150, making 200 minutes since the start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes after the current time. So the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.\n\nBut wait, because the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period starting at the current time. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect this. So the probability is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nBut wait, let's compute that. We have \u03bb = 0.004055 per minute.\n\nSo \u03bb*150 = 0.004055 * 150 \u2248 0.60825.\n\ne^(-0.60825) \u2248 0.543. So 1 - 0.543 = 0.457, which is approximately 45.7%. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%. Hmm, 45.7% is close to 44 or 48. Maybe I should be more precise in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute ln(0.68) more accurately. Let's see, 0.68 is 68% of 1. So ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4054651. So \u03bb = 0.4054651 / 100 \u2248 0.004054651 per minute.\n\nThen, \u03bb * 150 = 0.004054651 * 150 = 0.6081977.\n\ne^(-0.6081977) is approximately 0.5431. So 1 - 0.5431 is 0.4569, or 45.69%. So about 45.7%, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. The closest is D)48% or A)44%.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is interpreted differently. Let me think again.\n\nThe given probability is 32% decay within 100 minutes. So that's P(100) = 0.32. So the decay constant \u03bb can be found from 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). So e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. So \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/(-100) \u2248 0.004054651.\n\nSo the decay probability in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Let's compute that more accurately.\n\nCalculating \u03bb * 150: 0.004054651 * 150 = 0.60819765.\n\nCompute e^-0.60819765. Let's compute that.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series for e^-x around x=0. Alternatively, use known values. Let me think: e^-0.6 is approximately 0.5488. e^-0.6082 is a little less than that. Let me compute e^-0.6082.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator:\n\n0.6082: natural exponent.\n\ne^-0.6 is about 0.5488.\n\n0.6082 is 0.0082 more than 0.6.\n\nSo using the approximation: e^-(a + b) = e^-a * e^-b.\n\nSo e^-0.6082 = e^-0.6 * e^-0.0082.\n\ne^-0.6 \u2248 0.5488.\n\ne^-0.0082 \u2248 1 - 0.0082 + (0.0082^2)/2 - ... \u2248 approximately 0.9918.\n\nSo 0.5488 * 0.9918 \u2248 0.5445.\n\nSo e^-0.6082 \u2248 0.5445.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5445 = 0.4555, about 45.55%. Hmm, that's about 45.5%, which is approximately 45.5%. The options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%. So 45.5% is closer to 44% (44.5% would be the midpoint between 44 and 46). But perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's compute the decay constant \u03bb correctly.\n\nGiven that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100).\n\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural logs: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68):\n\nWe know that ln(0.7) \u2248 -0.3567, ln(0.68) is a bit more negative. Let's compute it accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator: ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.4054651.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.4054651 / 100 = 0.004054651 per minute.\n\nNow, the next 150 minutes: time t is 150.\n\nSo P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t) = 1 - e^(-0.004054651 * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.60819765).\n\nCompute e^-0.60819765.\n\nUsing a calculator, e^-0.60819765 \u2248 0.543.\n\nSo P = 1 - 0.543 = 0.457, which is about 45.7%.\n\nBut the options don't have 45.7%. So perhaps I made a mistake in the question's interpretation. Maybe the question is about the total time being 250 minutes (100 + 150)? Wait, the question says 50 minutes have passed, and we're looking at the next 150. So 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, but considering that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the conditional probability is P(decay in 50 < t \u2264 200 | no decay in 0 < t \u226450).\n\nIn that case, the formula would be [P(decay by 200) - P(decay by 50)] / [1 - P(decay by 50)].\n\nWait, that's a better approach. Let me think.\n\nThe total probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes is P(200) - P(50), where P(t) is the probability of decay by time t.\n\nSo P(200) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200), P(50)=1 - e^(-\u03bb*50).\n\nThe conditional probability is [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)].\n\nSo let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, calculate \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb = 0.004054651 per minute.\n\nCompute P(50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*50).\n\n\u03bb*50 = 0.004054651 *50 = 0.20273255.\n\ne^-0.20273255 \u2248 0.8163.\n\nSo P(50)=1 - 0.8163 = 0.1837 or 18.37%.\n\nSimilarly, P(200)=1 - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\n\u03bb*200=0.004054651 *200=0.8109302.\n\ne^-0.8109302 \u2248 0.4449.\n\nSo P(200)=1 -0.4449=0.5551 or 55.51%.\n\nSo the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is P(200) - P(50) = 0.5551 -0.1837=0.3714 or 37.14%.\n\nThe denominator is 1 - P(50) = 1 - 0.1837=0.8163.\n\nSo the conditional probability is 0.3714 / 0.8163 \u2248 0.4547 or 45.47%.\n\nAgain, about 45.5%. But the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps the question is not considering the conditional probability. Or maybe I've made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, but the question says, \"the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So that's P(100)=0.32. So the initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the decay constant again. Let me double-check.\n\n\u03bb = (ln(1/(1-0.32)))/100 = ln(1/0.68)/100. ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588) \u2248 0.38566. So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566/100= 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake earlier? Because ln(0.68) is -0.4054651, so \u03bb would be 0.4054651/100= 0.004054651. But wait, another way: P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So for t=100, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). So e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68. So \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100. 1/0.68 is approximately 1.470588. ln(1.470588) is about 0.38566. So \u03bb=0.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, this contradicts my earlier calculation. So which is correct? Because I think I might have confused ln(0.68) with ln(1/0.68).\n\nWait, let's compute it correctly. Let me compute ln(0.68):\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4054651.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.4054651 / 100 = 0.004054651 per minute. That's correct.\n\nWait, but wait: when I compute e^(-\u03bb*100), it's e^(-0.4054651) = 0.68, which matches the given data. So my initial calculation of \u03bb was correct.\n\nSo going back, the conditional probability approach gives 45.5%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is asking for the probability in the next 150 minutes without considering the conditional probability, just the straight probability from t=0 to t=150. But that would be P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.004054651 *150).\n\nLet's compute that again: 0.004054651 *150 =0.60819765.\n\ne^-0.60819765 \u2248 0.543. So P(150) = 1 - 0.543 = 0.457, 45.7%.\n\nBut that's not matching any options. So perhaps the question is asking for the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Which is the conditional probability approach, which we found to be about 45.5%, which is also not an option.\n\nWait, the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%. Hmm. 45.5% is closest to 44% (A) or 48% (D). But neither is very close.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial calculation of the decay constant. Let me compute it again.\n\nGiven P(100) = 32% = 0.32.\n\nSo 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100).\n\nSo e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural log: -\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/(-100).\n\nln(0.68)= -0.4054651.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.4054651 / 100 = 0.004054651 per minute.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the options again. Maybe the question is considering the next 150 minutes after the initial 100. So the total time would be 250 minutes. So we can calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is from 100 to 250. So the conditional probability here would be [P(250) - P(100)] / [1 - P(100)].\n\nWait, but the question says that 50 minutes have passed, not 100. So this approach wouldn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, regardless of the previous 50. So it's the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, which is 45.7%. But again, the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 100 minutes' probability is given, but the question is about the next 150 minutes. So perhaps the calculation is to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in 50.\n\nWhich brings us back to the conditional probability approach, giving approximately 45.5%.\n\nBut that's not matching any options. So perhaps the problem is in the way the question is phrased. Let me read the question again.\n\nQuestion: We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\n\nSo, the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So the initial calculation of \u03bb is correct.\n\nNow, since 50 minutes have passed, the time elapsed is 50, and the next 150 minutes would make the total time 200 minutes.\n\nSo the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.\n\nWhich is P(200) - P(50).\n\nCompute P(50)=1 - e^(-0.004054651 *50) = 1 - e^(-0.20273255) \u2248 1 - 0.8163 \u2248 0.1837.\n\nP(200)=1 - e^(-0.004054651*200)=1 - e^(-0.8109302) \u2248 1 - 0.4449 \u2248 0.5551.\n\nSo the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is 0.5551 - 0.1837=0.3714, which is 37.14%.\n\nBut the denominator in the conditional probability is the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, which is 0.8163.\n\nSo the conditional probability is 0.3714 / 0.8163 \u2248 0.4547 or 45.47%, which is about 45.5%.\n\nBut the options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, not considering the 50 minutes. So it's the same as P(150)=45.7%. Again, not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model it using the half-life approach. Wait, the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So the half-life T1/2 is the time when half the atoms have decayed. But 32% decayed means 68% remain. So 0.68 = e^(-\u03bb T1/2).\n\nWait, but wait, the half-life formula is T1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb. So \u03bb = ln(2)/T1/2.\n\nAlternatively, since 0.68 = e^(-\u03bb *100), then T1/2 is ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nBut perhaps this approach isn't helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using a different approach. For example, the probability of decay in a certain time is given by the formula P = 1 - e^(-kt), where k is the decay constant.\n\nBut in this case, the given probability is 32% for 100 minutes, which we've already used to find k.\n\nSo the problem is, after 50 minutes without decay, what's the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. So it's the conditional probability between t=50 and t=200.\n\nWhich, as calculated, is approximately 45.5%. But none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the conditional probability.\n\nLet me recompute the numbers more accurately.\n\nCompute P(50):\n\n\u03bb=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nt=50: \u03bbt=0.20273255.\n\ne^-0.20273255:\n\ne^-0.2 \u2248 0.8187.\n\ne^-0.20273255: Let's compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing Taylor expansion around x=0.2:\n\nx=0.20273255.\n\ne^-x = e^-(0.2 + 0.00273255) = e^-0.2 * e^-0.00273255.\n\ne^-0.2 \u2248 0.818730753.\n\ne^-0.00273255 \u2248 1 - 0.00273255 + (0.00273255)^2/2 \u2248 approximately 0.997273.\n\nSo e^-x \u2248 0.818730753 * 0.997273 \u2248 0.8163.\n\nSo P(50) = 1 - 0.8163 = 0.1837.\n\nSimilarly, P(200)=1 - e^(-0.004054651 *200) = 1 - e^(-0.8109302).\n\nCompute e^-0.8109302.\n\nWe know that e^-0.8 is approximately 0.4493.\n\ne^-0.8109302 = e^-(0.8 + 0.0109302) = e^-0.8 * e^-0.0109302.\n\ne^-0.0109302 \u2248 1 - 0.0109302 + (0.0109302)^2/2 \u2248 0.9891.\n\nSo e^-0.8109302 \u2248 0.4493 * 0.9891 \u2248 0.4445.\n\nThus, P(200)=1-0.4445=0.5555.\n\nSo the difference is 0.5555 - 0.1837 = 0.3718.\n\nDenominator is 1 - 0.1837 = 0.8163.\n\n0.3718 / 0.8163 \u2248 0.4553, or 45.53%.\n\nStill, not matching any options.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Maybe the 32% is the probability per minute, which would be incorrect. No, the question states it's the probability within 100 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes without considering the 50 minutes already passed. So it's 150 minutes from now, which is 150 minutes. So P(150)=45.7%, but again, no option.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the options again. The closest to 45.5% is option D)48% and option A)44%. But neither is very close. Perhaps the calculation is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. So it's the same as the conditional probability.\n\nAnother approach: the conditional probability is (P(200) - P(50)) / (1 - P(50)).\n\nWe have P(50)=0.1837, P(200)=0.5555.\n\nSo 0.5555 -0.1837=0.3718.\n\nDivide by (1-0.1837)=0.8163.\n\n0.3718 /0.8163 \u2248 0.4553 or 45.53%.\n\nStill, same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial data was 32% decay within 100 minutes, so the decay constant is calculated as \u03bb = ln(2)/T_half, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability given is the cumulative probability, so it's 32% after 100 minutes, meaning that the decay constant is calculated using that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try calculating it as a half-life.\n\nThe half-life T is the time taken for the number of atoms to halve. So if 32% have decayed, that implies 68% remain, so 0.68 = e^(-\u03bb T).\n\nWait, no, because 32% decayed, so 68% remain. So e^(-\u03bb * T) = 0.68. So \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/(-T). But T here is 100 minutes.\n\nSo \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/(-100) = 0.004054651 per minute, which is what I had earlier.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not using the exponential decay model. Maybe it's using a linear probability model, which would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what the question expects.\n\nIf the probability is 32% in 100 minutes, then the probability per minute is 0.32/100=0.0032 per minute. So for 150 minutes, it's 0.0032 *150=0.48, 48%, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, that's a linear approach, which isn't correct for radioactive decay. Radioactive decay follows an exponential model, not a linear one. So using that approach would be wrong, but perhaps the question expects that.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be 48%, option D.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Because the correct approach is the exponential model. But perhaps the question is expecting the linear model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 32% is the decay constant per minute, so \u03bb=0.32/100=0.0032.\n\nThen, for 150 minutes, P=1 - e^(-0.0032*150)=1 - e^(-0.48) \u2248 1 - 0.619 = 0.381, 38.1%, which isn't any of the options.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 32% is the activity or something else. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The question states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that the atom decays in the first 100 minutes. The probability that it hasn't decayed after 100 minutes is 68%. So the decay constant \u03bb can be calculated as \u03bb = ln(2)/T_half, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the decay probability in time t is P(t)=1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So for t=100, P=0.32.\n\nSo, 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100)=0.32 \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb= -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 0.00405465 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is after 50 minutes, so 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is P=1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nBut wait, no. Because the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting now, regardless of the past.\n\nSo the probability is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) \u2248 45.7%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes after the initial 100. So the total time would be 250 minutes.\n\nWait, but the question says 50 minutes have passed. So 50 minutes, not 100.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased, and the 32% is the probability per 100 minutes. So the activity is 32% per 100 minutes. But that's not standard; decay probabilities are in the form of P(t)=1 - e^(-\u03bb t).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model, like the linear model. So if in 100 minutes, the probability is 32%, then per minute it's 0.32. So in 150 minutes, it's 0.32 * (150/100)=0.48, which is 48%, option D.\n\nBut that's incorrect for radioactive decay. So perhaps the intended answer is D)48%.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the conditional probability, which is 45.5%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D)48%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the problem.\n\nWait, let's compute the decay constant again. Given P(100)=32%.\n\nSo 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb=ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb= (ln(1/0.68))/100= ln(1.470588)/100 \u22480.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because ln(0.68)=\u22120.4054651, so \u03bb=0.4054651/100=0.004054651 per minute. So perhaps the initial calculation is correct.\n\nBut if I take \u03bb=0.0038566, then let's compute the probability for 150 minutes.\n\n\u03bb=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nt=150: \u03bbt=0.0038566 *150=0.57849.\n\ne^-0.57849\u22480.5618. So P=1-0.5618=0.4382 or 43.82%, which is about 44%, option A.\n\nBut how did I get two different values for \u03bb? Because in one approach, I took ln(0.68)=\u22120.4054651, leading to \u03bb=0.004054651 per minute. In another approach, I thought that \u03bb=ln(1.470588)/100=0.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute. But that's incorrect because ln(1/0.68)=ln(1.470588)=0.38566. So \u03bb=0.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me clarify:\n\nWe have 0.32=1-e^(-\u03bb*100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 take natural logs: -100\u03bb=ln(0.68)=\u22120.4054651 \u2192 100\u03bb=0.4054651 \u2192 \u03bb=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nSo the correct \u03bb is 0.004054651 per minute.\n\nSo, if I use this \u03bb, then for t=150 minutes, P=1 - e^(-0.004054651 *150)=1 - e^(-0.60819765)=0.457, 45.7%.\n\nBut this isn't an option. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the linear approximation, which would give 48%, option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended that the decay is 32% per 100 minutes, so the decay rate is 0.32 per 100 minutes, so 0.0032 per minute. Then, for 150 minutes, it's 0.0032 *150=0.48, 48%, option D.\n\nBut that's not the correct model, but perhaps the question expects that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 32% is the activity, which is \u03bbN, but that's more for the rate, not the probability.\n\nIn that case, the activity is \u03bbN=0.32 per 100 minutes, so \u03bb=0.32/(100N), but that's getting into more complex topics.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. The correct approach gives approximately 45.7%, but that's not an option. The options are 44%,40%,52%,48%.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation of \u03bb is different. Let me recheck.\n\nGiven P(t)=1 - e^(-\u03bb t) = 0.32 when t=100.\n\nSo, e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb=ln(0.68)=\u22120.4054651 \u2192 \u03bb=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nNow, the time after 50 minutes is 150 more minutes.\n\nSo, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P=1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) = 1 - e^(-0.60819765)=0.457.\n\nBut no option matches. So perhaps the question is considering the 50 minutes passed as part of the decay, and the next 150 would be up to 200 minutes. So the conditional probability is [P(200)\u2212P(50)]/[1\u2212P(50)].\n\nWait, let's compute this accurately.\n\nCompute P(50)=1 - e^(-0.004054651 *50)=1 - e^(-0.20273255)= 1 - 0.8163=0.1837.\n\nP(200)=1 - e^(-0.004054651 *200)=1 - e^(-0.8109302)=0.5551.\n\nSo the numerator is 0.5551\u22120.1837=0.3714.\n\nDenominator is 1\u22120.1837=0.8163.\n\n0.3714/0.8163=0.4547, 45.47%, which is approximately 45.5%.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, not considering the 50 minutes passed. So it's P=1 - e^(-\u03bb*150)=45.7%.\n\nBut again, no option matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150 minutes, and the decay probability is 32% for 100 minutes, so scaling it.\n\nSo, perhaps the probability for 150 minutes is (150/100)*32% = 48%, option D.\n\nBut that's a linear approach, which isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the probability decreases by 32% every 100 minutes, so after 50 minutes, half of that time, the probability would be 16% (32% * (50/100)), but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects to find the decay probability for 150 minutes using the same formula, but I must have made a calculation mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate \u03bb again.\n\n\u03bb= ln(1/(1-0.32))/100 = ln(1/0.68)/100= ln(1.470588)/100\u22480.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, that's a different value. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute e^(-\u03bb*100) with \u03bb=0.0038566.\n\ne^(-0.0038566 *100)=e^-0.38566\u22480.68. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo perhaps earlier I made a mistake in calculating \u03bb. So \u03bb=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, using this \u03bb, let's compute the probability for 150 minutes.\n\n\u03bb*150=0.0038566 *150=0.57849.\n\ne^-0.57849\u22480.5618.\n\nSo P=1-0.5618=0.4382, 43.82%, which is about 44%, option A.\n\nAh! Now that's option A.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating \u03bb. Because when I computed \u03bb as 0.004054651, I used ln(0.68), which is correct. But earlier I thought that ln(1/0.68)=0.38566, which is correct, but why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, no, because ln(1/0.68)=ln(1.470588)=0.38566.\n\nSo \u03bb=0.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nBut earlier I thought that ln(0.68)=\u22120.4054651, so \u03bb=0.4054651/100=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nWait, these are two different values for \u03bb. Which is correct?\n\nWait, 0.38566 is ln(1.470588)=0.38566.\n\nAnd ln(0.68)=\u22120.4054651.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nBecause P(t)=1 - e^(-\u03bb t)=0.32.\n\nSo, e^(-\u03bb t)=0.68.\n\nTake natural logs: -\u03bb t= ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb= (ln(0.68))/(-t) \u2192 t=100.\n\nSo \u03bb= (ln(0.68))/(-100)= (\u22120.4054651)/(-100)=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, but why does ln(1/0.68)=ln(1.470588)=0.38566? Because ln(1/0.68)=ln(1.470588)=0.38566.\n\nBut that would be \u03bb=0.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because substituting \u03bb=0.0038566 per minute into e^(-\u03bb*100)=e^-0.38566\u22480.68, which is correct.\n\nBut when I compute \u03bb=0.004054651 per minute, e^(-0.004054651 *100)=e^-0.4054651\u22480.68, which is also correct.\n\nWait a minute, that's impossible. Because 0.38566 is not equal to 0.4054651. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, no, let me clarify:\n\nIf P(t)=1 - e^(-\u03bb t), and P(100)=0.32,\n\nthen e^(-\u03bb*100)=0.68 \u2192 -\u03bb*100=ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb= (ln(0.68))/(-100)= (\u22120.4054651)/(-100)=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut when I compute ln(1/0.68)=ln(1.470588)=0.38566.\n\nSo, \u03bb= (ln(1/0.68))/100=0.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, but that's a different value. So which is correct?\n\nBecause e^(-\u03bb t)=0.68 \u2192 ln(0.68)= -\u03bb t \u2192 \u03bb= (\u2212ln(0.68))/t.\n\nSo, with t=100, \u03bb= (0.4054651)/100=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo earlier mistake: when I thought \u03bb=0.0038566, that's incorrect. The correct \u03bb is 0.004054651 per minute.\n\nSo, with \u03bb=0.004054651 per minute, let's compute the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)=1 - e^(-0.60819765)=0.457, 45.7%.\n\nBut that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D)48%, assuming a linear model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done as follows:\n\nThe probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period, which is 32% * (150/100) = 48%, option D.\n\nBut that's incorrect because the decay probability isn't linear with time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes after the initial 50 minutes. So the total time is 200 minutes.\n\nSo the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200) =1 - e^(-0.8109302)=0.5551. But that's the probability by 200 minutes, not the next 150.\n\nBut the question is about the next 150 minutes, which is the same as the conditional probability we calculated earlier, 45.5%, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The correct calculation leads to approximately 45.5%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is D)48%, assuming a linear approach.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial probability is 32% in 100 minutes, so the decay constant \u03bb is 0.32/100=0.0032 per minute. Then, for 150 minutes, the probability is 0.0032*150=0.48, 48%, option D.\n\nBut again, that's a linear approach, which is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the conditional probability approach.\n\nWait, the conditional probability is [P(200)\u2212P(50)]/[1\u2212P(50)].\n\nCompute P(200)=1\u2212e^(-0.004054651 *200)=1\u2212e^(-0.8109302)=0.5551.\n\nP(50)=0.1837.\n\nSo [0.5551\u22120.1837]=0.3714.\n\nDenominator: 1\u22120.1837=0.8163.\n\n0.3714/0.8163=0.4547, 45.47%.\n\nSo 45.5% is the correct answer, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option D)48%, assuming the question expects a linear model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of half-life.\n\nGiven P(100)=32%, so 68% remain. The half-life T is the time when 50% remain.\n\nSo 0.5 = e^(-\u03bb T) \u2192 ln(0.5)=\u2212\u03bb T \u2192 T= ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nWe have \u03bb=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nSo T=0.6931 /0.004054651 \u2248 170.9 minutes.\n\nSo half-life is approximately 171 minutes.\n\nNow, the time elapsed is 50 minutes, so the remaining time is 150 minutes.\n\nSo the fraction remaining after 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *50)=e^(-0.20273255)=0.8163.\n\nThe fraction remaining after 50+150=200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *200)=e^(-0.8109302)=0.4449.\n\nSo the fraction that decays between 50 and 200 minutes is 0.8163 - 0.4449=0.3714.\n\nSo the conditional probability is 0.3714 / (1 - 0.1837)=0.3714/0.8163\u22480.4547.\n\nAgain, 45.47%.\n\nSo I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 45.5%, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option D)48%, but I'm not sure why.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes, without considering the 50 minutes already passed. So it's 150 minutes, P=45.7%, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays within the next 150 minutes after the initial 100. So the total time is 250 minutes.\n\nSo P(250)=1 - e^(-\u03bb*250)=1 - e^(-0.004054651 *250)=1 - e^(-1.01366275)=1 - 0.3635=0.6365 or 63.65%.\n\nBut that's not relevant to the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply expecting us to find the decay probability in 150 minutes, which is 45.7%, and the closest option is D)48%.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D)48%.\n\nBut I'm not certain. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is D)48%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. Hmm, the question is about the probability of an atom decaying. They say that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have passed without decay, and we're being asked what the probability is for the next 150 minutes. Wait, does that mean the next 150 minutes from now, which would be 200 minutes total, or the next 150 after the initial 100, making it 250? No, I think it's the next 150 minutes after the current time. So, 50 minutes have already passed, and we're looking at the next 150, so total time would be 200 minutes.\n\nWait, but radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? Which means the probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. It's memoryless. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the probability. Or does it?\n\nWait, the initial statement says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So maybe that's the half-life or something else. Or perhaps it's the probability of decaying in the first 100 minutes. Hmm. Let me think about decay probabilities.\n\nI remember that the decay probability (or the fraction remaining) can be modeled using the exponential decay formula. The formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant, and t is time. The probability that the atom hasn't decayed after time t is e^(-\u03bbt), so the probability it has decayed is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).\n\nWait, but wait. The given data is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So P(100) = 0.32. That would mean that 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.32. So e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68), so \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nLet me calculate that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) which is about -0.4055. So \u03bb is 0.4055/100 = 0.004055 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is, after 50 minutes have passed without decay, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, so the next 150 minutes is 150 minutes from now, which is t=50 to t=200. So the time elapsed since the start is 200 minutes. But since decay is memoryless, the probability from now is for the next 150 minutes.\n\nWait, no, the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, regardless of previous time.\n\nWait, but the initial condition is that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 100 minutes. So now, 50 minutes have passed, and it's still not decayed. So the total time is 50 minutes, and we're looking at the next 150, making 200 minutes since the start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes after the current time. So the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.\n\nBut wait, because the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period starting at the current time. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect this. So the probability is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nBut wait, let's compute that. We have \u03bb = 0.004055 per minute.\n\nSo \u03bb*150 = 0.004055 * 150 \u2248 0.60825.\n\ne^(-0.60825) \u2248 0.543. So 1 - 0.543 = 0.457, which is approximately 45.7%. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%. Hmm, 45.7% is close to 44 or 48. Maybe I should be more precise in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute ln(0.68) more accurately. Let's see, 0.68 is 68% of 1. So ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4054651. So \u03bb = 0.4054651 / 100 \u2248 0.004054651 per minute.\n\nThen, \u03bb * 150 = 0.004054651 * 150 = 0.6081977.\n\ne^(-0.6081977) is approximately 0.5431. So 1 - 0.5431 is 0.4569, or 45.69%. So about 45.7%, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. The closest is D)48% or A)44%.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is interpreted differently. Let me think again.\n\nThe given probability is 32% decay within 100 minutes. So that's P(100) = 0.32. So the decay constant \u03bb can be found from 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). So e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. So \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/(-100) \u2248 0.004054651.\n\nSo the decay probability in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Let's compute that more accurately.\n\nCalculating \u03bb * 150: 0.004054651 * 150 = 0.60819765.\n\nCompute e^-0.60819765. Let's compute that.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series for e^-x around x=0. Alternatively, use known values. Let me think: e^-0.6 is approximately 0.5488. e^-0.6082 is a little less than that. Let me compute e^-0.6082.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator:\n\n0.6082: natural exponent.\n\ne^-0.6 is about 0.5488.\n\n0.6082 is 0.0082 more than 0.6.\n\nSo using the approximation: e^-(a + b) = e^-a * e^-b.\n\nSo e^-0.6082 = e^-0.6 * e^-0.0082.\n\ne^-0.6 \u2248 0.5488.\n\ne^-0.0082 \u2248 1 - 0.0082 + (0.0082^2)/2 - ... \u2248 approximately 0.9918.\n\nSo 0.5488 * 0.9918 \u2248 0.5445.\n\nSo e^-0.6082 \u2248 0.5445.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5445 = 0.4555, about 45.55%. Hmm, that's about 45.5%, which is approximately 45.5%. The options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%. So 45.5% is closer to 44% (44.5% would be the midpoint between 44 and 46). But perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's compute the decay constant \u03bb correctly.\n\nGiven that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100).\n\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural logs: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68):\n\nWe know that ln(0.7) \u2248 -0.3567, ln(0.68) is a bit more negative. Let's compute it accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator: ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.4054651.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.4054651 / 100 = 0.004054651 per minute.\n\nNow, the next 150 minutes: time t is 150.\n\nSo P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t) = 1 - e^(-0.004054651 * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.60819765).\n\nCompute e^-0.60819765.\n\nUsing a calculator, e^-0.60819765 \u2248 0.543.\n\nSo P = 1 - 0.543 = 0.457, which is about 45.7%.\n\nBut the options don't have 45.7%. So perhaps I made a mistake in the question's interpretation. Maybe the question is about the total time being 250 minutes (100 + 150)? Wait, the question says 50 minutes have passed, and we're looking at the next 150. So 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, but considering that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the conditional probability is P(decay in 50 < t \u2264 200 | no decay in 0 < t \u226450).\n\nIn that case, the formula would be [P(decay by 200) - P(decay by 50)] / [1 - P(decay by 50)].\n\nWait, that's a better approach. Let me think.\n\nThe total probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes is P(200) - P(50), where P(t) is the probability of decay by time t.\n\nSo P(200) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200), P(50)=1 - e^(-\u03bb*50).\n\nThe conditional probability is [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)].\n\nSo let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, calculate \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb = 0.004054651 per minute.\n\nCompute P(50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*50).\n\n\u03bb*50 = 0.004054651 *50 = 0.20273255.\n\ne^-0.20273255 \u2248 0.8163.\n\nSo P(50)=1 - 0.8163 = 0.1837 or 18.37%.\n\nSimilarly, P(200)=1 - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\n\u03bb*200=0.004054651 *200=0.8109302.\n\ne^-0.8109302 \u2248 0.4449.\n\nSo P(200)=1 -0.4449=0.5551 or 55.51%.\n\nSo the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is P(200) - P(50) = 0.5551 -0.1837=0.3714 or 37.14%.\n\nThe denominator is 1 - P(50) = 1 - 0.1837=0.8163.\n\nSo the conditional probability is 0.3714 / 0.8163 \u2248 0.4547 or 45.47%.\n\nAgain, about 45.5%. But the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps the question is not considering the conditional probability. Or maybe I've made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, but the question says, \"the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So that's P(100)=0.32. So the initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the decay constant again. Let me double-check.\n\n\u03bb = (ln(1/(1-0.32)))/100 = ln(1/0.68)/100. ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588) \u2248 0.38566. So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566/100= 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake earlier? Because ln(0.68) is -0.4054651, so \u03bb would be 0.4054651/100= 0.004054651. But wait, another way: P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So for t=100, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). So e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68. So \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100. 1/0.68 is approximately 1.470588. ln(1.470588) is about 0.38566. So \u03bb=0.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, this contradicts my earlier calculation. So which is correct? Because I think I might have confused ln(0.68) with ln(1/0.68).\n\nWait, let's compute it correctly. Let me compute ln(0.68):\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4054651.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.4054651 / 100 = 0.004054651 per minute. That's correct.\n\nWait, but wait: when I compute e^(-\u03bb*100), it's e^(-0.4054651) = 0.68, which matches the given data. So my initial calculation of \u03bb was correct.\n\nSo going back, the conditional probability approach gives 45.5%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is asking for the probability in the next 150 minutes without considering the conditional probability, just the straight probability from t=0 to t=150. But that would be P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.004054651 *150).\n\nLet's compute that again: 0.004054651 *150 =0.60819765.\n\ne^-0.60819765 \u2248 0.543. So P(150) = 1 - 0.543 = 0.457, 45.7%.\n\nBut that's not matching any options. So perhaps the question is asking for the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Which is the conditional probability approach, which we found to be about 45.5%, which is also not an option.\n\nWait, the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%. Hmm. 45.5% is closest to 44% (A) or 48% (D). But neither is very close.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial calculation of the decay constant. Let me compute it again.\n\nGiven P(100) = 32% = 0.32.\n\nSo 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100).\n\nSo e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural log: -\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/(-100).\n\nln(0.68)= -0.4054651.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.4054651 / 100 = 0.004054651 per minute.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the options again. Maybe the question is considering the next 150 minutes after the initial 100. So the total time would be 250 minutes. So we can calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is from 100 to 250. So the conditional probability here would be [P(250) - P(100)] / [1 - P(100)].\n\nWait, but the question says that 50 minutes have passed, not 100. So this approach wouldn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, regardless of the previous 50. So it's the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, which is 45.7%. But again, the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 100 minutes' probability is given, but the question is about the next 150 minutes. So perhaps the calculation is to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in 50.\n\nWhich brings us back to the conditional probability approach, giving approximately 45.5%.\n\nBut that's not matching any options. So perhaps the problem is in the way the question is phrased. Let me read the question again.\n\nQuestion: We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\n\nSo, the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So the initial calculation of \u03bb is correct.\n\nNow, since 50 minutes have passed, the time elapsed is 50, and the next 150 minutes would make the total time 200 minutes.\n\nSo the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.\n\nWhich is P(200) - P(50).\n\nCompute P(50)=1 - e^(-0.004054651 *50) = 1 - e^(-0.20273255) \u2248 1 - 0.8163 \u2248 0.1837.\n\nP(200)=1 - e^(-0.004054651*200)=1 - e^(-0.8109302) \u2248 1 - 0.4449 \u2248 0.5551.\n\nSo the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is 0.5551 - 0.1837=0.3714, which is 37.14%.\n\nBut the denominator in the conditional probability is the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, which is 0.8163.\n\nSo the conditional probability is 0.3714 / 0.8163 \u2248 0.4547 or 45.47%, which is about 45.5%.\n\nBut the options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, not considering the 50 minutes. So it's the same as P(150)=45.7%. Again, not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model it using the half-life approach. Wait, the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So the half-life T1/2 is the time when half the atoms have decayed. But 32% decayed means 68% remain. So 0.68 = e^(-\u03bb T1/2).\n\nWait, but wait, the half-life formula is T1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb. So \u03bb = ln(2)/T1/2.\n\nAlternatively, since 0.68 = e^(-\u03bb *100), then T1/2 is ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nBut perhaps this approach isn't helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using a different approach. For example, the probability of decay in a certain time is given by the formula P = 1 - e^(-kt), where k is the decay constant.\n\nBut in this case, the given probability is 32% for 100 minutes, which we've already used to find k.\n\nSo the problem is, after 50 minutes without decay, what's the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. So it's the conditional probability between t=50 and t=200.\n\nWhich, as calculated, is approximately 45.5%. But none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the conditional probability.\n\nLet me recompute the numbers more accurately.\n\nCompute P(50):\n\n\u03bb=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nt=50: \u03bbt=0.20273255.\n\ne^-0.20273255:\n\ne^-0.2 \u2248 0.8187.\n\ne^-0.20273255: Let's compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing Taylor expansion around x=0.2:\n\nx=0.20273255.\n\ne^-x = e^-(0.2 + 0.00273255) = e^-0.2 * e^-0.00273255.\n\ne^-0.2 \u2248 0.818730753.\n\ne^-0.00273255 \u2248 1 - 0.00273255 + (0.00273255)^2/2 \u2248 approximately 0.997273.\n\nSo e^-x \u2248 0.818730753 * 0.997273 \u2248 0.8163.\n\nSo P(50) = 1 - 0.8163 = 0.1837.\n\nSimilarly, P(200)=1 - e^(-0.004054651 *200) = 1 - e^(-0.8109302).\n\nCompute e^-0.8109302.\n\nWe know that e^-0.8 is approximately 0.4493.\n\ne^-0.8109302 = e^-(0.8 + 0.0109302) = e^-0.8 * e^-0.0109302.\n\ne^-0.0109302 \u2248 1 - 0.0109302 + (0.0109302)^2/2 \u2248 0.9891.\n\nSo e^-0.8109302 \u2248 0.4493 * 0.9891 \u2248 0.4445.\n\nThus, P(200)=1-0.4445=0.5555.\n\nSo the difference is 0.5555 - 0.1837 = 0.3718.\n\nDenominator is 1 - 0.1837 = 0.8163.\n\n0.3718 / 0.8163 \u2248 0.4553, or 45.53%.\n\nStill, not matching any options.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Maybe the 32% is the probability per minute, which would be incorrect. No, the question states it's the probability within 100 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes without considering the 50 minutes already passed. So it's 150 minutes from now, which is 150 minutes. So P(150)=45.7%, but again, no option.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the options again. The closest to 45.5% is option D)48% and option A)44%. But neither is very close. Perhaps the calculation is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. So it's the same as the conditional probability.\n\nAnother approach: the conditional probability is (P(200) - P(50)) / (1 - P(50)).\n\nWe have P(50)=0.1837, P(200)=0.5555.\n\nSo 0.5555 -0.1837=0.3718.\n\nDivide by (1-0.1837)=0.8163.\n\n0.3718 /0.8163 \u2248 0.4553 or 45.53%.\n\nStill, same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial data was 32% decay within 100 minutes, so the decay constant is calculated as \u03bb = ln(2)/T_half, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability given is the cumulative probability, so it's 32% after 100 minutes, meaning that the decay constant is calculated using that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try calculating it as a half-life.\n\nThe half-life T is the time taken for the number of atoms to halve. So if 32% have decayed, that implies 68% remain, so 0.68 = e^(-\u03bb T).\n\nWait, no, because 32% decayed, so 68% remain. So e^(-\u03bb * T) = 0.68. So \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/(-T). But T here is 100 minutes.\n\nSo \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/(-100) = 0.004054651 per minute, which is what I had earlier.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not using the exponential decay model. Maybe it's using a linear probability model, which would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what the question expects.\n\nIf the probability is 32% in 100 minutes, then the probability per minute is 0.32/100=0.0032 per minute. So for 150 minutes, it's 0.0032 *150=0.48, 48%, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, that's a linear approach, which isn't correct for radioactive decay. Radioactive decay follows an exponential model, not a linear one. So using that approach would be wrong, but perhaps the question expects that.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be 48%, option D.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Because the correct approach is the exponential model. But perhaps the question is expecting the linear model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 32% is the decay constant per minute, so \u03bb=0.32/100=0.0032.\n\nThen, for 150 minutes, P=1 - e^(-0.0032*150)=1 - e^(-0.48) \u2248 1 - 0.619 = 0.381, 38.1%, which isn't any of the options.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 32% is the activity or something else. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The question states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that the atom decays in the first 100 minutes. The probability that it hasn't decayed after 100 minutes is 68%. So the decay constant \u03bb can be calculated as \u03bb = ln(2)/T_half, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the decay probability in time t is P(t)=1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So for t=100, P=0.32.\n\nSo, 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100)=0.32 \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb= -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 0.00405465 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is after 50 minutes, so 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is P=1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nBut wait, no. Because the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting now, regardless of the past.\n\nSo the probability is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) \u2248 45.7%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes after the initial 100. So the total time would be 250 minutes.\n\nWait, but the question says 50 minutes have passed. So 50 minutes, not 100.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased, and the 32% is the probability per 100 minutes. So the activity is 32% per 100 minutes. But that's not standard; decay probabilities are in the form of P(t)=1 - e^(-\u03bb t).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model, like the linear model. So if in 100 minutes, the probability is 32%, then per minute it's 0.32. So in 150 minutes, it's 0.32 * (150/100)=0.48, which is 48%, option D.\n\nBut that's incorrect for radioactive decay. So perhaps the intended answer is D)48%.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the conditional probability, which is 45.5%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D)48%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the problem.\n\nWait, let's compute the decay constant again. Given P(100)=32%.\n\nSo 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb=ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb= (ln(1/0.68))/100= ln(1.470588)/100 \u22480.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because ln(0.68)=\u22120.4054651, so \u03bb=0.4054651/100=0.004054651 per minute. So perhaps the initial calculation is correct.\n\nBut if I take \u03bb=0.0038566, then let's compute the probability for 150 minutes.\n\n\u03bb=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nt=150: \u03bbt=0.0038566 *150=0.57849.\n\ne^-0.57849\u22480.5618. So P=1-0.5618=0.4382 or 43.82%, which is about 44%, option A.\n\nBut how did I get two different values for \u03bb? Because in one approach, I took ln(0.68)=\u22120.4054651, leading to \u03bb=0.004054651 per minute. In another approach, I thought that \u03bb=ln(1.470588)/100=0.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute. But that's incorrect because ln(1/0.68)=ln(1.470588)=0.38566. So \u03bb=0.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me clarify:\n\nWe have 0.32=1-e^(-\u03bb*100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 take natural logs: -100\u03bb=ln(0.68)=\u22120.4054651 \u2192 100\u03bb=0.4054651 \u2192 \u03bb=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nSo the correct \u03bb is 0.004054651 per minute.\n\nSo, if I use this \u03bb, then for t=150 minutes, P=1 - e^(-0.004054651 *150)=1 - e^(-0.60819765)=0.457, 45.7%.\n\nBut this isn't an option. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the linear approximation, which would give 48%, option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended that the decay is 32% per 100 minutes, so the decay rate is 0.32 per 100 minutes, so 0.0032 per minute. Then, for 150 minutes, it's 0.0032 *150=0.48, 48%, option D.\n\nBut that's not the correct model, but perhaps the question expects that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 32% is the activity, which is \u03bbN, but that's more for the rate, not the probability.\n\nIn that case, the activity is \u03bbN=0.32 per 100 minutes, so \u03bb=0.32/(100N), but that's getting into more complex topics.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. The correct approach gives approximately 45.7%, but that's not an option. The options are 44%,40%,52%,48%.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation of \u03bb is different. Let me recheck.\n\nGiven P(t)=1 - e^(-\u03bb t) = 0.32 when t=100.\n\nSo, e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb=ln(0.68)=\u22120.4054651 \u2192 \u03bb=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nNow, the time after 50 minutes is 150 more minutes.\n\nSo, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P=1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) = 1 - e^(-0.60819765)=0.457.\n\nBut no option matches. So perhaps the question is considering the 50 minutes passed as part of the decay, and the next 150 would be up to 200 minutes. So the conditional probability is [P(200)\u2212P(50)]/[1\u2212P(50)].\n\nWait, let's compute this accurately.\n\nCompute P(50)=1 - e^(-0.004054651 *50)=1 - e^(-0.20273255)= 1 - 0.8163=0.1837.\n\nP(200)=1 - e^(-0.004054651 *200)=1 - e^(-0.8109302)=0.5551.\n\nSo the numerator is 0.5551\u22120.1837=0.3714.\n\nDenominator is 1\u22120.1837=0.8163.\n\n0.3714/0.8163=0.4547, 45.47%, which is approximately 45.5%.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, not considering the 50 minutes passed. So it's P=1 - e^(-\u03bb*150)=45.7%.\n\nBut again, no option matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150 minutes, and the decay probability is 32% for 100 minutes, so scaling it.\n\nSo, perhaps the probability for 150 minutes is (150/100)*32% = 48%, option D.\n\nBut that's a linear approach, which isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the probability decreases by 32% every 100 minutes, so after 50 minutes, half of that time, the probability would be 16% (32% * (50/100)), but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects to find the decay probability for 150 minutes using the same formula, but I must have made a calculation mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate \u03bb again.\n\n\u03bb= ln(1/(1-0.32))/100 = ln(1/0.68)/100= ln(1.470588)/100\u22480.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, that's a different value. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute e^(-\u03bb*100) with \u03bb=0.0038566.\n\ne^(-0.0038566 *100)=e^-0.38566\u22480.68. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo perhaps earlier I made a mistake in calculating \u03bb. So \u03bb=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, using this \u03bb, let's compute the probability for 150 minutes.\n\n\u03bb*150=0.0038566 *150=0.57849.\n\ne^-0.57849\u22480.5618.\n\nSo P=1-0.5618=0.4382, 43.82%, which is about 44%, option A.\n\nAh! Now that's option A.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating \u03bb. Because when I computed \u03bb as 0.004054651, I used ln(0.68), which is correct. But earlier I thought that ln(1/0.68)=0.38566, which is correct, but why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, no, because ln(1/0.68)=ln(1.470588)=0.38566.\n\nSo \u03bb=0.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nBut earlier I thought that ln(0.68)=\u22120.4054651, so \u03bb=0.4054651/100=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nWait, these are two different values for \u03bb. Which is correct?\n\nWait, 0.38566 is ln(1.470588)=0.38566.\n\nAnd ln(0.68)=\u22120.4054651.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nBecause P(t)=1 - e^(-\u03bb t)=0.32.\n\nSo, e^(-\u03bb t)=0.68.\n\nTake natural logs: -\u03bb t= ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb= (ln(0.68))/(-t) \u2192 t=100.\n\nSo \u03bb= (ln(0.68))/(-100)= (\u22120.4054651)/(-100)=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, but why does ln(1/0.68)=ln(1.470588)=0.38566? Because ln(1/0.68)=ln(1.470588)=0.38566.\n\nBut that would be \u03bb=0.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because substituting \u03bb=0.0038566 per minute into e^(-\u03bb*100)=e^-0.38566\u22480.68, which is correct.\n\nBut when I compute \u03bb=0.004054651 per minute, e^(-0.004054651 *100)=e^-0.4054651\u22480.68, which is also correct.\n\nWait a minute, that's impossible. Because 0.38566 is not equal to 0.4054651. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, no, let me clarify:\n\nIf P(t)=1 - e^(-\u03bb t), and P(100)=0.32,\n\nthen e^(-\u03bb*100)=0.68 \u2192 -\u03bb*100=ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb= (ln(0.68))/(-100)= (\u22120.4054651)/(-100)=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut when I compute ln(1/0.68)=ln(1.470588)=0.38566.\n\nSo, \u03bb= (ln(1/0.68))/100=0.38566/100=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, but that's a different value. So which is correct?\n\nBecause e^(-\u03bb t)=0.68 \u2192 ln(0.68)= -\u03bb t \u2192 \u03bb= (\u2212ln(0.68))/t.\n\nSo, with t=100, \u03bb= (0.4054651)/100=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo earlier mistake: when I thought \u03bb=0.0038566, that's incorrect. The correct \u03bb is 0.004054651 per minute.\n\nSo, with \u03bb=0.004054651 per minute, let's compute the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)=1 - e^(-0.60819765)=0.457, 45.7%.\n\nBut that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D)48%, assuming a linear model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done as follows:\n\nThe probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period, which is 32% * (150/100) = 48%, option D.\n\nBut that's incorrect because the decay probability isn't linear with time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes after the initial 50 minutes. So the total time is 200 minutes.\n\nSo the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200) =1 - e^(-0.8109302)=0.5551. But that's the probability by 200 minutes, not the next 150.\n\nBut the question is about the next 150 minutes, which is the same as the conditional probability we calculated earlier, 45.5%, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The correct calculation leads to approximately 45.5%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is D)48%, assuming a linear approach.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial probability is 32% in 100 minutes, so the decay constant \u03bb is 0.32/100=0.0032 per minute. Then, for 150 minutes, the probability is 0.0032*150=0.48, 48%, option D.\n\nBut again, that's a linear approach, which is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the conditional probability approach.\n\nWait, the conditional probability is [P(200)\u2212P(50)]/[1\u2212P(50)].\n\nCompute P(200)=1\u2212e^(-0.004054651 *200)=1\u2212e^(-0.8109302)=0.5551.\n\nP(50)=0.1837.\n\nSo [0.5551\u22120.1837]=0.3714.\n\nDenominator: 1\u22120.1837=0.8163.\n\n0.3714/0.8163=0.4547, 45.47%.\n\nSo 45.5% is the correct answer, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option D)48%, assuming the question expects a linear model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of half-life.\n\nGiven P(100)=32%, so 68% remain. The half-life T is the time when 50% remain.\n\nSo 0.5 = e^(-\u03bb T) \u2192 ln(0.5)=\u2212\u03bb T \u2192 T= ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nWe have \u03bb=0.004054651 per minute.\n\nSo T=0.6931 /0.004054651 \u2248 170.9 minutes.\n\nSo half-life is approximately 171 minutes.\n\nNow, the time elapsed is 50 minutes, so the remaining time is 150 minutes.\n\nSo the fraction remaining after 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *50)=e^(-0.20273255)=0.8163.\n\nThe fraction remaining after 50+150=200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *200)=e^(-0.8109302)=0.4449.\n\nSo the fraction that decays between 50 and 200 minutes is 0.8163 - 0.4449=0.3714.\n\nSo the conditional probability is 0.3714 / (1 - 0.1837)=0.3714/0.8163\u22480.4547.\n\nAgain, 45.47%.\n\nSo I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 45.5%, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option D)48%, but I'm not sure why.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes, without considering the 50 minutes already passed. So it's 150 minutes, P=45.7%, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays within the next 150 minutes after the initial 100. So the total time is 250 minutes.\n\nSo P(250)=1 - e^(-\u03bb*250)=1 - e^(-0.004054651 *250)=1 - e^(-1.01366275)=1 - 0.3635=0.6365 or 63.65%.\n\nBut that's not relevant to the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply expecting us to find the decay probability in 150 minutes, which is 45.7%, and the closest option is D)48%.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D)48%.\n\nBut I'm not certain. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is D)48%.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the probability that a radioactive atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay probability is modeled using the exponential decay formula:\n\n\\[\nP(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant. The problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes, which allows us to calculate \\( \\lambda \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nWe have an atom that's supposed to decay, and the probability of it decaying within 100 minutes is 32%. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, we want to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, the next 150 minutes after what? Oh, I think it's the next 150 minutes from the current time, which is 50 minutes into the 100-minute period. Wait, no, the question says it's been 50 minutes since we started monitoring. So the total time we're considering for decay is 100 minutes, but 50 have already passed. So the remaining time would be 50 minutes. Oh wait, but the question says \"the next 150 minutes\"\u2014wait, that doesn't make sense because the total half-life or decay period is 100 minutes. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the initial 32% is the probability of decay within 100 minutes. So if the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the chance it will decay in the next 150? Hmm, that doesn't fit because 50 plus 150 is 200, which is longer than the initial 100-minute period. Or perhaps the 100 minutes is the half-life? Or maybe it's the mean lifetime.\n\nWait, no. The decay probability given is 32% within 100 minutes. So that must be the probability that the atom decays at any time up to 100 minutes. So the decay follows an exponential law, right? Because radioactive decay is a Poisson process, the probability of decay is memoryless.\n\nSo the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is given by the exponential decay formula. The survival probability S(t) = e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant.\n\nGiven that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, that means the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68% (since 100% - 32% = 68%). So S(100) = 0.68 = e^(-\u03bb * 100). Taking the natural logarithm on both sides, ln(0.68) = -\u03bb * 100. So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCalculating that, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) which is about -0.4055. So \u03bb \u2248 0.4055 / 100 \u2248 0.004055 per minute.\n\nNow, the question says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? Wait, wait. The next 150 minutes from when? From the start or from the current time? Since the initial monitoring was started 50 minutes ago, I think the next 150 minutes would be from the current time, making the total time up to 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the given probability is for 100 minutes. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the next 150 minutes from the start, which would be 100 + 50 = 150? That doesn't make sense. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the decay probability of 32% is the probability that the atom decays within the first 100 minutes after it's created. So when we start monitoring, it's at t=0. Time t=50, it hasn't decayed. Now, we want to find the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=50+150 = t=200. But wait, the initial 32% is up to t=100. So perhaps the decay probability is modeled as a fixed time window. Or perhaps I should model it as a half-life scenario, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so the decay follows an exponential distribution with a certain \u03bb. Since the process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next t minutes, regardless of how much time has already passed, depends only on t. Wait, but that's not correct because the exponential distribution models the time until the first decay, and the probability is the same regardless of the time passed. But in this question, the initial 32% is given for 100 minutes, so perhaps it's a different model.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this using the survival function. The probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is S(t) = e^(-\u03bb t). The probability that it decays by time t is 1 - S(t) = 32% at t=100. So 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.32 \u2192 e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68. So \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100 \u2248 (ln(1.47)) /100 \u2192 ln(1.47) is about 0.382, so \u03bb\u2248 0.00382 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is, given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, the next 150 minutes after t=50 would take us to t=200. So the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200 is S(50) [the probability it hasn't decayed by 50] multiplied by (1 - S(150))? Because the probability it decays between 50 and 200 is the probability it hasn't decayed by 50 (S(50)) times the probability it decays within the next 150 minutes from t=50.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because the total time is from t=50 to t=200. So the probability that it decays during that interval is S(50) * (1 - S(150)). Because S(50) is the probability it hasn't decayed yet, and (1 - S(150)) is the probability it decays within the next 150 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the remaining time as 150 minutes from t=50. So the probability is (1 - S(150)), but wait, that's not correct because S(150) is the survival after 150 minutes, but from t=0. So the time from t=50 to t=200 is 150 minutes, so the survival up to t=200 is S(200) = e^(-\u03bb * 200). So the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200 is S(50) * (1 - S(150)) ? Or wait, no: the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is the probability that it decays after 50 but before 200. So that's S(50) * (1 - S(150)).\n\nWait, no, S(50) is the survival up to 50, then the decay probability from 50 to 200 is the integral from 50 to 200 of \u03bb e^(-\u03bb t) dt. Which equals e^(-\u03bb *50) [1 - e^(-\u03bb (200-50)) ] = S(50) * (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)).\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute \u03bb. We have \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100 \u2248 (0.382)/100 \u2248 0.00382 per minute.\n\nCompute S(50) = e^(-\u03bb *50) = e^(-0.00382 *50) = e^(-0.191) \u2248 0.826.\n\nNow, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is S(50) * (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)).\n\nCompute \u03bb*150 = 0.00382 *150 \u2248 0.573.\n\ne^(-0.573) \u2248 0.564.\n\nSo 1 - 0.564 = 0.436.\n\nMultiply by S(50)=0.826: 0.826 * 0.436 \u2248 0.3598, which is about 35.98% or approximately 36%. Hmm, but none of the options are around 36%. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes from the start, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. So the total time considered is 50 +150 = 200 minutes, but the initial probability was for 100 minutes. Hmm, but that would complicate things. Or perhaps I should think in terms of conditional probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes from the current time, which is 50 minutes after the start. So the time from now is 150 minutes, making the total time 200 minutes. So the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 32% is the decay probability within 100 minutes, so the decay constant \u03bb is as computed, but since the process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes from the current time (t=50) is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, regardless of past time. So that would be 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, but that would be the case if the process is memoryless. Because the probability of decay in the next t minutes is always 1 - e^(-\u03bb t), regardless of when you start. So if we compute that, perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nWe have \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100 \u2248 0.00382 per minute.\n\nThen, the probability to decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) = 1 - e^(-0.00382 * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.573) \u2248 1 - 0.564 = 0.436 \u2192 43.6%. Hmm, the options don't have 44%, but option A is 44%, which is close. But wait, perhaps I'm being approximate, so perhaps 44% is the intended answer.\n\nWait, but let me recheck the \u03bb calculation. Let's compute ln(1/0.68) more accurately.\n\nln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. So \u03bb = 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nThen, \u03bb*150 = 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.\n\ne^(-0.57849) \u2248 Let me compute that. e^(-0.578) is approximately 0.562.\n\nSo 1 - 0.562 = 0.438 \u2192 43.8%. So about 44%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because the initial 32% is the probability of decay within 100 minutes. So the conditional probability given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes would be the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, which we calculated earlier as approximately 36%. But that's not matching any of the options.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the question.\n\nQuestion: So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\n\nWait, the next 150 minutes from the current time (t=50), making the end time t=50+150=200. So the decay could happen at any time between 50 and 200. So the probability is the integral from t=50 to t=200 of the decay probability density function.\n\nThe decay probability between t=a and t=b is S(a) * (1 - S(b - a))? Or wait, no. Let me think.\n\nThe survival function S(t) = e^(-\u03bb t). The probability of decay between a and b is S(a) * (1 - S(b - a))? No, that's not right. The correct expression is S(a) * (1 - S(b - a))? Wait, no, the correct way is:\n\nThe probability of decay between a and b is the integral from a to b of \u03bb e^(-\u03bb t) dt. Which is e^(-\u03bb a) - e^(-\u03bb b).\n\nSo, that would be S(a) - S(b).\n\nSo in this case, a=50, b=200. So the probability is S(50) - S(200) = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nCompute this:\n\n\u03bb is 0.0038566 per minute.\n\n\u03bb *50 = 0.19283 \u2192 e^(-0.19283) \u2248 0.825.\n\n\u03bb *200 = 0.77132 \u2192 e^(-0.77132) \u2248 0.463.\n\nSo the probability is 0.825 - 0.463 = 0.362 \u2192 36.2%.\n\nHmm, that's about 36%, but the options don't have that. So this suggests that perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not using the exponential decay model but a different model. Because the 32% is the probability in 100 minutes, so perhaps it's a fixed probability per time, not an exponential. But that's unlikely because radioactive decay is exponential.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the probability that the atom decays within the next 150 minutes from the start, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. So the time frame is 0 to 200 minutes, but given that it hasn't decayed in 0-50, what is the chance it decays in 0-200.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if it decays in 0-50, it wouldn't be in the given condition. So the correct approach is conditional probability.\n\nThe probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between 50 and 200) given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nSo using conditional probability, the formula is P(A and B) / P(B), where A is decay between 50-200, and B is not decaying in 0-50.\n\nWait, but in this case, we're given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, so we're looking for the probability that it decays between 50 and 200, which is the same as P(decay between 50-200 | not decayed by 50).\n\nWhich is [P(not decayed by 50) * P(decay between 50-200 | not decayed by 50)] / P(not decayed by 50). Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Because the conditional probability is P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But in this case, A is decay between 50-200, and B is not decayed by 50. But if it decays between 50-200, it implies that it hasn't decayed by 50. So P(A and B) is just P(A), which is the same as P(A | B) * P(B). Therefore, P(A | B) = P(A) / P(B).\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again. The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is the same as the probability that it decays after 50 and before 200. Since it didn't decay before 50, the probability is the same as the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. Which, because of the memoryless property, is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from now, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, because the exponential distribution is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability it will decay in the next 150 is the same as if you just started watching. So the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \u2248 43.6%, which is approximately 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, according to my earlier calculation, that's 43.6%, which rounds to 44%. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated the probability between 50 and 200 as 36%, which didn't match any option. So I think I'm getting confused between two different approaches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 32% is the probability of decay within 100 minutes, so the decay constant \u03bb is such that 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.32. So \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes from the current time (t=50) is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \u2248 43.6%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the initial question says, \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\" So that would be 43.6%, which is approximately 44%, so option A.\n\nBut let me check the options again:\n\nA) 44%\nB)40%\nC)52%\nD)48%\n\nSo 44% is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach. For example, perhaps the decay follows a uniform probability distribution, but that's not the case for radioactive decay. But if I assume that the decay is uniform, then the probability would be (150/100) * 32% = 48%, which is option D. But that's not correct because radioactive decay isn't uniform; it's exponential.\n\nSo the correct answer should be A, 44%. But wait, why isn't it 36% as per the earlier calculation? Oh, because the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is always 1 - e^(-\u03bb t), regardless of previous time. So when we're at t=50, the chance of decaying in the next 150 is the same as if we just started. So it's 43.6%, which rounds to 44%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.\n\nWe have an atom that's supposed to decay, and the probability of it decaying within 100 minutes is 32%. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, we want to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, the next 150 minutes after what? Oh, I think it's the next 150 minutes from the current time, which is 50 minutes into the 100-minute period. Wait, no, the question says it's been 50 minutes since we started monitoring. So the total time we're considering for decay is 100 minutes, but 50 have already passed. So the remaining time would be 50 minutes. Oh wait, but the question says \"the next 150 minutes\"\u2014wait, that doesn't make sense because the total half-life or decay period is 100 minutes. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the initial 32% is the probability of decay within 100 minutes. So if the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the chance it will decay in the next 150? Hmm, that doesn't fit because 50 plus 150 is 200, which is longer than the initial 100-minute period. Or perhaps the 100 minutes is the half-life? Or maybe it's the mean lifetime.\n\nWait, no. The decay probability given is 32% within 100 minutes. So that must be the probability that the atom decays at any time up to 100 minutes. So the decay follows an exponential law, right? Because radioactive decay is a Poisson process, the probability of decay is memoryless.\n\nSo the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is given by the exponential decay formula. The survival probability S(t) = e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant.\n\nGiven that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, that means the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68% (since 100% - 32% = 68%). So S(100) = 0.68 = e^(-\u03bb * 100). Taking the natural logarithm on both sides, ln(0.68) = -\u03bb * 100. So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCalculating that, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) which is about -0.4055. So \u03bb \u2248 0.4055 / 100 \u2248 0.004055 per minute.\n\nNow, the question says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? Wait, wait. The next 150 minutes from when? From the start or from the current time? Since the initial monitoring was started 50 minutes ago, I think the next 150 minutes would be from the current time, making the total time up to 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the given probability is for 100 minutes. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the next 150 minutes from the start, which would be 100 + 50 = 150? That doesn't make sense. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the decay probability of 32% is the probability that the atom decays within the first 100 minutes after it's created. So when we start monitoring, it's at t=0. Time t=50, it hasn't decayed. Now, we want to find the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=50+150 = t=200. But wait, the initial 32% is up to t=100. So perhaps the decay probability is modeled as a fixed time window. Or perhaps I should model it as a half-life scenario, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so the decay follows an exponential distribution with a certain \u03bb. Since the process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next t minutes, regardless of how much time has already passed, depends only on t. Wait, but that's not correct because the exponential distribution models the time until the first decay, and the probability is the same regardless of the time passed. But in this question, the initial 32% is given for 100 minutes, so perhaps it's a different model.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this using the survival function. The probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is S(t) = e^(-\u03bb t). The probability that it decays by time t is 1 - S(t) = 32% at t=100. So 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.32 \u2192 e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68. So \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100 \u2248 (ln(1.47)) /100 \u2192 ln(1.47) is about 0.382, so \u03bb\u2248 0.00382 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is, given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, the next 150 minutes after t=50 would take us to t=200. So the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200 is S(50) [the probability it hasn't decayed by 50] multiplied by (1 - S(150))? Because the probability it decays between 50 and 200 is the probability it hasn't decayed by 50 (S(50)) times the probability it decays within the next 150 minutes from t=50.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because the total time is from t=50 to t=200. So the probability that it decays during that interval is S(50) * (1 - S(150)). Because S(50) is the probability it hasn't decayed yet, and (1 - S(150)) is the probability it decays within the next 150 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the remaining time as 150 minutes from t=50. So the probability is (1 - S(150)), but wait, that's not correct because S(150) is the survival after 150 minutes, but from t=0. So the time from t=50 to t=200 is 150 minutes, so the survival up to t=200 is S(200) = e^(-\u03bb * 200). So the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200 is S(50) * (1 - S(150)) ? Or wait, no: the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is the probability that it decays after 50 but before 200. So that's S(50) * (1 - S(150)).\n\nWait, no, S(50) is the survival up to 50, then the decay probability from 50 to 200 is the integral from 50 to 200 of \u03bb e^(-\u03bb t) dt. Which equals e^(-\u03bb *50) [1 - e^(-\u03bb (200-50)) ] = S(50) * (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)).\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute \u03bb. We have \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100 \u2248 (0.382)/100 \u2248 0.00382 per minute.\n\nCompute S(50) = e^(-\u03bb *50) = e^(-0.00382 *50) = e^(-0.191) \u2248 0.826.\n\nNow, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 is S(50) * (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)).\n\nCompute \u03bb*150 = 0.00382 *150 \u2248 0.573.\n\ne^(-0.573) \u2248 0.564.\n\nSo 1 - 0.564 = 0.436.\n\nMultiply by S(50)=0.826: 0.826 * 0.436 \u2248 0.3598, which is about 35.98% or approximately 36%.

So about 44%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because the initial 32% is the probability of decay within 100 minutes.

So the time frame is 0 to 200 minutes, but given that it hasn't decayed in 0-50, what is the chance it decays in 0-200.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if it decays in 0-50, it wouldn't be in the given condition. So the correct approach is conditional probability.\n\nThe probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between 50 and 200) given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nSo using conditional probability, the formula is P(A and B) / P(B), where A is decay between 50-200, and B is not decaying in 0-50.\n\nWait, but in this case, we're given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, so we're looking for the probability that it decays between 50 and 200, which is the same as P(decay between 50-200 | not decayed by 50).\n\nWhich is [P(not decayed by 50) * P(decay between 50-200 | not decayed by 50)] / P(not decayed by 50). Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Because the conditional probability is P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But in this case, A is decay between 50-200, and B is not decayed by 50. But if it decays between 50-200, it implies that it hasn't decayed by 50. So P(A and B) is just P(A), which is the same as P(A | B) * P(B). Therefore, P(A | B) = P(A) / P(B).\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again. The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is the same as the probability that it decays after 50 and before 200. Since it didn't decay before 50, the probability is the same as the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. Which, because of the memoryless property, is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from now, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, because the exponential distribution is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability it will decay in the next 150 is the same as if you just started watching. So the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \u2248 43.6%, which is approximately 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, according to my earlier calculation, that's 43.6%, which rounds to 44%. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated the probability between 50 and 200 as 36%, which didn't match any option. So I think I'm getting confused between two different approaches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 32% is the probability of decay within 100 minutes, so the decay constant \u03bb is such that 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.32. So \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes from the current time (t=50) is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \u2248 43.6%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the initial question says, \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\" So that would be 43.6%, which is approximately 44%, so option A.\n\nBut let me check the options again:\n\nA) 44%\nB)40%\nC)52%\nD)48%\n\nSo 44% is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach. For example, perhaps the decay follows a uniform probability distribution, but that's not the case for radioactive decay. But if I assume that the decay is uniform, then the probability would be (150/100) * 32% = 48%, which is option D. But that's not correct because radioactive decay isn't uniform; it's exponential.\n\nSo the correct answer should be A, 44%. But wait, why isn't it 36% as per the earlier calculation? Oh, because the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is always 1 - e^(-\u03bb t), regardless of previous time. So when we're at t=50, the chance of decaying in the next 150 is the same as if we just started. So it's 43.6%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process using the exponential decay model. The probability of an atom decaying within a given time follows an exponential distribution, which is memoryless. This means the probability of decay in the next \\( t \\) minutes depends only on \\( t \\), not on how much time has already passed.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so the survival probability after 100 minutes is \\( S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68 \\).\n2. The survival probability at time \\( t \\) is given by \\( S(t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant.\n3. From \\( S(100) = 0.68 \\), we calculate \\( \\lambda \\):\n   \\[\n   \\lambda = \\frac{-\\ln(0.68)}{100} \\approx \\frac{-\\ln(0.68)}{100} \\approx 0.0038566 \\, \\text{per minute}.\n   \\]\n\n### Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes:\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed and the atom has not decayed.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let me think it through. So the question is about the probability of an atom decaying after some time has passed.\n\nAlright, the setup: We have an atom that has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, in 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it will decay. Now, 50 minutes have already passed and it hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, is that 150 minutes from the start or from now? Oh, right, the way it's phrased, it's the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.\n\nWait no, no. Because the decay process is about the time elapsed since it was created. Radioactive decay is a memoryless process, right? So the probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. It only depends on the remaining time.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me get this straight. The initial statement says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that it decays before 100 minutes. Now, after 50 minutes, it's still not decayed. So what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes from that point? Or is it the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes total?\n\nWait, no, the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So from time 50 to 200, which is 150 minutes. So the question is, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but radioactive decay works with the concept of half-life, but also the decay probability is modeled by an exponential distribution. So the decay probability in a time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so 0.32. So that gives us the value of \u03bb.\n\nLet me find \u03bb. So P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So for t=100 minutes, P=0.32.\n\nSo 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100)\n\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural logs: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68)\n\n\u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nLet me compute that. Ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566 (since ln(0.7) is about -0.35667, and 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so the ln is more negative). So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is: given that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Since the decay process is memoryless, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the probability for the remaining time. So the probability it decays in the next t minutes is the same as the probability it hasn't decayed in the first 50, but then decays in the next 150. Alternatively, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it hasn't decayed yet (after 50 minutes) multiplied by the probability it decays in the next 150.\n\nWait, no. The memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So the probability after t minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any subsequent t minutes, regardless of how much time has already elapsed.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose I have an atom that hasn't decayed for 50 minutes. The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as if it were a new atom, but with the time being 150 minutes. No, wait, no. Because the decay process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next t minutes is the same as the initial probability of decaying in t minutes, regardless of how much time has passed.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the decay process depends on the time that remains. So the probability that it decays between t and t + \u0394t is proportional to \u0394t, given the current time t.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a conditional probability. Let me denote T as the time the atom takes to decay. T is a random variable with an exponential distribution. The probability that T is less than or equal to 100 is 32%, so P(T \u2264 100) = 0.32.\n\nWe want to find P(T \u2264 50 + 150 | T > 50), which is P(T \u2264 200 | T > 50). Alternatively, this is equal to P(50 < T \u2264 200) / P(T > 50).\n\nSince for an exponential distribution, the memoryless property says that P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s). So in this case, P(T > 200 | T >50) = P(T >150). Therefore, P(T \u2264200 | T>50) = 1 - P(T>150).\n\nWait, let me re-express this. The probability that the atom decays within the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes (so within 200 minutes since the start) given that it hasn't decayed yet is equal to the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes regardless of the previous time.\n\nWait, no, because after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150. So the conditional probability is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from now, which for an exponential distribution is P(T \u2264150). Because the memoryless property says that P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s). So P(T \u2264 t + s | T > t) = 1 - P(T > t + s | T > t) ) = 1 - P(T > s) = P(T \u2264 s).\n\nWait, so the conditional probability that T is less than t + s given that T is greater than t is equal to the probability that T is less than s. So in this case, s is 150 minutes, so the probability is P(T \u2264150). But wait, wait, the problem is to find the probability that T is less than or equal to 200 minutes given that T is greater than 50 minutes. So that's equal to P(T \u2264200 and T>50) / P(T>50) ) = [P(T \u2264200) - P(T \u226450)] / [1 - P(T \u226450)].\n\nBut since the decay is memoryless, perhaps we can find a simpler way. Alternatively, since the decay is exponential, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(T \u2264150). So the same as if we had just started. But wait, no, because the time that has passed is 50 minutes. So after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150, but the decay probability in that 150 is the same as for any 150-minute interval starting now.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-express this. The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, is the same as the probability that it decays in any 150-minute interval starting from the 50-minute mark. Because of the memoryless property, the probability only depends on the time remaining. So the probability is P(T \u2264150). Wait, no, because the exponential distribution's CDF is P(T \u2264 t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is P(T \u2264150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nBut wait, no, that's the probability that it decays within 150 minutes from the start. But in our case, 50 minutes have already passed, and it hasn't decayed. So the remaining time is 150 minutes. So the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in any 150-minute interval, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, but earlier we found \u03bb from the given 32% decay in 100 minutes. So \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/100, as I computed earlier.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when t=100, P=0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). So e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68. So \u03bb = ln(1/0.68)/100 = ln(1.470586)/100 \u2248 0.38566/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo the decay probability in 150 minutes would be P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute \u03bb*150 = 0.0038566 *150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) \u2248 e^-0.578. Hmm, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.578 is between them. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator approximation: ln(2)=0.6931, but that's not needed here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute e^(-0.57849) as follows. Let's see:\n\nWe know that ln(0.56) \u2248 -0.5798. Because ln(0.5) is -0.6931, ln(0.56) is about -0.5798. Oh wait, that's close to 0.57849. So e^-0.57849 \u2248 0.56.\n\nWait, but let me be more precise. Let me compute 0.57849:\n\nCompute e^-0.57849.\n\nWe can write 0.57849 \u2248 0.5785.\n\nSo e^(-0.5785) \u2248 ?\n\nI think using a Taylor expansion around x=0.5785.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using known values. Let me think: e^-0.5 \u2248 0.6065; e^-0.6 \u2248 0.5488.\n\nAt x=0.5785, which is 0.5785, between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me compute the linear approximation between these two points.\n\nAt x=0.5: e^-x = 0.6065.\n\nAt x=0.6: 0.5488.\n\nThe difference in x is 0.1, and the difference in e^-x is 0.5488 - 0.6065 = -0.0577.\n\nSo for x=0.5785, which is 0.0785 above 0.5.\n\nSo delta x is 0.0785.\n\nThe slope between 0.5 and 0.6 is (-0.0577)/0.1 = -0.577 per 0.1 x.\n\nSo for delta x of 0.0785, the change in e^-x is approximately (-0.577) * 0.0785 \u2248 -0.0454.\n\nSo e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.6065 - 0.0454 \u2248 0.5611.\n\nBut wait, that's a rough approximation. Let me check with a calculator function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for \u03bb=0.0038566 per minute, t=150.\n\n\u03bb*t = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.\n\ne^-0.57849 \u2248 0.56.\n\nSo 1 - e^-0.57849 \u2248 0.44.\n\nSo 44% probability. So the answer would be option A) 44%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me confirm. Because the initial 50 minutes haven't decayed, but for the next 150 minutes, the probability is 44%? But the initial probability was 32% for 100 minutes. So 44% is higher, which makes sense because 150 minutes is longer than 100. So the probability should be higher than 32%, which 44% is.\n\nSo the correct answer is A) 44%.\n",

So for t=100 minutes, P=0.32.\n\nSo 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100)\n\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural logs: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68)\n\n\u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nLet me compute that. Ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566 (since ln(0.7) is about -0.35667, and 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so the ln is more negative).

So the conditional probability is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from now, which for an exponential distribution is P(T \u2264150). Because the memoryless property says that P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s). So P(T \u2264 t + s | T > t) = 1 - P(T > t + s | T > t) ) = 1 - P(T > s) = P(T \u2264 s).\n\nWait, so the conditional probability that T is less than t + s given that T is greater than t is equal to the probability that T is less than s. So in this case, s is 150 minutes, so the probability is P(T \u2264150). But wait, wait, the problem is to find the probability that T is less than or equal to 200 minutes given that T is greater than 50 minutes. So that's equal to P(T \u2264200 and T>50) / P(T>50) ) = [P(T \u2264200) - P(T \u226450)] / [1 - P(T \u226450)].\n\nBut since the decay is memoryless, perhaps we can find a simpler way. Alternatively, since the decay is exponential, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(T \u2264150). So the same as if we had just started. But wait, no, because the time that has passed is 50 minutes. So after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150, but the decay probability in that 150 is the same as for any 150-minute interval starting now.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-express this. The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, is the same as the probability that it decays in any 150-minute interval starting from the 50-minute mark. Because of the memoryless property, the probability only depends on the time remaining. So the probability is P(T \u2264150). Wait, no, because the exponential distribution's CDF is P(T \u2264 t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is P(T \u2264150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nBut wait, no, that's the probability that it decays within 150 minutes from the start. But in our case, 50 minutes have already passed, and it hasn't decayed. So the remaining time is 150 minutes. So the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in any 150-minute interval, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, but earlier we found \u03bb from the given 32% decay in 100 minutes. So \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/100, as I computed earlier.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when t=100, P=0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). So e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68. So \u03bb = ln(1/0.68)/100 = ln(1.470586)/100 \u2248 0.38566/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo the decay probability in 150 minutes would be P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute \u03bb*150 = 0.0038566 *150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) \u2248 e^-0.578. Hmm, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.578 is between them. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator approximation: ln(2)=0.6931, but that's not needed here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute e^(-0.57849) as follows. Let's see:\n\nWe know that ln(0.56) \u2248 -0.5798. Because ln(0.5) is -0.6931, ln(0.56) is about -0.5798. Oh wait, that's close to 0.57849. So e^-0.57849 \u2248 0.56.\n\nWait, but let me be more precise. Let me compute 0.57849:\n\nCompute e^-0.57849.\n\nWe can write 0.57849 \u2248 0.5785.\n\nSo e^(-0.5785) \u2248 ?\n\nI think using a Taylor expansion around x=0.5785.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using known values. Let me think: e^-0.5 \u2248 0.6065; e^-0.6 \u2248 0.5488.\n\nAt x=0.5785, which is 0.5785, between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me compute the linear approximation between these two points.\n\nAt x=0.5: e^-x = 0.6065.\n\nAt x=0.6: 0.5488.\n\nThe difference in x is 0.1, and the difference in e^-x is 0.5488 - 0.6065 = -0.0577.\n\nSo for x=0.5785, which is 0.0785 above 0.5.\n\nSo delta x is 0.0785.\n\nThe slope between 0.5 and 0.6 is (-0.0577)/0.1 = -0.577 per 0.1 x.\n\nSo for delta x of 0.0785, the change in e^-x is approximately (-0.577) * 0.0785 \u2248 -0.0454.\n\nSo e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.6065 - 0.0454 \u2248 0.5611.\n\nBut wait, that's a rough approximation. Let me check with a calculator function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for \u03bb=0.0038566 per minute, t=150.\n\n\u03bb*t = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.\n\ne^-0.57849 \u2248 0.56.\n\nSo 1 - e^-0.57849 \u2248 0.44.\n\nSo 44% probability. So the answer would be option A) 44%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me confirm. Because the initial 50 minutes haven't decayed, but for the next 150 minutes, the probability is 44%? But the initial probability was 32% for 100 minutes. So 44% is higher, which makes sense because 150 minutes is longer than 100. So the probability should be higher than 32%, which 44% is.\n\nSo the correct answer is A) 44%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential distribution. The decay probability within a time \\( t \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \\( P(100) = 0.32 \\). Using this, we can calculate \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[\n0.32 = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100}\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\ne^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.68\n\\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\n-\\lambda \\cdot 100 = \\ln(0.68)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.38566 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.38566}{100} \\approx 0.0038566 \\, \\text{per minute}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the remaining time, not the time already elapsed. Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.0038566 \\) and \\( t = 150 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.57849\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-0.57849}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( e^{-0.57849} \\approx 0.56 \\):\n\n\\[\nP(150) \\approx 1 - 0.56 = 0.44\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%. This matches option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the exact concepts, but let me try to think it through. So, the question is about the probability that a particular atom will decay within the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time.\n\nThe problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Hmm, wait, so if we have a group of these atoms, 32% of them would decay in 100 minutes. But here we're dealing with a single atom, so the probability for each individual atom is the same. I think the key here is understanding that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, meaning the probability of decay is constant over time intervals, regardless of how much time has already passed.\n\nSo, the general formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), where N(t) is the number remaining after time t, N0 is the initial number, \u03bb is the decay constant, and t is time. But since we're dealing with probabilities, maybe it's better to think in terms of the probability of decay.\n\nWait, the probability that a nucleus decays in time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So, the given 32% is the probability that it decays within 100 minutes. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). Let me solve for \u03bb first.\n\nRearranging, e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, ln(0.68) = -100\u03bb. So, \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that. Ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So, the time left is 150 minutes, but the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since decay is memoryless, the probability from the current time onwards is the same as starting fresh. So, the time we need to consider for the decay is 150 minutes from now.\n\nWait, no, the 32% is given for 100 minutes. So, the initial 100 minutes had a 32% chance. But the question is about the next 150 minutes, given that 50 have passed without decay. So, the remaining time is 150 minutes. Alternatively, perhaps the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes.\n\nWait, the way the question is phrased: \"the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So that's the probability it decays in the first 100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed. So, we're looking for the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.\n\nBut since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes and then decays in the next 150. Or wait, no, the memoryless property means that the probability of decay in a future interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute interval.\n\nBut wait, wait, perhaps I should model it using the exponential distribution. The survival probability after time t is e^(-\u03bbt). So, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*50). The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. So, the probability is [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period, regardless of the prior time. So, perhaps I can compute the decay probability for 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but the initial data is for 100 minutes. So, I can find \u03bb using the 100-minute data, then compute the decay probability for 150 minutes. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nGiven P(100) = 0.32. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, what's the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes? That's P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo, compute \u03bb *150: 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\ne^(-0.57849) \u2248 0.562. So, 1 - 0.562 \u2248 0.438, which is about 43.8%. Looking at the options, option A is 44%. So, the answer would be A) 44%.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Because the question says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, the conditional probability is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in the first 50.\n\nWait, no, the way the question is phrased: \"so far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\"\n\nAh, so the time that has passed is 50 minutes, and we are looking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. So, the total time from the start is 200 minutes. But the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes have passed. Because the process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how long it has been waiting.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of conditional probability. The probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is P(50 < decay time < 200). Which is equal to P(decay time <200) - P(decay time <50) = [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nAlternatively, since the decay process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after t=50 is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute interval starting at t=50. So, that probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nWait, but which approach is correct? Let me think. The decay is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if it were starting fresh. Because the process doesn't depend on how long it's been waiting. So, the probability should be 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Which in my calculation earlier was approximately 43.8%, so 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because the given 32% is for 100 minutes. So, maybe I should calculate the probability for the next 150 minutes, but perhaps that's not directly applicable. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the atom decays within 150 minutes after the initial 50 minutes have passed. So, the time elapsed is 50, and the remaining time is 150. So, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). But earlier calculation using \u03bb gave 43.8%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recalculate \u03bb with more precision. Given that 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). So, e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Take natural log: ln(0.68) = -100\u03bb \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/(-100) = (approx) (-0.385662)/(-100) \u2192 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nThen, for t=150 minutes: \u03bbt = 0.00385662 * 150 \u2248 0.578493.\n\ne^(-0.578493) \u2248 e^(-0.5785) \u2248 Let me compute that. e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, e^(-0.6)=0.5488, e^(-0.5785) is between these. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\n0.5785 is approximately 0.5785. Let me use a calculator approach.\n\nWe know that ln(0.56) \u2248 -0.5798. Hmm, wait, let's see:\n\nWait, let me think: ln(0.56) \u2248 ln(56/100) = ln(14/25) \u2248 ln(0.56). Let me compute it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approximate e^(-0.5785) as follows.\n\nWe can compute using Taylor series or remember that ln(0.56) is approximately -0.5798. So, 0.5785 is very close to that. So, e^(-0.5785) \u2248 0.56. Therefore, 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%, so option A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Let me compute e^(-0.5785) more accurately.\n\nWe can use the fact that e^(-x) \u2248 1 - x + x^2/2 - x^3/6 + x^4/24 for small x, but x is 0.5785, which is not small, so maybe a better approach is to use a calculator-like approximation.\n\nAlternatively, since I don't have a calculator, but I know that:\n\n- ln(0.56) \u2248 -0.5798 (since 0.56 is e^-0.5798)\n- So, 0.5785 is about 0.5798 minus 0.0013. So, x = 0.5785 = 0.5798 - 0.0013.\n\nSo, e^(-0.5785) = e^(-0.5798 + 0.0013) )= e^(-0.5798) * e^(0.0013) \u2248 0.56 * (1 + 0.0013) \u2248 0.56 * 1.0013 \u2248 0.5607. So, e^(-0.5785) \u2248 0.5607.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, which is about 43.93%, so 44% when rounded. So the answer is option A) 44%.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the given 32% is the decay probability within 100 minutes, which is the same as the cumulative probability up to 100 minutes. So, the probability of decaying after 100 minutes is 32%. So, the decay constant \u03bb can be found from this.\n\nBut another approach: perhaps the decay constant can be found using the given 32% probability in 100 minutes.\n\nBut perhaps the question is simpler. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any t-minute interval, regardless of the time already elapsed. So, the 50 minutes that have passed without decay don't change the probability for the next 150 minutes. So, the probability is simply the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, which we calculated as approximately 44%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The given probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So, the decay constant \u03bb is such that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, which gives us \u03bb as we calculated.\n\nBut the question is, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability is the same as if we had just started, and we're considering 150 minutes. So, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150) \u2248 44%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability of the atom decaying between t=50 and t=200, which is the same as the probability of surviving up to t=50 and then decaying before t=200. That would be e^(-\u03bb *50) * [1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150)].\n\nWait, but that's the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after t=50, which is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval, regardless of the prior time. So, that's still 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150), because the memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is independent of the time already spent. So, the answer is 44%, option A.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. The way the question is phrased, \"the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So, that's the probability that it decays at any time within the first 100 minutes. So, the chance that it decays in the first 100 minutes is 32%.\n\nBut now, we're looking at the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes. So, that's the same as the probability that it decays after 50 minutes but before 200. So, the probability is P(50 < decay time < 200) = P(decay time <200) - P(decay time <50).\n\nWhich is [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nWe have \u03bb = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nCompute e^(-\u03bb *50): 0.0038566 *50 = 0.19283. e^(-0.19283) \u2248 0.8253.\n\ne^(-\u03bb *200): 0.0038566 *200 = 0.77132. e^(-0.77132) \u2248 0.462.\n\nSo, the probability is 0.8253 - 0.462 \u2248 0.3633, which is 36.33%. But that's not matching any of the options given. Hmm, that's a problem. Because earlier approach suggested 44%, but this approach gives 36.33%. So, I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nWait, where am I going wrong here? Because I thought the memoryless property would make the probability the same as 150 minutes, but according to this calculation, the probability is 36.33%, which is not an option here. Wait, but the options are A)44%, B)40%, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again. Let me clarify the concepts.\n\nThe memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given that the atom has not decayed up to the current time, is the same as the probability of decay in any t-minute interval, regardless of how long it's been waiting.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the current time is 50 minutes, and we're looking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. According to the memoryless property, this probability is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) \u2248 43.8%, which is option A.\n\nBut why is the other approach giving me 36%? Because that approach is considering the decay between 50 and 200 minutes, which is a 150-minute window, but perhaps I'm not correctly applying the memoryless property.\n\nWait, no. The correct way is to model the conditional probability. The probability that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to the probability that it decays at any point after t=50. But the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is independent of the time already spent. So, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) \u2248 43.8%, so 44%.\n\nWait, but wait, in my second approach, I calculated e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200) and got 0.3633. That would suggest a 36% chance, but that's not matching the memoryless approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the second approach. Let me reevaluate. The probability that the decay occurs between t=50 and t=200 is the same as the probability that the atom has not decayed before t=50 multiplied by the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. So, that's e^(-\u03bb *50) * (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)).\n\nWait, wait, that makes sense. Because the atom hasn't decayed up to t=50, the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200 is the probability of surviving up to t=50 times the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n\nSo, let's compute that. e^(-\u03bb*50) \u2248 0.8253 (as before), and (1 - e^(-\u03bb*150)) \u2248 0.438.\n\nSo, 0.8253 * 0.438 \u2248 0.362, which is approximately 36.2%, which is not one of the options. So, why is this conflicting with the memoryless approach?\n\nAh, perhaps I'm getting confused between the conditional probability and the joint probability. The question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. So, that is a conditional probability.\n\nThe conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A and B)/P(B). In this case, A is the event that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between t=50 and t=200), and B is the event that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, since we're given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability that it decays in the next 150 is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But in this case, A is the event that it decays between t=50 and t=200, and B is that it hasn't decayed before t=50. So, A and B is just A, because A is a subset of B. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because A is the event that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200. So, if the atom hasn't decayed before t=50, then the probability it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the same as the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed up to t=50.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B). But since A occurs only if B has occurred (i.e., the atom hasn't decayed before t=50), P(A and B) is equal to P(A). Wait, no. Because A is the event that the decay happens between t=50 and t=200. So, if the atom hasn't decayed before t=50, the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the same as the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Which, according to the memoryless property, is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \u2248 43.8%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute P(A|B) as [P(A and B)] / P(B). Since B is the event that the atom hasn't decayed by t=50, P(B) = e^(-\u03bb *50) \u2248 0.8253. And P(A and B) is the probability that the atom hasn't decayed before t=50 and then decays between t=50 and t=200. Which is equal to e^(-\u03bb*50) * (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)).\n\nSo, P(A|B) = [e^(-\u03bb *50) * (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150))] / e^(-\u03bb *50) ) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \u2248 0.438, so 43.8%.\n\nWhich is the same as the memoryless approach. So, the probability is approximately 44%, so option A.\n\nSo why did I get 36% earlier? Because I was calculating P(A) which is the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, which is 0.362. But the question is asking for the conditional probability P(A|B), which is 44%. So, the correct answer is 44%, option A.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach where I calculated 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) \u2248 44%, that aligns with the correct conditional probability. So, the answer should be A)44%.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by calculating the unconditional probability P(A) instead of the conditional probability P(A|B). So, the correct approach is to compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) which is approximately 44%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the exact concepts, but let me try to think it through. So, the question is about the probability that a particular atom will decay within the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time.\n\nThe problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Hmm, wait, so if we have a group of these atoms, 32% of them would decay in 100 minutes. But here we're dealing with a single atom, so the probability for each individual atom is the same. I think the key here is understanding that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, meaning the probability of decay is constant over time intervals, regardless of how much time has already passed.\n\nSo, the general formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), where N(t) is the number remaining after time t, N0 is the initial number, \u03bb is the decay constant, and t is time. But since we're dealing with probabilities, maybe it's better to think in terms of the probability of decay.\n\nWait, the probability that a nucleus decays in time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So, the given 32% is the probability that it decays within 100 minutes. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). Let me solve for \u03bb first.\n\nRearranging, e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, ln(0.68) = -100\u03bb. So, \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that. Ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So, the time left is 150 minutes, but the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since decay is memoryless, the probability from the current time onwards is the same as starting fresh. So, the time we need to consider for the decay is 150 minutes from now.\n\nWait, no, the 32% is given for 100 minutes. So, the initial 100 minutes had a 32% chance. But the question is about the next 150 minutes, given that 50 have passed without decay. So, the remaining time is 150 minutes. Alternatively, perhaps the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes.\n\nWait, the way the question is phrased: \"the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So that's the probability it decays in the first 100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed. So, we're looking for the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.\n\nBut since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes and then decays in the next 150. Or wait, no, the memoryless property means that the probability of decay in a future interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute interval.\n\nBut wait, wait, perhaps I should model it using the exponential distribution. The survival probability after time t is e^(-\u03bbt). So, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*50). The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. So, the probability is [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period, regardless of the prior time. So, perhaps I can compute the decay probability for 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but the initial data is for 100 minutes. So, I can find \u03bb using the 100-minute data, then compute the decay probability for 150 minutes. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nGiven P(100) = 0.32. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, what's the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes? That's P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo, compute \u03bb *150: 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\ne^(-0.57849) \u2248 0.562. So, 1 - 0.562 \u2248 0.438, which is about 43.8%. Looking at the options, option A is 44%. So, the answer would be A) 44%.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Because the question says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, the conditional probability is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in the first 50.\n\nWait, no, the way the question is phrased: \"so far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\"\n\nAh, so the time that has passed is 50 minutes, and we are looking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. So, the total time from the start is 200 minutes. But the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes have passed. Because the process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how long it has been waiting.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of conditional probability. The probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is P(50 < decay time < 200). Which is equal to P(decay time <200) - P(decay time <50) = [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nAlternatively, since the decay process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after t=50 is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute interval starting at t=50. So, that probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nWait, but which approach is correct? Let me think. The decay is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if it were starting fresh. Because the process doesn't depend on how long it's been waiting. So, the probability should be 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Which in my calculation earlier was approximately 43.8%, so 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because the given 32% is for 100 minutes. So, maybe I should calculate the probability for the next 150 minutes, but perhaps that's not directly applicable. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the atom decays within 150 minutes after the initial 50 minutes have passed. So, the time elapsed is 50, and the remaining time is 150. So, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). But earlier calculation using \u03bb gave 43.8%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recalculate \u03bb with more precision. Given that 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). So, e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Take natural log: ln(0.68) = -100\u03bb \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/(-100) = (approx) (-0.385662)/(-100) \u2192 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nThen, for t=150 minutes: \u03bbt = 0.00385662 * 150 \u2248 0.578493.\n\ne^(-0.578493) \u2248 e^(-0.5785) \u2248 Let me compute that. e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, e^(-0.6)=0.5488, e^(-0.5785) is between these. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\n0.5785 is approximately 0.5785. Let me use a calculator approach.\n\nWe know that ln(0.56) \u2248 -0.5798. Hmm, wait, let's see:\n\nWait, let me think: ln(0.56) \u2248 ln(56/100) = ln(14/25) \u2248 ln(0.56). Let me compute it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approximate e^(-0.5785) as follows.\n\nWe can compute using Taylor series or remember that ln(0.56) is approximately -0.5798. So, 0.5785 is very close to that. So, e^(-0.5785) \u2248 0.56. Therefore, 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%, so option A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Let me compute e^(-0.5785) more accurately.\n\nWe can use the fact that e^(-x) \u2248 1 - x + x^2/2 - x^3/6 + x^4/24 for small x, but x is 0.5785, which is not small, so maybe a better approach is to use a calculator-like approximation.\n\nAlternatively, since I don't have a calculator, but I know that:\n\n- ln(0.56) \u2248 -0.5798 (since 0.56 is e^-0.5798)\n- So, 0.5785 is about 0.5798 minus 0.0013. So, x = 0.5785 = 0.5798 - 0.0013.\n\nSo, e^(-0.5785) = e^(-0.5798 + 0.0013) )= e^(-0.5798) * e^(0.0013) \u2248 0.56 * (1 + 0.0013) \u2248 0.56 * 1.0013 \u2248 0.5607. So, e^(-0.5785) \u2248 0.5607.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, which is about 43.93%, so 44% when rounded. So the answer is option A) 44%.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the given 32% is the decay probability within 100 minutes, which is the same as the cumulative probability up to 100 minutes. So, the probability of decaying after 100 minutes is 32%. So, the decay constant \u03bb can be found from this.\n\nBut another approach: perhaps the decay constant can be found using the given 32% probability in 100 minutes.\n\nBut perhaps the question is simpler. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any t-minute interval, regardless of the time already elapsed. So, the 50 minutes that have passed without decay don't change the probability for the next 150 minutes. So, the probability is simply the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, which we calculated as approximately 44%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The given probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So, the decay constant \u03bb is such that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, which gives us \u03bb as we calculated.\n\nBut the question is, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability is the same as if we had just started, and we're considering 150 minutes. So, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150) \u2248 44%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability of the atom decaying between t=50 and t=200, which is the same as the probability of surviving up to t=50 and then decaying before t=200. That would be e^(-\u03bb *50) * [1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150)].\n\nWait, but that's the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after t=50, which is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval, regardless of the prior time. So, that's still 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150), because the memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is independent of the time already spent. So, the answer is 44%, option A.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. The way the question is phrased, \"the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So, that's the probability that it decays at any time within the first 100 minutes. So, the chance that it decays in the first 100 minutes is 32%.\n\nBut now, we're looking at the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes. So, that's the same as the probability that it decays after 50 minutes but before 200. So, the probability is P(50 < decay time < 200) = P(decay time <200) - P(decay time <50).\n\nWhich is [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nWe have \u03bb = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nCompute e^(-\u03bb *50): 0.0038566 *50 = 0.19283. e^(-0.19283) \u2248 0.8253.\n\ne^(-\u03bb *200): 0.0038566 *200 = 0.77132. e^(-0.77132) \u2248 0.462.\n\nSo, the probability is 0.8253 - 0.462 \u2248 0.3633, which is 36.33%. But that's not matching any of the options given. Hmm, that's a problem. Because earlier approach suggested 44%, but this approach gives 36.33%. So, I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nWait, where am I going wrong here? Because I thought the memoryless property would make the probability the same as 150 minutes, but according to this calculation, the probability is 36.33%, which is not an option here. Wait, but the options are A)44%, B)40%, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again. Let me clarify the concepts.\n\nThe memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given that the atom has not decayed up to the current time, is the same as the probability of decay in any t-minute interval, regardless of how long it's been waiting.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the current time is 50 minutes, and we're looking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. According to the memoryless property, this probability is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) \u2248 43.8%, which is option A.\n\nBut why is the other approach giving me 36%? Because that approach is considering the decay between 50 and 200 minutes, which is a 150-minute window, but perhaps I'm not correctly applying the memoryless property.\n\nWait, no. The correct way is to model the conditional probability. The probability that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to the probability that it decays at any point after t=50. But the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is independent of the time already spent. So, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) \u2248 43.8%, so 44%.\n\nWait, but wait, in my second approach, I calculated e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200) and got 0.3633. That would suggest a 36% chance, but that's not matching the memoryless approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the second approach. Let me reevaluate. The probability that the decay occurs between t=50 and t=200 is the same as the probability that the atom has not decayed before t=50 multiplied by the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. So, that's e^(-\u03bb *50) * (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)).\n\nWait, wait, that makes sense. Because the atom hasn't decayed up to t=50, the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200 is the probability of surviving up to t=50 times the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n\nSo, let's compute that. e^(-\u03bb*50) \u2248 0.8253 (as before), and (1 - e^(-\u03bb*150)) \u2248 0.438.\n\nSo, 0.8253 * 0.438 \u2248 0.362, which is approximately 36.2%, which is not one of the options. So, why is this conflicting with the memoryless approach?\n\nAh, perhaps I'm getting confused between the conditional probability and the joint probability. The question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. So, that is a conditional probability.\n\nThe conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A and B)/P(B). In this case, A is the event that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between t=50 and t=200), and B is the event that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, since we're given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability that it decays in the next 150 is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But in this case, A is the event that it decays between t=50 and t=200, and B is that it hasn't decayed before t=50. So, A and B is just A, because A is a subset of B. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because A is the event that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200. So, if the atom hasn't decayed before t=50, then the probability it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the same as the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed up to t=50.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B). But since A occurs only if B has occurred (i.e., the atom hasn't decayed before t=50), P(A and B) is equal to P(A). Wait, no. Because A is the event that the decay happens between t=50 and t=200. So, if the atom hasn't decayed before t=50, the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the same as the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Which, according to the memoryless property, is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \u2248 43.8%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute P(A|B) as [P(A and B)] / P(B). Since B is the event that the atom hasn't decayed by t=50, P(B) = e^(-\u03bb *50) \u2248 0.8253. And P(A and B) is the probability that the atom hasn't decayed before t=50 and then decays between t=50 and t=200. Which is equal to e^(-\u03bb*50) * (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)).\n\nSo, P(A|B) = [e^(-\u03bb *50) * (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150))] / e^(-\u03bb *50) ) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \u2248 0.438, so 43.8%.\n\nWhich is the same as the memoryless approach. So, the probability is approximately 44%, so option A.\n\nSo why did I get 36% earlier? Because I was calculating P(A) which is the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, which is 0.362. But the question is asking for the conditional probability P(A|B), which is 44%. So, the correct answer is 44%, option A.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach where I calculated 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) \u2248 44%, that aligns with the correct conditional probability. So, the answer should be A)44%.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by calculating the unconditional probability P(A) instead of the conditional probability P(A|B). So, the correct approach is to compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) which is approximately 44%.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, we use the memoryless property of radioactive decay. The decay process follows an exponential distribution, where the probability of decay in a given time interval depends only on the length of the interval, not on how much time has already passed.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Given Decay Probability**: The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, i.e., \\( P(100) = 0.32 \\).\n2. **Memoryless Property**: The probability of decay in the next \\( t \\) minutes is independent of the time already elapsed.\n3. **Decay Constant (\\( \\lambda \\))**: The decay constant can be calculated using the given 32% probability for 100 minutes:\n   \\[\n   P(100) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} \\implies 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100\\lambda} \\implies e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68.\n   \\]\n   Taking the natural logarithm:\n   \\[\n   -100\\lambda = \\ln(0.68) \\implies \\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100}.\n   \\]\n   Approximating \\( \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.38566 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.38566}{100} \\approx 0.0038566 \\, \\text{per minute}.\n   \\]\n\n### Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes:\nUsing the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.0038566 \\):\n\\[\n\\lambda \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.0038566 \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.57849.\n\\]\nNow, calculate \\( e^{-0.57849} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows some kind of exponential law. Let me think. Oh right, the decay follows an exponential decay model, so the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Wait, but wait, the question is about the probability that the atom will decay in a certain time given that it hasn't decayed before.\n\nThe problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. That's P = 32% or 0.32. So the half-life isn't given, but I can probably find the decay constant from this information.\n\nWait, the decay formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), right? Or wait, the probability of decay is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). Because N(t) is the number remaining, so the number decayed is 1 - N(t)/N0. So the probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).\n\nGiven that in 100 minutes, the probability is 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100). Let me solve for \u03bb.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.32 = e^(-100\u03bb). That's 0.68 = e^(-100\u03bb). Taking the natural logarithm on both sides, ln(0.68) = -100\u03bb. So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that.\n\nWait, ln(0.68) is approximately... Hmm, ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, ln(0.7) is around -0.3567. 0.68 is close to 0.7, so maybe ln(0.68) is around -0.3857 or so? Let me check with a calculator in my mind. Oh wait, I think the exact value isn't necessary because the problem is about conditional probability.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So we need to find the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but the next 150 minutes from when? Oh, from the current time, so 50 minutes have already passed, and we're looking at 150 minutes from now. Or wait, no, the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the way the question is phrased, it's the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed.\n\nWait, the way it's phrased: \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\" So starting from the current time (50 minutes have passed), what's the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes.\n\nBut in radioactive decay, the probability doesn't depend on the past. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any subsequent 150-minute period, given it hasn't decayed yet.\n\nSo the probability of decay in time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So the time t here is 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nBut wait, I calculated \u03bb earlier using the 100-minute data. Let me get that.\n\nSo from 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb), so e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. So \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100 = (ln(1.47)) / 100. Because 1/0.68 is approximately 1.47.\n\nWait, ln(1.47) is about 0.385. So \u03bb is 0.385 / 100 \u2248 0.00385 per minute.\n\nSo now, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nCalculating that, \u03bb *150 is 0.00385 *150 \u2248 0.5775.\n\ne^(-0.5775) is approximately 0.5623. So 1 - 0.5623 is 0.4377, which is about 43.77%, so approximately 44%.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 44%, which would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, wait, but wait. The initial setup. The decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, which is the same as saying that the decay constant \u03bb is such that 1 - e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.32.\n\nSo, e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Taking ln on both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = - ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCompute ln(0.68): ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.3857 (since ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit smaller, so ln is more negative). So ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.3857.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.3857 / 100 = 0.003857 per minute.\n\nNow, for t=150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb t) = 1 - e^(-0.003857 *150).\n\nCalculate 0.003857 *150: 0.003857 *150 = 0.57855.\n\ne^(-0.57855) \u2248 e^-0.57855. Let me approximate e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nLet me compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, 0.57855 is approximately 0.5786. Let me compute e^-0.5786.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series approximation or use a calculator-like approach.\n\nAlternatively, since I know that ln(2) is about 0.6931, so e^-0.6931 is 0.5. But 0.5786 is less than that, so e^-0.5786 is greater than 0.5. Let me think, 0.5786 is about 0.5786.\n\nAlternatively, we can remember that e^-0.57 \u2248 0.563, e^-0.58 \u2248 0.560, e^-0.59 \u2248 0.556.\n\nWait, maybe using more precise calculation.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute it as follows:\n\nCompute 0.57855:\n\nWe can write it as 0.5 + 0.07855.\n\nWe know that e^-0.5 \u2248 0.6065.\n\nNow, e^-0.57855 = e^(-0.5 - 0.07855) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.07855.\n\ne^-0.07855 \u2248 1 - 0.07855 + (0.07855^2)/2 - (0.07855^3)/6.\n\nCalculating:\n\n0.07855^2 \u2248 0.00617, divided by 2 is ~0.003085.\n\n0.07855^3 \u2248 0.000484, divided by 6 is ~0.0000807.\n\nSo e^-0.07855 \u2248 1 - 0.07855 + 0.003085 - 0.0000807.\n\n1 - 0.07855 is 0.92145. Adding 0.003085 gives 0.924535. Subtract 0.0000807 gives 0.924454.\n\nSo e^-0.57855 \u2248 0.6065 * 0.924454 \u2248 0.6065 * 0.924.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n0.6 * 0.924 = 0.5544.\n\n0.0065 * 0.924 \u2248 0.006006.\n\nAdding together: 0.5544 + 0.006006 \u2248 0.5604.\n\nSo e^-0.57855 \u2248 0.5604.\n\nTherefore, 1 - e^-0.57855 \u2248 1 - 0.5604 = 0.4396, which is approximately 43.96%, so about 44%. So option A is 44%, which would be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. The initial 50 minutes have passed without decay. Does that affect anything? Because in radioactive decay, the probability is independent of time, so the fact that it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes doesn't change the future probabilities. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability of decay within 200 minutes (50 +150) minus the probability of decay within 50 minutes. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes is equal to the probability that it decays by 200 minutes minus the probability that it decays by 50 minutes.\n\nSo P = (1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)) - (1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)) ) = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nBut wait, in our case, the given probability is for 100 minutes, so perhaps we can compute \u03bb and then compute this.\n\nWait, maybe the initial approach I took was correct, but perhaps the question is about the conditional probability. Oh, wait, no, because the decay is memoryless. So the fact that it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes doesn't affect the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. So the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period, regardless of prior time.\n\nSo the answer is 44% which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, so the effective time is 150 minutes from now, and the total time is 200 minutes. So perhaps the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *200), but no, because the decay could have happened in the first 50 minutes, but it didn't. So the correct approach is to compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in the first 50.\n\nWait, but in probability terms, the probability that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200 minutes is equal to the probability it hasn't decayed by t=50 multiplied by the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.\n\nWhich is P = (e^(-\u03bb *50)) * (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)).\n\nBut that's the same as the approach where P = [1 - e^(-\u03bb*(50+150))] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] ].\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.\n\nThe total probability of decay by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t).\n\nSo the probability that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200 is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nAlternatively, the conditional probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)].\n\nWhich is [e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200)] / [e^(-\u03bb *50)].\n\nWhich simplifies to 1 - e^(-\u03bb (200 -50 )) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nAh, so that's the same as before. So the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150), which is what I computed earlier.\n\nSo the 50 minutes don't affect the calculation because the decay is memoryless. So the correct approach is to calculate the probability for 150 minutes as 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The initial data is that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. So from that, I can calculate \u03bb.\n\nYes, as before.\n\nSo yes, the answer should be 44%, which is option A.\n",

Because in radioactive decay, the probability is independent of time, so the fact that it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes doesn't change the future probabilities. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability of decay within 200 minutes (50 +150) minus the probability of decay within 50 minutes. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes is equal to the probability that it decays by 200 minutes minus the probability that it decays by 50 minutes.\n\nSo P = (1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)) - (1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)) ) = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nBut wait, in our case, the given probability is for 100 minutes, so perhaps we can compute \u03bb and then compute this.\n\nWait, maybe the initial approach I took was correct, but perhaps the question is about the conditional probability. Oh, wait, no, because the decay is memoryless. So the fact that it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes doesn't affect the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. So the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period, regardless of prior time.\n\nSo the answer is 44% which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, so the effective time is 150 minutes from now, and the total time is 200 minutes. So perhaps the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *200), but no, because the decay could have happened in the first 50 minutes, but it didn't. So the correct approach is to compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in the first 50.\n\nWait, but in probability terms, the probability that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200 minutes is equal to the probability it hasn't decayed by t=50 multiplied by the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.\n\nWhich is P = (e^(-\u03bb *50)) * (1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)).\n\nBut that's the same as the approach where P = [1 - e^(-\u03bb*(50+150))] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] ].\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.\n\nThe total probability of decay by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t).\n\nSo the probability that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200 is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nAlternatively, the conditional probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)].\n\nWhich is [e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200)] / [e^(-\u03bb *50)].\n\nWhich simplifies to 1 - e^(-\u03bb (200 -50 )) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nAh, so that's the same as before. So the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150), which is what I computed earlier.\n\nSo the 50 minutes don't affect the calculation because the decay is memoryless. So the correct approach is to calculate the probability for 150 minutes as 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The initial data is that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. So from that, I can calculate \u03bb.\n\nYes, as before.\n\nSo yes, the answer should be 44%, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model, where the probability of decay by time \\( t \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \\( \\lambda \\)\nFrom the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \\( P(100) = 0.32 \\). Substituting into the formula:\n\n\\[\n0.32 = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100}\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\ne^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.68\n\\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\n-\\lambda \\cdot 100 = \\ln(0.68)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100}\n\\]\n\nUsing approximations, \\( \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.3857 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.3857}{100} \\approx 0.003857 \\, \\text{per minute}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes\nThe question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, starting from the current time (50 minutes have already passed without decay). In radioactive decay, the process is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the decay constant \\( \\lambda \\) and the time interval (150 minutes). Thus, we calculate:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{next 150}} = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.003857 \\):\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{next 150}} = 1 - e^{-0.003857 \\cdot 150}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent:\n\n\\[\n0.003857 \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.57855\n\\]\n\nNow, approximate \\( e^{-0.57855} \\). Using a series expansion or known values, \\( e^{-0.57855} \\approx 0.5604 \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{next 150}} = 1 - 0.5604 \\approx 0.4396 \\, \\text{or} \\, 43.96\\%.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Match the result to the closest option\nThe closest option to \\( 43.96\\% \\) is \\( 44\\% \\), which corresponds to **Option A**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows some kind of exponential law. Let me think. Oh right, the decay follows an exponential probability model. So the probability of decay doesn't depend on when it decayed, only on the time remaining.\n\nThe problem says that the decay probability of the atom is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, so the probability P is 32% over 100 minutes. I need to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, but 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Oh, right, so the first 50 minutes didn't happen, so we're looking at the remaining time.\n\nWait, no. The atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, so now we're looking from the current time, how likely it is to decay in the next 150 minutes. So the total time from now is 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but how is the decay probability related to time? I think the probability is given for a certain time interval, which relates to the decay constant. Let me recall the formula. The formula for the probability of decay in time t is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant.\n\nWait, another way to think: the decay follows a Poisson process, so the probability that the nucleus hasn't decayed after time t is e^(-\u03bbt). So the survival probability is that, and the decay probability is 1 minus that.\n\nBut in the problem, we're told that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%. So P(100) = 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). So we can solve for \u03bb.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's rearrange:\n\ne^(-\u03bb*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nTake natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n-\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68)\n\nSo \u03bb = -ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68): ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. Let me think, ln(0.68) is approximately... Let me compute it more accurately. I can approximate ln(0.7) is about -0.3567. Wait, 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7. So ln(0.68) is maybe around -0.385. Hmm, but I should get the exact value. Alternatively, I can use a calculator in my mind.\n\nWait, maybe I should just carry it as a variable for now. So \u03bb = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100 \u2248 (0.38566) / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, let me calculate it more accurately. Let's think: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So the negative of that is 0.38566. So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo now, we have to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. Wait, no, the 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the time remaining is 150 minutes from now. So the total time being considered is 150 minutes.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So the initial decay probability was given for 100 minutes, but now we're looking beyond that? Or is the 100 minutes from the start, and 50 have passed, so 50 left? Hmm, wait, let me read the question again.\n\nThe decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability from time zero to 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed (so time is at t=50), and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, which would take us to t=200 (50 + 150).\n\nWait, no. Because the next 150 minutes after the current time would be 150 minutes from now. So the total time since the start is 50 +150=200 minutes. So the probability to decay between t=50 to t=200 is what we're looking for.\n\nWait, but the decay is a memoryless process, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes from t=50 is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from t=0, given that it hasn't decayed before t=50. Because the decay doesn't have memory of previous times.\n\nSo the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%. So \u03bb is fixed.\n\nWait, but the 50 minutes have passed, so the decay hasn't happened yet. So the probability we're looking for is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=50+150=200. So the probability is P(150) as I thought.\n\nAlternatively, it's the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, starting from the current time, which is the same as P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nBut wait, since the decay is memoryless, the fact that it didn't decay in the first 50 minutes doesn't affect the probability beyond that point. So the probability to decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability to decay in 150 minutes starting from time zero.\n\nWait, no. Because the decay is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed, as long as it hasn't decayed yet. So yes, the probability is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t).\n\nSo now, let's compute P(150). We already have \u03bb from the first part.\n\nWe found \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150)\n\nCalculating the exponent: 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) is approximately?\n\nHmm, e^0.5 is about 1.6487, so e^0.578 is higher. Wait, wait, wait. No, because 0.578 is negative, so e^(-0.578) is 1/(e^0.578).\n\ne^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.6 is about 1.8221. 0.578 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's approximate e^0.578.\n\nLet me think, 0.578 is approximately 0.578. So, using a Taylor expansion or linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nAt x=0.5, e^x=1.64872\n\nx=0.6, e^x=1.82212\n\nThe difference between x=0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1, and the e^x increases by about 0.1734 (1.82212-1.64872=0.1734). So per 0.01 increase in x, e^x increases by about 0.1734/10=0.01734.\n\nSo for x=0.578, that's 0.078 above 0.5. So 0.078 * 0.01734 per 0.01, but wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the linear approximation.\n\nThe slope at x=0.5 is e^0.5 \u2248 1.64872. The derivative is same as the function value, so slope is 1.64872.\n\nSo at x=0.5, the function is 1.64872. For dx=0.078, the approximate e^x is 1.64872 + 0.078 *1.64872.\n\nSo 0.078 * 1.64872 \u2248 0.1287.\n\nSo e^0.578 \u2248 1.64872 + 0.1287 \u2248 1.7774.\n\nSo e^0.578 \u22481.7774. So 1/e^0.578 \u2248 1/1.7774 \u2248 0.562.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator-like approach. Let's see:\n\nln(2)=0.6931. So 0.578 is less than that, so e^0.578 is less than 2.\n\nWait, but I think my approximation is close enough. So e^(-0.578) \u2248 0.562.\n\nSo P(150) = 1 - 0.562 = 0.438, or 43.8%. Hmm, the options are 44%, which is option A. So the answer would be A) 44%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute \u03bb more accurately.\n\nEarlier, we had \u03bb = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100.\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68) more accurately. Let's think, 0.68 is e^x, what's x?\n\nWe know that ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667, and ln(0.68) is a bit lower.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the Taylor series for ln(x) around x=0.7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ln(2/3) is about -0.4055, but 0.68 is 2/3 is 0.6667, so 0.68 is a bit higher. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me think: ln(0.68) can be calculated using the expansion for ln(x) around x=1.\n\nThe expansion is ln(x) = (x-1) - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - (x-1)^4/4 + ... for |x-1| <1.\n\nSo x=0.68, x-1 = -0.32.\n\nSo ln(0.68) = (-0.32) - ( (-0.32)^2 )/2 + ( (-0.32)^3 )/3 - ( (-0.32)^4 )/4 + ... \n\nLet's compute term by term.\n\nFirst term: -0.32.\n\nSecond term: (0.32^2)/2 = (0.1024)/2=0.0512. So subtract this: -0.32 - 0.0512= -0.3712.\n\nThird term: (-0.32)^3 = -0.032768. Divided by 3: -0.0109227. So adding this: -0.3712 + (-0.0109227) \u2192 Wait no, wait the third term is + (x-1)^3 /3. Since (x-1) is -0.32, (x-1)^3 is (-0.32)^3 = -0.032768. So the third term is (-0.032768)/3 \u2248 -0.0109227. So adding that gives: -0.32 -0.0512 -0.0109227 = -0.3821227.\n\nFourth term: (x-1)^4 = (-0.32)^4 = 0.1048576. Divided by 4: 0.0262144. So subtract this: -0.3821227 - 0.0262144 = -0.4083371.\n\nFifth term: (x-1)^5 = (-0.32)^5 = -0.033554432. Divided by 5: -0.006710886. Adding this: -0.4083371 + (-0.006710886) \u2192 wait, no, the expansion is ln(x) = sum from n=1 to infty [ ( (-1)^(n+1) (x-1)^n ) /n ].\n\nWait, correction: ln(x) = (x-1) - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - (x-1)^4/4 + ... \n\nSo the terms alternate signs. So term 1: -(x-1) is -(-0.32) = 0.32? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me redo.\n\nWait, x=0.68, so x-1= -0.32.\n\nThe expansion is:\n\nln(x) = (x-1) - ( (x-1)^2 )/2 + ( (x-1)^3 )/3 - ( (x-1)^4 )/4 + ( (x-1)^5 )/5 - ... \n\nSo substituting x=0.68:\n\nln(0.68) = (-0.32) - ( (-0.32)^2 )/2 + ( (-0.32)^3 )/3 - ( (-0.32)^4 )/4 + ( (-0.32)^5 )/5 - ... \n\nLet me compute each term up to the fifth term to approximate.\n\nTerm 1: -0.32.\n\nTerm 2: - ( (0.32)^2 ) / 2 = -(0.1024)/2 = -0.0512. So adding this gives: -0.32 -0.0512 = -0.3712.\n\nTerm3: + ( (-0.32)^3 ) /3 = (-0.032768)/3 \u2248 -0.01092267. So adding this: -0.3712 -0.01092267 \u2248 -0.3821227.\n\nTerm4: - ( (0.32)^4 ) /4 = - (0.1048576)/4 = -0.0262144. So adding: -0.3821227 -0.0262144 \u2248 -0.4083371.\n\nTerm5: + ( (-0.32)^5 )/5 = (-0.033554432)/5 \u2248 -0.006710886. Adding: -0.4083371 -0.006710886 \u2248 -0.415047986.\n\nTerm6: - ( (0.32)^6 ) /6 = - (0.01073741824)/6 \u2248 -0.0017895697. Adding: -0.415047986 -0.0017895697 \u2248 -0.4168375557.\n\nTerm7: + ( (-0.32)^7 ) /7 \u2248 (-0.00343597383)/7 \u2248 -0.0004908534. Adding: -0.4168375557 -0.0004908534 \u2248 -0.4173284091.\n\nTerm8: - (0.32^8)/8 = (0.001125899906)/8 \u2248 0.0001407375. Adding: -0.4173284091 + 0.0001407375 \u2248 -0.4171876716.\n\nTerm9: + ( (-0.32)^9 ) /9 = (-0.00036024064)/9 \u2248 -0.00004002674. Adding: -0.4171876716 -0.00004002674 \u2248 -0.4172276983.\n\nHmm, so after 9 terms, ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.4172277.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought ln(0.68) was about -0.385. Hmm, so this seems more accurate.\n\nSo \u03bb = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100 \u2248 (0.4172277)/100 \u2248 0.004172277 per minute.\n\nWait, wait, that's different from my initial calculation. Oh, because I had earlier taken ln(0.68) as approximately -0.385, but with this expansion, it's about -0.417.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my initial approximation was a bit off. Let me redo the calculation with this more accurate \u03bb.\n\nSo \u03bb \u2248 0.004172277 per minute.\n\nNow, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nSo \u03bb*150 = 0.004172277 *150 \u2248 0.62584155.\n\nSo e^(-0.62584155) is approximately?\n\nHmm, e^0.6 is approximately 1.8221. So e^0.6258 is a bit higher. Let's compute e^0.6258.\n\nWe can compute ln(1.868) is about 0.625, because e^0.625 \u2248 1.868.\n\nWait, let's check: e^0.6 is 1.8221, e^0.625: let's compute.\n\nLet me compute e^0.625.\n\nWe can use the Taylor expansion around x=0.6.\n\nLet me compute e^0.625 = e^(0.6 + 0.025) = e^0.6 * e^0.025.\n\nWe know e^0.6 \u22481.8221.\n\ne^0.025 is approximately 1 + 0.025 + (0.025)^2/2 + (0.025)^3/6.\n\nWhich is 1 + 0.025 + 0.0003125 + 0.00002604 \u2248 1.02533854.\n\nSo e^0.625 \u2248 1.8221 * 1.02533854 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n1.8221 * 1.025 \u2248 1.8221 *1 =1.8221, 1.8221 *0.025=0.0455525. So total approx 1.86765.\n\nSo e^0.625 \u22481.86765.\n\nSo e^(-0.6258) \u2248 1/1.86765 \u2248 0.5355.\n\nSo P =1 - 0.5355= 0.4645, or 46.45%.\n\nHmm, that's about 46.45%, which isn't an option. The options are 44%, 40%,52%,48%.\n\nWait, perhaps my approximation of e^0.6258 is off.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use more accurate calculation for e^(-0.62584155).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as 1/(e^0.62584155).\n\nLet me compute e^0.62584155.\n\nWe can note that 0.62584155 is approximately 0.6258.\n\nAnother approach: e^0.6258 is the same as e^(6258/10000) \u2248 but perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the calculator approach.\n\nWe know that ln(1.868) is approximately 0.625, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute e^0.62584155.\n\nLet me use a calculator method. Let me compute 0.62584155.\n\nWe can note that 0.6258 is approximately 0.625 +0.00084155.\n\nWe have e^0.625 \u22481.868.\n\nSo e^0.62584155 = e^(0.625 +0.00084155) = e^0.625 * e^0.00084155.\n\ne^0.00084155 \u22481 + 0.00084155 + (0.00084155)^2/2 \u2248 1.00084155 + 0.000000355 \u22481.0008419.\n\nSo e^0.62584155 \u22481.868 *1.0008419 \u22481.868 *1.000842.\n\n1.868 *1.0008 =1.868 *1 +1.868*0.0008 =1.868 +0.0014944 =1.8694944.\n\nSo e^0.62584155 \u22481.8695.\n\nSo e^(-0.62584155) \u22481/1.8695 \u22480.5345.\n\nThus, P=1-0.5345=0.4655, which is 46.55%.\n\nHmm, that's about 46.5%, which is close to 46.5%. But the options are 44,40,52,48. So the closest is 48%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed ln(0.68)= -0.417, which led to \u03bb=0.004172.\n\nWait, but let me recompute \u03bb more accurately.\n\nEarlier, using the expansion up to term9, ln(0.68)\u2248-0.4172277.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.4172277 / 100 = 0.004172277 per minute.\n\nThen, \u03bb*150=0.004172277 *150=0.62584155.\n\nSo e^(-0.62584155)= 0.5345.\n\nSo P=1-0.5345=0.4655, which is 46.55%. Hmm, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So P(100)=0.32.\n\nSo 0.32=1-e^(-\u03bb*100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 \u03bb= - ln(0.68)/100.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the initial assumption. Because when 50 minutes have passed, the decay probability is 32% for the next 100 minutes? Or is it the total time?\n\nWait, let me read the question again.\n\nThe decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the initial 100 minutes.\n\nBut now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and the remaining time is 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, the 32% is the probability over 100 minutes. So from t=0 to t=100, the probability is 32%. Now, at t=50, we want to find the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 (150 minutes later). So the time in consideration is 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but the decay is memoryless. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nBut with \u03bb calculated from P(100)=0.32.\n\nSo if I compute P(150), I should get the correct value.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation gave me about 46.5%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of \u03bb.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68) more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566248.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I messed up earlier. Let me get the exact value.\n\nWait, I think I confused the approximation earlier. Let me compute ln(0.68) using a calculator.\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3856624808.\n\nSo \u03bb= 0.3856624808 / 100 \u22480.0038566248 per minute.\n\nThen, \u03bb*150=0.0038566248 *150= 0.57849372.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849372) is approximately?\n\nWe can compute this as 1/(e^0.57849372).\n\nWe can compute e^0.57849372.\n\nHmm, e^0.5 is about 1.64872, e^0.57849372.\n\nWe can compute e^0.57849372.\n\nWe can approximate this using a Taylor series or using known values.\n\nWe know that ln(1.782) is approximately 0.578.\n\nWait, let's compute e^0.57849372.\n\nWe can note that 0.57849372 is approximately 0.5785.\n\ne^0.5785 = ?\n\nAlternatively, let me think: e^0.5 = 1.64872, e^0.6=1.82212.\n\n0.5785 is 0.0785 above 0.5. Let's compute e^0.5785 = e^0.5 * e^0.0785.\n\nWe know e^0.0785 \u22481 + 0.0785 + (0.0785)^2/2 + (0.0785)^3/6.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm1: 0.0785.\n\nTerm2: (0.0785)^2 = 0.00616225, divided by 2: 0.003081125.\n\nTerm3: (0.0785)^3 \u22480.0785 *0.00616225 \u22480.0004835, divided by 6: ~0.00008058.\n\nSo e^0.0785 \u22481 +0.0785 +0.003081125 +0.00008058 \u22481.0816617.\n\nSo e^0.5785 = e^0.5 * e^0.0785 \u22481.64872 *1.0816617.\n\nCompute that: 1.64872 *1.08 = 1.64872 *1 + 1.64872 *0.08 =1.64872 +0.1318976=1.7806176.\n\nBut more accurately, 1.64872 *1.0816617.\n\nCompute 1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.7806176.\n\nThen, 1.64872 *0.0016617 \u22480.002732.\n\nSo total \u22481.7806176 +0.002732 \u22481.78335.\n\nSo e^0.5785 \u22481.78335.\n\nSo e^(-0.5785)=1/1.78335\u22480.5615.\n\nSo P(150)=1-0.5615=0.4385, which is 43.85%, approximately 44%.\n\nAh, that's option A) 44%.\n\nSo the correct answer is A) 44%.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought ln(0.68) was about -0.417, I got a higher value, but that was incorrect because the correct value of ln(0.68) is around -0.38566. So I must have made a mistake in the earlier expansion.\n\nSo the correct calculation gives P=43.85%, which rounds to 44%, option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows some kind of exponential law. Let me think. Oh right, the decay follows an exponential probability model. So the probability of decay doesn't depend on when it decayed, only on the time remaining.\n\nThe problem says that the decay probability of the atom is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, so the probability P is 32% over 100 minutes. I need to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, but 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Oh, right, so the first 50 minutes didn't happen, so we're looking at the remaining time.\n\nWait, no. The atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, so now we're looking from the current time, how likely it is to decay in the next 150 minutes. So the total time from now is 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but how is the decay probability related to time? I think the probability is given for a certain time interval, which relates to the decay constant. Let me recall the formula. The formula for the probability of decay in time t is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant.\n\nWait, another way to think: the decay follows a Poisson process, so the probability that the nucleus hasn't decayed after time t is e^(-\u03bbt). So the survival probability is that, and the decay probability is 1 minus that.\n\nBut in the problem, we're told that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%. So P(100) = 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). So we can solve for \u03bb.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's rearrange:\n\ne^(-\u03bb*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nTake natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n-\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68)\n\nSo \u03bb = -ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68): ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. Let me think, ln(0.68) is approximately... Let me compute it more accurately. I can approximate ln(0.7) is about -0.3567. Wait, 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7. So ln(0.68) is maybe around -0.385. Hmm, but I should get the exact value. Alternatively, I can use a calculator in my mind.\n\nWait, maybe I should just carry it as a variable for now. So \u03bb = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100 \u2248 (0.38566) / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, let me calculate it more accurately. Let's think: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So the negative of that is 0.38566. So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo now, we have to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. Wait, no, the 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the time remaining is 150 minutes from now. So the total time being considered is 150 minutes.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So the initial decay probability was given for 100 minutes, but now we're looking beyond that? Or is the 100 minutes from the start, and 50 have passed, so 50 left? Hmm, wait, let me read the question again.\n\nThe decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability from time zero to 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed (so time is at t=50), and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, which would take us to t=200 (50 + 150).\n\nWait, no. Because the next 150 minutes after the current time would be 150 minutes from now. So the total time since the start is 50 +150=200 minutes. So the probability to decay between t=50 to t=200 is what we're looking for.\n\nWait, but the decay is a memoryless process, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes from t=50 is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from t=0, given that it hasn't decayed before t=50. Because the decay doesn't have memory of previous times.\n\nSo the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%. So \u03bb is fixed.\n\nWait, but the 50 minutes have passed, so the decay hasn't happened yet. So the probability we're looking for is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=50+150=200. So the probability is P(150) as I thought.\n\nAlternatively, it's the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, starting from the current time, which is the same as P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nBut wait, since the decay is memoryless, the fact that it didn't decay in the first 50 minutes doesn't affect the probability beyond that point. So the probability to decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability to decay in 150 minutes starting from time zero.\n\nWait, no. Because the decay is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed, as long as it hasn't decayed yet. So yes, the probability is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t).\n\nSo now, let's compute P(150). We already have \u03bb from the first part.\n\nWe found \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150)\n\nCalculating the exponent: 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) is approximately?\n\nHmm, e^0.5 is about 1.6487, so e^0.578 is higher. Wait, wait, wait. No, because 0.578 is negative, so e^(-0.578) is 1/(e^0.578).\n\ne^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.6 is about 1.8221. 0.578 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's approximate e^0.578.\n\nLet me think, 0.578 is approximately 0.578. So, using a Taylor expansion or linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nAt x=0.5, e^x=1.64872\n\nx=0.6, e^x=1.82212\n\nThe difference between x=0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1, and the e^x increases by about 0.1734 (1.82212-1.64872=0.1734). So per 0.01 increase in x, e^x increases by about 0.1734/10=0.01734.\n\nSo for x=0.578, that's 0.078 above 0.5. So 0.078 * 0.01734 per 0.01, but wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the linear approximation.\n\nThe slope at x=0.5 is e^0.5 \u2248 1.64872. The derivative is same as the function value, so slope is 1.64872.\n\nSo at x=0.5, the function is 1.64872. For dx=0.078, the approximate e^x is 1.64872 + 0.078 *1.64872.\n\nSo 0.078 * 1.64872 \u2248 0.1287.\n\nSo e^0.578 \u2248 1.64872 + 0.1287 \u2248 1.7774.\n\nSo e^0.578 \u22481.7774. So 1/e^0.578 \u2248 1/1.7774 \u2248 0.562.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator-like approach. Let's see:\n\nln(2)=0.6931. So 0.578 is less than that, so e^0.578 is less than 2.\n\nWait, but I think my approximation is close enough. So e^(-0.578) \u2248 0.562.\n\nSo P(150) = 1 - 0.562 = 0.438, or 43.8%. Hmm, the options are 44%, which is option A. So the answer would be A) 44%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute \u03bb more accurately.\n\nEarlier, we had \u03bb = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100.\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68) more accurately. Let's think, 0.68 is e^x, what's x?\n\nWe know that ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667, and ln(0.68) is a bit lower.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the Taylor series for ln(x) around x=0.7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ln(2/3) is about -0.4055, but 0.68 is 2/3 is 0.6667, so 0.68 is a bit higher. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me think: ln(0.68) can be calculated using the expansion for ln(x) around x=1.\n\nThe expansion is ln(x) = (x-1) - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - (x-1)^4/4 + ... for |x-1| <1.\n\nSo x=0.68, x-1 = -0.32.\n\nSo ln(0.68) = (-0.32) - ( (-0.32)^2 )/2 + ( (-0.32)^3 )/3 - ( (-0.32)^4 )/4 + ... \n\nLet's compute term by term.\n\nFirst term: -0.32.\n\nSecond term: (0.32^2)/2 = (0.1024)/2=0.0512. So subtract this: -0.32 - 0.0512= -0.3712.\n\nThird term: (-0.32)^3 = -0.032768. Divided by 3: -0.0109227. So adding this: -0.3712 + (-0.0109227) \u2192 Wait no, wait the third term is + (x-1)^3 /3. Since (x-1) is -0.32, (x-1)^3 is (-0.32)^3 = -0.032768. So the third term is (-0.032768)/3 \u2248 -0.0109227. So adding that gives: -0.32 -0.0512 -0.0109227 = -0.3821227.\n\nFourth term: (x-1)^4 = (-0.32)^4 = 0.1048576. Divided by 4: 0.0262144. So subtract this: -0.3821227 - 0.0262144 = -0.4083371.\n\nFifth term: (x-1)^5 = (-0.32)^5 = -0.033554432. Divided by 5: -0.006710886. Adding this: -0.4083371 + (-0.006710886) \u2192 wait, no, the expansion is ln(x) = sum from n=1 to infty [ ( (-1)^(n+1) (x-1)^n ) /n ].\n\nWait, correction: ln(x) = (x-1) - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - (x-1)^4/4 + ... \n\nSo the terms alternate signs. So term 1: -(x-1) is -(-0.32) = 0.32? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me redo.\n\nWait, x=0.68, so x-1= -0.32.\n\nThe expansion is:\n\nln(x) = (x-1) - ( (x-1)^2 )/2 + ( (x-1)^3 )/3 - ( (x-1)^4 )/4 + ( (x-1)^5 )/5 - ... \n\nSo substituting x=0.68:\n\nln(0.68) = (-0.32) - ( (-0.32)^2 )/2 + ( (-0.32)^3 )/3 - ( (-0.32)^4 )/4 + ( (-0.32)^5 )/5 - ... \n\nLet me compute each term up to the fifth term to approximate.\n\nTerm 1: -0.32.\n\nTerm 2: - ( (0.32)^2 ) / 2 = -(0.1024)/2 = -0.0512. So adding this gives: -0.32 -0.0512 = -0.3712.\n\nTerm3: + ( (-0.32)^3 ) /3 = (-0.032768)/3 \u2248 -0.01092267. So adding this: -0.3712 -0.01092267 \u2248 -0.3821227.\n\nTerm4: - ( (0.32)^4 ) /4 = - (0.1048576)/4 = -0.0262144. So adding: -0.3821227 -0.0262144 \u2248 -0.4083371.\n\nTerm5: + ( (-0.32)^5 )/5 = (-0.033554432)/5 \u2248 -0.006710886.

Oh, because I had earlier taken ln(0.68) as approximately -0.385, but with this expansion, it's about -0.417.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my initial approximation was a bit off. Let me redo the calculation with this more accurate \u03bb.\n\nSo \u03bb \u2248 0.004172277 per minute.\n\nNow, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nSo \u03bb*150 = 0.004172277 *150 \u2248 0.62584155.\n\nSo e^(-0.62584155) is approximately?\n\nHmm, e^0.6 is approximately 1.8221. So e^0.6258 is a bit higher. Let's compute e^0.6258.\n\nWe can compute ln(1.868) is about 0.625, because e^0.625 \u2248 1.868.\n\nWait, let's check: e^0.6 is 1.8221, e^0.625: let's compute.\n\nLet me compute e^0.625.\n\nWe can use the Taylor expansion around x=0.6.\n\nLet me compute e^0.625 = e^(0.6 + 0.025) = e^0.6 * e^0.025.\n\nWe know e^0.6 \u22481.8221.\n\ne^0.025 is approximately 1 + 0.025 + (0.025)^2/2 + (0.025)^3/6.\n\nWhich is 1 + 0.025 + 0.0003125 + 0.00002604 \u2248 1.02533854.\n\nSo e^0.625 \u2248 1.8221 * 1.02533854 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n1.8221 * 1.025 \u2248 1.8221 *1 =1.8221, 1.8221 *0.025=0.0455525. So total approx 1.86765.\n\nSo e^0.625 \u22481.86765.\n\nSo e^(-0.6258) \u2248 1/1.86765 \u2248 0.5355.\n\nSo P =1 - 0.5355= 0.4645, or 46.45%.\n\nHmm, that's about 46.45%, which isn't an option. The options are 44%, 40%,52%,48%.\n\nWait, perhaps my approximation of e^0.6258 is off.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use more accurate calculation for e^(-0.62584155).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as 1/(e^0.62584155).\n\nLet me compute e^0.62584155.\n\nWe can note that 0.62584155 is approximately 0.6258.\n\nAnother approach: e^0.6258 is the same as e^(6258/10000) \u2248 but perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the calculator approach.\n\nWe know that ln(1.868) is approximately 0.625, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute e^0.62584155.\n\nLet me use a calculator method. Let me compute 0.62584155.\n\nWe can note that 0.6258 is approximately 0.625 +0.00084155.\n\nWe have e^0.625 \u22481.868.\n\nSo e^0.62584155 = e^(0.625 +0.00084155) = e^0.625 * e^0.00084155.\n\ne^0.00084155 \u22481 + 0.00084155 + (0.00084155)^2/2 \u2248 1.00084155 + 0.000000355 \u22481.0008419.\n\nSo e^0.62584155 \u22481.868 *1.0008419 \u22481.868 *1.000842.\n\n1.868 *1.0008 =1.868 *1 +1.868*0.0008 =1.868 +0.0014944 =1.8694944.\n\nSo e^0.62584155 \u22481.8695.\n\nSo e^(-0.62584155) \u22481/1.8695 \u22480.5345.\n\nThus, P=1-0.5345=0.4655, which is 46.55%.\n\nHmm, that's about 46.5%, which is close to 46.5%. But the options are 44,40,52,48. So the closest is 48%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed ln(0.68)= -0.417, which led to \u03bb=0.004172.\n\nWait, but let me recompute \u03bb more accurately.\n\nEarlier, using the expansion up to term9, ln(0.68)\u2248-0.4172277.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.4172277 / 100 = 0.004172277 per minute.\n\nThen, \u03bb*150=0.004172277 *150=0.62584155.\n\nSo e^(-0.62584155)= 0.5345.\n\nSo P=1-0.5345=0.4655, which is 46.55%. Hmm, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So P(100)=0.32.\n\nSo 0.32=1-e^(-\u03bb*100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 \u03bb= - ln(0.68)/100.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the initial assumption. Because when 50 minutes have passed, the decay probability is 32% for the next 100 minutes? Or is it the total time?\n\nWait, let me read the question again.\n\nThe decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the initial 100 minutes.\n\nBut now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and the remaining time is 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, the 32% is the probability over 100 minutes. So from t=0 to t=100, the probability is 32%. Now, at t=50, we want to find the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 (150 minutes later). So the time in consideration is 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but the decay is memoryless. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nBut with \u03bb calculated from P(100)=0.32.\n\nSo if I compute P(150), I should get the correct value.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation gave me about 46.5%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of \u03bb.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68) more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566248.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I messed up earlier. Let me get the exact value.\n\nWait, I think I confused the approximation earlier. Let me compute ln(0.68) using a calculator.\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3856624808.\n\nSo \u03bb= 0.3856624808 / 100 \u22480.0038566248 per minute.\n\nThen, \u03bb*150=0.0038566248 *150= 0.57849372.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849372) is approximately?\n\nWe can compute this as 1/(e^0.57849372).\n\nWe can compute e^0.57849372.\n\nHmm, e^0.5 is about 1.64872, e^0.57849372.\n\nWe can compute e^0.57849372.\n\nWe can approximate this using a Taylor series or using known values.\n\nWe know that ln(1.782) is approximately 0.578.\n\nWait, let's compute e^0.57849372.\n\nWe can note that 0.57849372 is approximately 0.5785.\n\ne^0.5785 = ?\n\nAlternatively, let me think: e^0.5 = 1.64872, e^0.6=1.82212.\n\n0.5785 is 0.0785 above 0.5. Let's compute e^0.5785 = e^0.5 * e^0.0785.\n\nWe know e^0.0785 \u22481 + 0.0785 + (0.0785)^2/2 + (0.0785)^3/6.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm1: 0.0785.\n\nTerm2: (0.0785)^2 = 0.00616225, divided by 2: 0.003081125.\n\nTerm3: (0.0785)^3 \u22480.0785 *0.00616225 \u22480.0004835, divided by 6: ~0.00008058.\n\nSo e^0.0785 \u22481 +0.0785 +0.003081125 +0.00008058 \u22481.0816617.\n\nSo e^0.5785 = e^0.5 * e^0.0785 \u22481.64872 *1.0816617.\n\nCompute that: 1.64872 *1.08 = 1.64872 *1 + 1.64872 *0.08 =1.64872 +0.1318976=1.7806176.\n\nBut more accurately, 1.64872 *1.0816617.\n\nCompute 1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.7806176.\n\nThen, 1.64872 *0.0016617 \u22480.002732.\n\nSo total \u22481.7806176 +0.002732 \u22481.78335.\n\nSo e^0.5785 \u22481.78335.\n\nSo e^(-0.5785)=1/1.78335\u22480.5615.\n\nSo P(150)=1-0.5615=0.4385, which is 43.85%, approximately 44%.\n\nAh, that's option A) 44%.\n\nSo the correct answer is A) 44%.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought ln(0.68) was about -0.417, I got a higher value, but that was incorrect because the correct value of ln(0.68) is around -0.38566. So I must have made a mistake in the earlier expansion.\n\nSo the correct calculation gives P=43.85%, which rounds to 44%, option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model, where the probability of decay in a given time \\( t \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant. The problem states that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, i.e., \\( P(100) = 0.32 \\). Using this, we can calculate \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\( \\lambda \\)\nFrom \\( P(100) = 0.32 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n0.32 = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100}\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\ne^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.68\n\\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\n-\\lambda \\cdot 100 = \\ln(0.68)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.38566 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.38566}{100} \\approx 0.0038566 \\, \\text{per minute}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes\nWe need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, starting from the current time. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.0038566 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.57849\n\\]\n\nNow calculate \\( e^{-0.57849} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem is about an atom that's supposed to decay, and we're given some probabilities. The question is about finding the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without it decaying. Hmm.\n\nWait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, right? The basic formula for the probability of decay is something like N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant, t is time. But wait, in this case, we're dealing with probabilities, so maybe it's about the decay probability over a certain time.\n\nThe question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that the atom decays in the first 100 minutes. I think that's the same as saying the probability of decay in time T is 0.32 when T=100 minutes.\n\nI need to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after the initial 50 minutes have passed. So total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the decay process is memoryless, right? So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the probability after that point. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from any starting point.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me think again. The 32% is the probability of decay in 100 minutes. So first, I need to find the decay constant \u03bb. Because once I have \u03bb, I can compute the probability for any time.\n\nSo the decay probability in time T is given by P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbT). Wait, because the survival probability is e^(-\u03bbT), so the decay probability is 1 minus that. So for T=100 minutes, P=0.32.\n\nSo 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). Let's rearrange this.\n\ne^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural log on both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68) is approximately, let's see. I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(e^-0.4) is about -0.4, but e^-0.4 is around 0.67, which is close to 0.68. Wait, e^-0.4 is about 0.6703. So ln(0.6703) is -0.4. So ln(0.68) would be a bit less negative, maybe around -0.405.\n\nSo \u03bb \u2248 0.405 / 100 \u2248 0.00405 per minute.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because the equation is \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. So the negative of ln(0.68) is positive, so \u03bb is 0.00405 per minute.\n\nWait, but I can calculate it more accurately. Let me compute ln(0.68). Alternatively, using a calculator if I had one. But for the sake of this problem, let's proceed with the approximate value.\n\nSo now, the question is: what's the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay. But as the decay is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time zero. So I think I just calculate P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nBut wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the approach should consider that after 50 minutes, the remaining probability is that it hasn't decayed yet. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays within 150 minutes after 50 minutes have passed. Since the process is memoryless, the decay constant doesn't change, so it's equivalent to a fresh atom.\n\nWait, but no, wait. The decay process is memoryless, so the fact that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes doesn't affect the future probabilities. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from now, which is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWait, but let me check that. Another way to think: the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the same as the probability that it decays within 150 minutes starting at t=50. So that's the same as the probability of decaying in a 150-minute interval, which is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo I think that's the way to go. So I need to calculate 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nBut wait, I already have \u03bb from the given 100-minute data.\n\nSo let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, find \u03bb.\n\nGiven P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb).\n\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTake ln: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68).\n\n\u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCompute ln(0.68): using calculator, ln(0.68)= approximately -0.38566.\n\nWait, wait, because e^-0.4 is about 0.6703, so ln(0.68) is a bit more than -0.4. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.385662.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, compute the probability of decay in 150 minutes: P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo \u03bb*150 = 0.00385662 * 150 = 0.578493.\n\ne^-0.578493 \u2248 ?\n\nHmm, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.578 is between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nLet me compute e^-0.578493.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it as e^(-0.578493) \u2248 1 / e^0.578493.\n\ne^0.5 is about 1.64872, e^0.6 is about 1.82211.\n\n0.578493 is 0.5 + 0.078493.\n\ne^0.5 = 1.64872.\n\ne^0.078493 \u2248 1 + 0.078493 + (0.078493^2)/2 \u2248 1.078493 + 0.00308 \u2248 1.08157.\n\nSo e^0.578493 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08157 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 * 1 + 1.64872 *0.08.\n\n1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176.\n\nSo e^0.578493 \u2248 1.7806.\n\nSo e^-0.578493 \u2248 1/1.7806 \u2248 0.5616.\n\nSo P = 1 - 0.5616 = 0.4384, or 43.84%.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option A) 44%, and option D is 48%, but 43.84 is close to 44%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation because perhaps my approximation for e^0.578 is a bit off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a calculator would give a more precise value. Let me try to compute e^-0.578493 more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566, and \u03bb is 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nSo \u03bb *150 = 0.578493.\n\nCompute e^(-0.578493) using a calculator (if I had one). Alternatively, I can use the Taylor expansion around x=0.5, but that might take time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a better approximation.\n\nWait, 0.578493 is approximately 0.5785.\n\ne^-0.5785 = ?\n\nWell, e^-0.5 = 0.60653066.\n\ne^-0.0785: Let me compute e^-0.0785.\n\ne^-0.0785 \u2248 1 - 0.0785 + (0.0785^2)/2 - (0.0785^3)/6.\n\n0.0785^2 = ~0.00616225; divided by 2 is ~0.003081125.\n\n0.0785^3 = 0.0785 * 0.00616225 \u2248 0.0004833; divided by 6 is ~0.00008055.\n\nSo e^-0.0785 \u2248 1 -0.0785 +0.003081125 -0.00008055 \u2248 1 - 0.0785 is 0.9215, plus 0.003081125 is 0.92458, minus 0.00008055 gives 0.9245.\n\nSo e^-0.5785 = e^-(0.5 + 0.0785) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.0785 \u2248 0.6065 * 0.9245 \u2248 0.6065 *0.9245.\n\nCompute 0.6065 * 0.9 = 0.54585; 0.6065 *0.0245= approx 0.01485.\n\nAdding them: 0.54585 + 0.01485 \u2248 0.5607.\n\nSo e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.5607. So 1 - 0.5607 is 0.4393, or 43.93%.\n\nSo approximately 43.9% chance of decay in 150 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 44%, which is very close. But wait, another way to approach this is to compute the decay constant more precisely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation of \u03bb. Let me re-calculate \u03bb using more precise numbers.\n\nGiven that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so:\n\nP(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb).\n\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\n-100\u03bb = ln(0.68).\n\n\u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCompute ln(0.68):\n\nUsing calculator, ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566248.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.38566248 / 100 = 0.0038566248 per minute.\n\nNow, the time we're interested in is 150 minutes.\n\nSo \u03bb *150 = 0.0038566248 * 150 = 0.57849372.\n\nNow, compute e^-0.57849372.\n\nUsing a calculator, e^-0.57849372 \u2248 0.5616.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5616 = 0.4384, which is 43.84%, so 43.84% probability.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 44% (option A) and option D is 48%. So the closest is option A, 44%.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Because the question says that 50 minutes have passed without decay. So perhaps I should compute the probability from the remaining time, considering that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because the decay process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes from any point. So I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nBut another way: the probability that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *50). Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the probability that it decays in the 150-minute period starting at t=50.\n\nBut since the process is memoryless, this is equivalent to the probability that a fresh atom decays in 150 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) = 0.4384.\n\nSo the answer should be approximately 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options are:\n\nA)44%\n\nB)40%\n\nC)52%\n\nD)48%\n\nSo option A is 44%, which is the correct answer based on our calculations.\n\nWait, but another approach: the half-life formula. Maybe I can compute the half-life and see if it aligns.\n\nThe half-life T_1/2 is ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nWe have \u03bb=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo T_1/2 \u2248 0.6931 / 0.0038566 \u2248 180 minutes.\n\nHmm, so the half-life is about 180 minutes.\n\nNow, the initial data says that in 100 minutes, 32% decay. That makes sense because after 180 minutes, 50% would have decayed. So in 100 minutes, which is less than the half-life, about 32% decayed, which fits.\n\nNow, the probability of decay in 150 minutes would be 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nWith \u03bb=0.0038566, 150 * \u03bb = 0.57849.\n\ne^-0.57849 \u2248 0.5616. So 1 - 0.5616 = 0.4384, which is 43.84%, so 44%, option A.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is A)44%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem is about an atom that's supposed to decay, and we're given some probabilities. The question is about finding the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without it decaying. Hmm.\n\nWait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, right? The basic formula for the probability of decay is something like N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant, t is time. But wait, in this case, we're dealing with probabilities, so maybe it's about the decay probability over a certain time.\n\nThe question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that the atom decays in the first 100 minutes. I think that's the same as saying the probability of decay in time T is 0.32 when T=100 minutes.\n\nI need to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after the initial 50 minutes have passed. So total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the decay process is memoryless, right? So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the probability after that point. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from any starting point.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me think again. The 32% is the probability of decay in 100 minutes. So first, I need to find the decay constant \u03bb. Because once I have \u03bb, I can compute the probability for any time.\n\nSo the decay probability in time T is given by P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbT). Wait, because the survival probability is e^(-\u03bbT), so the decay probability is 1 minus that. So for T=100 minutes, P=0.32.\n\nSo 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). Let's rearrange this.\n\ne^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural log on both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68) is approximately, let's see. I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(e^-0.4) is about -0.4, but e^-0.4 is around 0.67, which is close to 0.68. Wait, e^-0.4 is about 0.6703. So ln(0.6703) is -0.4. So ln(0.68) would be a bit less negative, maybe around -0.405.\n\nSo \u03bb \u2248 0.405 / 100 \u2248 0.00405 per minute.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because the equation is \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. So the negative of ln(0.68) is positive, so \u03bb is 0.00405 per minute.\n\nWait, but I can calculate it more accurately. Let me compute ln(0.68). Alternatively, using a calculator if I had one. But for the sake of this problem, let's proceed with the approximate value.\n\nSo now, the question is: what's the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay. But as the decay is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time zero. So I think I just calculate P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nBut wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the approach should consider that after 50 minutes, the remaining probability is that it hasn't decayed yet. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays within 150 minutes after 50 minutes have passed. Since the process is memoryless, the decay constant doesn't change, so it's equivalent to a fresh atom.\n\nWait, but no, wait. The decay process is memoryless, so the fact that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes doesn't affect the future probabilities. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from now, which is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWait, but let me check that. Another way to think: the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the same as the probability that it decays within 150 minutes starting at t=50. So that's the same as the probability of decaying in a 150-minute interval, which is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo I think that's the way to go. So I need to calculate 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nBut wait, I already have \u03bb from the given 100-minute data.\n\nSo let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, find \u03bb.\n\nGiven P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb).\n\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTake ln: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68).\n\n\u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCompute ln(0.68): using calculator, ln(0.68)= approximately -0.38566.\n\nWait, wait, because e^-0.4 is about 0.6703, so ln(0.68) is a bit more than -0.4. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.385662.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, compute the probability of decay in 150 minutes: P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo \u03bb*150 = 0.00385662 * 150 = 0.578493.\n\ne^-0.578493 \u2248 ?\n\nHmm, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.578 is between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nLet me compute e^-0.578493.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it as e^(-0.578493) \u2248 1 / e^0.578493.\n\ne^0.5 is about 1.64872, e^0.6 is about 1.82211.\n\n0.578493 is 0.5 + 0.078493.\n\ne^0.5 = 1.64872.\n\ne^0.078493 \u2248 1 + 0.078493 + (0.078493^2)/2 \u2248 1.078493 + 0.00308 \u2248 1.08157.\n\nSo e^0.578493 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08157 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 * 1 + 1.64872 *0.08.\n\n1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176.\n\nSo e^0.578493 \u2248 1.7806.\n\nSo e^-0.578493 \u2248 1/1.7806 \u2248 0.5616.\n\nSo P = 1 - 0.5616 = 0.4384, or 43.84%.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option A) 44%, and option D is 48%, but 43.84 is close to 44%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation because perhaps my approximation for e^0.578 is a bit off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a calculator would give a more precise value. Let me try to compute e^-0.578493 more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566, and \u03bb is 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nSo \u03bb *150 = 0.578493.\n\nCompute e^(-0.578493) using a calculator (if I had one). Alternatively, I can use the Taylor expansion around x=0.5, but that might take time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a better approximation.\n\nWait, 0.578493 is approximately 0.5785.\n\ne^-0.5785 = ?\n\nWell, e^-0.5 = 0.60653066.\n\ne^-0.0785: Let me compute e^-0.0785.\n\ne^-0.0785 \u2248 1 - 0.0785 + (0.0785^2)/2 - (0.0785^3)/6.\n\n0.0785^2 = ~0.00616225; divided by 2 is ~0.003081125.\n\n0.0785^3 = 0.0785 * 0.00616225 \u2248 0.0004833; divided by 6 is ~0.00008055.\n\nSo e^-0.0785 \u2248 1 -0.0785 +0.003081125 -0.00008055 \u2248 1 - 0.0785 is 0.9215, plus 0.003081125 is 0.92458, minus 0.00008055 gives 0.9245.\n\nSo e^-0.5785 = e^-(0.5 + 0.0785) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.0785 \u2248 0.6065 * 0.9245 \u2248 0.6065 *0.9245.\n\nCompute 0.6065 * 0.9 = 0.54585; 0.6065 *0.0245= approx 0.01485.\n\nAdding them: 0.54585 + 0.01485 \u2248 0.5607.\n\nSo e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.5607. So 1 - 0.5607 is 0.4393, or 43.93%.\n\nSo approximately 43.9% chance of decay in 150 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 44%, which is very close. But wait, another way to approach this is to compute the decay constant more precisely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation of \u03bb. Let me re-calculate \u03bb using more precise numbers.\n\nGiven that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so:\n\nP(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb).\n\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\n-100\u03bb = ln(0.68).\n\n\u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCompute ln(0.68):\n\nUsing calculator, ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566248.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.38566248 / 100 = 0.0038566248 per minute.\n\nNow, the time we're interested in is 150 minutes.\n\nSo \u03bb *150 = 0.0038566248 * 150 = 0.57849372.\n\nNow, compute e^-0.57849372.\n\nUsing a calculator, e^-0.57849372 \u2248 0.5616.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5616 = 0.4384, which is 43.84%, so 43.84% probability.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 44% (option A) and option D is 48%. So the closest is option A, 44%.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Because the question says that 50 minutes have passed without decay. So perhaps I should compute the probability from the remaining time, considering that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because the decay process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes from any point. So I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nBut another way: the probability that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *50). Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the probability that it decays in the 150-minute period starting at t=50.\n\nBut since the process is memoryless, this is equivalent to the probability that a fresh atom decays in 150 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) = 0.4384.\n\nSo the answer should be approximately 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options are:\n\nA)44%\n\nB)40%\n\nC)52%\n\nD)48%\n\nSo option A is 44%, which is the correct answer based on our calculations.\n\nWait, but another approach: the half-life formula. Maybe I can compute the half-life and see if it aligns.\n\nThe half-life T_1/2 is ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nWe have \u03bb=0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo T_1/2 \u2248 0.6931 / 0.0038566 \u2248 180 minutes.\n\nHmm, so the half-life is about 180 minutes.\n\nNow, the initial data says that in 100 minutes, 32% decay. That makes sense because after 180 minutes, 50% would have decayed. So in 100 minutes, which is less than the half-life, about 32% decayed, which fits.\n\nNow, the probability of decay in 150 minutes would be 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nWith \u03bb=0.0038566, 150 * \u03bb = 0.57849.\n\ne^-0.57849 \u2248 0.5616. So 1 - 0.5616 = 0.4384, which is 43.84%, so 44%, option A.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is A)44%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model for radioactive atoms.

Let's see what I remember from my studies. \n\nThe question says that an atom has a 32% probability of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, so that's 150 minutes from now, making the total time 200 minutes? Or is it 150 minutes from the initial time? Wait, the way it's phrased, \"next 150 minutes,\" so starting from now, adding 150 minutes. So the total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.\n\nBut wait, I remember that radioactive decay is a Poisson process, which means it's memoryless. Oh right, the key here is that the decay process doesn't depend on the time that has already passed. So the probability of decay depends only on the time remaining, not on how long it's been since the start.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The decay probability given is 32% within 100 minutes. So that means the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32. But how is this probability calculated?\n\nRadioactive decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a nucleus decays within a time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. Alternatively, the half-life formula comes into play, but maybe I should relate the given probability to the decay constant.\n\nWait, the question states the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, P(100) = 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). I can solve for \u03bb.\n\nLet me compute that. Rearranging: e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68): ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but 0.68 is a bit less than 2/3. Let me compute it more accurately. \n\nWait, ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. So \u03bb = 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo the decay constant \u03bb is approximately 0.0038566 min^-1.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Since the process is memoryless, the probability only depends on the time elapsed since the last decay. So right now, the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. But since it's memoryless, the remaining time is 150 minutes. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Because the initial 100-minute probability is 32%, which is for the first 100 minutes. So if the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50, what's the chance it will decay in the next 150 minutes (total of 200 minutes from the start)?\n\nAlternatively, since the process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting from time zero. Or does the time already elapsed affect it?\n\nWait no, the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is independent of how much time has already passed. So the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo let me compute that. \n\nWe have \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nCompute 150 * \u03bb = 150 * 0.0038566 \u2248 0.57849.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) \u2248 Let me compute that. e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator approach: 0.57849 is about 0.578.\n\nCompute e^(-0.578):\n\nWe know that ln(2) is about 0.693. So 0.578 is less than that. Let's compute e^-0.578.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a Taylor expansion? Or I can approximate it. Alternatively, since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can think of it as 1/(e^0.578).\n\ne^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.578 is a bit more. Let's see: e^0.578 \u2248 e^0.5 * e^0.078. \n\ne^0.078 is approximately 1 + 0.078 + (0.078)^2/2 \u2248 1 + 0.078 + 0.00304 \u2248 1.08104. \n\nSo e^0.5 is 1.6487, multiplied by 1.08104: \n\n1.6487 * 1.08 \u2248 Let's compute that. 1.6487 * 1 = 1.6487, 1.6487 * 0.08 = 0.1319. So total \u2248 1.7806.\n\nSo e^0.578 \u2248 ~1.7806. Therefore, e^-0.578 \u2248 1 / 1.7806 \u2248 approximately 0.5617.\n\nSo P(150) = 1 - 0.5617 = 0.4383, which is about 43.83%. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 44%, which is close. But wait, maybe my approximation was a bit rough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check the calculation of \u03bb.\n\nWe had P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). So e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTake ln of both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). \n\nln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but 0.68 is bigger than 2/3 (which is ~0.6667), so ln(0.68) is less negative. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566248.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.38566248 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566248 per minute.\n\nNow, for 150 minutes: \u03bb * t = 0.0038566248 * 150 = 0.57849372.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849372) is needed.\n\nLet me compute e^-0.57849372 more precisely. \n\nWe can use the Taylor series for e^-x around x=0. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps using a known value.\n\nWait, e^-0.578 is approximately 0.5615? Let me think. Wait, I remember that e^-0.5 \u2248 0.6065, e^-0.6\u22480.5488. So 0.578 is between 0.5 and 0.6. \n\nLet me compute e^(-0.578) more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a calculator-like approach. Let's compute e^-0.57849.\n\nLet me consider that 0.57849 is approximately 0.5785.\n\nCompute e^-0.5785:\n\nWe can write this as e^-(0.5 + 0.0785) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.0785.\n\ne^-0.5 is about 0.60653066.\n\ne^-0.0785: Compute e^-0.0785. Using the Taylor series up to the third term:\n\ne^-x \u2248 1 - x + x\u00b2/2 - x\u00b3/6.\n\nx = 0.0785.\n\nSo:\n\n1 - 0.0785 = 0.9215.\n\n+ (0.0785)^2 / 2 = 0.006162/2 = 0.003081. Now, 0.9215 + 0.003081 = 0.924581.\n\n- (0.0785)^3 /6. (0.0785)^3 is about 0.0785 * 0.0785 = 0.006162; multiplied by 0.0785 gives ~0.000482. Divided by 6: ~0.0000803. So subtract that: 0.924581 - 0.0000803 \u2248 0.9245.\n\nSo e^-0.0785 \u2248 0.9245. Therefore, e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.60653 * 0.9245 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n0.60653 * 0.9 = 0.545877.\n\n0.60653 * 0.0245 = approx 0.60653 * 0.02 is 0.01213, and 0.60653 * 0.0045 \u2248 0.002729. So total is 0.01213 + 0.002729 = 0.014859.\n\nSo adding to 0.545877, gives 0.545877 + 0.014859 \u2248 0.560736.\n\nSo e^-0.5785 \u2248 ~0.5607.\n\nThus, P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, or about 43.93%. So approximately 44%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 44%. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait a second, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total time. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So P(100) = 0.32.\n\nWe've computed \u03bb correctly, so the next step is correct. So the probability in the next 150 minutes is 44%, so the answer is A.\n\nBut wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is being interpreted as the decay probability being 32% per 100 minutes, so maybe it's a half-life problem?\n\nWait, but the 32% is the probability of decay within 100 minutes. The half-life (T_1/2) is the time it takes for half the atoms to decay. But the decay constant \u03bb is related to the half-life by T_1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nBut in this problem, since the given is a probability, the exponential model applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the decay probability as 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to approach: perhaps the 32% is the activity, but no, that's not relevant here. The question is about the probability of decay, so exponential model is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is a bit tricky. The 50 minutes have passed without decay, so the remaining time is 150 minutes. So the total time is 200 minutes. But because the process is memoryless, the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from now, which is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes regardless of the past.\n\nSo, the probability is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150). Which we calculated as approximately 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me think if I've made any wrong assumptions. The problem says \"the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So that's the probability that it decays in the first 100 minutes. So that's 32%, which is 0.32.\n\nSo, yes, we found \u03bb correctly. So the calculation of 44% seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if the options include 44%: yes, option A is 44%.\n\nWait, but another thought: the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, but what if the 50 minutes have already passed, and the 150 minutes is the remaining time until the next observation. So the total time would be 200 minutes. But no, because the decay probability in the next 150 minutes is just about that interval, not the total time. Because the process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed.\n\nSo I think my initial approach is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what I remember from my studies. \n\nThe question says that an atom has a 32% probability of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, so that's 150 minutes from now, making the total time 200 minutes? Or is it 150 minutes from the initial time? Wait, the way it's phrased, \"next 150 minutes,\" so starting from now, adding 150 minutes.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68).

Because the process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed.\n\nSo I think my initial approach is correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model, which states that the probability of a nucleus decaying within a time \\( t \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant. The problem provides that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \\( P(100) = 0.32 \\). Using this, we can solve for \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n### Step 1: Solve for \\( \\lambda \\)\nFrom \\( P(100) = 0.32 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n0.32 = 1 - e^{-100\\lambda}\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\ne^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68\n\\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\n-100\\lambda = \\ln(0.68)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{-\\ln(0.68)}{100}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.38566 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.38566}{100} \\approx 0.0038566 \\, \\text{min}^{-1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes\nThe question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability depends only on the remaining time (150 minutes). Using the decay probability formula:\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.0038566 \\) and \\( t = 150 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.57849\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-0.57849}\n\\]\n\nTo compute \\( e^{-0.57849} \\), we approximate:\n\n\\[\ne^{-0.57849} \\approx 0.5615\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - 0.5615 \\approx 0.4385 \\, \\text{or} \\, 43.85\\%\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Match the closest option\nThe closest option to 43.85% is **44%**, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows something called an exponential law. Let me think. Oh right, the decay probability over time isn't linear; it's based on half-lives or something like that. \n\nThe question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, but probability is different from activity or something else. So if the probability that the atom decays within 100 minutes is 32%, that must be the cumulative probability up to 100 minutes. \n\nNow, the situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but 50 minutes have already passed, so the next 150 minutes would make the total time 200 minutes? Or do I consider the remaining time? No, wait, the question is about the next 150 minutes, regardless of the initial 50. Oh wait, no, because the decay hasn't happened yet. So we're looking at the probability from time t=50 to t=200 (which is 150 minutes later).\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think in terms of the decay constant. I remember that the decay law is N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. The probability that the atom has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). \n\nGiven that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (0.32), so:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100)\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\nTaking natural log on both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68)\nSo \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100\n\nLet me calculate that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.7) is around -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit less. Let me compute it accurately. Alternatively, I can use the exact value:\n\n\u03bb = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100. Because ln(0.68) is negative, so negative of that is positive.\n\nWait, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So \u03bb is 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, we're looking at the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200 minutes. Wait no, the next 150 minutes after t=50 is t=50 to t=200. So the total time is 200 minutes. But since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability from t=0 to t=50 is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*50). Wait, but the question is about the probability from t=50 to t=200. So the probability it decays in that interval is the probability that it decays by 200 minus the probability that it decayed by 50.\n\nSo, probability P = [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)\n\nWait, but let me plug in \u03bb. Let me compute each term.\n\nFirst, compute \u03bb: 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nCompute e^(-\u03bb*50):\n\n\u03bb *50 = 0.0038566 *50 = 0.19283\ne^-0.19283 \u2248 approximately 0.825. Let me compute more accurately. e^-0.1928 is about 0.825. Let me check: ln(0.825) is about -0.192, so yes.\n\nThen, e^(-\u03bb*200) is e^(-0.0038566 *200) = e^(-0.77132). What's that? e^-0.77 is about 0.463. Let me compute 0.77132: e^-0.77132 is approximately 0.462.\n\nSo the difference is 0.825 - 0.462 \u2248 0.363, or 36.3%. Hmm, but the options don't have 36%. Wait, the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the \u03bb value.\n\nWait, initial data: probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. So 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.32 \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 ln(0.68) = -100\u03bb \u2192 \u03bb = - ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute ln(0.68) accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator: ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566248.\n\nSo \u03bb \u2248 0.38566248 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566248 per minute.\n\nSo, e^(-\u03bb*50) = e^(-0.0038566248 *50) = e^(-0.19283124) \u2248 0.8253.\n\ne^(-\u03bb*200) = e^(-0.0038566248 *200) = e^(-0.77132496) \u2248 0.4623.\n\nSo the probability P is 0.8253 - 0.4623 = 0.363 or 36.3%. Hmm, but that's not an option. The options are 40%, 44%, 48%, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the question. Oh wait, the question says \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\" Oh wait, no, wait. The question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So the time left is not 150 minutes, but the next 150 minutes from now. So the total time is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes, but the time from now is 150 minutes.\n\nSo the probability is the chance that it decays between t=50 and t=50+150=200. So that's the same as I computed, which is 36.3%. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial setup.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the probability of decay within the next 150 minutes, regardless of the initial 50. Wait, no, because the 50 minutes have passed without decay.\n\nWait another approach: the probability that the atom hasn't decayed after 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*50). Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. Which is the same as 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200) - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200), which is the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet. So that would be the conditional probability.\n\nSo P(decays in next 150 | hasn't decayed in first 50) = [P(decays between 50 and 200)] / [P(not decayed by 50)].\n\nWait, but that's the same as P(decays in 50-200) / P(not decayed by 50). Which is [e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / e^(-\u03bb*50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*(200-50)) = 1 - e^(-150\u03bb).\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Let me think. If the atom hasn't decayed by t=50, the remaining time is 150 minutes. But the decay process is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes for a new atom. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the decay is exponential, the remaining probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). But that's only if the time is measured from the start. But in this case, the 50 minutes have already passed, but the decay hasn't happened yet. So the remaining probability is the same as if the atom is fresh, but the time is 150 minutes. So the probability would be 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Let me compute that.\n\n\u03bb is 0.0038566 per minute.\n\n\u03bb *150 = 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849\n\ne^(-0.57849) \u2248 e^-0.58 is about 0.5615.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5615 \u2248 0.4385, which is 43.85%. So about 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but earlier approach gave 36%. So which is correct? Oh, I think I confused two approaches. Let me clarify.\n\nApproach 1: The probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes (from now) is the same as the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200. So P = [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] = e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb).\n\nApproach 2: Since the process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability for a new atom to decay in 150 minutes. So P = 1 - e^(-150\u03bb).\n\nWhich approach is correct? Hmm. Wait, because the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet, is equal to 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So approach 2 is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. The original problem says that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. So we calculated \u03bb based on that. Then, given that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, the probability of decaying in the next 150 is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\n\u03bb = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\n150 * \u03bb = 0.57849\n\ne^-0.57849 \u2248 let me compute more accurately. e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nLet me calculate using a calculator:\n\n0.57849 is approximately 0.5785.\n\nCompute e^-0.5785.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series or approximate it.\n\nAlternatively, let me think in terms of known values. Let me compute ln(0.56):\n\nln(0.56) \u2248 -0.5798. Oh, that's close to 0.5785. So e^-0.5785 is approximately 0.56.\n\nWait, because ln(0.56) is approximately -0.5798, so e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.561 (since 0.5785 is very close to 0.5798). So e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.561.\n\nSo 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or 43.9%, which is approximately 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I did approach 1, I got 36.3%. So which is correct?\n\nAh, I think the confusion comes from whether the next 150 minutes is from the initial time (t=0) or from t=50.\n\nWait, the question says: \"So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\"\n\nSo the next 150 minutes are from the current time, which is t=50. So we're looking at t=50 to t=200. So the correct approach is to find the probability of decay in that interval.\n\nBut the memoryless property tells us that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as for a new atom. So that's approach 2, leading to 44% (option A).\n\nBut wait, let's compute both approaches.\n\nApproach 1: P = e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb).\n\nCompute each term:\n\ne^(-50\u03bb) = e^(-0.0038566 *50) = e^(-0.19283) \u2248 0.8253.\n\ne^(-200\u03bb) = e^(-0.0038566 *200) = e^(-0.77132) \u2248 0.4623.\n\nSo P = 0.8253 - 0.4623 = 0.363 or 36.3%.\n\nApproach 2: P = 1 - e^(-150\u03bb) = 1 - e^(-0.57849) \u2248 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, 43.9%.\n\nHmm, so which one is correct? I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the memoryless property.\n\nIn radioactive decay, the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet, is 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So approach 2 is correct. So the probability is 43.9%, which is approximately 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, the initial approach 1 is another way of looking at it, but I think I made a mistake there. Because approach 1 computes the probability from t=50 to t=200, which is 150 minutes. But the way approach 1 is done is correct, but why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, approach 1 is correct because P(decayed by 200) - P(decayed by 50) is the same as the probability of decaying between 50 and 200.\n\nBut according to approach 2, the probability is 43.9%, but approach 1 gives 36.3%. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in approach 2. Because the initial condition is that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the conditional probability P(t < 200 | t >50) = [P(50 < t < 200)] / P(t >50).\n\nWhich is [ (P(t <200) - P(t <50) ) ] / (1 - P(t <50)).\n\nBut that's the same as [ (1 - e^(-200\u03bb) ) - (1 - e^(-50\u03bb) ) ] / (e^(-50\u03bb)) ) = [e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb)] / e^(-50\u03bb) ) = 1 - e^(-150\u03bb).\n\nWhich is approach 2. So approach 2 is the correct way to compute the conditional probability.\n\nSo the correct answer is 43.9%, which is approximately 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, in approach 1, I computed the absolute probability (not conditional) of decay between 50 and 200. That is 36.3%. But the question asks, given that it hasn't decayed yet, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So it's a conditional probability, so approach 2 is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 44%, option A.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 44% as the correct answer, or do they? Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 44%\nB)40%\nC)52%\nD)48%\n\nSo option A is 44%, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did approach 1, I got 36.3%, which isn't an option. So the correct approach is approach 2, leading to option A.\n",

So that's the same as I computed, which is 36.3%. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial setup.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the probability of decay within the next 150 minutes, regardless of the initial 50. Wait, no, because the 50 minutes have passed without decay.\n\nWait another approach: the probability that the atom hasn't decayed after 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*50). Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. Which is the same as 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200) - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200), which is the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet. So that would be the conditional probability.\n\nSo P(decays in next 150 | hasn't decayed in first 50) = [P(decays between 50 and 200)] / [P(not decayed by 50)].\n\nWait, but that's the same as P(decays in 50-200) / P(not decayed by 50). Which is [e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / e^(-\u03bb*50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*(200-50)) = 1 - e^(-150\u03bb).\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Let me think. If the atom hasn't decayed by t=50, the remaining time is 150 minutes. But the decay process is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes for a new atom. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the decay is exponential, the remaining probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). But that's only if the time is measured from the start. But in this case, the 50 minutes have already passed, but the decay hasn't happened yet. So the remaining probability is the same as if the atom is fresh, but the time is 150 minutes. So the probability would be 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Let me compute that.\n\n\u03bb is 0.0038566 per minute.\n\n\u03bb *150 = 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849\n\ne^(-0.57849) \u2248 e^-0.58 is about 0.5615.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5615 \u2248 0.4385, which is 43.85%. So about 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but earlier approach gave 36%. So which is correct? Oh, I think I confused two approaches. Let me clarify.\n\nApproach 1: The probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes (from now) is the same as the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200. So P = [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] = e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb).\n\nApproach 2: Since the process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability for a new atom to decay in 150 minutes. So P = 1 - e^(-150\u03bb).\n\nWhich approach is correct? Hmm. Wait, because the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet, is equal to 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So approach 2 is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. The original problem says that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. So we calculated \u03bb based on that. Then, given that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, the probability of decaying in the next 150 is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\n\u03bb = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\n150 * \u03bb = 0.57849\n\ne^-0.57849 \u2248 let me compute more accurately. e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nLet me calculate using a calculator:\n\n0.57849 is approximately 0.5785.\n\nCompute e^-0.5785.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series or approximate it.\n\nAlternatively, let me think in terms of known values. Let me compute ln(0.56):\n\nln(0.56) \u2248 -0.5798. Oh, that's close to 0.5785. So e^-0.5785 is approximately 0.56.\n\nWait, because ln(0.56) is approximately -0.5798, so e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.561 (since 0.5785 is very close to 0.5798). So e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.561.\n\nSo 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or 43.9%, which is approximately 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I did approach 1, I got 36.3%. So which is correct?\n\nAh, I think the confusion comes from whether the next 150 minutes is from the initial time (t=0) or from t=50.\n\nWait, the question says: \"So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\"\n\nSo the next 150 minutes are from the current time, which is t=50. So we're looking at t=50 to t=200. So the correct approach is to find the probability of decay in that interval.\n\nBut the memoryless property tells us that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as for a new atom. So that's approach 2, leading to 44% (option A).\n\nBut wait, let's compute both approaches.\n\nApproach 1: P = e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb).\n\nCompute each term:\n\ne^(-50\u03bb) = e^(-0.0038566 *50) = e^(-0.19283) \u2248 0.8253.\n\ne^(-200\u03bb) = e^(-0.0038566 *200) = e^(-0.77132) \u2248 0.4623.\n\nSo P = 0.8253 - 0.4623 = 0.363 or 36.3%.\n\nApproach 2: P = 1 - e^(-150\u03bb) = 1 - e^(-0.57849) \u2248 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, 43.9%.\n\nHmm, so which one is correct? I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the memoryless property.\n\nIn radioactive decay, the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet, is 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So approach 2 is correct. So the probability is 43.9%, which is approximately 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, the initial approach 1 is another way of looking at it, but I think I made a mistake there. Because approach 1 computes the probability from t=50 to t=200, which is 150 minutes. But the way approach 1 is done is correct, but why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, approach 1 is correct because P(decayed by 200) - P(decayed by 50) is the same as the probability of decaying between 50 and 200.\n\nBut according to approach 2, the probability is 43.9%, but approach 1 gives 36.3%. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in approach 2. Because the initial condition is that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the conditional probability P(t < 200 | t >50) = [P(50 < t < 200)] / P(t >50).\n\nWhich is [ (P(t <200) - P(t <50) ) ] / (1 - P(t <50)).\n\nBut that's the same as [ (1 - e^(-200\u03bb) ) - (1 - e^(-50\u03bb) ) ] / (e^(-50\u03bb)) ) = [e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb)] / e^(-50\u03bb) ) = 1 - e^(-150\u03bb).\n\nWhich is approach 2. So approach 2 is the correct way to compute the conditional probability.\n\nSo the correct answer is 43.9%, which is approximately 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, in approach 1, I computed the absolute probability (not conditional) of decay between 50 and 200. That is 36.3%. But the question asks, given that it hasn't decayed yet, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So it's a conditional probability, so approach 2 is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 44%, option A.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 44% as the correct answer, or do they? Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 44%\nB)40%\nC)52%\nD)48%\n\nSo option A is 44%, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did approach 1, I got 36.3%, which isn't an option. So the correct approach is approach 2, leading to option A.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay, we use the principles of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential law. The decay probability is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the current time, not on the elapsed time.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. This implies:\n   \\[\n   0.32 = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100}\n   \\]\n   Solving for the decay constant \\(\\lambda\\):\n   \\[\n   e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100} \\approx 0.0038566 \\, \\text{per minute}.\n   \\]\n\n2. The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Using the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{decay in next 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}.\n   \\]\n\n3. Substituting \\(\\lambda \\approx 0.0038566\\):\n   \\[\n   \\lambda \\cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.57849.\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   e^{-0.57849} \\approx 0.561.\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{decay in next 150 minutes}) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \\, \\text{or} \\, 43.9\\%.\n   \\]\n\n4. Among the given options, the closest value is **44%**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**, corresponding to option A.\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step. Alright, the question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. I need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the next 150 minutes. So after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150 minutes? Or is it 150 minutes starting from now? Oh, wait, the question says, \"the next 150 minutes.\" So that's the period we're considering.\n\nBut wait, the initial statement says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So I think that means the half-life or something related. Or maybe the decay constant. Wait, no, 32% is the probability that it decays in 100 minutes. So that's like the probability P = 0.32 for time t=100 minutes.\n\nWait, but in radioactive decay, the decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a nucleus decays in a time interval t is given by P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. Alternatively, for small probabilities, it's approximated as P \u2248 \u03bbt, but 32% isn't that small, so I can't use the approximation. So I need to use the exponential formula.\n\nFirst, I need to find the decay constant \u03bb. Given that P(100) = 0.32, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). Let me solve for \u03bb.\n\nSo rearranging: e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\nTake natural logarithm on both sides: ln(0.68) = -100\u03bb.\n\nSo \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68): I think ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit less. Let me compute it. Wait, ln(2/3) is around -0.405, but 0.68 is about 0.68. Alternatively, using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact value. Let me think again. Let's compute ln(0.68).\n\nWait, 0.68 is 68% of 1. Let me compute it. Natural log of 0.68: ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. Yes, that's correct. So \u03bb is 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed and it hasn't decayed yet.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial statement says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So the remaining time is 150 minutes? Or is it the next 150 minutes starting from now? Because the initial decay probability was for 100 minutes starting from when it was made.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the question again. \"We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So that's the probability in the first 100 minutes. But in our case, 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So now, what is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes?\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Because the next 150 minutes would be from the current time. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, no. Because the decay probability given is for 100 minutes, which is the initial period.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The initial setup is that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying in the first 100 minutes. But we're now at 50 minutes, and it hasn't decayed. So what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: The question is about the probability that the atom decays during the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So, the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. So we need to find the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the decay is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, regardless of the past, depends only on the current time. So the 50 minutes don't affect the probability for the next 150 minutes because radioactive decay is a Poisson process, which is memoryless. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as if it were starting fresh, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the probability that it decays in the next t minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). But the 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the question is, given that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, what's the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes. So it's the conditional probability.\n\nIn that case, the probability is the same as the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes. Because the decay is memoryless, the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes doesn't change the fact that the remaining time has a certain probability.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The probability of the atom decaying at any time t is independent of the time that has already passed. So the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute period.\n\nWait, no, because the decay is an exponential distribution. The probability that it hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-\u03bbt). So the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is [1 - e^(-\u03bb*150)] / [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)].\n\nWait, let me think again. The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after t=50 is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. Because the total time from the start is 200 minutes, but the decay is memoryless, so the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute window starting at any time.\n\nWait, no, the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to the probability that it decays in 150 minutes. But in terms of the exponential distribution, the probability that a decay occurs in a time interval from a to b is F(b) - F(a), where F(t) is the cumulative distribution function, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).\n\nSo, the probability that the decay occurs between 50 and 200 minutes is [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nBut wait, the question is, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So it's a conditional probability.\n\nThe conditional probability P(decays between 50 and 200 | not decayed by 50) = [P(decays between 50 and 200)] / [P(not decayed by 50)].\n\nWhich is [e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / [e^(-\u03bb*50)].\n\nSimplify: [1 - e^(-\u03bb*(200-50))] = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the conditional probability ends up being 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150), which is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes starting from t=0. So the memoryless property comes into play here.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 150 minutes is longer than the initial 100 minutes. Oh wait, but the 50 minutes are already passed. So the remaining time is 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but according to this calculation, the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). So it's as if it's starting fresh.\n\nSo, the key point is that the probability of decaying in the next t minutes, given that it hasn't decayed so far, is the same as the probability of decaying in any t-minute window, regardless of how much time has already passed.\n\nSo, in this case, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nBut wait, in the initial condition, the probability of decaying in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). So from that, we can find \u03bb.\n\nSo, let's recompute \u03bb. We have:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb)\n=> e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68\nTaking natural log: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68)\n=> \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566, so \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, we need to compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nPlugging in \u03bb: 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) \u2248 e^(-0.578) \u2248 0.562.\n\nSo 1 - 0.562 = 0.438, which is approximately 43.8%. Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 44%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Let's compute \u03bb accurately.\n\nCompute \u03bb:\n\nln(0.68) = ?\n\nUsing a calculator: 0.68 is e^x. Let me compute ln(0.68).\n\nI know that ln(0.7) \u2248 -0.35667, and ln(0.68) is a bit more negative. Let's compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:\n\nln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) \u2248 -0.38566. Let's use that.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, for t=150 minutes, the exponent is \u03bb*t = 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\nCompute e^(-0.57849):\n\nWe can use the approximation that e^-0.5 \u2248 0.6065, e^-0.6 \u2248 0.5488, e^-0.57849 is between these.\n\nCompute 0.57849 - 0.5 = 0.07849. So e^-0.5 is 0.6065.\n\nWe can compute e^-0.07849 \u2248 1 - 0.07849 + 0.07849\u00b2/2 - ... but perhaps a better way is to compute it as 0.57849 = 0.5 + 0.07849.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) = e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.07849).\n\ne^(-0.5) \u2248 0.6065.\n\ne^(-0.07849) \u2248 approximately 1 - 0.07849 + (0.07849)^2/2.\n\n0.07849^2 \u2248 0.00616. So 0.00616/2 = 0.00308.\n\nSo 1 - 0.07849 = 0.92151 + 0.00308 = 0.92459.\n\nSo e^(-0.07849) \u2248 0.92459.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) \u2248 0.6065 * 0.92459 \u2248 ?\n\n0.6 * 0.92459 \u2248 0.55475.\n\n0.0065 * 0.92459 \u2248 0.006009.\n\nSo total \u2248 0.55475 + 0.006009 \u2248 0.56076.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) \u2248 0.5608.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392, which is about 43.92% or 44%.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 44%, which matches.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because the initial calculation said 43.92%, which is 44%. So the answer would be A) 44%.\n\nBut wait, the options are given as A)44%, B)40%, etc. So A is correct.\n\nBut wait, another approach: Let's compute the decay constant again.\n\nWait, another way: Let me compute \u03bb with more precise numbers.\n\nWe have:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural log:\n\n-100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCompute ln(0.68) accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566248.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.38566248 / 100 = 0.0038566248 per minute.\n\nNow, compute \u03bb * 150 = 0.0038566248 * 150 = 0.57849372.\n\nCompute e^(-0.57849372) accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, e^(-0.57849372) \u2248 0.5618.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5618 = 0.4382 \u2192 43.82%.\n\nSo approximately 43.82%, which rounds to 44%. So the correct answer is A)44%.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the options again. The options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.\n\nSo the correct answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step. Alright, the question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. I need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the next 150 minutes. So after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150 minutes? Or is it 150 minutes starting from now? Oh, wait, the question says, \"the next 150 minutes.\" So that's the period we're considering.\n\nBut wait, the initial statement says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So I think that means the half-life or something related. Or maybe the decay constant. Wait, no, 32% is the probability that it decays in 100 minutes. So that's like the probability P = 0.32 for time t=100 minutes.\n\nWait, but in radioactive decay, the decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a nucleus decays in a time interval t is given by P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. Alternatively, for small probabilities, it's approximated as P \u2248 \u03bbt, but 32% isn't that small, so I can't use the approximation. So I need to use the exponential formula.\n\nFirst, I need to find the decay constant \u03bb. Given that P(100) = 0.32, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). Let me solve for \u03bb.\n\nSo rearranging: e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\nTake natural logarithm on both sides: ln(0.68) = -100\u03bb.\n\nSo \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68): I think ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit less. Let me compute it. Wait, ln(2/3) is around -0.405, but 0.68 is about 0.68. Alternatively, using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact value. Let me think again. Let's compute ln(0.68).\n\nWait, 0.68 is 68% of 1. Let me compute it. Natural log of 0.68: ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. Yes, that's correct. So \u03bb is 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed and it hasn't decayed yet.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial statement says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So the remaining time is 150 minutes? Or is it the next 150 minutes starting from now? Because the initial decay probability was for 100 minutes starting from when it was made.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the question again. \"We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So that's the probability in the first 100 minutes. But in our case, 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So now, what is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes?\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Because the next 150 minutes would be from the current time. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, no. Because the decay probability given is for 100 minutes, which is the initial period.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The initial setup is that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying in the first 100 minutes. But we're now at 50 minutes, and it hasn't decayed. So what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: The question is about the probability that the atom decays during the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So, the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. So we need to find the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the decay is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, regardless of the past, depends only on the current time. So the 50 minutes don't affect the probability for the next 150 minutes because radioactive decay is a Poisson process, which is memoryless. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as if it were starting fresh, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the probability that it decays in the next t minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). But the 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the question is, given that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, what's the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes. So it's the conditional probability.\n\nIn that case, the probability is the same as the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes. Because the decay is memoryless, the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes doesn't change the fact that the remaining time has a certain probability.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The probability of the atom decaying at any time t is independent of the time that has already passed. So the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute period.\n\nWait, no, because the decay is an exponential distribution. The probability that it hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-\u03bbt). So the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is [1 - e^(-\u03bb*150)] / [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)].\n\nWait, let me think again. The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after t=50 is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. Because the total time from the start is 200 minutes, but the decay is memoryless, so the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute window starting at any time.\n\nWait, no, the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to the probability that it decays in 150 minutes. But in terms of the exponential distribution, the probability that a decay occurs in a time interval from a to b is F(b) - F(a), where F(t) is the cumulative distribution function, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).\n\nSo, the probability that the decay occurs between 50 and 200 minutes is [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nBut wait, the question is, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So it's a conditional probability.\n\nThe conditional probability P(decays between 50 and 200 | not decayed by 50) = [P(decays between 50 and 200)] / [P(not decayed by 50)].\n\nWhich is [e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / [e^(-\u03bb*50)].\n\nSimplify: [1 - e^(-\u03bb*(200-50))] = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the conditional probability ends up being 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150), which is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes starting from t=0. So the memoryless property comes into play here.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 150 minutes is longer than the initial 100 minutes. Oh wait, but the 50 minutes are already passed. So the remaining time is 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but according to this calculation, the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). So it's as if it's starting fresh.\n\nSo, the key point is that the probability of decaying in the next t minutes, given that it hasn't decayed so far, is the same as the probability of decaying in any t-minute window, regardless of how much time has already passed.\n\nSo, in this case, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nBut wait, in the initial condition, the probability of decaying in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). So from that, we can find \u03bb.\n\nSo, let's recompute \u03bb. We have:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb)\n=> e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68\nTaking natural log: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68)\n=> \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566, so \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, we need to compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nPlugging in \u03bb: 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) \u2248 e^(-0.578) \u2248 0.562.\n\nSo 1 - 0.562 = 0.438, which is approximately 43.8%. Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 44%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Let's compute \u03bb accurately.\n\nCompute \u03bb:\n\nln(0.68) = ?\n\nUsing a calculator: 0.68 is e^x. Let me compute ln(0.68).\n\nI know that ln(0.7) \u2248 -0.35667, and ln(0.68) is a bit more negative. Let's compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:\n\nln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) \u2248 -0.38566. Let's use that.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, for t=150 minutes, the exponent is \u03bb*t = 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\nCompute e^(-0.57849):\n\nWe can use the approximation that e^-0.5 \u2248 0.6065, e^-0.6 \u2248 0.5488, e^-0.57849 is between these.\n\nCompute 0.57849 - 0.5 = 0.07849. So e^-0.5 is 0.6065.\n\nWe can compute e^-0.07849 \u2248 1 - 0.07849 + 0.07849\u00b2/2 - ... but perhaps a better way is to compute it as 0.57849 = 0.5 + 0.07849.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) = e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.07849).\n\ne^(-0.5) \u2248 0.6065.\n\ne^(-0.07849) \u2248 approximately 1 - 0.07849 + (0.07849)^2/2.\n\n0.07849^2 \u2248 0.00616. So 0.00616/2 = 0.00308.\n\nSo 1 - 0.07849 = 0.92151 + 0.00308 = 0.92459.\n\nSo e^(-0.07849) \u2248 0.92459.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) \u2248 0.6065 * 0.92459 \u2248 ?\n\n0.6 * 0.92459 \u2248 0.55475.\n\n0.0065 * 0.92459 \u2248 0.006009.\n\nSo total \u2248 0.55475 + 0.006009 \u2248 0.56076.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) \u2248 0.5608.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392, which is about 43.92% or 44%.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 44%, which matches.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because the initial calculation said 43.92%, which is 44%. So the answer would be A) 44%.\n\nBut wait, the options are given as A)44%, B)40%, etc. So A is correct.\n\nBut wait, another approach: Let's compute the decay constant again.\n\nWait, another way: Let me compute \u03bb with more precise numbers.\n\nWe have:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural log:\n\n-100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCompute ln(0.68) accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566248.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.38566248 / 100 = 0.0038566248 per minute.\n\nNow, compute \u03bb * 150 = 0.0038566248 * 150 = 0.57849372.\n\nCompute e^(-0.57849372) accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, e^(-0.57849372) \u2248 0.5618.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5618 = 0.4382 \u2192 43.82%.\n\nSo approximately 43.82%, which rounds to 44%. So the correct answer is A)44%.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the options again. The options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.\n\nSo the correct answer is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of a nucleus decaying in a time interval \\( t \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant.

Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the time already elapsed (50 minutes). Thus, we use the same formula:\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.0038566 \\) and \\( t = 150 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.0038566 \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.57849\n\\]\n\nNow, compute \\( e^{-0.57849} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nWe have an atom, and we're monitoring its decay. The problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, from what I remember, radioactive decay is a random process, and the probability of decay is independent of the time it's been observed so far. Oh wait, right, that's the key point\u2014radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, so the probability of decay doesn't depend on when you start observing, only on the time that passes.\n\nSo the situation here is that we've been observing this atom for 50 minutes, and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, we want to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait a second. Oh, no, wait. The next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed, so the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Or does the 150 minutes start right now, making it 150 minutes in addition to the 50 that have already passed? Hmm, the wording says, \"the next 150 minutes,\" so I think it's 150 minutes starting from the current time, so adding to the 50 that have passed. So the total time from the beginning is 200 minutes.\n\nBut wait, the given data is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So perhaps the decay constant is related to that. Let me think about the formula for radioactive decay. The probability that a nucleus hasn't decayed after time t is given by N(t)/N0 = e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. So the probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).\n\nIn the given problem, the decay probability is 32% (0.32) within 100 minutes. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). Let me solve for \u03bb.\n\nRearranging, e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but let me get the exact value. Let me calculate it: 0.68 is e^x. So x is ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566 (since e^-0.385 is around 0.68). So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait\u2014no, because 50 minutes have already passed. So the total time is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Or, alternatively, the remaining time is 150 minutes after the 50. So the decay probability would be the chance that it decays between t=50 and t=200.\n\nWait, but the way decay works is that the probability that it hasn't decayed by time t is N(t)/N0 = e^(-\u03bbt). So the probability that it hasn't decayed by 200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*200). The probability it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*50). So the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is [e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb)].\n\nAlternatively, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after the 50, which is the same as from 50 to 200. So the formula would be 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200) - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The probability that the atom decays before time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So the probability that it decays between time a and time b is P(b) - P(a) = [1 - e^(-\u03bbb)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bba)] = e^(-\u03bba) - e^(-\u03bbb).\n\nSo in our case, a is 50 minutes and b is 200 minutes. So the probability is e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb).\n\nAlternatively, since 200 is 100 * 2, perhaps I can express this in terms of the given 100-minute data.\n\nWait, let me compute e^(-50\u03bb) and e^(-200\u03bb). Since \u03bb is 0.0038566 per minute, 50\u03bb is 0.0038566 *50 \u2248 0.19283. So e^(-0.19283) is approximately 0.825.\n\n200\u03bb is 0.0038566 *200 \u2248 0.7713. e^(-0.7713) \u2248 0.462.\n\nSo the probability is 0.825 - 0.462 = 0.363, which is 36.3%. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Since we're given the 100-minute probability, perhaps we can find the decay constant \u03bb from that.\n\nWait, given that in 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). So e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Then, 100\u03bb = -ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 \u2192 ln(1.47) \u2248 0.385, so \u03bb \u2248 0.00385 per minute.\n\nSo now, the time after the initial observation is 150 minutes, but since we've already waited 50 minutes, the total time is 200 minutes. So the probability that it decays by 200 minutes is P(200) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200). But wait, no, the question is the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, which is from time 50 to 200. So the probability is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-200\u03bb)] - [1 - e^(-50\u03bb)] = e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb).\n\nLet me compute this. \u03bb=0.00385 per minute.\n\n50\u03bb = 0.1925. e^(-0.1925) \u2248 0.825.\n\n200\u03bb = 0.770. e^(-0.770) \u2248 0.463.\n\nSo the difference is 0.825 - 0.463 = 0.362, about 36.2%. Hmm, but the options given are 40%, 44%, 48%, 52%, etc. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another way: the decay is memoryless, so the fact that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes doesn't affect the probability for the next 150 minutes. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting from t=0.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. If it were memoryless, the probability for 150 minutes would be higher than 32%, but perhaps the question is considering the remaining time.\n\nWait, no. The initial 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (from t=50 to t=200) is the same as the probability that it decays within 150 minutes starting from a fresh state, multiplied by the probability that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nWait, no, because the decay is memoryless. The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. So the conditional probability is (probability of decaying in 150 minutes) / (probability of not decaying in 50 minutes).\n\nWait, but I think that's incorrect. Let me recall: in radioactive decay, the probability of decay in a certain time period is independent of how much time has already passed. So if the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if it were a fresh atom over 150 minutes.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the decay rate is a constant probability per unit time. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is (1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150)).\n\nWait, but that would ignore the previous 50 minutes. Or does it matter?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The decay process is memoryless, which means the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has passed before.\n\nSo in this case, the initial 50 minutes have passed without decay. But the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if we had just started observing, and asked for the probability of decaying in 150 minutes. So perhaps it's 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWait, but wait. That would mean that the 50 minutes don't affect the probability, which seems counterintuitive. But that's the nature of memoryless processes.\n\nSo let me compute that.\n\nWe have \u03bb \u2248 0.00385 per minute.\n\nSo 150 * \u03bb \u2248 0.5775.\n\ne^(-0.5775) \u2248 approximately 0.5615.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385, which is 43.85%, which is close to option A (44%).\n\nBut wait, in my earlier approach, considering the 50 minutes, I got 36%, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps the correct approach is that the probability is 44%, option A.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because the 50 minutes have passed without decay, but since the process is memoryless, the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as if it were a new atom.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the atom's lifetime is being considered. If the atom has a half-life, for example, the longer you wait, the less likely it is to decay in the next period. So perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.\n\nWhich would be P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-200\u03bb)] - [1 - e^(-50\u03bb)] = e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb).\n\nLet me compute that again.\n\nWith \u03bb = 0.00385 per minute.\n\n50\u03bb = 0.1925 \u2192 e^-0.1925 \u2248 0.825.\n\n200\u03bb = 0.77 \u2192 e^-0.77 \u2248 0.463.\n\nSo 0.825 - 0.463 = 0.362 \u2192 36.2%.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So that suggests that I made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability as the chance that it decays within 150 minutes after the initial 50. So the total time from start is 200 minutes, but the 150 minutes is the time after the 50.\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier, and I get 36.2%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I should think again about the initial approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the decay probability given in 100 minutes is 32%. So perhaps the decay constant \u03bb can be found as ln(1/(1-0.32)) / 100.\n\nWait, yes. Because P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt) \u2192 e^(-\u03bbt) = 1 - P(t).\n\nSo for t=100, P=0.32 \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 0.003856 per minute.\n\nSo, the decay constant is correct.\n\nNow, the time between 50 and 200 is 150 minutes. So the probability that the atom decays during that interval is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.\n\nWhich is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-200\u03bb)] - [1 - e^(-50\u03bb)] = e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\ne^(-50\u03bb) = e^(-50 * 0.003856) = e^(-0.1928) \u2248 0.8247.\n\ne^(-200\u03bb) = e^(-200 * 0.003856) = e^(-0.7712) \u2248 0.4624.\n\nSubtracting these: 0.8247 - 0.4624 = 0.3623, which is approximately 36.23%.\n\nBut none of the options match this. The options are 40, 44, 48, 52. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, starting from the current time (50 minutes have passed), so the time is 150 minutes from now, not the total time. So the time would be t=150, and the calculation is 1 - e^(-150\u03bb).\n\nWait, let me compute that. 150\u03bb = 0.5784. e^-0.5784 \u2248 0.5615. So 1 - 0.5615 \u2248 0.4385 \u2192 43.85%, which is approximately 44%, option A.\n\nBut why would that be correct, given that the initial 50 minutes have passed? Because the process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if it had just started.\n\nWait, but wait. If the process is memoryless, then the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any subsequent 150 minutes period, regardless of how much time has already passed. So, yes, that would be 44%, option A.\n\nBut earlier calculation when considering the time from 50 to 200 minutes gave 36%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability for 150 minutes from now, not from the start.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo 150 * 0.003856 \u2248 0.5784.\n\ne^-0.5784 \u2248 0.5615.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385 \u2192 43.85%, which rounds to 44%, option A.\n\nBut why did I get a different answer earlier? Oh, because I was considering the time from 50 to 200, which is 150 minutes, but perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, another way: the decay is memoryless, so the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is the same regardless of how long it has already been observed. So the 50 minutes don't affect the probability. So the probability is simply the probability of decaying in 150 minutes.\n\nSo the answer would be 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, the initial statement says \"the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So perhaps the decay constant is calculated based on that, and then we compute the probability for 150 minutes.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. Let me make sure I'm using the correct \u03bb.\n\n\u03bb = (ln(1/(1 - 0.32)) ) / 100.\n\nBecause P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), so e^(-\u03bbt) = 1 - P(t) \u2192 -\u03bbt = ln(1 - P(t)) \u2192 \u03bb = ( - ln(1 - P(t)) ) / t.\n\nSo for t=100, P=0.32.\n\nSo \u03bb = ln(1/(1-0.32)) / 100 \u2192 ln(1/0.68) \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2192 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo 150 minutes: \u03bbt = 0.0038566 *150 \u2248 0.5785.\n\ne^(-0.5785) \u2248 0.5615.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385 \u2192 43.85% \u2192 44%, option A.\n\nSo the answer should be option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nWe have an atom, and we're monitoring its decay. The problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, from what I remember, radioactive decay is a random process, and the probability of decay is independent of the time it's been observed so far. Oh wait, right, that's the key point\u2014radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, so the probability of decay doesn't depend on when you start observing, only on the time that passes.\n\nSo the situation here is that we've been observing this atom for 50 minutes, and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, we want to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait a second. Oh, no, wait. The next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed, so the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Or does the 150 minutes start right now, making it 150 minutes in addition to the 50 that have already passed? Hmm, the wording says, \"the next 150 minutes,\" so I think it's 150 minutes starting from the current time, so adding to the 50 that have passed. So the total time from the beginning is 200 minutes.\n\nBut wait, the given data is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So perhaps the decay constant is related to that. Let me think about the formula for radioactive decay. The probability that a nucleus hasn't decayed after time t is given by N(t)/N0 = e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. So the probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).\n\nIn the given problem, the decay probability is 32% (0.32) within 100 minutes. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). Let me solve for \u03bb.\n\nRearranging, e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but let me get the exact value. Let me calculate it: 0.68 is e^x. So x is ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566 (since e^-0.385 is around 0.68). So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait\u2014no, because 50 minutes have already passed. So the total time is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Or, alternatively, the remaining time is 150 minutes after the 50. So the decay probability would be the chance that it decays between t=50 and t=200.\n\nWait, but the way decay works is that the probability that it hasn't decayed by time t is N(t)/N0 = e^(-\u03bbt). So the probability that it hasn't decayed by 200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*200). The probability it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*50). So the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is [e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb)].\n\nAlternatively, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after the 50, which is the same as from 50 to 200. So the formula would be 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200) - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The probability that the atom decays before time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So the probability that it decays between time a and time b is P(b) - P(a) = [1 - e^(-\u03bbb)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bba)] = e^(-\u03bba) - e^(-\u03bbb).\n\nSo in our case, a is 50 minutes and b is 200 minutes. So the probability is e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb).\n\nAlternatively, since 200 is 100 * 2, perhaps I can express this in terms of the given 100-minute data.\n\nWait, let me compute e^(-50\u03bb) and e^(-200\u03bb). Since \u03bb is 0.0038566 per minute, 50\u03bb is 0.0038566 *50 \u2248 0.19283. So e^(-0.19283) is approximately 0.825.\n\n200\u03bb is 0.0038566 *200 \u2248 0.7713. e^(-0.7713) \u2248 0.462.\n\nSo the probability is 0.825 - 0.462 = 0.363, which is 36.3%. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Since we're given the 100-minute probability, perhaps we can find the decay constant \u03bb from that.\n\nWait, given that in 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). So e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Then, 100\u03bb = -ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 \u2192 ln(1.47) \u2248 0.385, so \u03bb \u2248 0.00385 per minute.\n\nSo now, the time after the initial observation is 150 minutes, but since we've already waited 50 minutes, the total time is 200 minutes. So the probability that it decays by 200 minutes is P(200) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200). But wait, no, the question is the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, which is from time 50 to 200. So the probability is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-200\u03bb)] - [1 - e^(-50\u03bb)] = e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb).\n\nLet me compute this. \u03bb=0.00385 per minute.\n\n50\u03bb = 0.1925. e^(-0.1925) \u2248 0.825.\n\n200\u03bb = 0.770. e^(-0.770) \u2248 0.463.\n\nSo the difference is 0.825 - 0.463 = 0.362, about 36.2%. Hmm, but the options given are 40%, 44%, 48%, 52%, etc. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another way: the decay is memoryless, so the fact that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes doesn't affect the probability for the next 150 minutes. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting from t=0.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. If it were memoryless, the probability for 150 minutes would be higher than 32%, but perhaps the question is considering the remaining time.\n\nWait, no. The initial 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (from t=50 to t=200) is the same as the probability that it decays within 150 minutes starting from a fresh state, multiplied by the probability that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nWait, no, because the decay is memoryless. The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. So the conditional probability is (probability of decaying in 150 minutes) / (probability of not decaying in 50 minutes).\n\nWait, but I think that's incorrect. Let me recall: in radioactive decay, the probability of decay in a certain time period is independent of how much time has already passed. So if the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if it were a fresh atom over 150 minutes.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the decay rate is a constant probability per unit time. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is (1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150)).\n\nWait, but that would ignore the previous 50 minutes. Or does it matter?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The decay process is memoryless, which means the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has passed before.\n\nSo in this case, the initial 50 minutes have passed without decay. But the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if we had just started observing, and asked for the probability of decaying in 150 minutes. So perhaps it's 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWait, but wait. That would mean that the 50 minutes don't affect the probability, which seems counterintuitive. But that's the nature of memoryless processes.\n\nSo let me compute that.\n\nWe have \u03bb \u2248 0.00385 per minute.\n\nSo 150 * \u03bb \u2248 0.5775.\n\ne^(-0.5775) \u2248 approximately 0.5615.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385, which is 43.85%, which is close to option A (44%).\n\nBut wait, in my earlier approach, considering the 50 minutes, I got 36%, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps the correct approach is that the probability is 44%, option A.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because the 50 minutes have passed without decay, but since the process is memoryless, the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as if it were a new atom.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the atom's lifetime is being considered. If the atom has a half-life, for example, the longer you wait, the less likely it is to decay in the next period. So perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.\n\nWhich would be P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-200\u03bb)] - [1 - e^(-50\u03bb)] = e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb).\n\nLet me compute that again.\n\nWith \u03bb = 0.00385 per minute.\n\n50\u03bb = 0.1925 \u2192 e^-0.1925 \u2248 0.825.\n\n200\u03bb = 0.77 \u2192 e^-0.77 \u2248 0.463.\n\nSo 0.825 - 0.463 = 0.362 \u2192 36.2%.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So that suggests that I made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability as the chance that it decays within 150 minutes after the initial 50.

So perhaps I should think again about the initial approach.\n\nWait, another approach: the decay probability given in 100 minutes is 32%. So perhaps the decay constant \u03bb can be found as ln(1/(1-0.32)) / 100.\n\nWait, yes. Because P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt) \u2192 e^(-\u03bbt) = 1 - P(t).\n\nSo for t=100, P=0.32 \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 0.003856 per minute.\n\nSo, the decay constant is correct.\n\nNow, the time between 50 and 200 is 150 minutes. So the probability that the atom decays during that interval is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.\n\nWhich is P(200) - P(50) = [1 - e^(-200\u03bb)] - [1 - e^(-50\u03bb)] = e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\ne^(-50\u03bb) = e^(-50 * 0.003856) = e^(-0.1928) \u2248 0.8247.\n\ne^(-200\u03bb) = e^(-200 * 0.003856) = e^(-0.7712) \u2248 0.4624.\n\nSubtracting these: 0.8247 - 0.4624 = 0.3623, which is approximately 36.23%.\n\nBut none of the options match this. The options are 40, 44, 48, 52. Hmm.

So the time would be t=150, and the calculation is 1 - e^(-150\u03bb).\n\nWait, let me compute that. 150\u03bb = 0.5784. e^-0.5784 \u2248 0.5615. So 1 - 0.5615 \u2248 0.4385 \u2192 43.85%, which is approximately 44%, option A.\n\nBut why would that be correct, given that the initial 50 minutes have passed? Because the process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if it had just started.\n\nWait, but wait.

So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability for 150 minutes from now, not from the start.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo 150 * 0.003856 \u2248 0.5784.\n\ne^-0.5784 \u2248 0.5615.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385 \u2192 43.85%, which rounds to 44%, option A.\n\nBut why did I get a different answer earlier?

So the 50 minutes don't affect the probability. So the probability is simply the probability of decaying in 150 minutes.\n\nSo the answer would be 44%, option A.\n\nBut wait, the initial statement says \"the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So perhaps the decay constant is calculated based on that, and then we compute the probability for 150 minutes.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. Let me make sure I'm using the correct \u03bb.\n\n\u03bb = (ln(1/(1 - 0.32)) ) / 100.\n\nBecause P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), so e^(-\u03bbt) = 1 - P(t) \u2192 -\u03bbt = ln(1 - P(t)) \u2192 \u03bb = ( - ln(1 - P(t)) ) / t.\n\nSo for t=100, P=0.32.\n\nSo \u03bb = ln(1/(1-0.32)) / 100 \u2192 ln(1/0.68) \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2192 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo 150 minutes: \u03bbt = 0.0038566 *150 \u2248 0.5785.\n\ne^(-0.5785) \u2248 0.5615.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385 \u2192 43.85% \u2192 44%, option A.\n\nSo the answer should be option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which is memoryless. The probability of decay within a given time interval depends only on the decay constant \\( \\lambda \\), not on the time already elapsed. The decay constant \\( \\lambda \\) can be determined from the given information that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (\\( P(100) = 0.32 \\)).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the decay constant \\( \\lambda \\)\nThe probability of decay within time \\( t \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - P(t))}{t}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( P(100) = 0.32 \\) and \\( t = 100 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.32)}{100} = \\frac{-\\ln(0.68)}{100}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.38566 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.38566}{100} \\approx 0.0038566 \\, \\text{per minute.}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Probability of decay in the next 150 minutes\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on \\( \\lambda \\) and the time interval (150 minutes). The probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.0038566 \\) and \\( t = 150 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.5785\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-0.5785}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( e^{-0.5785} \\approx 0.5615 \\):\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - 0.5615 \\approx 0.4385 \\, \\text{or} \\, 43.85\\%.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Match the closest option\nThe closest option to 43.85% is **44%**, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it has decayed. But wait, probability over what time? Oh right, it's the probability that the atom decays within that time period. So the decay probability P is 32% (0.32) for 100 minutes.\n\nNow, the situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, next 150? Let me read that again. Oh, wait, no, wait. The question says, \"the next 150 minutes.\" But wait, 50 minutes have already passed. So the total time we're considering is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes? Or is it the next 150 minutes from now, making the total time 200 minutes, but we're looking for the probability from now to 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.\n\nHmm, but I think I might be getting confused here. Let me clarify. The decay is a Poisson process, I remember that much. The key thing is that the decay is memoryless, meaning that the probability of decaying in the next t minutes doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the fact that it didn't decay in the first 50 minutes shouldn't affect the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The initial information is that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. So first, I should probably find the decay constant \u03bb, since the decay probability relates to the half-life or the decay constant.\n\nThe formula I remember is that the probability P of decay in time t is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So, given that, for t=100 minutes, P=0.32.\n\nSo, let's set that up: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). Rearranging, e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.68) = -100\u03bb.\n\nSo \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCalculating that: ln(0.68) is approximately, let me think, ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. So ln(0.68) is about -0.4 (because e^(-0.4) \u2248 0.6703, which is close to 0.68). Let me compute it more accurately. Alternatively, use a calculator approach.\n\nBut wait, since I'm just thinking, maybe I'll approximate it. Let's compute ln(0.68) more accurately. Let me think: 0.68 is e^x. Let's find x. So e^x = 0.68. x is ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.4 (since e^-0.4 is about 0.6703, which is close to 0.68). So let's say ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nSo \u03bb \u2248 0.4055 / 100 \u2248 0.004055 per minute.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let's see: 0.68 is 68% of 1. So ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32). Alternatively, using a calculator, but since I'm just thinking, maybe I can approximate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute \u03bb using the formula, but perhaps I don't need the exact value because the next step might not require it. Let's see.\n\nWait, the question is about the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nBut since the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in the first 150 minutes of its lifetime. So, the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes doesn't change anything; the remaining probability is just for the next 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200. But the memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same regardless of when you start. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute interval, which would be 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Because the total time from now is 150 minutes, so the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is P(t) = e^(-\u03bb t). So, the probability that it hasn't decayed after 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *50). The probability that it hasn't decayed after 200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*200). So the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is P(200) - P(50) = e^(-\u03bb*200) - e^(-\u03bb*50) = e^(-\u03bb*50) (e^(-\u03bb*150) - 1) ).\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy, but let's proceed.\n\nBut wait, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is [P(200) - P(50)] / P(50). Because the condition is that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, so the probability is (probability of decaying between 50 and 200) divided by (probability of not decaying by 50).\n\nBut wait, given the memoryless property, this should be equal to the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, regardless of the 50 minutes. So, the conditional probability is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes. So, perhaps I can just compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, but let me think. The conditional probability P(decays in 150 | not decayed in 50) = [P(decays between 50 and 200)] / [P(not decayed by 50)].\n\nWhich is [e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / e^(-\u03bb*50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nYes, that's correct. So the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nSo I need to calculate \u03bb from the given data, then compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, but I can also compute \u03bb from the initial data. So, from the given P(100)=0.32.\n\nSo, let's compute \u03bb.\n\nP(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = (- ln(0.68))/100.\n\nCompute ln(0.68). Let me think: ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.4055, since 2/3 is approximately 0.6667. So 0.68 is a bit higher, so ln(0.68) is about -0.4005.\n\nWait, wait, let me think more accurately. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nWe know that ln(0.6931) is approximately -0.3662, but that's for 1/2. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think of e^x = 0.68.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series for ln(x) around x=1: ln(1+x) \u2248 x - x\u00b2/2 + x\u00b3/3 - x^4/4, but that's for x near 0. Alternatively, since 0.68 is 1 - 0.32, maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator approach: I can recall that ln(0.7) \u2248 -0.3567, ln(0.69) \u2248 -0.3711, ln(0.68) is between these. Let me see: 0.68 is 0.69 minus 0.01, so maybe ln(0.68) is about -0.4005? Let me check:\n\ne^(-0.4) is approximately 0.6703, which is less than 0.68. So to get e^(-0.4) = 0.6703.\n\nWait, but we need e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/(-100).\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute ln(0.68) precisely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the approximation that ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nLet me proceed with that.\n\nSo, \u03bb = (0.4055)/100 \u2248 0.004055 per minute.\n\nNow, compute the probability of decay in 150 minutes: 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nSo \u03bb*150 = 0.004055 * 150 \u2248 0.60825.\n\nSo e^(-0.60825) \u2248 what? Well, e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488. e^(-0.60825) would be a bit less. Let's compute:\n\n0.60825 = 0.6 + 0.00825.\n\nSo, e^(-0.60825) = e^(-0.6) * e^(-0.00825).\n\ne^(-0.6) \u2248 0.5488.\n\ne^(-0.00825) \u2248 1 - 0.00825 + (0.00825)^2/2 - ... \u2248 approximately 0.9918 (since 0.00825 is small, so using the approximation e^x \u2248 1 + x for small x, but more accurately, e^(-0.00825) \u2248 0.9918).\n\nSo, 0.5488 * 0.9918 \u2248 0.5444.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.5444 \u2248 0.4556, which is about 45.56%.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D) 48%, but wait, perhaps my approximations are a bit off.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute \u03bb more accurately.\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68) more accurately.\n\nWe can compute ln(0.68) using a calculator approach. Let me think: ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32).\n\nAlternatively, I can use the Taylor expansion for ln(x) around x=1. The expansion is ln(1+x) = x - x\u00b2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + ... for |x| < 1.\n\nSo, 0.68 = 1 - 0.32 \u2192 x = -0.32.\n\nSo ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) = -0.32 - (0.32)^2/2 - (0.32)^3/3 - (0.32)^4/4 - ... \n\nCompute the first few terms:\n\nFirst term: -0.32.\n\nSecond term: -(0.1024)/2 = -0.0512 \u2192 total so far: -0.3712.\n\nThird term: -(0.032768)/3 \u2248 -0.0109227 \u2192 total: -0.3821227.\n\nFourth term: -(0.01048576)/4 \u2248 -0.00262144 \u2192 total: -0.3847441.\n\nFifth term: -(0.0033554432)/5 \u2248 -0.0006710886 \u2192 total: -0.38541519.\n\nSixth term: -(0.001073741824)/6 \u2248 -0.00017895697 \u2192 total: -0.38559415.\n\nSeventh term: -(0.0003435973837)/7 \u2248 -0.00004908534 \u2192 total: -0.385643235.\n\nEighth term: -(0.0001107530715)/8 \u2248 -0.000013844134 \u2192 total: -0.385657079.\n\nSo, up to the eighth term, it's about -0.385657.\n\nBut the actual value of ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005. Hmm, so the approximation using the Taylor series isn't converging quickly enough because x is -0.32, which is a larger value, so higher terms contribute more significantly. So perhaps the Taylor series isn't the best approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a better approximation method, like using the known values of ln(0.69) and ln(0.67) to interpolate.\n\nWait, I think I remember that ln(0.69) is approximately -0.3711, ln(0.68) would be a bit more negative than that. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach. Let's compute ln(0.68) numerically.\n\nLet me try to compute ln(0.68) by using the Newton-Raphson method to solve e^x = 0.68.\n\nWe need to find x such that e^x = 0.68. Let's make an initial guess x\u2080 = -0.4.\n\nCompute e^(-0.4) = 0.67032, which is less than 0.68. So the next guess: x\u2081 = x\u2080 + (0.68 - e^x\u2080)/(e^x\u2080).\n\nWait, Newton-Raphson for e^x - 0.68 = 0.\n\nThe function f(x) = e^x - 0.68. f'(x)=e^x.\n\nAt x\u2080 = -0.4: f(x\u2080)=0.67032 - 0.68 = -0.00968.\n\nf'(x\u2080) = e^(-0.4) = 0.67032.\n\nNext iteration: x\u2081 = x\u2080 - f(x\u2080)/f'(x\u2080) = (-0.4) - (-0.00968)/(0.67032) \u2192 (-0.4) + 0.00968/0.67032.\n\nCompute 0.00968 / 0.67032 \u2248 0.01444.\n\nSo x\u2081 \u2248 -0.4 + 0.01444 \u2248 -0.38556.\n\nCompute f(x\u2081) = e^(-0.38556) - 0.68.\n\ne^(-0.38556) \u2248 e^(-0.38) \u2248 0.6873 (since e^(-0.38) is approximately 0.6873? Wait, wait, e^(-0.38) = 1 / e^0.38. e^0.38 is approximately 1.4623, so 1/1.4623 \u2248 0.684. So 0.684 - 0.68 is 0.004.\n\nWait, that's a positive value, so f(x\u2081) = 0.684 - 0.68 = 0.004.\n\nf'(x\u2081) = e^(-0.38556) \u2248 0.684.\n\nSo next iteration: x\u2082 = x\u2081 - f(x\u2081)/f'(x\u2081) = (-0.38556) - (0.004)/(0.684) \u2192 (-0.38556) - 0.00585 \u2248 -0.39141.\n\nCompute f(x\u2082) = e^(-0.39141) - 0.68.\n\ne^(-0.39141) \u2248 1 / e^0.39141. e^0.39141 is approximately e^0.39 \u2248 1.477, so 1/1.477 \u2248 0.6765.\n\nSo 0.6765 - 0.68 = -0.0035.\n\nf'(x\u2082) = e^(-0.39141) \u2248 0.6765.\n\nNext iteration: x\u2083 = x\u2082 - f(x\u2082)/f'(x\u2082) = (-0.39141) - (-0.0035)/0.6765 \u2248 (-0.39141) + 0.00517 \u2248 -0.38624.\n\nNow compute f(x\u2083) = e^(-0.38624) - 0.68.\n\ne^(-0.38624) \u2248 1 / e^0.38624 \u2248 1/(1.471) \u2248 0.6802.\n\nSo 0.6802 - 0.68 = 0.0002.\n\nf'(x\u2083) \u2248 0.6802.\n\nNext iteration: x\u2084 = x\u2083 - (0.0002)/0.6802 \u2248 (-0.38624) - 0.00029 \u2248 -0.38653.\n\nCompute f(x\u2084) = e^(-0.38653) - 0.68.\n\ne^(-0.38653) \u2248 1 / e^0.38653 \u2192 e^0.38653 \u2248 1.472, so 1/1.472 \u2248 0.6803.\n\nSo 0.6803 - 0.68 = 0.0003. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's converging around x \u2248 -0.4005.\n\nWait, but this is getting too time-consuming. Let me just accept that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4055.\n\nSo, \u03bb \u2248 0.4055 / 100 = 0.004055 per minute.\n\nNow, compute the probability of decay in 150 minutes: 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) = 1 - e^(-0.004055 * 150).\n\nCompute 0.004055 *150: 0.004055 * 150 = 0.60825.\n\nSo e^(-0.60825) \u2248 ?\n\nWe know that e^(-0.6) \u2248 0.5488, and e^(-0.60825) is a bit less than that.

So \u03bb = 0.4055 / 100 = 0.004055 per minute.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute \u03bb exactly using the given data.\n\nWait, perhaps using the exact expression. Let me think, the decay constant \u03bb is given by the equation 1 - e^(-\u03bb t) = P. So for t=100, P=0.32.\n\nSo, e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 \u2192 ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588) \u2248 0.38566.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, that's a different value than before. Wait, because ln(1/0.68) is positive, so \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when I said ln(0.68) is negative. Because ln(0.68) is negative, but ln(1/0.68) is positive. So yes, \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the sign earlier. Let me recheck.\n\nFrom 1 - e^(-\u03bb t) = P \u2192 e^(-\u03bb t) = 1-P \u2192 -\u03bb t = ln(1-P) \u2192 \u03bb = [ - ln(1-P) ] / t.\n\nSo for P=0.32, \u03bb = [ - ln(0.68) ] / 100 \u2192 ln(0.68) is negative, so the negative makes it positive.\n\nSo \u03bb = (0.4055)/100 = 0.004055 per minute.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier when I computed ln(1/0.68) as approximately 0.4055, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, 1/0.68 is approximately 1.470588. The natural log of 1.470588 is approximately 0.38566. So \u03bb = 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nAh, that's where I went wrong earlier. I thought ln(0.68) was -0.4055, but actually, ln(1/0.68) is 0.4055. Wait, no, no, wait: ln(1/0.68) is the same as -ln(0.68). So if ln(0.68) is -0.4055, then ln(1/0.68) is 0.4055. So yes, \u03bb = 0.4055 / 100 = 0.004055 per minute.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought ln(1.470588) is 0.4055, but that's not correct. Let me compute it accurately.\n\nWait, e^0.4 is approximately 1.4918, which is larger than 1.470588. So ln(1.470588) is less than 0.4. Let me compute it:\n\nCompute ln(1.470588):\n\nWe know that e^0.38566 \u2248 1.470588.\n\nSo ln(1.470588) \u2248 0.38566.\n\nSo, lambda is 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, that's different from the 0.004055 I had earlier. So where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I confused two different approximations. Let me correct this.\n\nSo, to find \u03bb, I need to compute \u03bb = ln(1/(1-P)) / t.\n\nGiven P=0.32, t=100.\n\nSo, 1-P = 0.68.\n\n\u03bb = ln(1/0.68) / 100 \u2192 ln(1.470588)/100 \u2248 0.38566/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is P' = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo, \u03bb * 150 = 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\nSo, e^(-0.57849) \u2248 ?\n\nWe can compute this as 1 / e^(0.57849).\n\nWe know that e^0.5 \u2248 1.64872, e^0.6 \u2248 1.8221188.\n\n0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nLet me compute e^0.57849.\n\nWe can use the Taylor expansion around x=0.5:\n\ne^x = e^0.5 * e^(x-0.5).\n\nx=0.57849 \u2192 x-0.5 = 0.07849.\n\ne^0.07849 \u2248 1 + 0.07849 + (0.07849)^2/2 + (0.07849)^3/6.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1) 1.\n\n2) 0.07849 \u2192 0.07849.\n\n3) (0.07849)^2 = 0.006161 \u2192 0.006161/2 = 0.0030805.\n\n4) (0.07849)^3 \u2248 0.000483 \u2192 0.000483/6 \u2248 0.0000805.\n\nSo summing up: 1 + 0.07849 = 1.07849 \u2192 +0.0030805 \u2192 1.08157 \u2192 +0.0000805 \u2192 1.08165.\n\nSo e^0.07849 \u2248 1.08165.\n\nThus, e^0.57849 \u2248 e^0.5 * e^0.07849 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08165 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 * (1 + 0.08) = 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176.\n\nBut we have 1.08165, which is 1.08 + 0.00165.\n\nSo, 1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.7806176.\n\nThen, 1.64872 * 0.00165 \u2248 0.00272.\n\nSo total \u2248 1.7806176 + 0.00272 \u2248 1.7833376.\n\nSo e^0.57849 \u2248 1.7833.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) = 1 / 1.7833 \u2248 0.5598.\n\nSo P' = 1 - 0.5598 \u2248 0.4402 \u2192 44.02%.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option A)44%.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I used a different \u03bb, I got about 45.57%, but perhaps with the correct \u03bb, it's 44%.\n\nHmm, so the correct answer would be 44%, which is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it has decayed. But wait, probability over what time? Oh right, it's the probability that the atom decays within that time period. So the decay probability P is 32% (0.32) for 100 minutes.\n\nNow, the situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, next 150? Let me read that again. Oh, wait, no, wait. The question says, \"the next 150 minutes.\" But wait, 50 minutes have already passed. So the total time we're considering is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes? Or is it the next 150 minutes from now, making the total time 200 minutes, but we're looking for the probability from now to 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.\n\nHmm, but I think I might be getting confused here. Let me clarify. The decay is a Poisson process, I remember that much. The key thing is that the decay is memoryless, meaning that the probability of decaying in the next t minutes doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the fact that it didn't decay in the first 50 minutes shouldn't affect the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The initial information is that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. So first, I should probably find the decay constant \u03bb, since the decay probability relates to the half-life or the decay constant.\n\nThe formula I remember is that the probability P of decay in time t is P = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So, given that, for t=100 minutes, P=0.32.\n\nSo, let's set that up: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). Rearranging, e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.68) = -100\u03bb.\n\nSo \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCalculating that: ln(0.68) is approximately, let me think, ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. So ln(0.68) is about -0.4 (because e^(-0.4) \u2248 0.6703, which is close to 0.68). Let me compute it more accurately. Alternatively, use a calculator approach.\n\nBut wait, since I'm just thinking, maybe I'll approximate it. Let's compute ln(0.68) more accurately. Let me think: 0.68 is e^x. Let's find x. So e^x = 0.68. x is ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.4 (since e^-0.4 is about 0.6703, which is close to 0.68). So let's say ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nSo \u03bb \u2248 0.4055 / 100 \u2248 0.004055 per minute.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let's see: 0.68 is 68% of 1. So ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32). Alternatively, using a calculator, but since I'm just thinking, maybe I can approximate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute \u03bb using the formula, but perhaps I don't need the exact value because the next step might not require it. Let's see.\n\nWait, the question is about the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nBut since the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in the first 150 minutes of its lifetime. So, the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes doesn't change anything; the remaining probability is just for the next 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200. But the memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same regardless of when you start. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute interval, which would be 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Because the total time from now is 150 minutes, so the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is P(t) = e^(-\u03bb t). So, the probability that it hasn't decayed after 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *50). The probability that it hasn't decayed after 200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*200). So the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is P(200) - P(50) = e^(-\u03bb*200) - e^(-\u03bb*50) = e^(-\u03bb*50) (e^(-\u03bb*150) - 1) ).\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy, but let's proceed.\n\nBut wait, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is [P(200) - P(50)] / P(50). Because the condition is that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, so the probability is (probability of decaying between 50 and 200) divided by (probability of not decaying by 50).\n\nBut wait, given the memoryless property, this should be equal to the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, regardless of the 50 minutes. So, the conditional probability is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes. So, perhaps I can just compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, but let me think. The conditional probability P(decays in 150 | not decayed in 50) = [P(decays between 50 and 200)] / [P(not decayed by 50)].\n\nWhich is [e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / e^(-\u03bb*50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nYes, that's correct. So the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nSo I need to calculate \u03bb from the given data, then compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, but I can also compute \u03bb from the initial data. So, from the given P(100)=0.32.\n\nSo, let's compute \u03bb.\n\nP(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = (- ln(0.68))/100.\n\nCompute ln(0.68). Let me think: ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.4055, since 2/3 is approximately 0.6667. So 0.68 is a bit higher, so ln(0.68) is about -0.4005.\n\nWait, wait, let me think more accurately. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nWe know that ln(0.6931) is approximately -0.3662, but that's for 1/2. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think of e^x = 0.68.\n\nWe can use the Taylor series for ln(x) around x=1: ln(1+x) \u2248 x - x\u00b2/2 + x\u00b3/3 - x^4/4, but that's for x near 0. Alternatively, since 0.68 is 1 - 0.32, maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator approach: I can recall that ln(0.7) \u2248 -0.3567, ln(0.69) \u2248 -0.3711, ln(0.68) is between these. Let me see: 0.68 is 0.69 minus 0.01, so maybe ln(0.68) is about -0.4005? Let me check:\n\ne^(-0.4) is approximately 0.6703, which is less than 0.68. So to get e^(-0.4) = 0.6703.\n\nWait, but we need e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/(-100).\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute ln(0.68) precisely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the approximation that ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nLet me proceed with that.\n\nSo, \u03bb = (0.4055)/100 \u2248 0.004055 per minute.\n\nNow, compute the probability of decay in 150 minutes: 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nSo \u03bb*150 = 0.004055 * 150 \u2248 0.60825.\n\nSo e^(-0.60825) \u2248 what? Well, e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488. e^(-0.60825) would be a bit less. Let's compute:\n\n0.60825 = 0.6 + 0.00825.\n\nSo, e^(-0.60825) = e^(-0.6) * e^(-0.00825).\n\ne^(-0.6) \u2248 0.5488.\n\ne^(-0.00825) \u2248 1 - 0.00825 + (0.00825)^2/2 - ... \u2248 approximately 0.9918 (since 0.00825 is small, so using the approximation e^x \u2248 1 + x for small x, but more accurately, e^(-0.00825) \u2248 0.9918).\n\nSo, 0.5488 * 0.9918 \u2248 0.5444.\n\nSo, 1 - 0.5444 \u2248 0.4556, which is about 45.56%.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D) 48%, but wait, perhaps my approximations are a bit off.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute \u03bb more accurately.\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68) more accurately.\n\nWe can compute ln(0.68) using a calculator approach. Let me think: ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32).\n\nAlternatively, I can use the Taylor expansion for ln(x) around x=1. The expansion is ln(1+x) = x - x\u00b2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + ... for |x| < 1.\n\nSo, 0.68 = 1 - 0.32 \u2192 x = -0.32.\n\nSo ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) = -0.32 - (0.32)^2/2 - (0.32)^3/3 - (0.32)^4/4 - ... \n\nCompute the first few terms:\n\nFirst term: -0.32.\n\nSecond term: -(0.1024)/2 = -0.0512 \u2192 total so far: -0.3712.\n\nThird term: -(0.032768)/3 \u2248 -0.0109227 \u2192 total: -0.3821227.\n\nFourth term: -(0.01048576)/4 \u2248 -0.00262144 \u2192 total: -0.3847441.\n\nFifth term: -(0.0033554432)/5 \u2248 -0.0006710886 \u2192 total: -0.38541519.\n\nSixth term: -(0.001073741824)/6 \u2248 -0.00017895697 \u2192 total: -0.38559415.\n\nSeventh term: -(0.0003435973837)/7 \u2248 -0.00004908534 \u2192 total: -0.385643235.\n\nEighth term: -(0.0001107530715)/8 \u2248 -0.000013844134 \u2192 total: -0.385657079.\n\nSo, up to the eighth term, it's about -0.385657.\n\nBut the actual value of ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005. Hmm, so the approximation using the Taylor series isn't converging quickly enough because x is -0.32, which is a larger value, so higher terms contribute more significantly. So perhaps the Taylor series isn't the best approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a better approximation method, like using the known values of ln(0.69) and ln(0.67) to interpolate.\n\nWait, I think I remember that ln(0.69) is approximately -0.3711, ln(0.68) would be a bit more negative than that. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach. Let's compute ln(0.68) numerically.\n\nLet me try to compute ln(0.68) by using the Newton-Raphson method to solve e^x = 0.68.\n\nWe need to find x such that e^x = 0.68. Let's make an initial guess x\u2080 = -0.4.\n\nCompute e^(-0.4) = 0.67032, which is less than 0.68. So the next guess: x\u2081 = x\u2080 + (0.68 - e^x\u2080)/(e^x\u2080).\n\nWait, Newton-Raphson for e^x - 0.68 = 0.\n\nThe function f(x) = e^x - 0.68. f'(x)=e^x.\n\nAt x\u2080 = -0.4: f(x\u2080)=0.67032 - 0.68 = -0.00968.\n\nf'(x\u2080) = e^(-0.4) = 0.67032.\n\nNext iteration: x\u2081 = x\u2080 - f(x\u2080)/f'(x\u2080) = (-0.4) - (-0.00968)/(0.67032) \u2192 (-0.4) + 0.00968/0.67032.\n\nCompute 0.00968 / 0.67032 \u2248 0.01444.\n\nSo x\u2081 \u2248 -0.4 + 0.01444 \u2248 -0.38556.\n\nCompute f(x\u2081) = e^(-0.38556) - 0.68.\n\ne^(-0.38556) \u2248 e^(-0.38) \u2248 0.6873 (since e^(-0.38) is approximately 0.6873? Wait, wait, e^(-0.38) = 1 / e^0.38. e^0.38 is approximately 1.4623, so 1/1.4623 \u2248 0.684. So 0.684 - 0.68 is 0.004.\n\nWait, that's a positive value, so f(x\u2081) = 0.684 - 0.68 = 0.004.\n\nf'(x\u2081) = e^(-0.38556) \u2248 0.684.\n\nSo next iteration: x\u2082 = x\u2081 - f(x\u2081)/f'(x\u2081) = (-0.38556) - (0.004)/(0.684) \u2192 (-0.38556) - 0.00585 \u2248 -0.39141.\n\nCompute f(x\u2082) = e^(-0.39141) - 0.68.\n\ne^(-0.39141) \u2248 1 / e^0.39141. e^0.39141 is approximately e^0.39 \u2248 1.477, so 1/1.477 \u2248 0.6765.\n\nSo 0.6765 - 0.68 = -0.0035.\n\nf'(x\u2082) = e^(-0.39141) \u2248 0.6765.\n\nNext iteration: x\u2083 = x\u2082 - f(x\u2082)/f'(x\u2082) = (-0.39141) - (-0.0035)/0.6765 \u2248 (-0.39141) + 0.00517 \u2248 -0.38624.\n\nNow compute f(x\u2083) = e^(-0.38624) - 0.68.\n\ne^(-0.38624) \u2248 1 / e^0.38624 \u2248 1/(1.471) \u2248 0.6802.\n\nSo 0.6802 - 0.68 = 0.0002.\n\nf'(x\u2083) \u2248 0.6802.\n\nNext iteration: x\u2084 = x\u2083 - (0.0002)/0.6802 \u2248 (-0.38624) - 0.00029 \u2248 -0.38653.\n\nCompute f(x\u2084) = e^(-0.38653) - 0.68.\n\ne^(-0.38653) \u2248 1 / e^0.38653 \u2192 e^0.38653 \u2248 1.472, so 1/1.472 \u2248 0.6803.\n\nSo 0.6803 - 0.68 = 0.0003. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's converging around x \u2248 -0.4005.\n\nWait, but this is getting too time-consuming. Let me just accept that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4055.\n\nSo, \u03bb \u2248 0.4055 / 100 = 0.004055 per minute.\n\nNow, compute the probability of decay in 150 minutes: 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) = 1 - e^(-0.004055 * 150).\n\nCompute 0.004055 *150: 0.004055 * 150 = 0.60825.\n\nSo e^(-0.60825) \u2248 ?\n\nWe know that e^(-0.6) \u2248 0.5488, and e^(-0.60825) is a bit less than that. Let's compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, use the approximation:\n\ne^(-0.60825) \u2248 e^(-0.6) * e^(-0.00825).\n\nWe know e^(-0.6) \u2248 0.5488.\n\ne^(-0.00825) \u2248 1 - 0.00825 + (0.00825)^2/2 - (0.00825)^3/6.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1st term: 1\n\n2nd term: -0.00825 \u2192 0.99175.\n\n3rd term: (0.00825)^2 = 0.00006806 \u2192 0.00006806 / 2 = 0.00003403 \u2192 0.99175 + 0.00003403 = 0.99178403.\n\n4th term: (0.00825)^3 = 0.0000005615 \u2192 /6 \u2192 0.0000000936 \u2192 subtract that \u2192 0.99178403 - 0.0000000936 \u2248 0.99178394.\n\nSo e^(-0.00825) \u2248 0.99178394.\n\nSo e^(-0.60825) \u2248 0.5488 * 0.99178394 \u2248 0.5488 * 0.99178.\n\nCompute 0.5488 * 0.99178:\n\n0.5488 * 0.99 = 0.5433.\n\n0.5488 * 0.00178 \u2248 approx 0.000974.\n\nSo total \u2248 0.5433 + 0.000974 \u2248 0.54427.\n\nSo 1 - 0.54427 \u2248 0.45573, which is about 45.57%.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)44%\n\nB)40%\n\nC)52%\n\nD)48%\n\nHmm, 45.57% is close to 44% (option A), but I'm getting a bit confused. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?\n\nWait, maybe I should use a more precise value for \u03bb. Let me compute \u03bb more accurately.\n\nWe have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = - ln(0.68)/100.\n\nI can compute ln(0.68) more accurately using a calculator function, but since I don't have one, let's use the approximation that ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.4055. So \u03bb = 0.4055 / 100 = 0.004055 per minute.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute \u03bb exactly using the given data.\n\nWait, perhaps using the exact expression. Let me think, the decay constant \u03bb is given by the equation 1 - e^(-\u03bb t) = P. So for t=100, P=0.32.\n\nSo, e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 \u2192 ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588) \u2248 0.38566.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, that's a different value than before. Wait, because ln(1/0.68) is positive, so \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when I said ln(0.68) is negative. Because ln(0.68) is negative, but ln(1/0.68) is positive. So yes, \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the sign earlier. Let me recheck.\n\nFrom 1 - e^(-\u03bb t) = P \u2192 e^(-\u03bb t) = 1-P \u2192 -\u03bb t = ln(1-P) \u2192 \u03bb = [ - ln(1-P) ] / t.\n\nSo for P=0.32, \u03bb = [ - ln(0.68) ] / 100 \u2192 ln(0.68) is negative, so the negative makes it positive.\n\nSo \u03bb = (0.4055)/100 = 0.004055 per minute.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier when I computed ln(1/0.68) as approximately 0.4055, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, 1/0.68 is approximately 1.470588. The natural log of 1.470588 is approximately 0.38566. So \u03bb = 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nAh, that's where I went wrong earlier. I thought ln(0.68) was -0.4055, but actually, ln(1/0.68) is 0.4055. Wait, no, no, wait: ln(1/0.68) is the same as -ln(0.68). So if ln(0.68) is -0.4055, then ln(1/0.68) is 0.4055. So yes, \u03bb = 0.4055 / 100 = 0.004055 per minute.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought ln(1.470588) is 0.4055, but that's not correct. Let me compute it accurately.\n\nWait, e^0.4 is approximately 1.4918, which is larger than 1.470588. So ln(1.470588) is less than 0.4. Let me compute it:\n\nCompute ln(1.470588):\n\nWe know that e^0.38566 \u2248 1.470588.\n\nSo ln(1.470588) \u2248 0.38566.\n\nSo, lambda is 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nWait, that's different from the 0.004055 I had earlier. So where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I confused two different approximations. Let me correct this.\n\nSo, to find \u03bb, I need to compute \u03bb = ln(1/(1-P)) / t.\n\nGiven P=0.32, t=100.\n\nSo, 1-P = 0.68.\n\n\u03bb = ln(1/0.68) / 100 \u2192 ln(1.470588)/100 \u2248 0.38566/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is P' = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nSo, \u03bb * 150 = 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\nSo, e^(-0.57849) \u2248 ?\n\nWe can compute this as 1 / e^(0.57849).\n\nWe know that e^0.5 \u2248 1.64872, e^0.6 \u2248 1.8221188.\n\n0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nLet me compute e^0.57849.\n\nWe can use the Taylor expansion around x=0.5:\n\ne^x = e^0.5 * e^(x-0.5).\n\nx=0.57849 \u2192 x-0.5 = 0.07849.\n\ne^0.07849 \u2248 1 + 0.07849 + (0.07849)^2/2 + (0.07849)^3/6.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1) 1.\n\n2) 0.07849 \u2192 0.07849.\n\n3) (0.07849)^2 = 0.006161 \u2192 0.006161/2 = 0.0030805.\n\n4) (0.07849)^3 \u2248 0.000483 \u2192 0.000483/6 \u2248 0.0000805.\n\nSo summing up: 1 + 0.07849 = 1.07849 \u2192 +0.0030805 \u2192 1.08157 \u2192 +0.0000805 \u2192 1.08165.\n\nSo e^0.07849 \u2248 1.08165.\n\nThus, e^0.57849 \u2248 e^0.5 * e^0.07849 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08165 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 * (1 + 0.08) = 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176.\n\nBut we have 1.08165, which is 1.08 + 0.00165.\n\nSo, 1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.7806176.\n\nThen, 1.64872 * 0.00165 \u2248 0.00272.\n\nSo total \u2248 1.7806176 + 0.00272 \u2248 1.7833376.\n\nSo e^0.57849 \u2248 1.7833.\n\nSo e^(-0.57849) = 1 / 1.7833 \u2248 0.5598.\n\nSo P' = 1 - 0.5598 \u2248 0.4402 \u2192 44.02%.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option A)44%.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I used a different \u03bb, I got about 45.57%, but perhaps with the correct \u03bb, it's 44%.\n\nHmm, so the correct answer would be 44%, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process using the memoryless property of exponential decay. The probability of an atom decaying within a time \\( t \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is \\( P(100) = 0.32 \\). Using this, we can calculate \\( \\lambda \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\n0.32 = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} \\implies e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\n-\\lambda \\cdot 100 = \\ln(0.68) \\implies \\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100}\n\\]\n\nUsing the approximation \\( \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.4055 \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.4055}{100} \\approx 0.004055 \\, \\text{per minute}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.004055 \\) and \\( t = 150 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\cdot 150 = 0.004055 \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.60825\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( e^{-0.60825} \\). Using approximations:\n\n\\[\ne^{-0.60825} \\approx 0.5444\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - 0.5444 \\approx 0.4556 \\, \\text{or} \\, 45.56\\%.\n\\]\n\nFinally, compare this result with the given options:\n\n- **A) 44%**: Closest to the calculated value of 45.56%.\n- **B) 40%**: Too low.\n- **C) 52%**: Too high.\n- **D) 48%**: Slightly higher than the calculated value.\n\nThe closest option is **A) 44%**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nAlright, the problem says we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, right now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, wait, the next 150 minutes after what? Because 50 minutes have already passed, so are we looking at the next 150 minutes starting now, which would make it 200 minutes total? Or is it the next 150 minutes from the start? I think it's the next 150 minutes starting now, so the total time since the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\" So, starting from the current time, the next 150 minutes. So, that's 150 minutes from now. But wait, the initial 100 minutes was the half-life or the mean lifetime? Oh, wait, no. Wait, the 32% is the probability of decay within 100 minutes. Oh, okay, so the 32% is the probability over 100 minutes. So, the decay process follows an exponential law, right? So the probability of decay doesn't depend on the time already elapsed, but only the remaining time. So, in other words, even if 50 minutes have passed without decay, the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as if it were starting fresh. Or does it?\n\nWait, no. Because radioactive decay is memoryless. So the probability that it decays in the next t minutes is independent of how much time has already passed. So if the initial 100 minutes had a 32% chance, that's like a certain decay constant.\n\nWait, but let me think again. So the decay probability is given as 32% within 100 minutes. So the decay constant \u03bb is such that the probability P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So when t=100, P(100)=0.32.\n\nSo first, I can calculate \u03bb. Let me compute that.\n\nP(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100)\n=> e^(-100 \u03bb) = 0.68\nTake natural log on both sides:\n-100 \u03bb = ln(0.68)\n\u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100\n\nWait, ln(0.68) is negative, so \u03bb is positive. Let me compute the value. ln(0.68) is approximately, since ln(1)=0, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so maybe ln(0.68) is around -0.3857? Let me check with calculator.\n\nWait, 0.68 is e^-0.3856, because e^0.3856 is about 1.47, but wait, no, wait: e^(-0.3856) is 0.68. So yes, ln(0.68) = -0.3856. So \u03bb is 0.3856 / 100 = 0.003856 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes (from now)?\n\nWait, but wait, in the exponential model, the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So even though 50 minutes have passed, the probability for the next 150 is the same as for any 150-minute period. So the probability is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWait, no, because the 32% was given for 100 minutes. So the initial 100 minutes, the probability is 32%. So the way I think it's set up, the decay follows P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t), so \u03bb is fixed.\n\nSo, let me compute P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150). We've got \u03bb as 0.003856 per minute.\n\nSo \u03bb*150 = 0.003856 * 150 \u2248 0.5784.\n\nSo e^(-0.5784) is approximately... let's think. e^(-0.5)=0.6065, e^(-0.6)=0.5488. So 0.5784 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the relation that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5784 is about 0.6931 * (0.5784 /0.6931) \u2248 0.6931 * 0.835. So e^(-0.5784) \u2248 1/(2^0.835) \u2248 1/(approx 1.76) \u2248 0.568. Hmm, but wait, that's just a rough estimate. Alternatively, using a calculator would be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute e^-0.5784 more accurately.\n\nUsing Taylor series expansion around x=0: e^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2 + x\u00b3/6.\n\nBut x is -0.5784, which is a bit big, so maybe not the best. Alternatively, I can use a calculator-like approach.\n\nAlternatively, think that 0.5784 is about 0.578. Let me compute e^-0.578.\n\nLet me compute 0.578:\n\ne^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.578 is about e^(0.5 + 0.078) = e^0.5 * e^0.078 \u2248 1.6487 * 1.081 \u2248 1.6487 * 1.08 = approx 1.782.\n\nSo e^-0.578 \u2248 1 / 1.782 \u2248 0.56.\n\nWait, but that's just a rough estimate. Let me see, 1.782 is the e^0.578, so the reciprocal is 0.562.\n\nSo P(150) = 1 - 0.562 = 0.438, which is about 43.8%, so approximately 44%. Looking at the options, option A is 44%.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The initial 100 minutes had a 32% chance. So the decay constant \u03bb is 0.003856 per minute. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). So let's compute \u03bb*150: 0.003856 *150 = 0.5784.\n\nSo e^-0.5784 is approximately, as I said, 0.562, so 1-0.562 = 0.438, so 43.8%, which is approximately 44% as option A.\n\nBut wait, another approach: since 100 minutes gives 32% decay, then the half-life would be when P(t) = 50%. So solving 0.5 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t), so e^(-\u03bb t) = 0.5. So \u03bb t = ln(2) \u2248 0.6931. So for t=100, \u03bb = 0.6931/100 = 0.006931 per minute. But wait, earlier calculation from 0.32 in 100 minutes gave \u03bb as approximately 0.003856 per minute. So these are different. So perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given 32% is not the same as the half-life. So the initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's P(100) = 0.32. So \u03bb is calculated correctly as 0.003856 per minute.\n\nSo, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(150)=1-e^(-0.003856 *150) = 1 - e^(-0.5784) \u2248 1 - 0.562 = 0.438 or 43.8%, which is about 44%, so option A.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Since 50 minutes have already passed without decay, does that affect the probability? No, because radioactive decay is memoryless. The probability that the atom decays in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how long it's been around. So even though 50 minutes have passed, the probability for the next 150 is the same as if it had just started. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but another approach. Since 50 minutes have passed, the remaining time is 150 minutes. So the time elapsed since the start is 50+150=200 minutes. But the probability of decay in 200 minutes is P(200)=1 - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nBut wait, the question is about the next 150 minutes, not the total 200. So it's the same as P(150). So the approach I took earlier is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the decay probability over the next 150 minutes, not the total. So P(150) is correct.\n\nSo the calculation gives approximately 43.8%, which rounds to 44%, so option A.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA)44%\n\nB)40%\n\nC)52%\n\nD)48%\n\nSo the closest is A)44%.\n\nWait, but let me compute more accurately. Let's compute e^-0.5784 more precisely.\n\nUsing a calculator (if I had one), but since I can't, I'll try to compute it more accurately.\n\nWe can write 0.5784 as 0.5784.\n\nWe know that e^-0.5 = 0.60653066.\n\ne^-0.5784 = e^-(0.5 + 0.0784) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.0784.\n\ne^-0.0784 can be approximated using the Taylor series around 0: e^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2 + x^3/6.\n\nSo x = -0.0784.\n\nSo e^-0.0784 \u2248 1 -0.0784 + (0.0784)^2/2 - (0.0784)^3/6.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n0.0784^2 = 0.0784 * 0.0784 \u2248 0.00614656.\n\n0.00614656 / 2 \u2248 0.00307328.\n\n0.0784^3 \u2248 0.0784 * 0.00614656 \u2248 0.000482688.\n\n0.000482688 /6 \u2248 0.000080448.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1 -0.0784 = 0.9216.\n\n+ 0.00307328 \u2192 0.9216 + 0.00307328 = 0.92467328.\n\n- 0.000080448 \u2192 0.92467328 - 0.000080448 \u2248 0.92459283.\n\nSo e^-0.0784 \u2248 0.92459283.\n\nSo e^-0.5784 = e^-0.5 * e^-0.0784 \u2248 0.60653066 * 0.92459283.\n\nMultiplying 0.60653066 * 0.92459283.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.6 * 0.92459283 \u2248 0.554755698.\n\n0.00653066 * 0.92459283 \u2248 approx 0.006044.\n\nAdding them together: 0.554755698 + 0.006044 \u2248 0.5608.\n\nSo e^-0.5784 \u2248 0.5608.\n\nThus, P(150) = 1 - 0.5608 \u2248 0.4392 \u2192 43.92%, which is approximately 44%. So the answer is A)44%.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the initial probability of 32% in 100 minutes is P(100) = 0.32. So using that, we found \u03bb \u2248 0.003856 per minute.\n\nBut perhaps a more precise way to calculate \u03bb would be better. Let me compute \u03bb accurately.\n\nWe have P(100)=0.32 =1 - e^(-\u03bb*100).\n\nSo e^(-100 \u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTake natural log on both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68).\n\nSo \u03bb = - ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCompute ln(0.68):\n\nWe can use the Taylor series for ln(x) around x=1.\n\nln(x) \u2248 (x-1) - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - (x-1)^4/4 + ... \n\nBut 0.68 is 0.32 below 1, so x=0.68, x-1=-0.32.\n\nSo let me compute ln(0.68) as follows:\n\nln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) \u2248 -0.32 - (0.32)^2/2 - (0.32)^3/3 - (0.32)^4/4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-0.32 \u2192 -0.32\n\n- (0.32)^2 /2 = - (0.1024)/2 = -0.0512 \u2192 total so far: -0.3712\n\n- (0.32)^3 /3 = -(0.032768)/3 \u2248 -0.0109227 \u2192 total: -0.3821227\n\n- (0.32)^4 /4 = -(0.01048576)/4 \u2248 -0.00262144 \u2192 total: -0.384744.\n\nNext term: -(0.32)^5 /5 = -(0.0033554432)/5 \u2248 -0.000671088 \u2192 total: -0.385415.\n\nNext term: -(0.32)^6 /6 \u2248 -(0.0010737418)/6 \u2248 -0.00017895697 \u2192 total: -0.385594.\n\nAnd so on. The approximation is getting closer. Let's see, the actual ln(0.68) is approximately -0.385662. So our approximation is pretty close.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, compute \u03bb *150 = 0.00385662 *150 = 0.578493.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) is the value we need. Let's compute this more accurately.\n\nUsing the same method as before, perhaps using a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a better approximation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that ln(2) is 0.6931, so 0.578493 is about 0.6931 * 0.835.\n\nWait, 0.6931 * 0.835 is 0.6931 * 0.8 = 0.55448, and 0.6931 * 0.035 = 0.0242585. So 0.55448 + 0.0242585 = 0.5787385. That's close to 0.578493.\n\nSo 0.578493 is about ln(2) * 0.835. So e^(-0.578493) = 1/(e^(ln(2)*0.835)) )= 1/(2^0.835).\n\n2^0.835 is approximately, since 2^0.8 is about 1.7411, and 2^0.035 is about 1.025, so 1.7411 * 1.025 \u2248 1.783. So 1/1.783 \u2248 0.5607.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) \u2248 0.5607.\n\nThus, P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393 or 43.93%, which is approximately 44%.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option A)44%.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the initial assumption is correct. The question says, \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\" So that's the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes from the current time, regardless of how much time has passed. So yes, the memoryless property applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a bit tricky. Because the 32% is for 100 minutes, but we're being asked about 150 minutes in the future, so perhaps the probability is 32% times (150/100) = 48%, but that's not correct because decay probabilities don't add linearly. Wait, no, that approach is wrong because the decay process is exponential, not linear.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's find the decay constant \u03bb from the given data.\n\nWe know that P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t) = 0.32 when t=100.\n\nSo solving for \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb = (-ln(1 - 0.32)) /100 = (-ln(0.68))/100 \u2248 (0.385662)/100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, the time elapsed since the start is 50 minutes. So the remaining time we're interested in is 150 minutes. So the total time from the start is 200 minutes. But wait, no, because the question is about the next 150 minutes, so starting from now.\n\nWait, no, the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, so the time that has passed is 50 minutes. The remaining time is 150 minutes from now. So the probability is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes from now, which is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nBut another way to think about it is: the probability that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *50). Then, given that it hasn't decayed, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is [1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)].\n\nWait, but because of the memoryless property, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes starting from time zero. So it's still 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) = 0.4393, which is 43.93%.\n\nSo the correct answer is 44%, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the time as 200 minutes, but that's not what the question says. The question says \"the next 150 minutes\", which would be from the current time, not from the initial time.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is A)44%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model, which states that the probability of an atom decaying in a given time follows the equation:\n\n\\[\nP(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(P(t)\\) is the probability of decay, \\(\\lambda\\) is the decay constant, and \\(t\\) is the time.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the decay constant (\\(\\lambda\\))\nThe problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \\(P(100) = 0.32\\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nAlright, the problem says we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, right now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, wait, the next 150 minutes after what? Because 50 minutes have already passed, so are we looking at the next 150 minutes starting now, which would make it 200 minutes total? Or is it the next 150 minutes from the start? I think it's the next 150 minutes starting now, so the total time since the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\" So, starting from the current time, the next 150 minutes. So, that's 150 minutes from now. But wait, the initial 100 minutes was the half-life or the mean lifetime? Oh, wait, no. Wait, the 32% is the probability of decay within 100 minutes. Oh, okay, so the 32% is the probability over 100 minutes. So, the decay process follows an exponential law, right? So the probability of decay doesn't depend on the time already elapsed, but only the remaining time. So, in other words, even if 50 minutes have passed without decay, the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as if it were starting fresh. Or does it?\n\nWait, no. Because radioactive decay is memoryless. So the probability that it decays in the next t minutes is independent of how much time has already passed. So if the initial 100 minutes had a 32% chance, that's like a certain decay constant.\n\nWait, but let me think again. So the decay probability is given as 32% within 100 minutes. So the decay constant \u03bb is such that the probability P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). So when t=100, P(100)=0.32.\n\nSo first, I can calculate \u03bb. Let me compute that.\n\nP(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100)\n=> e^(-100 \u03bb) = 0.68\nTake natural log on both sides:\n-100 \u03bb = ln(0.68)\n\u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100\n\nWait, ln(0.68) is negative, so \u03bb is positive. Let me compute the value. ln(0.68) is approximately, since ln(1)=0, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so maybe ln(0.68) is around -0.3857? Let me check with calculator.\n\nWait, 0.68 is e^-0.3856, because e^0.3856 is about 1.47, but wait, no, wait: e^(-0.3856) is 0.68. So yes, ln(0.68) = -0.3856. So \u03bb is 0.3856 / 100 = 0.003856 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes (from now)?\n\nWait, but wait, in the exponential model, the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So even though 50 minutes have passed, the probability for the next 150 is the same as for any 150-minute period. So the probability is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWait, no, because the 32% was given for 100 minutes. So the initial 100 minutes, the probability is 32%. So the way I think it's set up, the decay follows P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t), so \u03bb is fixed.\n\nSo, let me compute P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150). We've got \u03bb as 0.003856 per minute.\n\nSo \u03bb*150 = 0.003856 * 150 \u2248 0.5784.\n\nSo e^(-0.5784) is approximately... let's think. e^(-0.5)=0.6065, e^(-0.6)=0.5488. So 0.5784 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the relation that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5784 is about 0.6931 * (0.5784 /0.6931) \u2248 0.6931 * 0.835. So e^(-0.5784) \u2248 1/(2^0.835) \u2248 1/(approx 1.76) \u2248 0.568. Hmm, but wait, that's just a rough estimate. Alternatively, using a calculator would be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute e^-0.5784 more accurately.\n\nUsing Taylor series expansion around x=0: e^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2 + x\u00b3/6.\n\nBut x is -0.5784, which is a bit big, so maybe not the best. Alternatively, I can use a calculator-like approach.\n\nAlternatively, think that 0.5784 is about 0.578. Let me compute e^-0.578.\n\nLet me compute 0.578:\n\ne^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.578 is about e^(0.5 + 0.078) = e^0.5 * e^0.078 \u2248 1.6487 * 1.081 \u2248 1.6487 * 1.08 = approx 1.782.\n\nSo e^-0.578 \u2248 1 / 1.782 \u2248 0.56.\n\nWait, but that's just a rough estimate. Let me see, 1.782 is the e^0.578, so the reciprocal is 0.562.\n\nSo P(150) = 1 - 0.562 = 0.438, which is about 43.8%, so approximately 44%. Looking at the options, option A is 44%.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The initial 100 minutes had a 32% chance. So the decay constant \u03bb is 0.003856 per minute. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). So let's compute \u03bb*150: 0.003856 *150 = 0.5784.\n\nSo e^-0.5784 is approximately, as I said, 0.562, so 1-0.562 = 0.438, so 43.8%, which is approximately 44% as option A.\n\nBut wait, another approach: since 100 minutes gives 32% decay, then the half-life would be when P(t) = 50%. So solving 0.5 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t), so e^(-\u03bb t) = 0.5. So \u03bb t = ln(2) \u2248 0.6931. So for t=100, \u03bb = 0.6931/100 = 0.006931 per minute. But wait, earlier calculation from 0.32 in 100 minutes gave \u03bb as approximately 0.003856 per minute. So these are different. So perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given 32% is not the same as the half-life. So the initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's P(100) = 0.32. So \u03bb is calculated correctly as 0.003856 per minute.\n\nSo, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(150)=1-e^(-0.003856 *150) = 1 - e^(-0.5784) \u2248 1 - 0.562 = 0.438 or 43.8%, which is about 44%, so option A.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Since 50 minutes have already passed without decay, does that affect the probability? No, because radioactive decay is memoryless. The probability that the atom decays in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how long it's been around. So even though 50 minutes have passed, the probability for the next 150 is the same as if it had just started. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but another approach. Since 50 minutes have passed, the remaining time is 150 minutes. So the time elapsed since the start is 50+150=200 minutes. But the probability of decay in 200 minutes is P(200)=1 - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nBut wait, the question is about the next 150 minutes, not the total 200. So it's the same as P(150). So the approach I took earlier is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the decay probability over the next 150 minutes, not the total. So P(150) is correct.\n\nSo the calculation gives approximately 43.8%, which rounds to 44%, so option A.\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA)44%\n\nB)40%\n\nC)52%\n\nD)48%\n\nSo the closest is A)44%.\n\nWait, but let me compute more accurately. Let's compute e^-0.5784 more precisely.\n\nUsing a calculator (if I had one), but since I can't, I'll try to compute it more accurately.\n\nWe can write 0.5784 as 0.5784.\n\nWe know that e^-0.5 = 0.60653066.\n\ne^-0.5784 = e^-(0.5 + 0.0784) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.0784.\n\ne^-0.0784 can be approximated using the Taylor series around 0: e^x \u2248 1 + x + x\u00b2/2 + x^3/6.\n\nSo x = -0.0784.\n\nSo e^-0.0784 \u2248 1 -0.0784 + (0.0784)^2/2 - (0.0784)^3/6.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n0.0784^2 = 0.0784 * 0.0784 \u2248 0.00614656.\n\n0.00614656 / 2 \u2248 0.00307328.\n\n0.0784^3 \u2248 0.0784 * 0.00614656 \u2248 0.000482688.\n\n0.000482688 /6 \u2248 0.000080448.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1 -0.0784 = 0.9216.\n\n+ 0.00307328 \u2192 0.9216 + 0.00307328 = 0.92467328.\n\n- 0.000080448 \u2192 0.92467328 - 0.000080448 \u2248 0.92459283.\n\nSo e^-0.0784 \u2248 0.92459283.\n\nSo e^-0.5784 = e^-0.5 * e^-0.0784 \u2248 0.60653066 * 0.92459283.\n\nMultiplying 0.60653066 * 0.92459283.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.6 * 0.92459283 \u2248 0.554755698.\n\n0.00653066 * 0.92459283 \u2248 approx 0.006044.\n\nAdding them together: 0.554755698 + 0.006044 \u2248 0.5608.\n\nSo e^-0.5784 \u2248 0.5608.\n\nThus, P(150) = 1 - 0.5608 \u2248 0.4392 \u2192 43.92%, which is approximately 44%. So the answer is A)44%.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the initial probability of 32% in 100 minutes is P(100) = 0.32. So using that, we found \u03bb \u2248 0.003856 per minute.\n\nBut perhaps a more precise way to calculate \u03bb would be better. Let me compute \u03bb accurately.\n\nWe have P(100)=0.32 =1 - e^(-\u03bb*100).\n\nSo e^(-100 \u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTake natural log on both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68).\n\nSo \u03bb = - ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCompute ln(0.68):\n\nWe can use the Taylor series for ln(x) around x=1.\n\nln(x) \u2248 (x-1) - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - (x-1)^4/4 + ... \n\nBut 0.68 is 0.32 below 1, so x=0.68, x-1=-0.32.\n\nSo let me compute ln(0.68) as follows:\n\nln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) \u2248 -0.32 - (0.32)^2/2 - (0.32)^3/3 - (0.32)^4/4.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-0.32 \u2192 -0.32\n\n- (0.32)^2 /2 = - (0.1024)/2 = -0.0512 \u2192 total so far: -0.3712\n\n- (0.32)^3 /3 = -(0.032768)/3 \u2248 -0.0109227 \u2192 total: -0.3821227\n\n- (0.32)^4 /4 = -(0.01048576)/4 \u2248 -0.00262144 \u2192 total: -0.384744.\n\nNext term: -(0.32)^5 /5 = -(0.0033554432)/5 \u2248 -0.000671088 \u2192 total: -0.385415.\n\nNext term: -(0.32)^6 /6 \u2248 -(0.0010737418)/6 \u2248 -0.00017895697 \u2192 total: -0.385594.\n\nAnd so on. The approximation is getting closer. Let's see, the actual ln(0.68) is approximately -0.385662. So our approximation is pretty close.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, compute \u03bb *150 = 0.00385662 *150 = 0.578493.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) is the value we need. Let's compute this more accurately.\n\nUsing the same method as before, perhaps using a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a better approximation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that ln(2) is 0.6931, so 0.578493 is about 0.6931 * 0.835.\n\nWait, 0.6931 * 0.835 is 0.6931 * 0.8 = 0.55448, and 0.6931 * 0.035 = 0.0242585. So 0.55448 + 0.0242585 = 0.5787385. That's close to 0.578493.\n\nSo 0.578493 is about ln(2) * 0.835. So e^(-0.578493) = 1/(e^(ln(2)*0.835)) )= 1/(2^0.835).\n\n2^0.835 is approximately, since 2^0.8 is about 1.7411, and 2^0.035 is about 1.025, so 1.7411 * 1.025 \u2248 1.783. So 1/1.783 \u2248 0.5607.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) \u2248 0.5607.\n\nThus, P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393 or 43.93%, which is approximately 44%.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option A)44%.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the initial assumption is correct. The question says, \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\" So that's the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes from the current time, regardless of how much time has passed. So yes, the memoryless property applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a bit tricky. Because the 32% is for 100 minutes, but we're being asked about 150 minutes in the future, so perhaps the probability is 32% times (150/100) = 48%, but that's not correct because decay probabilities don't add linearly. Wait, no, that approach is wrong because the decay process is exponential, not linear.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's find the decay constant \u03bb from the given data.\n\nWe know that P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t) = 0.32 when t=100.\n\nSo solving for \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb = (-ln(1 - 0.32)) /100 = (-ln(0.68))/100 \u2248 (0.385662)/100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nNow, the time elapsed since the start is 50 minutes. So the remaining time we're interested in is 150 minutes. So the total time from the start is 200 minutes. But wait, no, because the question is about the next 150 minutes, so starting from now.\n\nWait, no, the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, so the time that has passed is 50 minutes. The remaining time is 150 minutes from now. So the probability is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes from now, which is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nBut another way to think about it is: the probability that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *50). Then, given that it hasn't decayed, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is [1 - e^(-\u03bb *150)].\n\nWait, but because of the memoryless property, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes starting from time zero. So it's still 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) = 0.4393, which is 43.93%.\n\nSo the correct answer is 44%, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the time as 200 minutes, but that's not what the question says. The question says \"the next 150 minutes\", which would be from the current time, not from the initial time.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is A)44%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model, which states that the probability of an atom decaying in a given time follows the equation:\n\n\\[\nP(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(P(t)\\) is the probability of decay, \\(\\lambda\\) is the decay constant, and \\(t\\) is the time.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the decay constant (\\(\\lambda\\))\nThe problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \\(P(100) = 0.32\\). Substituting into the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.32 = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100}\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\ne^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.68\n\\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\n-\\lambda \\cdot 100 = \\ln(0.68)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\(\\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.3856\\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.3856}{100} = 0.003856 \\, \\text{per minute.}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes\nThe question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, starting from the current time. Using the decay equation:\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(\\lambda = 0.003856\\) and \\(t = 150\\):\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-0.003856 \\cdot 150}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-0.5784}\n\\]\n\nTo compute \\(e^{-0.5784}\\), we approximate it as \\(e^{-0.5784} \\approx 0.5608\\). Thus:\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392\n\\]\n\nConverting to a percentage:\n\n\\[\nP(150) \\approx 43.92\\% \\, \\text{(approximately 44%)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Verify the memoryless property\nThe memoryless property of radioactive decay ensures that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes that have already passed. Therefore, the calculation remains valid.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**, corresponding to option **A**.\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.\n\nThe question says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are A) 44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.\n\nHmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The key point here is that the decay process is memoryless. Oh wait, right! The probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So even if the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, the probability for the next period is still calculated based on the remaining time.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The given decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. That's the total probability over 100 minutes. So, the decay constant must be related to that.\n\nThe formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. But the probability that the atom decays by time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So, in this case, the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). Hmm, I can solve for \u03bb from this.\n\nLet me rearrange that equation. e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides, -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = - ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that. ln(0.68) is approximately... Well, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so 0.68 is a bit less than that. Maybe around -0.4005? So, \u03bb is approximately 0.004005 per minute.\n\nWait, let me get that precise. Let me compute ln(0.68). Oh wait, I can compute it using a calculator. But since I'm just thinking, I'll approximate. Let me remember that ln(0.5) is about -0.693, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and ln(0.68) is a bit closer to ln(0.7). Let me see: ln(0.68) is about -0.4005, so \u03bb is 0.004005 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is, what's the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes? But wait, since 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet, the remaining time is 150 minutes. Wait, no. Wait, the total time we're considering is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Or is it just 150 minutes from now?\n\nWait, no. The way the question is phrased: the initial monitoring started after 50 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period, regardless of previous time.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the probability that it decays at all within the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Oh, right, because the decay is memoryless, the conditional probability is the same as the probability over 150 minutes, regardless of the past. So the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because the question is asking for the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the conditional probability is P(decay in next 150) = [P(decay in 200) - P(decay in 50)] / P(not decayed in 50).\n\nSo P(decay in 200) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200). P(decay in 50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*50). P(not decayed in 50) = e^(-\u03bb*50).\n\nSo the conditional probability is [ (1 - e^(-200\u03bb)) - (1 - e^(-50\u03bb)) ] / e^(-50\u03bb) )\n\nSimplify numerator: (1 - e^{-200\u03bb} -1 + e^{-50\u03bb}) = e^{-50\u03bb} - e^{-200\u03bb}.\n\nDivide by e^{-50\u03bb}: [e^{-50\u03bb} (1 - e^{-150\u03bb})] / e^{-50\u03bb} ) = 1 - e^{-150\u03bb}.\n\nSo the conditional probability is 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}, which is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. So, regardless of the prior 50 minutes, the probability is the same as if we were starting fresh for 150 minutes.\n\nSo I just need to compute 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}, where \u03bb is the decay constant found earlier.\n\nFrom the initial condition: 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100\u03bb}, so e^{-100\u03bb}=0.68.\n\nWe can write e^{-150\u03bb} as e^{-100\u03bb} * e^{-50\u03bb} = 0.68 * e^{-50\u03bb}.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Since we know e^{-100\u03bb} = 0.68, then e^{-50\u03bb} = sqrt(0.68) because (e^{-50\u03bb})^2 = e^{-100\u03bb} = 0.68. So sqrt(0.68) is approximately 0.8246.\n\nSo e^{-50\u03bb} \u2248 0.8246.\n\nNow, e^{-150\u03bb} = e^{-100\u03bb} * e^{-50\u03bb} = 0.68 * 0.8246 \u2248 0.56.\n\nSo 1 - e^{-150\u03bb} \u2248 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%. So the probability is 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.68) precisely. 0.68 is 68/100. sqrt(68) is about 8.246, so sqrt(0.68) is about 0.8246. So yes, 0.68 * 0.8246 is approximately 0.56.\n\nWait, 0.68 * 0.8246: 0.6 * 0.8 is 0.48, 0.6 *0.0246 is 0.01476, 0.08 *0.8 is 0.064, 0.08 *0.0246 is 0.001968. Adding all up: 0.48 + 0.01476 = 0.49476; 0.064 + 0.001968=0.065968. Sum is about 0.49476 +0.065968=0.5607. So approximately 0.5607. So 1 -0.5607 is 0.4393, so about 43.93%, which rounds to 44%. So option A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the exact method without approximations. Let me try.\n\nGiven that e^{-100\u03bb} = 0.68.\n\nWe need e^{-150\u03bb} = e^{-100\u03bb} * e^{-50\u03bb} = 0.68 * e^{-50\u03bb}.\n\nBut e^{-50\u03bb} is sqrt(e^{-100\u03bb}) = sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.824621.\n\nSo e^{-150\u03bb} = 0.68 * 0.824621 = 0.56069.\n\nSo 1 - 0.56069 = 0.43931, which is 43.93%, so 44%. So option A is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another approach: perhaps using the fact that the decay is exponential, the probability of decay in any time interval is the same, given it hasn't decayed before. So the probability for the next t minutes is 1 - e^{-\u03bb t}.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the original 32% is for 100 minutes. So the decay constant \u03bb is such that 1 - e^{-\u03bb *100} = 0.32. So \u03bb = -ln(1 - 0.32)/100 = ln(1/0.68)/100.\n\nAlternatively, \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100 = ln(1.470588)/100 \u2248 0.38566/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the time in question is 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}.\n\nCompute \u03bb *150 = 0.0038566 *150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\ne^-0.57849 is approximately e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.561.\n\nSo 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%, so 44%, option A.\n\nSo the answer should be A) 44%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.\n\nThe question says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are A) 44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.\n\nHmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model.

So even if the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, the probability for the next period is still calculated based on the remaining time.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The given decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. That's the total probability over 100 minutes. So, the decay constant must be related to that.\n\nThe formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. But the probability that the atom decays by time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So, in this case, the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). Hmm, I can solve for \u03bb from this.\n\nLet me rearrange that equation. e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides, -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = - ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that. ln(0.68) is approximately... Well, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so 0.68 is a bit less than that. Maybe around -0.4005?

Let me see: ln(0.68) is about -0.4005, so \u03bb is 0.004005 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is, what's the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes? But wait, since 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet, the remaining time is 150 minutes. Wait, no. Wait, the total time we're considering is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Or is it just 150 minutes from now?\n\nWait, no. The way the question is phrased: the initial monitoring started after 50 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period, regardless of previous time.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the probability that it decays at all within the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Oh, right, because the decay is memoryless, the conditional probability is the same as the probability over 150 minutes, regardless of the past. So the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because the question is asking for the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the conditional probability is P(decay in next 150) = [P(decay in 200) - P(decay in 50)] / P(not decayed in 50).\n\nSo P(decay in 200) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200). P(decay in 50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*50). P(not decayed in 50) = e^(-\u03bb*50).\n\nSo the conditional probability is [ (1 - e^(-200\u03bb)) - (1 - e^(-50\u03bb)) ] / e^(-50\u03bb) )\n\nSimplify numerator: (1 - e^{-200\u03bb} -1 + e^{-50\u03bb}) = e^{-50\u03bb} - e^{-200\u03bb}.\n\nDivide by e^{-50\u03bb}: [e^{-50\u03bb} (1 - e^{-150\u03bb})] / e^{-50\u03bb} ) = 1 - e^{-150\u03bb}.\n\nSo the conditional probability is 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}, which is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. So, regardless of the prior 50 minutes, the probability is the same as if we were starting fresh for 150 minutes.\n\nSo I just need to compute 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}, where \u03bb is the decay constant found earlier.\n\nFrom the initial condition: 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100\u03bb}, so e^{-100\u03bb}=0.68.\n\nWe can write e^{-150\u03bb} as e^{-100\u03bb} * e^{-50\u03bb} = 0.68 * e^{-50\u03bb}.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Since we know e^{-100\u03bb} = 0.68, then e^{-50\u03bb} = sqrt(0.68) because (e^{-50\u03bb})^2 = e^{-100\u03bb} = 0.68. So sqrt(0.68) is approximately 0.8246.\n\nSo e^{-50\u03bb} \u2248 0.8246.\n\nNow, e^{-150\u03bb} = e^{-100\u03bb} * e^{-50\u03bb} = 0.68 * 0.8246 \u2248 0.56.\n\nSo 1 - e^{-150\u03bb} \u2248 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%. So the probability is 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.68) precisely. 0.68 is 68/100. sqrt(68) is about 8.246, so sqrt(0.68) is about 0.8246. So yes, 0.68 * 0.8246 is approximately 0.56.\n\nWait, 0.68 * 0.8246: 0.6 * 0.8 is 0.48, 0.6 *0.0246 is 0.01476, 0.08 *0.8 is 0.064, 0.08 *0.0246 is 0.001968. Adding all up: 0.48 + 0.01476 = 0.49476; 0.064 + 0.001968=0.065968. Sum is about 0.49476 +0.065968=0.5607. So approximately 0.5607. So 1 -0.5607 is 0.4393, so about 43.93%, which rounds to 44%. So option A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the exact method without approximations. Let me try.\n\nGiven that e^{-100\u03bb} = 0.68.\n\nWe need e^{-150\u03bb} = e^{-100\u03bb} * e^{-50\u03bb} = 0.68 * e^{-50\u03bb}.\n\nBut e^{-50\u03bb} is sqrt(e^{-100\u03bb}) = sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.824621.\n\nSo e^{-150\u03bb} = 0.68 * 0.824621 = 0.56069.\n\nSo 1 - 0.56069 = 0.43931, which is 43.93%, so 44%. So option A is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another approach: perhaps using the fact that the decay is exponential, the probability of decay in any time interval is the same, given it hasn't decayed before. So the probability for the next t minutes is 1 - e^{-\u03bb t}.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the original 32% is for 100 minutes. So the decay constant \u03bb is such that 1 - e^{-\u03bb *100} = 0.32. So \u03bb = -ln(1 - 0.32)/100 = ln(1/0.68)/100.\n\nAlternatively, \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100 = ln(1.470588)/100 \u2248 0.38566/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the time in question is 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}.\n\nCompute \u03bb *150 = 0.0038566 *150 \u2248 0.57849.\n\ne^-0.57849 is approximately e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.561.\n\nSo 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%, so 44%, option A.\n\nSo the answer should be A) 44%.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the probability that a radioactive atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay process follows an exponential model, and the probability of decay is memoryless. The key steps to solve the problem are as follows:\n\n1. **Given Information**: The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. This implies that \\( 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.32 \\). Rearranging, \\( e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68 \\).\n\n2. **Decay Constant**: Solve for the decay constant \\( \\lambda \\). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, \\( -100\\lambda = \\ln(0.68) \\), so \\( \\lambda = -\\ln(0.68) / 100 \\). Approximating \\( \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.4005 \\), we find \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.004005 \\, \\text{per minute} \\).\n\n3. **Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes**: The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is given by \\( 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150} \\). To compute this:\n   - First, calculate \\( e^{-150\\lambda} \\). Using \\( e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68 \\), we find \\( e^{-150\\lambda} = e^{-100\\lambda} \\cdot e^{-50\\lambda} = 0.68 \\cdot \\sqrt{0.68} \\).\n   - Approximating \\( \\sqrt{0.68} \\approx 0.8246 \\), we get \\( e^{-150\\lambda} \\approx 0.68 \\cdot 0.8246 \\approx 0.5607 \\).\n   - Finally, \\( 1 - e^{-150\\lambda} \\approx 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393 \\), or 43.93%.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%. This matches option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about radioactive decay. Let me think about what I know. The question is about the probability of an atom decaying after a certain time, given that it hasn't decayed already. Hmm, right, this sounds like it involves conditional probability and maybe the concept of half-life or something related to exponential decay.\n\nSo, the setup is that we have an atom with a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. But wait, 50 minutes have already passed and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, 150 minutes from now? Or in the next 150 minutes after the initial 100? Wait no, the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes, right? Because the first 50 minutes have already passed without decay.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that 50 minutes have passed since we started monitoring, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes, making the total 200 minutes since the start. But the given probability is for decay within 100 minutes. So I need to find the probability of decay between time t=50 to t=200 (150 minutes), given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.\n\nWait, but I think I should model this using the decay equation. The general formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant, and t is time.\n\nThe decay probability within a certain time is given by 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So the probability of decay in time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).\n\nWait, but in this case, the given probability is 32% (0.32) for 100 minutes. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). So I can solve for \u03bb.\n\nLet me write that equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). Rearranging, e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. So taking natural log on both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68): ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but wait, 0.68 is 68% of 1. Let me calculate it more accurately. Wait, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005. So \u03bb is approximately 0.4005 / 100 = 0.004005 per minute.\n\nWait, but maybe I should use a calculator for more precise value. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed symbolically without exact numbers.\n\nSo, the question is, what's the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. Hmm, so the time elapsed since the start is 50 minutes, and we're looking at the next 150, making 200 minutes in total. So the probability we need is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200, given that it hasn't decayed up to t=50.\n\nWait, but in radioactive decay, the process is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next time period doesn't depend on how long it's been already. So the probability of decaying in the next T minutes is the same as it being T minutes from the start.\n\nWait, so the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is equal to the probability it decays in 150 minutes. Because the decay process is memoryless. So the probability would be 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the initial 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the survival probability after 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *50). Then, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. But since the process is memoryless, the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from any starting point, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, but wait, another way to look at it: the probability that it hasn't decayed after 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *50). Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 is the probability that it decays in 150 minutes times the probability it survived the first 50. Wait, no, that's not the correct way.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the same as [1 - e^(-\u03bb * 200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nSo that's the probability of decay between 50 and 200. But since the problem states that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, the conditional probability would be [e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200)] divided by e^(-\u03bb *50), because the condition is that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nSo the conditional probability is [e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200)] / e^(-\u03bb *50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). Because e^(-\u03bb (200-50)) is e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nSo that simplifies to 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). So the conditional probability is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n\nSo regardless of the initial 50 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). But wait, no, because the initial condition is that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. So the conditional probability is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). Because the decay is memoryless.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this using the decay equation. Let me compute \u03bb first.\n\nGiven P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100). So e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural log: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68): Let's compute it numerically. ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005. So \u03bb \u2248 0.4005 / 100 \u2248 0.004005 per minute.\n\nNow, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nCompute \u03bb * 150: 0.004005 *150 \u2248 0.60075.\n\nSo e^(-0.60075) \u2248 approximately 0.547. So 1 - 0.547 is 0.453, or 45.3%.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, the closest is option D, which is 48%. Hmm, perhaps my approximation is a bit rough. Let me calculate more accurately.\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68) more precisely. Let me think, e^(-0.4) is about 0.6703, which is close to 0.68. Let me compute ln(0.68) more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator-like approach: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005.\n\nWait, let's compute e^(-0.4) = 1/(e^0.4) \u2248 1/1.4918 \u2248 0.6703. Since 0.6703 is less than 0.68, ln(0.68) is a bit higher than -0.4. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing Taylor series or perhaps a better approximation. Alternatively, perhaps using exact calculator functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use exact values. Let me compute \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/ (-100) \u2192 which is approximately (\u22120.4005)/100 \u2192 0.004005 per minute.\n\nThen, \u03bb *150 = 0.004005 *150 = 0.60075.\n\nCompute e^(-0.60075). Let me compute e^0.60075 first. e^0.6 is about 1.8221. Let's see: 0.60075 is 0.6 + 0.00075.\n\ne^0.6 = 1.82211880039 (approx).\n\ne^0.00075 \u2248 1 + 0.00075 + (0.00075)^2/2 \u2248 1.000750000625. So e^0.60075 \u2248 1.8221188 * 1.000750000625 \u2248 1.8221188 * 1.00075 \u2248 1.8221188 + (1.8221188 * 0.00075) \u2248 1.8221188 + 0.00136659 \u2248 1.823485.\n\nSo e^(-0.60075) = 1/1.823485 \u2248 0.5483.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5483 = 0.4517, which is approximately 45.2%.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D) 48% and option A) 44%. Hmm, 45.2% is closer to 44% (44.8% is option A, 44%) or 48% (which is 45.2% is closer to 45% than to 48%\u2014no, wait, 45.2% is 0.452, which is 45.2%\u2014so the options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the problem isn't using an exponential decay model. Because the given probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So perhaps it's using a simple proportion, like a linear relation between time and probability. But no, radioactive decay is exponential, so that's probably not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay is modeled as a probability of 32% per 100 minutes, and each 100 minutes is a half-life or something. Wait, no, the half-life is when the probability is 50%. So in this case, 32% is less than half, so the half-life would be longer than 100 minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps the decay constant can be calculated using the given 32% in 100 minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e^(-0.60075). Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, 0.60075 is the exponent.\n\nLet me compute e^(-0.60075):\n\nUsing a calculator, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488116. Then, for 0.60075, which is 0.6 + 0.00075, so the exponent is 0.6 + 0.00075.\n\nSo e^(-0.60075) = e^(-0.6) * e^(-0.00075).\n\ne^(-0.6) \u2248 0.5488116.\n\ne^(-0.00075) \u2248 1 - 0.00075 + (0.00075)^2/2 - (0.00075)^3/6. Let's compute:\n\n0.00075^2 = 5.625e-7, divided by 2 is 2.8125e-7.\n\n0.00075^3 = 4.21875e-10, divided by 6 is ~7.03e-11, which is negligible.\n\nSo e^(-0.00075) \u2248 1 - 0.00075 + 0.00000028125 \u2248 approximately 0.99925028125.\n\nSo e^(-0.60075) = 0.5488116 * 0.99925028 \u2248 0.5488116 * (1 - 0.000749718) \u2248 0.5488116 - (0.5488116 * 0.000749718).\n\nCalculating 0.5488116 * 0.000749718: approximately 0.5488 * 0.00075 \u2248 0.0004116.\n\nSo e^(-0.60075) \u2248 0.5488116 - 0.0004116 \u2248 0.5484.\n\nSo 1 - e^(-0.60075) \u2248 1 - 0.5484 = 0.4516, or 45.16%.\n\nHmm, so that's about 45.16%, which is approximately 45.2%. But none of the options exactly match this. The options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating \u03bb. Let me double-check the initial steps.\n\nGiven that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. So:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTaking ln on both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68) more accurately. Let's use a calculator. Let me think, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let me recall that ln(0.68) is the natural logarithm of 0.68.\n\nUsing a Taylor series around x=1: ln(x) \u2248 (x-1) - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - ... for x near 1.\n\nBut 0.68 is 0.32 away from 1, which is not that near. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005219.\n\nSo, \u03bb = 0.4005219 / 100 = 0.004005219 per minute.\n\nThen, for 150 minutes, \u03bbt = 0.004005219 * 150 = 0.60078285.\n\nSo e^(-0.60078285) is what?\n\nUsing a calculator, e^(-0.6) is approximately 0.5488116.\n\nBut more accurately, e^(-0.60078285) can be computed as follows.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute e^(-0.60078285) more accurately using a calculator function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the initial 100 minutes give 32% decay. So the decay constant \u03bb is 0.004005 per minute.\n\nSo for 150 minutes, the decay probability is 1 - e^(-0.004005 *150) = 1 - e^(-0.60075).\n\nAs before, e^(-0.60075) is approximately 0.5484, so 1 - 0.5484 is 0.4516, or 45.16%.\n\nBut the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not using exponential decay. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: the decay is a Poisson process, so the probability of decay in a certain time is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).\n\nSo, given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100).\n\nSo e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100.\n\nWait, but then, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So the probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*50). Then, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*50) * [1 - e^(-\u03bb*150)].\n\nWait, no. The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays within 200 minutes minus the probability that it decays within 50 minutes. So:\n\nP(50 < t < 200) = P(t < 200) - P(t <50) = [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nBut since we know that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the conditional probability is [e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / e^(-\u03bb*50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*(200-50)) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nSo that brings us back to the same result as before, 45.16%.\n\nBut none of the options are exactly 45.16%. The closest option is D) 48%, but that's 45.16% is about 45%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes from the current time (50 minutes have passed), making it 50 +150 = 200 minutes from the start. So the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.\n\nWait, let me compute \u03bb = ln(1/0.68)/100 = ln(1.4792899)/100 \u2248 0.385662 / 100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nWait, no, wait: ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.4792899) \u2248 0.385662. So \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I calculate \u03bb, it's (ln(1/0.68))/100, because e^(-\u03bb t) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb t = -ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/t.\n\nWait, let me correct that. So, since e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68 \u2192 -\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = (-ln(0.68))/100 \u2192 which is (ln(1/0.68))/100.\n\nSo ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.4792899) \u2248 0.385662. So \u03bb \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nThen, for 150 minutes, \u03bb*150 = 0.00385662 *150 = 0.578493.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) = approximately 0.5608.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392, or 43.92%.\n\nWait, that's about 44%, which matches option A) 44%.\n\nHmm, that's a different result than before. So where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of ln(0.68). Earlier, I thought ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005. But using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005219, which would make \u03bb = 0.4005219 / 100 \u2248 0.004005219 per minute.\n\nBut wait, that would make \u03bb = 0.004005219 per minute, and for 150 minutes, \u03bb*t = 0.004005219 * 150 = 0.60078285.\n\nSo e^(-0.60078285) is approximately 0.5484. So 1 - 0.5484 = 0.4516, which is about 45.16%.\n\nBut according to the corrected calculation, if \u03bb is 0.00385662, then for 150 minutes, it's 0.578493, and e^-0.578493 \u2248 0.5608 \u2192 43.92%, which is about 44%.\n\nSo which is correct? Let me double-check the calculation of \u03bb.\n\nThe correct approach is to compute \u03bb as (ln(1/0.68))/100.\n\nBecause:\n\ne^(-\u03bb * 100) = 0.68 \u2192 taking natural logs: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100 \u2192 which is (ln(1/0.68))/100.\n\nSo ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.4792899) \u2248 0.385662.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005, which would make \u03bb = 0.004005 per minute.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ln(0.68). Let me compute ln(0.68) accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.4005219.\n\nSo, \u03bb = (0.4005219) / 100 = 0.004005219 per minute.\n\nAh, wait, that's where I went wrong earlier. Because in the initial calculation, I used \u03bb = 0.004005 per minute, leading to 0.60075 as \u03bb*t for 150 minutes, which gave 45.16%.\n\nBut if I compute \u03bb correctly as 0.00385662 per minute, then \u03bb*t for 150 minutes is 0.00385662 * 150 = 0.578493.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) \u2248 0.5608 \u2192 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392, which is 43.92%, approximately 44%, matching option A.\n\nBut wait, why the discrepancy? Because I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation of \u03bb.\n\nWait, let's double-check:\n\nGiven 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural log: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = (- ln(0.68)) / 100.\n\nBut ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005219 \u2192 so \u03bb = (0.4005219) / 100 = 0.004005219 per minute.\n\nWait, that's correct. So earlier calculation was correct, and the later approach where \u03bb was 0.00385662 per minute was wrong.\n\nWait, no. Wait, I think I confused the steps. Because when I compute e^(-\u03bb * t) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68)) / t \u2192 which is ln(1.4792899) \u2248 0.385662 \u2192 \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the earlier calculation where \u03bb = 0.004005 per minute.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of ln(1/0.68).\n\nWait, let's compute 1/0.68 = 1.479289948 approximately.\n\nln(1.479289948) = ?\n\nLet me compute it accurately. Let's see:\n\ne^0.385 is approximately e^0.385.\n\nCompute e^0.385:\n\n0.385 = 0.3 + 0.085.\n\ne^0.3 \u2248 1.349858.\n\ne^0.085 \u2248 1.088395.\n\nSo e^0.385 \u2248 1.349858 * 1.088395 \u2248 1.473.\n\nWhich is close to 1.479289948.\n\nSo e^0.385 \u2248 1.473 \u2192 but 1.479289948 is higher. So ln(1.479289948) is a bit higher than 0.385.\n\nLet me compute ln(1.479289948) using a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator to find that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005219, which means that ln(1/0.68) is 0.4005219.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.4005219 / 100 = 0.004005219 per minute.\n\nSo I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought \u03bb is 0.00385662 per minute. That was incorrect. The correct value is \u03bb \u2248 0.0040052 per minute.\n\nThus, for 150 minutes, \u03bb*t = 0.0040052 *150 = 0.60078.\n\nSo e^(-0.60078) \u2248 0.5484.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5484 = 0.4516, or 45.16%.\n\nSo the probability is approximately 45.16%, which is not exactly one of the options. The options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%.\n\nHmm, perhaps the intended approach is to use a linear approximation or perhaps a different model, but I think the correct answer based on exponential decay is approximately 45.16%, which is not exactly an option.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial condition. The question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So the time remaining is 150 minutes. But perhaps the total time is 50 +150 =200 minutes, and the probability of decay in 200 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200). But since it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the conditional probability is [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)].\n\nWait, that's another approach. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute P = [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] / [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)].\n\nGiven \u03bb = 0.004005219 per minute.\n\nCompute \u03bb*50 = 0.20026095.\n\ne^(-0.20026095) \u2248 0.8181.\n\nSo 1 - 0.8181 = 0.1819.\n\n\u03bb*200 = 0.004005219 *200 = 0.8010438.\n\ne^(-0.8010438) \u2248 0.4493.\n\nSo 1 - 0.4493 = 0.5507.\n\nSo P = 0.5507 / 0.1819 \u2248 3.025.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because a probability can't be greater than 1.\n\nWait, no, that approach must be wrong. Because the conditional probability is [P(decayed by 200) - P(decayed by 50)] / P(not decayed by 50) \u2192 which is [ (1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)) - (1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)) ] / e^(-\u03bb*50) \u2192 which is [e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / e^(-\u03bb*50) \u2192 1 - e^(-\u03bb*(200-50)) \u2192 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) \u2192 which brings us back to the same result as before, 45.16%.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150), which is approximately 45.16%, which is not exactly any of the options. So perhaps the intended answer is 44% (option A), given the approximate calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps, and the correct approach leads to 48%.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the half-life formula. Let me think.\n\nThe half-life (T_1/2) is the time it takes for half the atoms to decay. The formula is T_1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nBut in this problem, the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So the half-life isn't directly applicable here, but perhaps we can relate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay probability is modeled as a linear function. So, if in 100 minutes, 32% decay, then in 150 minutes, perhaps 48% would have decayed. But that's not correct because exponential decay isn't linear.\n\nWait, but that would be option D)48%. So perhaps the problem expects that approach, assuming a linear relation between time and probability.\n\nBut that's incorrect because radioactive decay follows an exponential law, not a linear one.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the given 32% in 100 minutes, and the student is supposed to calculate the probability for 150 minutes as a multiple of that.\n\nSo, 32% in 100 minutes \u2192 perhaps 48% in 150 minutes (1.5 times 32%). But that's not correct either, because the decay probability doesn't scale linearly with time.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. The correct calculation based on exponential decay gives approximately 45.16%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the probability as a rate, like 32% per 100 minutes. So the probability per minute is 0.32/100 = 0.0032 per minute.\n\nThen, for 150 minutes, the probability would be 0.0032 *150 = 0.48, or 48%, which is option D.\n\nBut that approach is incorrect because it assumes a linear probability, which isn't the case for radioactive decay. However, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved this way, given that it's a multiple-choice question.\n\nSo, if I go with that approach, the answer would be 48%, option D.\n\nBut earlier, the correct approach using exponential decay gives around 45.16%, which is closer to 44% (option A) than to 48%.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects the use of the linear approximation, leading to option D)48%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)48%, but I'm not entirely sure. But based on the exponential decay model, it's approximately 45%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D)48%.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because my earlier calculation using the correct exponential model gave about 45.16%, which is closer to 44% (option A) than 48%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering the remaining time. Wait, no, because the decay is memoryless, so the remaining time is 150 minutes, and the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150), which is approximately 45%.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should recheck the calculation of \u03bb.\n\nGiven that P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100) \u2192 e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100.\n\nCompute ln(1/0.68) = ln(1.479289948) \u2248 0.385662.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nWait, earlier I thought \u03bb was 0.004005 per minute, but that was a mistake.\n\nWait, no, that's where the confusion arose. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, when I compute e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100 \u2192 ln(1/0.68) is approximately 0.385662 \u2192 \u03bb \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nThus, for 150 minutes, \u03bb*t = 0.00385662 * 150 \u2248 0.578493.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) \u2248 0.5608 \u2192 1 - 0.5608 \u2248 0.4392, which is 43.92%, approximately 44%, option A.\n\nAh, so this is where the confusion was. Earlier, I mistakenly used \u03bb as 0.004005 per minute, which gave a higher probability, but the correct \u03bb is 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nSo the correct calculation leads to approximately 44%, which is option A.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A) 44%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about radioactive decay. Let me think about what I know. The question is about the probability of an atom decaying after a certain time, given that it hasn't decayed already. Hmm, right, this sounds like it involves conditional probability and maybe the concept of half-life or something related to exponential decay.\n\nSo, the setup is that we have an atom with a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. But wait, 50 minutes have already passed and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, 150 minutes from now? Or in the next 150 minutes after the initial 100? Wait no, the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes, right? Because the first 50 minutes have already passed without decay.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that 50 minutes have passed since we started monitoring, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes, making the total 200 minutes since the start. But the given probability is for decay within 100 minutes. So I need to find the probability of decay between time t=50 to t=200 (150 minutes), given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.\n\nWait, but I think I should model this using the decay equation. The general formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant, and t is time.\n\nThe decay probability within a certain time is given by 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So the probability of decay in time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).\n\nWait, but in this case, the given probability is 32% (0.32) for 100 minutes. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100). So I can solve for \u03bb.\n\nLet me write that equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). Rearranging, e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. So taking natural log on both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68): ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but wait, 0.68 is 68% of 1. Let me calculate it more accurately. Wait, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005. So \u03bb is approximately 0.4005 / 100 = 0.004005 per minute.\n\nWait, but maybe I should use a calculator for more precise value. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed symbolically without exact numbers.\n\nSo, the question is, what's the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. Hmm, so the time elapsed since the start is 50 minutes, and we're looking at the next 150, making 200 minutes in total. So the probability we need is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200, given that it hasn't decayed up to t=50.\n\nWait, but in radioactive decay, the process is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next time period doesn't depend on how long it's been already. So the probability of decaying in the next T minutes is the same as it being T minutes from the start.\n\nWait, so the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is equal to the probability it decays in 150 minutes. Because the decay process is memoryless. So the probability would be 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the initial 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the survival probability after 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *50). Then, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. But since the process is memoryless, the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from any starting point, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nWait, but wait, another way to look at it: the probability that it hasn't decayed after 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb *50). Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 is the probability that it decays in 150 minutes times the probability it survived the first 50. Wait, no, that's not the correct way.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the same as [1 - e^(-\u03bb * 200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] = e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200).\n\nSo that's the probability of decay between 50 and 200. But since the problem states that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, the conditional probability would be [e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200)] divided by e^(-\u03bb *50), because the condition is that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nSo the conditional probability is [e^(-\u03bb *50) - e^(-\u03bb *200)] / e^(-\u03bb *50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). Because e^(-\u03bb (200-50)) is e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nSo that simplifies to 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). So the conditional probability is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes.\n\nSo regardless of the initial 50 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). But wait, no, because the initial condition is that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. So the conditional probability is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). Because the decay is memoryless.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this using the decay equation. Let me compute \u03bb first.\n\nGiven P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100). So e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural log: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68): Let's compute it numerically. ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005. So \u03bb \u2248 0.4005 / 100 \u2248 0.004005 per minute.\n\nNow, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150).\n\nCompute \u03bb * 150: 0.004005 *150 \u2248 0.60075.\n\nSo e^(-0.60075) \u2248 approximately 0.547. So 1 - 0.547 is 0.453, or 45.3%.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, the closest is option D, which is 48%. Hmm, perhaps my approximation is a bit rough. Let me calculate more accurately.\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68) more precisely. Let me think, e^(-0.4) is about 0.6703, which is close to 0.68. Let me compute ln(0.68) more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator-like approach: ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005.\n\nWait, let's compute e^(-0.4) = 1/(e^0.4) \u2248 1/1.4918 \u2248 0.6703. Since 0.6703 is less than 0.68, ln(0.68) is a bit higher than -0.4. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing Taylor series or perhaps a better approximation. Alternatively, perhaps using exact calculator functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use exact values. Let me compute \u03bb = (ln(0.68))/ (-100) \u2192 which is approximately (\u22120.4005)/100 \u2192 0.004005 per minute.\n\nThen, \u03bb *150 = 0.004005 *150 = 0.60075.\n\nCompute e^(-0.60075). Let me compute e^0.60075 first. e^0.6 is about 1.8221. Let's see: 0.60075 is 0.6 + 0.00075.\n\ne^0.6 = 1.82211880039 (approx).\n\ne^0.00075 \u2248 1 + 0.00075 + (0.00075)^2/2 \u2248 1.000750000625. So e^0.60075 \u2248 1.8221188 * 1.000750000625 \u2248 1.8221188 * 1.00075 \u2248 1.8221188 + (1.8221188 * 0.00075) \u2248 1.8221188 + 0.00136659 \u2248 1.823485.\n\nSo e^(-0.60075) = 1/1.823485 \u2248 0.5483.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5483 = 0.4517, which is approximately 45.2%.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option D) 48% and option A) 44%. Hmm, 45.2% is closer to 44% (44.8% is option A, 44%) or 48% (which is 45.2% is closer to 45% than to 48%\u2014no, wait, 45.2% is 0.452, which is 45.2%\u2014so the options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the problem isn't using an exponential decay model. Because the given probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So perhaps it's using a simple proportion, like a linear relation between time and probability. But no, radioactive decay is exponential, so that's probably not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay is modeled as a probability of 32% per 100 minutes, and each 100 minutes is a half-life or something. Wait, no, the half-life is when the probability is 50%. So in this case, 32% is less than half, so the half-life would be longer than 100 minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps the decay constant can be calculated using the given 32% in 100 minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e^(-0.60075). Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, 0.60075 is the exponent.\n\nLet me compute e^(-0.60075):\n\nUsing a calculator, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488116. Then, for 0.60075, which is 0.6 + 0.00075, so the exponent is 0.6 + 0.00075.\n\nSo e^(-0.60075) = e^(-0.6) * e^(-0.00075).\n\ne^(-0.6) \u2248 0.5488116.\n\ne^(-0.00075) \u2248 1 - 0.00075 + (0.00075)^2/2 - (0.00075)^3/6. Let's compute:\n\n0.00075^2 = 5.625e-7, divided by 2 is 2.8125e-7.\n\n0.00075^3 = 4.21875e-10, divided by 6 is ~7.03e-11, which is negligible.\n\nSo e^(-0.00075) \u2248 1 - 0.00075 + 0.00000028125 \u2248 approximately 0.99925028125.\n\nSo e^(-0.60075) = 0.5488116 * 0.99925028 \u2248 0.5488116 * (1 - 0.000749718) \u2248 0.5488116 - (0.5488116 * 0.000749718).\n\nCalculating 0.5488116 * 0.000749718: approximately 0.5488 * 0.00075 \u2248 0.0004116.\n\nSo e^(-0.60075) \u2248 0.5488116 - 0.0004116 \u2248 0.5484.\n\nSo 1 - e^(-0.60075) \u2248 1 - 0.5484 = 0.4516, or 45.16%.\n\nHmm, so that's about 45.16%, which is approximately 45.2%. But none of the options exactly match this. The options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating \u03bb. Let me double-check the initial steps.\n\nGiven that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. So:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTaking ln on both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68) more accurately. Let's use a calculator. Let me think, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let me recall that ln(0.68) is the natural logarithm of 0.68.\n\nUsing a Taylor series around x=1: ln(x) \u2248 (x-1) - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - ... for x near 1.\n\nBut 0.68 is 0.32 away from 1, which is not that near. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005219.\n\nSo, \u03bb = 0.4005219 / 100 = 0.004005219 per minute.\n\nThen, for 150 minutes, \u03bbt = 0.004005219 * 150 = 0.60078285.\n\nSo e^(-0.60078285) is what?\n\nUsing a calculator, e^(-0.6) is approximately 0.5488116.\n\nBut more accurately, e^(-0.60078285) can be computed as follows.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute e^(-0.60078285) more accurately using a calculator function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the initial 100 minutes give 32% decay. So the decay constant \u03bb is 0.004005 per minute.\n\nSo for 150 minutes, the decay probability is 1 - e^(-0.004005 *150) = 1 - e^(-0.60075).\n\nAs before, e^(-0.60075) is approximately 0.5484, so 1 - 0.5484 is 0.4516, or 45.16%.\n\nBut the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not using exponential decay. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: the decay is a Poisson process, so the probability of decay in a certain time is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt).\n\nSo, given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100).\n\nSo e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100.\n\nWait, but then, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So the probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*50). Then, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*50) * [1 - e^(-\u03bb*150)].\n\nWait, no. The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays within 200 minutes minus the probability that it decays within 50 minutes. So:\n\nP(50 < t < 200) = P(t < 200) - P(t <50) = [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)] = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200).\n\nBut since we know that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the conditional probability is [e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / e^(-\u03bb*50) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*(200-50)) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nSo that brings us back to the same result as before, 45.16%.\n\nBut none of the options are exactly 45.16%. The closest option is D) 48%, but that's 45.16% is about 45%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes from the current time (50 minutes have passed), making it 50 +150 = 200 minutes from the start. So the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.\n\nWait, let me compute \u03bb = ln(1/0.68)/100 = ln(1.4792899)/100 \u2248 0.385662 / 100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nWait, no, wait: ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.4792899) \u2248 0.385662. So \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I calculate \u03bb, it's (ln(1/0.68))/100, because e^(-\u03bb t) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb t = -ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/t.\n\nWait, let me correct that. So, since e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68 \u2192 -\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = (-ln(0.68))/100 \u2192 which is (ln(1/0.68))/100.\n\nSo ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.4792899) \u2248 0.385662. So \u03bb \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nThen, for 150 minutes, \u03bb*150 = 0.00385662 *150 = 0.578493.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) = approximately 0.5608.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392, or 43.92%.\n\nWait, that's about 44%, which matches option A) 44%.\n\nHmm, that's a different result than before. So where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of ln(0.68). Earlier, I thought ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005. But using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005219, which would make \u03bb = 0.4005219 / 100 \u2248 0.004005219 per minute.\n\nBut wait, that would make \u03bb = 0.004005219 per minute, and for 150 minutes, \u03bb*t = 0.004005219 * 150 = 0.60078285.\n\nSo e^(-0.60078285) is approximately 0.5484. So 1 - 0.5484 = 0.4516, which is about 45.16%.\n\nBut according to the corrected calculation, if \u03bb is 0.00385662, then for 150 minutes, it's 0.578493, and e^-0.578493 \u2248 0.5608 \u2192 43.92%, which is about 44%.\n\nSo which is correct? Let me double-check the calculation of \u03bb.\n\nThe correct approach is to compute \u03bb as (ln(1/0.68))/100.\n\nBecause:\n\ne^(-\u03bb * 100) = 0.68 \u2192 taking natural logs: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100 \u2192 which is (ln(1/0.68))/100.\n\nSo ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.4792899) \u2248 0.385662.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005, which would make \u03bb = 0.004005 per minute.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ln(0.68). Let me compute ln(0.68) accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.4005219.\n\nSo, \u03bb = (0.4005219) / 100 = 0.004005219 per minute.\n\nAh, wait, that's where I went wrong earlier. Because in the initial calculation, I used \u03bb = 0.004005 per minute, leading to 0.60075 as \u03bb*t for 150 minutes, which gave 45.16%.\n\nBut if I compute \u03bb correctly as 0.00385662 per minute, then \u03bb*t for 150 minutes is 0.00385662 * 150 = 0.578493.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) \u2248 0.5608 \u2192 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392, which is 43.92%, approximately 44%, matching option A.\n\nBut wait, why the discrepancy? Because I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation of \u03bb.\n\nWait, let's double-check:\n\nGiven 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68.\n\nTaking natural log: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = (- ln(0.68)) / 100.\n\nBut ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005219 \u2192 so \u03bb = (0.4005219) / 100 = 0.004005219 per minute.\n\nWait, that's correct. So earlier calculation was correct, and the later approach where \u03bb was 0.00385662 per minute was wrong.\n\nWait, no. Wait, I think I confused the steps. Because when I compute e^(-\u03bb * t) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68)) / t \u2192 which is ln(1.4792899) \u2248 0.385662 \u2192 \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 = 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the earlier calculation where \u03bb = 0.004005 per minute.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of ln(1/0.68).\n\nWait, let's compute 1/0.68 = 1.479289948 approximately.\n\nln(1.479289948) = ?\n\nLet me compute it accurately. Let's see:\n\ne^0.385 is approximately e^0.385.\n\nCompute e^0.385:\n\n0.385 = 0.3 + 0.085.\n\ne^0.3 \u2248 1.349858.\n\ne^0.085 \u2248 1.088395.\n\nSo e^0.385 \u2248 1.349858 * 1.088395 \u2248 1.473.\n\nWhich is close to 1.479289948.\n\nSo e^0.385 \u2248 1.473 \u2192 but 1.479289948 is higher. So ln(1.479289948) is a bit higher than 0.385.\n\nLet me compute ln(1.479289948) using a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator to find that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4005219, which means that ln(1/0.68) is 0.4005219.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.4005219 / 100 = 0.004005219 per minute.\n\nSo I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought \u03bb is 0.00385662 per minute. That was incorrect. The correct value is \u03bb \u2248 0.0040052 per minute.\n\nThus, for 150 minutes, \u03bb*t = 0.0040052 *150 = 0.60078.\n\nSo e^(-0.60078) \u2248 0.5484.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5484 = 0.4516, or 45.16%.\n\nSo the probability is approximately 45.16%, which is not exactly one of the options. The options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%.\n\nHmm, perhaps the intended approach is to use a linear approximation or perhaps a different model, but I think the correct answer based on exponential decay is approximately 45.16%, which is not exactly an option.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial condition. The question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So the time remaining is 150 minutes. But perhaps the total time is 50 +150 =200 minutes, and the probability of decay in 200 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200). But since it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the conditional probability is [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)].\n\nWait, that's another approach. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute P = [1 - e^(-\u03bb *200)] / [1 - e^(-\u03bb *50)].\n\nGiven \u03bb = 0.004005219 per minute.\n\nCompute \u03bb*50 = 0.20026095.\n\ne^(-0.20026095) \u2248 0.8181.\n\nSo 1 - 0.8181 = 0.1819.\n\n\u03bb*200 = 0.004005219 *200 = 0.8010438.\n\ne^(-0.8010438) \u2248 0.4493.\n\nSo 1 - 0.4493 = 0.5507.\n\nSo P = 0.5507 / 0.1819 \u2248 3.025.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because a probability can't be greater than 1.\n\nWait, no, that approach must be wrong. Because the conditional probability is [P(decayed by 200) - P(decayed by 50)] / P(not decayed by 50) \u2192 which is [ (1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)) - (1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)) ] / e^(-\u03bb*50) \u2192 which is [e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / e^(-\u03bb*50) \u2192 1 - e^(-\u03bb*(200-50)) \u2192 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) \u2192 which brings us back to the same result as before, 45.16%.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150), which is approximately 45.16%, which is not exactly any of the options. So perhaps the intended answer is 44% (option A), given the approximate calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps, and the correct approach leads to 48%.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the half-life formula. Let me think.\n\nThe half-life (T_1/2) is the time it takes for half the atoms to decay. The formula is T_1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nBut in this problem, the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So the half-life isn't directly applicable here, but perhaps we can relate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay probability is modeled as a linear function. So, if in 100 minutes, 32% decay, then in 150 minutes, perhaps 48% would have decayed. But that's not correct because exponential decay isn't linear.\n\nWait, but that would be option D)48%. So perhaps the problem expects that approach, assuming a linear relation between time and probability.\n\nBut that's incorrect because radioactive decay follows an exponential law, not a linear one.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the given 32% in 100 minutes, and the student is supposed to calculate the probability for 150 minutes as a multiple of that.\n\nSo, 32% in 100 minutes \u2192 perhaps 48% in 150 minutes (1.5 times 32%). But that's not correct either, because the decay probability doesn't scale linearly with time.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. The correct calculation based on exponential decay gives approximately 45.16%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the probability as a rate, like 32% per 100 minutes. So the probability per minute is 0.32/100 = 0.0032 per minute.\n\nThen, for 150 minutes, the probability would be 0.0032 *150 = 0.48, or 48%, which is option D.\n\nBut that approach is incorrect because it assumes a linear probability, which isn't the case for radioactive decay. However, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved this way, given that it's a multiple-choice question.\n\nSo, if I go with that approach, the answer would be 48%, option D.\n\nBut earlier, the correct approach using exponential decay gives around 45.16%, which is closer to 44% (option A) than to 48%.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects the use of the linear approximation, leading to option D)48%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)48%, but I'm not entirely sure. But based on the exponential decay model, it's approximately 45%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D)48%.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because my earlier calculation using the correct exponential model gave about 45.16%, which is closer to 44% (option A) than 48%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering the remaining time. Wait, no, because the decay is memoryless, so the remaining time is 150 minutes, and the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150), which is approximately 45%.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should recheck the calculation of \u03bb.\n\nGiven that P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100) \u2192 e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100.\n\nCompute ln(1/0.68) = ln(1.479289948) \u2248 0.385662.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.385662 / 100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nWait, earlier I thought \u03bb was 0.004005 per minute, but that was a mistake.\n\nWait, no, that's where the confusion arose. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, when I compute e^(-\u03bb *100) = 0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100 \u2192 ln(1/0.68) is approximately 0.385662 \u2192 \u03bb \u2248 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nThus, for 150 minutes, \u03bb*t = 0.00385662 * 150 \u2248 0.578493.\n\nSo e^(-0.578493) \u2248 0.5608 \u2192 1 - 0.5608 \u2248 0.4392, which is 43.92%, approximately 44%, option A.\n\nAh, so this is where the confusion was. Earlier, I mistakenly used \u03bb as 0.004005 per minute, which gave a higher probability, but the correct \u03bb is 0.00385662 per minute.\n\nSo the correct calculation leads to approximately 44%, which is option A.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A) 44%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process using the exponential decay model.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me think.\n\nThe question says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, we want to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.\n\nHmm, radioactive decay... I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed, right? It's memoryless. So the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes shouldn't affect the probability for the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The decay is memoryless, so the probability each moment depends only on the remaining time. But wait, the question is about the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. So the total time from now is 150 minutes. But wait, the initial 50 minutes have already passed. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the initial given decay probability is for 100 minutes. Hmm, perhaps I should model this using the decay constant.\n\nRight, the decay constant \u03bb is related to the half-life, but maybe I can approach it using the given probability. So the probability P(t) that a nucleus decays in time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). \n\nWait, but in the problem, it's given that the probability is 32% (0.32) within 100 minutes. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100). Let me solve for \u03bb.\n\nSo 1 - 0.32 = e^(-100\u03bb) => 0.68 = e^(-100\u03bb). Take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.68) = -100\u03bb. So \u03bb = - ln(0.68)/100.\n\nWait, ln(0.68) is negative, so the negatives will cancel. Let me compute ln(0.68). I know that ln(1)=0, ln(0.5)= -0.6931, and 0.68 is between 0.5 and 1. Let me approximate ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566 (I think that's right, because e^-0.385 is about 0.68). So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula without calculating \u03bb numerically. Let's see.\n\nThe question is about the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 have already passed. So the total time from the start is 200 minutes, but the decay hasn't happened in the first 50. So the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is what we're looking for.\n\nAlternatively, since decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval, regardless of past time. So maybe I can think of it as a fresh atom starting at t=50, and we're looking for the probability over the next 150 minutes.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because the decay process doesn't have memory. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom would decay in 150 minutes. So I can compute that using the same \u03bb as before.\n\nWait, but the given probability is for 100 minutes. So perhaps I should compute the decay probability for 150 minutes using the same \u03bb.\n\nSo let's restate the problem. The initial 50 minutes have passed without decay. Now, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150). We can calculate this using the \u03bb we found earlier.\n\nFrom the initial data, we have P(100) = 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *100) => e^(-100\u03bb)=0.68.\n\nSo for 150 minutes, P(150) = 1 - e^(-150\u03bb) = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb -50\u03bb) ) = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb) * e^(-50\u03bb).\n\nBut wait, e^(-100\u03bb) is 0.68, so P(150) = 1 - 0.68 * e^(-50\u03bb).\n\nHmm, but I don't know e^(-50\u03bb). Let me find another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can express e^(-50\u03bb) in terms of e^(-100\u03bb), which is 0.68.\n\nWait, because e^(-50\u03bb) is the square root of e^(-100\u03bb), since (e^(-50\u03bb))^2 = e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. So sqrt(0.68) is approximately 0.8246.\n\nSo e^(-50\u03bb) \u2248 0.8246.\n\nSo putting that into P(150) = 1 - 0.68 * 0.8246.\n\nCalculating 0.68 * 0.8246: 0.68 * 0.8 is 0.544, 0.68 * 0.0246 \u2248 0.0167, so total approx 0.5607.\n\nSo 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, which is about 43.93%. Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 44%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me do it more accurately.\n\nLet me calculate e^(-50\u03bb):\n\nWe know that e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. So e^(-50\u03bb) = sqrt(0.68) \u2248 sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.824621125.\n\nSo 0.68 * 0.824621125 = ?\n\nLet me compute 0.68 * 0.824621125.\n\nCompute 0.68 * 0.8 = 0.544.\n\n0.68 * 0.024621125 \u2248 0.68 * 0.0246 = let's compute 0.68 * 0.02 = 0.0136, 0.68 * 0.0046 = approximately 0.003128. So total is 0.0136 + 0.003128 \u2248 0.016728.\n\nSo adding to 0.544, 0.544 + 0.016728 \u2248 0.560728.\n\nSo 1 - 0.560728 = 0.439272, which is approximately 43.93%, so 44% when rounded. So the answer would be A) 44%.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps using the decay formula differently. Let me think.\n\nThe decay constant \u03bb can be found from the given data. So given that P(100) = 0.32.\n\nP(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb t) \u2192 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb) \u2192 e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = - ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nCalculating ln(0.68): ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566248.\n\nSo \u03bb = 0.38566248 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566248 per minute.\n\nNow, for t = 150 minutes, P(150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566248 *150).\n\nCalculating the exponent: 0.0038566248 *150 = 0.57849372.\n\nSo e^-0.57849372 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\nWe know that e^-0.5 \u2248 0.6065, e^-0.6 \u2248 0.5488. 0.578 is between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nLet me approximate:\n\nLet me compute e^-0.57849372.\n\nWe can use a Taylor series or calculator-like approach. Alternatively, knowing that ln(2) \u2248 0.6931, but that's for \u00bd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the value of 0.57849372.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use a calculator for e^-0.5785.\n\nWait, let me think: 0.5785 is about 0.58.\n\ne^-0.58 \u2248 ?\n\nWe know that e^-0.5 = 0.6065, e^-0.6 = 0.5488.\n\nAt 0.58, which is 80% of the way from 0.5 to 0.6.\n\nThe difference between 0.6 and 0.5 is 0.1, and 0.58 is 0.08 above 0.5.\n\nSo 0.08 / 0.1 = 0.8. So perhaps e^-0.58 is 0.6065 - 0.8*(0.6065-0.5488).\n\n0.6065-0.5488 = 0.0577.\n\n0.8 * 0.0577 = 0.04616.\n\nSo 0.6065 - 0.04616 = 0.5603.\n\nSo e^-0.58 \u2248 0.5603.\n\nSo P(150) = 1 - 0.5603 = 0.4397, which is approximately 43.97%, so about 44%. So the answer is A) 44%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation of e^-0.5785 can be done more accurately.\n\nWait, another approach: ln(0.56) is approximately -0.5798. So e^-0.5785 is approximately 0.56. Let me see:\n\nIf x = 0.5785, then e^-x \u2248 0.56?\n\nWait, because ln(0.56) \u2248 -0.5798, which is very close to x=0.5785. So e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.56.\n\nSo then, P(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%.\n\nSo that's consistent with our earlier calculation.\n\nSo the probability is approximately 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question is about the next 150 minutes. So the time elapsed since the beginning is 50 minutes, and we're looking at 150 minutes from now. So the total time since the start is 200 minutes.\n\nBut wait, the probability of decay in 200 minutes can't be more than 100% of course. But the question is about the next 150 minutes, so from t=50 to t=200. So that's 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting fresh. So the same calculation applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. So that would be the conditional probability.\n\nWait, but wait! Because the process is memoryless, the conditional probability is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting fresh. Because the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes doesn't affect the future.\n\nWait, but wait: the conditional probability P(decay in next 150 | not decayed in first 50) is equal to the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, which is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval. So yes, it's the same as P(150) which is 44%, so option A.\n\nSo the answer is option A) 44%.\n",

Let me see:\n\nIf x = 0.5785, then e^-x \u2248 0.56?\n\nWait, because ln(0.56) \u2248 -0.5798, which is very close to x=0.5785. So e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.56.\n\nSo then, P(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%.\n\nSo that's consistent with our earlier calculation.\n\nSo the probability is approximately 44%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question is about the next 150 minutes. So the time elapsed since the beginning is 50 minutes, and we're looking at 150 minutes from now. So the total time since the start is 200 minutes.\n\nBut wait, the probability of decay in 200 minutes can't be more than 100% of course. But the question is about the next 150 minutes, so from t=50 to t=200. So that's 150 minutes.\n\nWait, but since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting fresh. So the same calculation applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. So that would be the conditional probability.\n\nWait, but wait! Because the process is memoryless, the conditional probability is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting fresh. Because the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes doesn't affect the future.\n\nWait, but wait: the conditional probability P(decay in next 150 | not decayed in first 50) is equal to the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, which is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval. So yes, it's the same as P(150) which is 44%, so option A.\n\nSo the answer is option A) 44%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of a nucleus decaying in time \\( t \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant. The problem provides that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \\( P(100) = 0.32 \\). Using this, we can calculate \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[\n0.32 = 1 - e^{-100\\lambda} \\implies e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68 \\implies -100\\lambda = \\ln(0.68) \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{-\\ln(0.68)}{100}.\n\\]\n\nApproximating \\( \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.38566 \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.38566}{100} \\approx 0.0038566 \\, \\text{per minute}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the same decay constant:\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.0038566 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.0038566 \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.57849.\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\ne^{-0.57849} \\approx 0.56 \\quad \\text{(using approximations for \\( e^{-x} \\))}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.\n\\]\n\nThis means the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay does not affect this probability. The result aligns with the given options.\n\n**Answer: A**",
