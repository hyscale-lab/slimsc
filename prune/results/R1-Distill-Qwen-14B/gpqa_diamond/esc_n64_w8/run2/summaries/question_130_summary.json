      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshifts. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. And the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A to D, with some numbers.\n\nWait, I'm a bit rusty on my cosmology, but let me think. So, Lyman alpha absorption is when neutral hydrogen in intergalactic space absorbs certain wavelengths of light from distant objects like quasars. The Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, right? Its rest wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers or 121.6 nanometers. That's in the far UV.\n\nBut optical telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere absorbs it. So ground-based optical telescopes can't observe light in the UV. So for the absorption to be in the optical range, the quasar's light must have been redshifted so that the Lyman alpha line moves into the visible spectrum.\n\nSo the redshift z is the factor by which the wavelength is stretched. The observed wavelength \u03bb_obs = (1 + z) * \u03bb_rest. We want \u03bb_obs to be in the optical range, which is roughly 400-700 nm, or 0.4 to 0.7 micrometers, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.\n\nSo the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms when emitted. To shift it into the optical, say the lower end, 4000 Angstroms. So:\n\n\u03bb_obs = (1 + z) * 1216 = 4000\n\nSolve for z:\n\n(1 + z) = 4000 / 1216 \u2248 3.289\n\nSo z \u2248 2.289. So the redshift has to be at least about 2.29 for the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is about detecting the absorption. So if the quasar's light is at a higher redshift, the Lyman alpha would be in the optical. But the quasar itself emits a lot of UV, which would be redshifted as well. So if the quasar's emission is at a higher redshift, then the quasar's visible light would be even more redshifted, but that's probably not the issue here.\n\nThe key point is that the Lyman alpha absorption must be in the optical for ground-based telescopes to see it. So the minimum redshift is when Lyman alpha is at the lower end of the optical range.\n\nWait, but wait again. The Lyman alpha is a transition in hydrogen. So when a quasar's light passes through neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs at the quasar's rest frame wavelength. But because the quasar is moving away (due to redshift), the observed wavelength is longer.\n\nSo if the quasar has a redshift z, then the Lyman alpha absorption line would be at (1 + z)*1216 Angstroms.\n\nSo for the absorption line to be in the optical, (1 + z)*1216 must be less than about 7000 Angstroms (since beyond that is near-infrared, which ground-based optical telescopes can't easily detect either? Or wait, can they? Well, some optical telescopes have near-infrared capabilities, but the question specifies \"optical\", so I think up to about 700 nm or 7000 Angstroms is the upper limit.\n\nWait, but the quasar's own emission would be shifted. If the quasar is at a high redshift, its visible light would be redshifted into the infrared, making it difficult to see. So for the quasar to be detected, its emission lines must be in the optical. But wait, the question is about detecting the absorption caused by the hydrogen clouds, not the quasar itself.\n\nSo perhaps the quasar itself doesn't need to be visible, but the absorption line must be in the optical. Wait, but the quasar's light must reach us through the hydrogen cloud, so the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the cloud is in front of the quasar, and the quasar's light is from beyond the cloud. So the quasar's emission is at a higher redshift than the cloud, but the question is about the cloud's redshift.\n\nWait, the question says \"these objects\" which are the clouds. So the clouds are at a certain redshift, and the quasars are behind them. So the quasars must be at higher redshifts than the clouds.\n\nBut the question is about the clouds being detected. So the absorption line from the cloud must be in the optical. So the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1+z) is in the optical range.\n\nSo to find the minimal z such that 1216*(1+z) is in the optical, which is up to around 7000 Angstroms.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's think about it: if the observed wavelength is 7000 Angstroms (700 nm), then (1+z) = 7000/1216 \u2248 5.756. So z\u22484.756. So that would be when the absorption line is at the near-infrared edge, but perhaps the question is considering the lower end of optical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can observe is about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). So if the absorption is at 7000 Angstroms, the redshift is 7000/1216 -1 \u2248 4.756.\n\nBut the question is about the lower limit. So the minimal z is when the absorption is at the lower end of the optical range, say 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). So (1+z) =4000/1216 \u22483.289, so z\u22482.289.\n\nLooking at the options: options are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9. So 2.289 is closest to option C (2.4) or D (1.9). Wait, but 2.289 is about 2.3, which is between 2.4 and 1.9. Wait, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.3, so maybe the minimal z is 2.3. So the lower limit would be around 2.3, so the minimal z is just above 2.3. So the minimal redshift is when the Lyman alpha is at the lower end of the optical, so z is about 2.3.\n\nBut wait, maybe the question is considering that the quasar's emission is in the optical. Because if the quasar's light is too redshifted, it might not be visible in the optical. So the quasar must be at a redshift where its emission lines are still in the optical.\n\nWait, but the question is about the clouds, not the quasars. So perhaps the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So for the cloud to have its Lyman alpha in the optical, z_cloud is about 2.3, and the quasar could be at a higher z. But the question is about the lower limit for the cloud's redshift, so that their absorption can be detected.\n\nSo the minimal z is when the Lyman alpha is at the lower end of optical, which is around 4000 Angstroms, which gives z\u22482.289. So the minimal z is just over 2.3.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option C (2.4) and option D (1.9). Hmm, 2.4 is a bit higher than 2.3. So maybe the answer is 2.4, but wait, perhaps I should check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's own emission in the optical is possible only up to a certain redshift. For example, if the quasar's Lyman series emission is redshifted into the optical, but I think that's a different consideration. Maybe not. Because the question is about the clouds, not the quasars.\n\nAnother approach: the Lyman alpha forest is a series of absorption lines seen in the spectra of quasars. These lines are in the UV part of the quasar's spectrum, but when the quasar is at a high redshift, the Lyman alpha lines from intervening hydrogen clouds are redshifted into the optical range, making them observable.\n\nSo the redshift z of the cloud must satisfy (1 + z) * 1216 \u00c5 = \u03bb_obs (optical range).\n\nThe optical range is about 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So the minimal z is when \u03bb_obs is 4000 \u00c5:\n\nz = (4000 / 1216) -1 \u2248 3.289 -1 = 2.289. So z \u22482.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option C (2.4) and option D (1.9). Since 2.29 is closer to 2.4 than to 1.9, but wait, 2.29 is just under 2.3. So perhaps the options are approximate.\n\nWait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nSo 2.29 is between C and D. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z is 2.29, meaning anything above that would work. So the lower limit is z>2.29.\n\nSo the options are, the minimal redshift is around 2.3, so the lower limit would be z>2.3. So the possible options are C (2.4) as the next higher value.\n\nWait, but the question says \"estimate the lower limit on the redshift\". So perhaps the minimal z is when the Lyman alpha is just entering the optical. So the minimal z is when (1 + z) = 4000/1216 \u22483.289 \u2192 z\u22482.29. So the lower limit is just above 2.29. So any z above that is acceptable.\n\nSo the minimal redshift is about 2.29. Now, looking at the options, the closest is option C (2.4) and option D (1.9). Since 2.4 is higher than 2.29, but 1.9 is lower, which would not satisfy the condition. So the lower limit would be z=2.29, so any z above that would be acceptable. So the minimal possible z is 2.29, but the question is asking for the lower limit, which would be the minimal value needed for detection.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 2.3. So the available options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So the minimal z is 2.29. So the lowest option that is above 2.29 is option C (2.4). So the lower limit would be 2.29, so the object must have a redshift higher than that. So the minimal redshift is 2.29, so the lower limit is z=2.29, so any z above that would be detected.\n\nBut the options don't have 2.29, so the next higher option is 2.4. So the correct answer would be option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's emission must still be in the optical, so that we can see the quasar. Because if the quasar is too redshifted, it's not visible in optical, so we can't detect the absorption lines either.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the quasar's emission lines must be in the optical. So the quasar's redshift must be such that its emission lines (like Lyman alpha) are in the optical. So for the quasar, its Lyman alpha is at 1216 \u00c5, so to be in the optical, (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 \u22647000 \u00c5.\n\nSo z_quasar \u2264 (7000/1216) -1 \u22485.756. So z_quasar up to about 5.756.\n\nBut the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift z_cloud < z_quasar. So for the cloud's Lyman alpha to be in the optical, (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 \u22647000 \u2192 z_cloud \u22645.756. But the cloud's redshift must be less than the quasar's. So the maximum possible z_cloud is just under z_quasar, but the question is about the lower limit on z_cloud.\n\nWait, no, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud. So the minimal z_cloud such that the Lyman alpha absorption is in the optical. So regardless of the quasar's redshift, as long as the cloud is at that minimal z, the absorption line will be in the optical.\n\nWait, but the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. So if the cloud is at z_cloud, the quasar is at z_quasar > z_cloud. So the quasar's Lyman alpha is at (1 + z_quasar)*1216, which must be in the optical. So (1 + z_quasar)*1216 \u22647000 \u2192 z_quasar \u22645.756.\n\nBut the cloud's z_cloud could be as low as 0. However, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud such that the absorption can be detected with optical telescopes. Wait, no, the lower limit would be the minimum z where the absorption is in optical. But wait, if the cloud is at a lower z, the absorption would be in UV, which optical telescopes can't see. So the minimal z_cloud is when (1 + z_cloud)*1216 is at the lower end of the optical, which is about 4000 Angstroms.\n\nSo z_cloud \u2248 (4000/1216) -1 \u22482.289. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the minimal z_cloud is 2.29, which is about 2.3. So the answer would be option C (2.4) as the closest option.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the cloud is at z=2.29, then the Lyman alpha is at 4000 Angstroms, which is in the optical. So that's the minimal z for the cloud. So the correct answer is approximately 2.3, which is not an option, but option C is 2.4, which is the next higher number. So the answer would be option C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 \u00c5) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the observed wavelength of the absorption line falls within the optical range (approximately 4000\u20137000 \u00c5). \n\nThe relationship between the observed wavelength \\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} \\), the rest wavelength \\( \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\), and the redshift \\( z \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = (1 + z) \\cdot \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}\n\\]\n\nFor the Lyman alpha line to be detectable in the optical range, we consider the lower end of the optical spectrum, \\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = 4000 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\). Substituting \\( \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} = 1216 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\), we solve for \\( z \\):\n\n\\[\n(1 + z) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}} = \\frac{4000}{1216} \\approx 3.289\n\\]\n\n\\[\nz \\approx 3.289 - 1 = 2.289\n\\]\n\nThus, the lower limit for the redshift of the cloud is approximately \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\). Among the given options, the closest value is \\( z = 2.4 \\), which corresponds to option C.\n\nIt is important to note that this calculation assumes the absorption line is at the lower end of the optical range. If the absorption line were at a higher wavelength (e.g., closer to 7000 \u00c5), the required redshift would be higher. However, the question specifically asks for the lower limit, so \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\) is the critical value.\n\nThe other options can be ruled out as follows:\n- **Option A (3):** This is higher than the calculated \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\), so it is not the lower limit.\n- **Option B (1.2):** This is significantly lower than \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\), meaning the absorption line would still be in the ultraviolet and undetectable by optical telescopes.\n- **Option D (1.9):** This is also lower than \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\), so the absorption line would still not enter the optical range.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C (2.4)**, as it is the closest to the calculated lower limit of \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\).\n\nAnswer: C",

The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z is 2.29, meaning anything above that would work. So the lower limit is z>2.29.\n\nSo the options are, the minimal redshift is around 2.3, so the lower limit would be z>2.3. So the possible options are C (2.4) as the next higher value.\n\nWait, but the question says \"estimate the lower limit on the redshift\". So perhaps the minimal z is when the Lyman alpha is just entering the optical. So the minimal z is when (1 + z) = 4000/1216 \u22483.289 \u2192 z\u22482.29. So the lower limit is just above 2.29. So any z above that is acceptable.\n\nSo the minimal redshift is about 2.29. Now, looking at the options, the closest is option C (2.4) and option D (1.9). Since 2.4 is higher than 2.29, but 1.9 is lower, which would not satisfy the condition. So the lower limit would be z=2.29, so any z above that would be acceptable. So the minimal possible z is 2.29, but the question is asking for the lower limit, which would be the minimal value needed for detection.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 2.3. So the available options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So the minimal z is 2.29. So the lowest option that is above 2.29 is option C (2.4). So the lower limit would be 2.29, so the object must have a redshift higher than that. So the minimal redshift is 2.29, so the lower limit is z=2.29, so any z above that would be detected.\n\nBut the options don't have 2.29, so the next higher option is 2.4. So the correct answer would be option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's emission must still be in the optical, so that we can see the quasar. Because if the quasar is too redshifted, it's not visible in optical, so we can't detect the absorption lines either.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the quasar's emission lines must be in the optical. So the quasar's redshift must be such that its emission lines (like Lyman alpha) are in the optical. So for the quasar, its Lyman alpha is at 1216 \u00c5, so to be in the optical, (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 \u22647000 \u00c5.\n\nSo z_quasar \u2264 (7000/1216) -1 \u22485.756. So z_quasar up to about 5.756.\n\nBut the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift z_cloud < z_quasar. So for the cloud's Lyman alpha to be in the optical, (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 \u22647000 \u2192 z_cloud \u22645.756. But the cloud's redshift must be less than the quasar's. So the maximum possible z_cloud is just under z_quasar, but the question is about the lower limit on z_cloud.\n\nWait, no, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud. So the minimal z_cloud such that the Lyman alpha absorption is in the optical. So regardless of the quasar's redshift, as long as the cloud is at that minimal z, the absorption line will be in the optical.\n\nWait, but the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. So if the cloud is at z_cloud, the quasar is at z_quasar > z_cloud. So the quasar's Lyman alpha is at (1 + z_quasar)*1216, which must be in the optical. So (1 + z_quasar)*1216 \u22647000 \u2192 z_quasar \u22645.756.\n\nBut the cloud's z_cloud could be as low as 0. However, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud such that the absorption can be detected with optical telescopes. Wait, no, the lower limit would be the minimum z where the absorption is in optical. But wait, if the cloud is at a lower z, the absorption would be in UV, which optical telescopes can't see. So the minimal z_cloud is when (1 + z_cloud)*1216 is at the lower end of the optical, which is about 4000 Angstroms.\n\nSo z_cloud \u2248 (4000/1216) -1 \u22482.289. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the minimal z_cloud is 2.29, which is about 2.3. So the answer would be option C (2.4) as the closest option.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the cloud is at z=2.29, then the Lyman alpha is at 4000 Angstroms, which is in the optical. So that's the minimal z for the cloud. So the correct answer is approximately 2.3, which is not an option, but option C is 2.4, which is the next higher number. So the answer would be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 \u00c5) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the observed wavelength of the absorption line falls within the optical range (approximately 4000\u20137000 \u00c5). \n\nThe relationship between the observed wavelength \\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} \\), the rest wavelength \\( \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\), and the redshift \\( z \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = (1 + z) \\cdot \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}\n\\]\n\nFor the Lyman alpha line to be detectable in the optical range, we consider the lower end of the optical spectrum, \\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = 4000 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\). Substituting \\( \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} = 1216 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\), we solve for \\( z \\):\n\n\\[\n(1 + z) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}} = \\frac{4000}{1216} \\approx 3.289\n\\]\n\n\\[\nz \\approx 3.289 - 1 = 2.289\n\\]\n\nThus, the lower limit for the redshift of the cloud is approximately \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\). Among the given options, the closest value is \\( z = 2.4 \\), which corresponds to option C.\n\nIt is important to note that this calculation assumes the absorption line is at the lower end of the optical range. If the absorption line were at a higher wavelength (e.g., closer to 7000 \u00c5), the required redshift would be higher. However, the question specifically asks for the lower limit, so \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\) is the critical value.\n\nThe other options can be ruled out as follows:\n- **Option A (3):** This is higher than the calculated \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\), so it is not the lower limit.\n- **Option B (1.2):** This is significantly lower than \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\), meaning the absorption line would still be in the ultraviolet and undetectable by optical telescopes.\n- **Option D (1.9):** This is also lower than \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\), so the absorption line would still not enter the optical range.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C (2.4)**, as it is the closest to the calculated lower limit of \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\).\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about the redshift of objects observed through neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.\n\nThe question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. And we need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nWait, Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 \u00c5, which is in the ultraviolet. But when we observe it, if there's a redshift, the wavelength stretches. So the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1+z), right?\n\nBut wait, the quasar is the background object, and the hydrogen clouds are in front of it. So the quasar's light passes through the hydrogen, which absorbs at the rest wavelength, 1216 \u00c5. So in the quasar's frame, the hydrogen would absorb at that wavelength. But because the hydrogen cloud is at a certain redshift, the absorption would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the observer's frame.\n\nWait, but the quasar's light is from a background source, so the quasar itself has a higher redshift than the cloud. Or wait, no, the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Because the quasar is further away. So the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's.\n\nSo the absorption occurs at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) \u00c5. But the quasar's light is being observed at longer wavelengths due to its own redshift. So the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption line would be 1216*(1 + z_quasar) = 1216*(1 + z_cloud') where z_cloud' is the cloud's redshift. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the quasar's light is emitted at 1216 \u00c5, but due to the quasar's own redshift, that emission line would be observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). However, if there's a hydrogen cloud in front, it might absorb that light at its own rest frame wavelength, which would be observed at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So for the absorption to happen, the wavelength of the quasar's Lyman alpha emission, after being redshifted, must match the absorption wavelength of the cloud.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the relationship between the observed wavelength and redshift. The observed wavelength \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * (1 + z).\n\nIn this case, the quasar emits at Lyman alpha (1216 \u00c5), but because the quasar is at high redshift, the emitted wavelength is stretched. However, the hydrogen cloud in the intervening space absorbs at its own rest frame wavelength, which is 1216 \u00c5. So the cloud's absorption would be at \u03bb_cloud = 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But the quasar's emission line is at \u03bb_quasar = 1216*(1 + z_quasar). \n\nWait, but for the cloud to absorb the quasar's Lyman alpha emission, the quasar's emitted wavelength (in the quasar's frame) must be 1216 \u00c5. So the quasar's emission is at 1216 \u00c5. But in the observer's frame, it's redshifted to 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But the cloud, which is at a lower redshift, would have its own Lyman alpha at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So the cloud's Lyman alpha would be a lower wavelength than the quasar's. Hmm, but that would mean that in the observed spectrum, the absorption line would be at a longer wavelength than the quasar's emission line. That can't be right because the cloud is in front of the quasar. Wait, maybe I'm getting it backward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cloud's rest frame 1216 \u00c5 is what we observe as the absorption line. So if the cloud is at redshift z, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z). But the quasar's emission line is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). So for the cloud to absorb the quasar's emission, the quasar's emission must have been at a wavelength that, when redshifted by the cloud's z, becomes 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So the quasar's emitted wavelength is 1216 \u00c5, but due to its own redshift, it's observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But the cloud's absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So for the cloud to absorb that emission line, the quasar's emitted 1216 \u00c5 must be redshifted to 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the cloud's frame. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the rest frames. The quasar emits at 1216 \u00c5 (rest frame). The cloud, which is at a lower redshift, is in front. The cloud's rest frame would see the quasar's light as being redshifted by the quasar's z. So the quasar's Lyman alpha (1216 \u00c5 in quasar's frame) would be observed by the cloud at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). If that wavelength is within the Lyman series (i.e., longer than 1216 \u00c5), then the hydrogen in the cloud would absorb it.\n\nWait, but the Lyman alpha transition for hydrogen is 1216 \u00c5 in the rest frame. So the cloud can only absorb light at 1216 \u00c5 in its own rest frame. So the quasar's Lyman alpha emission, when it reaches the cloud, is redshifted. So the cloud's frame sees the quasar's Lyman alpha emission at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). For the cloud to absorb this, 1216*(1 + z_quasar) must equal 1216 \u00c5. Wait, that can't be right because (1 + z_quasar) is greater than 1. So 1216*(1 + z_quasar) would be longer than 1216 \u00c5, which is beyond the Lyman series. So the cloud can't absorb it because the wavelength is too long. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm thinking this wrong. The quasar emits light that passes through the hydrogen cloud. The cloud absorbs at 1216 \u00c5 in its own rest frame. So from the quasar's frame, the cloud is moving away (since it's at a lower redshift), so the cloud's rest frame is at a lower redshift. So the quasar's emission is at 1216 \u00c5, but the cloud's absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's frame. So for the cloud to absorb the quasar's Lyman alpha, the quasar's emission must be at a wavelength that, when observed in the cloud's frame, is 1216 \u00c5.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the quasar's emitted wavelength as seen by the cloud. The quasar's emitted wavelength is 1216 \u00c5. The cloud is at redshift z_cloud, so the quasar's emission is observed in the cloud's frame as \u03bb_cloud = \u03bb_quasar_emit * (1 + z_cloud_quasar). Wait, no. The quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, so the cloud is at a lower redshift. So the quasar's emitted light is observed by the cloud at \u03bb_cloud = 1216 * (1 + z_cloud_quasar). But the cloud's rest frame can only absorb at 1216 \u00c5. So for the cloud to absorb the quasar's Lyman alpha, 1216*(1 + z_cloud_quasar) must equal 1216 \u00c5. That would imply z_cloud_quasar is zero, which can't be right. So I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the observed wavelength of the absorption is what determines the redshift. So the absorption is observed in the quasar's spectrum at a wavelength longer than 1216 \u00c5. So the quasar's spectrum, when observed from Earth, would have an absorption line at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But the quasar's own emission line is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). So the absorption line would be at a wavelength longer than the quasar's emission line if z_cloud > z_quasar. But that's impossible because the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift must be less than the quasar's.\n\nWait, perhaps the quasar's emission line is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) and the absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So for the absorption to occur, the emission line must be at a wavelength that, when observed by the cloud, is 1216 \u00c5. So the cloud sees the quasar's emission line at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud) ) = 1216 \u00c5. So 1216*(1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud) ) = 1216 => (1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud) ) = 1 => 1 + z_quasar = 1 + z_cloud => z_quasar = z_cloud. Which can't be right because the cloud is in front. So I'm getting stuck here.\n\nMaybe another approach. Let's think about what wavelength the absorption line is observed at. The cloud is at redshift z, so the absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z). But the quasar's own emission line is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). For the absorption to occur, the quasar's emission line must be at a wavelength that, when observed in the cloud's frame, is 1216 \u00c5. So the quasar's emission line (1216 \u00c5 in its own frame) is observed by the cloud at 1216*(1 + z_quasar_cloud), where z_quasar_cloud is the redshift from the cloud to the quasar. Since the quasar is further away, z_quasar_cloud is positive. So 1216*(1 + z_quasar_cloud) = 1216 \u00c5. That implies z_quasar_cloud = 0, which is impossible. So perhaps the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption line is observed in the quasar's spectrum.\n\nWait, perhaps the cloud's absorption is observed in the quasar's spectrum. So the quasar's spectrum, when we look at it, has an absorption line at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But the quasar itself is at a higher redshift, so its own Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). For the absorption to occur, the absorption line must be at a wavelength longer than the emission line. So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) > 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But that would imply z_cloud > z_quasar, which can't be because the cloud is in front.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this all wrong. Let's think about what we observe. We see the quasar's light, which has passed through the hydrogen cloud. The cloud absorbs the quasar's light at 1216 \u00c5 in the cloud's frame. So in the observer's frame, that's 1216*(1 + z_cloud) \u00c5. But the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission, when observed, is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) \u00c5. So for the absorption to happen, the quasar's Lyman alpha emission must be at a wavelength that, when observed by the cloud, is 1216 \u00c5. So the quasar's emission is at 1216 \u00c5 (its rest frame), and the cloud, at a lower redshift, sees that as 1216*(1 + (z_quasar - z_cloud)) ) = 1216 \u00c5. So 1 + (z_quasar - z_cloud) ) = 1. So z_quasar = z_cloud. Which can't be right because the quasar is behind the cloud, so its z is higher.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach it differently. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that the absorption can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.\n\nWait, optical telescopes observe wavelengths from about 400 nm to around 700 nm, but in Angstroms, that's 4000 to 7000 \u00c5. So the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption must be in this range.\n\nThe Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1 + z) \u00c5. So 1216*(1 + z) >= 4000 \u00c5. Because if it's shorter than that, it's in the UV, which ground-based optical telescopes can't see (as Earth's atmosphere blocks UV). So let's compute the minimum z.\n\n1216*(1 + z) >= 4000\n\nSo (1 + z) >= 4000/1216 \u2248 3.29\n\nSo z >= 3.29 -1 = 2.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher option is C) 2.4. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 4000/1216.\n\n4000 divided by 1216: Let's compute 1216 *3 = 3648, 1216*3.29 = let's see.\n\n1216 * 3 = 3648\n1216 * 0.29 = approx 352.64\nTotal 3648 +352.64 = 3999.64, which is close to 4000. So z is about 2.29.\n\nSo the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2.29. So any z above that would have the absorption line in the optical range. So the lower limit is z \u22482.29. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nSo 2.29 is between C (2.4) and D (1.9). Wait, 2.29 is higher than D (1.9) and lower than C (2.4). So the lower limit would be when z is just enough to make the wavelength 4000 \u00c5. So the minimum z is about 2.29. So any z >=2.29 would be detected. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 2.4 which is above 2.29. So the lower limit is just above 2.29, so the minimum redshift would be when z is just above 2.29. So the answer would be the smallest z option that is above 2.29. The options are A)3, which is higher than 2.29, C)2.4 which is higher. So the lower limit is about 2.29, so the minimum possible z is 2.29. So the answer would be the option that's the smallest z that is just above 2.29. But the options don't have 2.3; the closest is C) 2.4. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to approximate.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. 1216 * (1 + z) >= 4000.\n\nSo 1 + z >= 4000/1216 = approximately 3.292.\n\nSo z >= 2.292.\n\nSo the minimum z is about 2.29. So the lower limit is z ~2.29. So any z >=2.29 would have the absorption line in optical. So the lower limit is around 2.29. Among the options, the smallest z that is higher than 2.29 is C)2.4. But wait, option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29, so it wouldn't be enough.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about this again. Because the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1 + z) \u00c5. For the absorption line to be in the optical range, we require 1216*(1 + z) >= 4000 \u00c5.\n\nSo the minimal z is when 1216*(1 + z) = 4000. So z = (4000/1216) -1 \u22483.292 -1=2.292.\n\nSo any z >=2.292 would be detectable. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the question is asking for the lower limit, meaning the minimal z such that it's detectable. So the answer is approximately 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher value is C)2.4. So the lower limit is just above 2.29. So the minimal redshift is about 2.29, so the answer would be the option that's the smallest possible, which is just above 2.29. But the options don't have 2.3; the closest higher is C)2.4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimal z such that the absorption line is in the optical. So the minimal z is when the absorption is at 4000 \u00c5. So the minimal z is approximately 2.29. So any z >=2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So among the options, the smallest option that's higher than 2.29 is C)2.4. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 \u00c5. When observed, if the redshifted wavelength is 1216*(1+z), and for ground-based optical telescopes, the wavelength has to be in the visible range, say above 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). So yes, z must be >= (4000/1216) -1 \u22482.29.\n\nSo the minimal redshift is about 2.29, so any z above that would be detected. The question is asking for the lower limit, which is the minimal z needed. So the answer is approximately 2.29, and the options don't have that, so the closest higher option is C)2.4.\n\nWait, but another possibility: sometimes, ground-based telescopes can observe into the near-UV, maybe up to about 360 nm (3600 \u00c5). So perhaps the threshold isn't 4000 \u00c5 but 3600 \u00c5. Let me check.\n\nIf the observed wavelength is 3600 \u00c5, then:\n\nz +1 = 3600 / 1216 \u2248 2.96\n\nSo z \u22481.96. So the lower limit would be about 1.96, which is close to option D)1.9. But I'm not sure if optical telescopes can observe down to 3600 \u00c5. Because the atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 3000 \u00c5 (UV), but some sites at high altitudes can go a bit lower, like 3200 \u00c5. So maybe the threshold is lower, like 3200 \u00c5.\n\nLet me compute for 3200 \u00c5.\n\n(1 + z) = 3200 / 1216 \u22482.633.\n\nz \u22481.633.\n\nSo the lower limit would be around 1.63. But none of the options are exactly that. Option D is 1.9, which is higher than 1.63. So if the threshold is 3200 \u00c5, then z >=1.63 would work, so the minimal z is about 1.63. So the options would need to have something above that. The options are B)1.2, D)1.9.\n\nWait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z where the absorption is just detectable. So if the threshold is 3200 \u00c5, then the minimal z is 1.63, so any z above that is okay. So the lower limit is z >=1.63. So the answer would be the smallest z that is just above 1.63. But looking at the options, the available options are 1.2 (B), 1.9 (D), 2.4 (C), and 3 (A).\n\nSo 1.63 is between B and D. The minimal z would be 1.63, so the lower limit is 1.63. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question expects the first approach, assuming the optical range starts at 4000 \u00c5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that the Lyman alpha absorption must be in the optical range. So the observed wavelength must be longer than 4000 \u00c5 (400 nm). So 1216*(1+z) >=4000.\n\nSo z >= (4000/1216)-1 \u22482.29.\n\nSo the minimal z is ~2.29. So among the options, the smallest z that's higher is C)2.4.\n\nWait, but the options have D)1.9 which is lower than 2.29. So that would not satisfy the condition, meaning that the absorption would be in the UV, not visible. So the answer would have to be the minimal z that brings the absorption into the optical, which is approximately 2.29. So the answer is C)2.4.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate 4000/1216.\n\n4000 divided by 1216:\n\n1216 *3=3648.\n\n4000-3648=352.\n\n352/1216=0.289 approx.\n\nSo 3.289.\n\nSo 1+z=3.289 \u2192 z\u22482.289.\n\nSo the minimal z is about 2.29. So the answer is the minimal z that is just above that. The options are C)2.4 and A)3, which are both higher. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. So the correct option is C)2.4, as it's the smallest option above 2.29.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's emission line is at 1216 \u00c5, but the absorption is at 1216*(1+z_cloud). For this absorption to be in the optical, 1216*(1+z_cloud) >=4000.\n\nSo z_cloud >= (4000/1216)-1 \u22482.29.\n\nSo the minimal z_cloud is ~2.29. So the answer is the smallest option higher than that, which is C)2.4.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about the redshift of objects observed through neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.\n\nThe question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. And we need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nWait, Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 \u00c5, which is in the ultraviolet. But when we observe it, if there's a redshift, the wavelength stretches. So the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1+z), right?\n\nBut wait, the quasar is the background object, and the hydrogen clouds are in front of it. So the quasar's light passes through the hydrogen, which absorbs at the rest wavelength, 1216 \u00c5. So in the quasar's frame, the hydrogen would absorb at that wavelength. But because the hydrogen cloud is at a certain redshift, the absorption would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the observer's frame.\n\nWait, but the quasar's light is from a background source, so the quasar itself has a higher redshift than the cloud. Or wait, no, the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Because the quasar is further away. So the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's.\n\nSo the absorption occurs at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) \u00c5. But the quasar's light is being observed at longer wavelengths due to its own redshift. So the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption line would be 1216*(1 + z_quasar) = 1216*(1 + z_cloud') where z_cloud' is the cloud's redshift. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the quasar's light is emitted at 1216 \u00c5, but due to the quasar's own redshift, that emission line would be observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). However, if there's a hydrogen cloud in front, it might absorb that light at its own rest frame wavelength, which would be observed at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So for the absorption to happen, the wavelength of the quasar's Lyman alpha emission, after being redshifted, must match the absorption wavelength of the cloud.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the relationship between the observed wavelength and redshift. The observed wavelength \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * (1 + z).\n\nIn this case, the quasar emits at Lyman alpha (1216 \u00c5), but because the quasar is at high redshift, the emitted wavelength is stretched. However, the hydrogen cloud in the intervening space absorbs at its own rest frame wavelength, which is 1216 \u00c5. So the cloud's absorption would be at \u03bb_cloud = 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But the quasar's emission line is at \u03bb_quasar = 1216*(1 + z_quasar). \n\nWait, but for the cloud to absorb the quasar's Lyman alpha emission, the quasar's emitted wavelength (in the quasar's frame) must be 1216 \u00c5. So the quasar's emission is at 1216 \u00c5. But in the observer's frame, it's redshifted to 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But the cloud, which is at a lower redshift, would have its own Lyman alpha at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So the cloud's Lyman alpha would be a lower wavelength than the quasar's. Hmm, but that would mean that in the observed spectrum, the absorption line would be at a longer wavelength than the quasar's emission line. That can't be right because the cloud is in front of the quasar. Wait, maybe I'm getting it backward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cloud's rest frame 1216 \u00c5 is what we observe as the absorption line. So if the cloud is at redshift z, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z). But the quasar's emission line is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). So for the cloud to absorb the quasar's emission, the quasar's emission must have been at a wavelength that, when redshifted by the cloud's z, becomes 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So the quasar's emitted wavelength is 1216 \u00c5, but due to its own redshift, it's observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But the cloud's absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So for the cloud to absorb that emission line, the quasar's emitted 1216 \u00c5 must be redshifted to 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the cloud's frame. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the rest frames. The quasar emits at 1216 \u00c5 (rest frame). The cloud, which is at a lower redshift, is in front. The cloud's rest frame would see the quasar's light as being redshifted by the quasar's z. So the quasar's Lyman alpha (1216 \u00c5 in quasar's frame) would be observed by the cloud at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). If that wavelength is within the Lyman series (i.e., longer than 1216 \u00c5), then the hydrogen in the cloud would absorb it.\n\nWait, but the Lyman alpha transition for hydrogen is 1216 \u00c5 in the rest frame. So the cloud can only absorb light at 1216 \u00c5 in its own rest frame. So the quasar's Lyman alpha emission, when it reaches the cloud, is redshifted. So the cloud's frame sees the quasar's Lyman alpha emission at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). For the cloud to absorb this, 1216*(1 + z_quasar) must equal 1216 \u00c5. Wait, that can't be right because (1 + z_quasar) is greater than 1. So 1216*(1 + z_quasar) would be longer than 1216 \u00c5, which is beyond the Lyman series. So the cloud can't absorb it because the wavelength is too long. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm thinking this wrong. The quasar emits light that passes through the hydrogen cloud. The cloud absorbs at 1216 \u00c5 in its own rest frame. So from the quasar's frame, the cloud is moving away (since it's at a lower redshift), so the cloud's rest frame is at a lower redshift. So the quasar's emission is at 1216 \u00c5, but the cloud's absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's frame. So for the cloud to absorb the quasar's Lyman alpha, the quasar's emission must be at a wavelength that, when observed in the cloud's frame, is 1216 \u00c5.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the quasar's emitted wavelength as seen by the cloud. The quasar's emitted wavelength is 1216 \u00c5. The cloud is at redshift z_cloud, so the quasar's emission is observed in the cloud's frame as \u03bb_cloud = \u03bb_quasar_emit * (1 + z_cloud_quasar). Wait, no. The quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, so the cloud is at a lower redshift. So the quasar's emitted light is observed by the cloud at \u03bb_cloud = 1216 * (1 + z_cloud_quasar). But the cloud's rest frame can only absorb at 1216 \u00c5. So for the cloud to absorb the quasar's Lyman alpha, 1216*(1 + z_cloud_quasar) must equal 1216 \u00c5. That would imply z_cloud_quasar is zero, which can't be right. So I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the observed wavelength of the absorption is what determines the redshift. So the absorption is observed in the quasar's spectrum at a wavelength longer than 1216 \u00c5. So the quasar's spectrum, when observed from Earth, would have an absorption line at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But the quasar's own emission line is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). So the absorption line would be at a wavelength longer than the quasar's emission line if z_cloud > z_quasar. But that's impossible because the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift must be less than the quasar's.\n\nWait, perhaps the quasar's emission line is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) and the absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So for the absorption to occur, the emission line must be at a wavelength that, when observed by the cloud, is 1216 \u00c5. So the cloud sees the quasar's emission line at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud) ) = 1216 \u00c5. So 1216*(1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud) ) = 1216 => (1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud) ) = 1 => 1 + z_quasar = 1 + z_cloud => z_quasar = z_cloud. Which can't be right because the cloud is in front. So I'm getting stuck here.\n\nMaybe another approach. Let's think about what wavelength the absorption line is observed at. The cloud is at redshift z, so the absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z). But the quasar's own emission line is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). For the absorption to occur, the quasar's emission line must be at a wavelength that, when observed in the cloud's frame, is 1216 \u00c5. So the quasar's emission line (1216 \u00c5 in its own frame) is observed by the cloud at 1216*(1 + z_quasar_cloud), where z_quasar_cloud is the redshift from the cloud to the quasar. Since the quasar is further away, z_quasar_cloud is positive. So 1216*(1 + z_quasar_cloud) = 1216 \u00c5. That implies z_quasar_cloud = 0, which is impossible. So perhaps the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption line is observed in the quasar's spectrum.\n\nWait, perhaps the cloud's absorption is observed in the quasar's spectrum. So the quasar's spectrum, when we look at it, has an absorption line at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But the quasar itself is at a higher redshift, so its own Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). For the absorption to occur, the absorption line must be at a wavelength longer than the emission line. So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) > 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But that would imply z_cloud > z_quasar, which can't be because the cloud is in front.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this all wrong. Let's think about what we observe. We see the quasar's light, which has passed through the hydrogen cloud. The cloud absorbs the quasar's light at 1216 \u00c5 in the cloud's frame. So in the observer's frame, that's 1216*(1 + z_cloud) \u00c5. But the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission, when observed, is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar) \u00c5. So for the absorption to happen, the quasar's Lyman alpha emission must be at a wavelength that, when observed by the cloud, is 1216 \u00c5. So the quasar's emission is at 1216 \u00c5 (its rest frame), and the cloud, at a lower redshift, sees that as 1216*(1 + (z_quasar - z_cloud)) ) = 1216 \u00c5. So 1 + (z_quasar - z_cloud) ) = 1. So z_quasar = z_cloud. Which can't be right because the quasar is behind the cloud, so its z is higher.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach it differently. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that the absorption can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.\n\nWait, optical telescopes observe wavelengths from about 400 nm to around 700 nm, but in Angstroms, that's 4000 to 7000 \u00c5. So the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption must be in this range.\n\nThe Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1 + z) \u00c5. So 1216*(1 + z) >= 4000 \u00c5. Because if it's shorter than that, it's in the UV, which ground-based optical telescopes can't see (as Earth's atmosphere blocks UV). So let's compute the minimum z.\n\n1216*(1 + z) >= 4000\n\nSo (1 + z) >= 4000/1216 \u2248 3.29\n\nSo z >= 3.29 -1 = 2.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher option is C) 2.4. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 4000/1216.\n\n4000 divided by 1216: Let's compute 1216 *3 = 3648, 1216*3.29 = let's see.\n\n1216 * 3 = 3648\n1216 * 0.29 = approx 352.64\nTotal 3648 +352.64 = 3999.64, which is close to 4000. So z is about 2.29.\n\nSo the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2.29. So any z above that would have the absorption line in the optical range. So the lower limit is z \u22482.29. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nSo 2.29 is between C (2.4) and D (1.9). Wait, 2.29 is higher than D (1.9) and lower than C (2.4). So the lower limit would be when z is just enough to make the wavelength 4000 \u00c5. So the minimum z is about 2.29. So any z >=2.29 would be detected. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 2.4 which is above 2.29. So the lower limit is just above 2.29, so the minimum redshift would be when z is just above 2.29. So the answer would be the smallest z option that is above 2.29. The options are A)3, which is higher than 2.29, C)2.4 which is higher. So the lower limit is about 2.29, so the minimum possible z is 2.29. So the answer would be the option that's the smallest z that is just above 2.29. But the options don't have 2.3; the closest is C) 2.4. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to approximate.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. 1216 * (1 + z) >= 4000.\n\nSo 1 + z >= 4000/1216 = approximately 3.292.\n\nSo z >= 2.292.\n\nSo the minimum z is about 2.29. So the lower limit is z ~2.29. So any z >=2.29 would have the absorption line in optical. So the lower limit is around 2.29. Among the options, the smallest z that is higher than 2.29 is C)2.4. But wait, option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29, so it wouldn't be enough.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about this again. Because the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1 + z) \u00c5. For the absorption line to be in the optical range, we require 1216*(1 + z) >= 4000 \u00c5.\n\nSo the minimal z is when 1216*(1 + z) = 4000. So z = (4000/1216) -1 \u22483.292 -1=2.292.\n\nSo any z >=2.292 would be detectable. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the question is asking for the lower limit, meaning the minimal z such that it's detectable. So the answer is approximately 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher value is C)2.4. So the lower limit is just above 2.29. So the minimal redshift is about 2.29, so the answer would be the option that's the smallest possible, which is just above 2.29. But the options don't have 2.3; the closest higher is C)2.4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimal z such that the absorption line is in the optical. So the minimal z is when the absorption is at 4000 \u00c5. So the minimal z is approximately 2.29. So any z >=2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So among the options, the smallest option that's higher than 2.29 is C)2.4. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 \u00c5. When observed, if the redshifted wavelength is 1216*(1+z), and for ground-based optical telescopes, the wavelength has to be in the visible range, say above 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). So yes, z must be >= (4000/1216) -1 \u22482.29.\n\nSo the minimal redshift is about 2.29, so any z above that would be detected. The question is asking for the lower limit, which is the minimal z needed. So the answer is approximately 2.29, and the options don't have that, so the closest higher option is C)2.4.\n\nWait, but another possibility: sometimes, ground-based telescopes can observe into the near-UV, maybe up to about 360 nm (3600 \u00c5). So perhaps the threshold isn't 4000 \u00c5 but 3600 \u00c5. Let me check.\n\nIf the observed wavelength is 3600 \u00c5, then:\n\nz +1 = 3600 / 1216 \u2248 2.96\n\nSo z \u22481.96. So the lower limit would be about 1.96, which is close to option D)1.9. But I'm not sure if optical telescopes can observe down to 3600 \u00c5. Because the atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 3000 \u00c5 (UV), but some sites at high altitudes can go a bit lower, like 3200 \u00c5. So maybe the threshold is lower, like 3200 \u00c5.\n\nLet me compute for 3200 \u00c5.\n\n(1 + z) = 3200 / 1216 \u22482.633.\n\nz \u22481.633.\n\nSo the lower limit would be around 1.63. But none of the options are exactly that. Option D is 1.9, which is higher than 1.63. So if the threshold is 3200 \u00c5, then z >=1.63 would work, so the minimal z is about 1.63. So the options would need to have something above that. The options are B)1.2, D)1.9.\n\nWait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z where the absorption is just detectable. So if the threshold is 3200 \u00c5, then the minimal z is 1.63, so any z above that is okay. So the lower limit is z >=1.63. So the answer would be the smallest z that is just above 1.63. But looking at the options, the available options are 1.2 (B), 1.9 (D), 2.4 (C), and 3 (A).\n\nSo 1.63 is between B and D. The minimal z would be 1.63, so the lower limit is 1.63. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question expects the first approach, assuming the optical range starts at 4000 \u00c5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that the Lyman alpha absorption must be in the optical range. So the observed wavelength must be longer than 4000 \u00c5 (400 nm). So 1216*(1+z) >=4000.\n\nSo z >= (4000/1216)-1 \u22482.29.\n\nSo the minimal z is ~2.29. So among the options, the smallest z that's higher is C)2.4.\n\nWait, but the options have D)1.9 which is lower than 2.29. So that would not satisfy the condition, meaning that the absorption would be in the UV, not visible. So the answer would have to be the minimal z that brings the absorption into the optical, which is approximately 2.29. So the answer is C)2.4.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate 4000/1216.\n\n4000 divided by 1216:\n\n1216 *3=3648.\n\n4000-3648=352.\n\n352/1216=0.289 approx.\n\nSo 3.289.\n\nSo 1+z=3.289 \u2192 z\u22482.289.\n\nSo the minimal z is about 2.29. So the answer is the minimal z that is just above that. The options are C)2.4 and A)3, which are both higher. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. So the correct option is C)2.4, as it's the smallest option above 2.29.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's emission line is at 1216 \u00c5, but the absorption is at 1216*(1+z_cloud). For this absorption to be in the optical, 1216*(1+z_cloud) >=4000.\n\nSo z_cloud >= (4000/1216)-1 \u22482.29.\n\nSo the minimal z_cloud is ~2.29. So the answer is the smallest option higher than that, which is C)2.4.\n\n\nTo determine the lower limit on the redshift of objects such that the Lyman alpha absorption line (rest wavelength ~1216 \u00c5) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the observed wavelength of the absorption line falls within the optical range. Optical ground-based telescopes typically observe wavelengths from approximately 4000 \u00c5 (400 nm) to 7000 \u00c5 (700 nm). Therefore, the absorption line must satisfy:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = 1216 \\times (1 + z) \\geq 4000 \\, \\text{\u00c5}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Solve for the minimum redshift\nRearranging the inequality:\n\n\\[\n1 + z \\geq \\frac{4000}{1216}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4000}{1216} \\approx 3.292 \\implies z \\geq 3.292 - 1 = 2.292.\n\\]\n\nThus, the minimum redshift required for the Lyman alpha absorption line to be detected in the optical range is approximately \\( z \\geq 2.29 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Compare with the options\nThe options provided are:\n- **A) 3**\n- **B) 1.2**\n- **C) 2.4**\n- **D) 1.9**\n\nFrom the calculation, the minimum redshift is \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\). Among the options, the smallest value greater than 2.29 is **C) 2.4**. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2.29, and the correct answer is the smallest option above this value.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Lyman alpha absorption line must be redshifted to fall within the optical range of ground-based telescopes. The minimum redshift required is approximately \\( z \\geq 2.29 \\), and the smallest option above this value is **C) 2.4**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about Lyman alpha absorption and redshift. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, and sometimes their light is absorbed by clouds of neutral hydrogen. The Lyman alpha wavelength is around 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, ground-based telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere absorbs that light. So how does this absorption line get detected?\n\nOh right, when the hydrogen is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe, the wavelength gets stretched\u2014redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be longer than 1216 Angstroms. But wait, if the quasar's light is absorbed by the hydrogen cloud, the absorption line is at the rest wavelength of the hydrogen. No, wait, no\u2014the absorption line is at the rest wavelength of the hydrogen, but if the cloud is moving away, the absorption line we see is shifted.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The quasar emits light, including the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms. If a hydrogen cloud is in front of the quasar, it absorbs that specific wavelength. But if the cloud is moving away, the absorption line we observe is at a longer wavelength (redshifted). So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.\n\nBut ground-based telescopes can't observe ultraviolet light, so the observed wavelength must be in the optical range, right? Optical wavelengths are roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So the Lyman alpha line, which is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame, must be redshifted into the optical.\n\nSo let's set up the equation. The rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. The observed wavelength lambda_obs must be greater than 4000 Angstroms (since that's the start of optical). So 1216*(1+z) >= 4000.\n\nSolving for z: 1+z >= 4000/1216 \u2248 3.29. So z >= approximately 2.29. So the redshift has to be at least about 2.29 for the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical range.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 2.4 and option D is 1.9. So 2.4 is the lower limit. Wait, but wait a second. The question says \"lower limit on the redshift\" such that they can be detected. So the minimum z where the Lyman alpha is just entering the optical range. So the lower limit would be when lambda_obs is exactly 4000 Angstroms.\n\nWait, but maybe the lower limit is when the Lyman alpha line is just within the observable range. So if the ground-based telescope can't observe below 4000 Angstroms (like 400 nm), then the redshift must be enough to shift 1216 to 4000.\n\nSo let me compute that. 1216*(1+z) = 4000. So 1+z = 4000/1216 \u2248 3.29. So z\u22482.29. So the redshift must be at least about 2.29. So the lower limit would be just above 2.29.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So the lower limit is around 2.29, so the answer would be option C, 2.4, as it's the first option above 2.29.\n\nWait, but another thought: does the absorption line have to be in the visible spectrum for the telescope to detect it? Because if the Lyman alpha line is redshifted beyond the optical, say into infrared, which ground-based telescopes can observe in some cases, but perhaps the question assumes only optical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quasar's light is so bright that the absorption line can be detected even in the near-UV.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about Lyman alpha absorption and redshift. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, and sometimes their light is absorbed by clouds of neutral hydrogen. The Lyman alpha wavelength is around 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, ground-based telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere absorbs that light. So how does this absorption line get detected?\n\nOh right, when the hydrogen is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe, the wavelength gets stretched\u2014redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be longer than 1216 Angstroms. But wait, if the quasar's light is absorbed by the hydrogen cloud, the absorption line is at the rest wavelength of the hydrogen. No, wait, no\u2014the absorption line is at the rest wavelength of the hydrogen, but if the cloud is moving away, the absorption line we see is shifted.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The quasar emits light, including the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms. If a hydrogen cloud is in front of the quasar, it absorbs that specific wavelength. But if the cloud is moving away, the absorption line we observe is at a longer wavelength (redshifted). So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.\n\nBut ground-based telescopes can't observe ultraviolet light, so the observed wavelength must be in the optical range, right? Optical wavelengths are roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So the Lyman alpha line, which is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame, must be redshifted into the optical.\n\nSo let's set up the equation. The rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. The observed wavelength lambda_obs must be greater than 4000 Angstroms (since that's the start of optical). So 1216*(1+z) >= 4000.\n\nSolving for z: 1+z >= 4000/1216 \u2248 3.29. So z >= approximately 2.29. So the redshift has to be at least about 2.29 for the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical range.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 2.4 and option D is 1.9. So 2.4 is the lower limit. Wait, but wait a second. The question says \"lower limit on the redshift\" such that they can be detected. So the minimum z where the Lyman alpha is just entering the optical range. So the lower limit would be when lambda_obs is exactly 4000 Angstroms.\n\nWait, but maybe the lower limit is when the Lyman alpha line is just within the observable range. So if the ground-based telescope can't observe below 4000 Angstroms (like 400 nm), then the redshift must be enough to shift 1216 to 4000.\n\nSo let me compute that. 1216*(1+z) = 4000. So 1+z = 4000/1216 \u2248 3.29. So z\u22482.29. So the redshift must be at least about 2.29. So the lower limit would be just above 2.29.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So the lower limit is around 2.29, so the answer would be option C, 2.4, as it's the first option above 2.29.\n\nWait, but another thought: does the absorption line have to be in the visible spectrum for the telescope to detect it? Because if the Lyman alpha line is redshifted beyond the optical, say into infrared, which ground-based telescopes can observe in some cases, but perhaps the question assumes only optical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quasar's light is so bright that the absorption line can be detected even in the near-UV. But no, ground-based can't observe UV, so the line must be in optical. So yeah, the redshift needs to be at least about 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, so the closest option is C) 2.4.\n\n\nTo determine the lower limit on the redshift of objects such that Lyman alpha absorption lines can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the situation as follows:\n\nThe Lyman alpha wavelength at rest is approximately 1216 Angstroms, which lies in the ultraviolet range. Ground-based telescopes cannot observe ultraviolet light due to atmospheric absorption, so the redshifted Lyman alpha line must fall within the optical range (approximately 4000\u20137000 Angstroms). The observed wavelength is related to the redshift \\( z \\) by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\cdot (1 + z)\n\\]\n\nTo ensure the Lyman alpha line is detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must satisfy:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} \\geq 4000 \\, \\text{Angstroms}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha line (\\( \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} = 1216 \\, \\text{Angstroms} \\)):\n\n\\[\n1216 \\cdot (1 + z) \\geq 4000\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( z \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + z \\geq \\frac{4000}{1216} \\approx 3.29\n\\]\n\n\\[\nz \\geq 3.29 - 1 \\approx 2.29\n\\]\n\nThus, the redshift must be at least approximately \\( z = 2.29 \\) for the Lyman alpha line to be detectable in the optical range.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is asking.\n\nThe question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space. These clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.\n\nHmm, I remember that redshift is a measure of how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The higher the redshift, the farther away the object is. So the question is about finding the smallest redshift (the lower limit) where these hydrogen clouds can be detected using optical telescopes on the ground.\n\nWait, but why does redshift matter here? Oh right, because when the hydrogen in the cloud absorbs light, it does so at a specific wavelength, the Lyman alpha line. But if the cloud is moving away from us (due to the expansion of the universe), the wavelength we observe will be longer than 1216 Angstroms. If it's moving towards us, it would be shorter, but I think in this context we're considering the expansion, so it's redshifted.\n\nBut the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. So the quasar emits the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms, but if the cloud is at a certain redshift z, the observed wavelength would be lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z). So if the cloud is at redshift z, the absorption line we see would be shifted.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The quasar itself might have its own redshift, right? Because quasars are very distant. But in this question, the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift would be lower than the quasar's. Because the cloud is closer to us than the quasar.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the cloud is in deep space, so if it's between us and the quasar, then the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's.\n\nBut the question is about the redshift of the cloud. So, when the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the hydrogen in the cloud absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength as observed in the rest frame of the cloud. But in our frame, the absorption would be at a longer wavelength (since the cloud is moving away, so the absorption is at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms).\n\nBut optical telescopes operate in the visible spectrum. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line must be within the visible range for us to detect it with optical telescopes. If the wavelength is shifted into the infrared or something beyond optical, then we can't see it with optical telescopes.\n\nSo, the Lyman alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. For us to observe this absorption line in the optical range, the wavelength must be redshifted into the optical. Because if the wavelength is longer than what optical telescopes can detect, we won't see it.\n\nWait, but what's the cutoff? Optical wavelengths are roughly 400-700 nm (4000 to 7000 Angstroms). So if the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is within 4000 to 7000 Angstroms, then it's in the optical range.\n\nSo let's set up the equation. The rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. Observed wavelength lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z). We need lambda_obs to be less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms because beyond that, it's infrared, which optical telescopes can't see (or can they? Wait, no, optical is visible, so if it's beyond 7000 Angstroms, it's infrared. So for optical detection, lambda_obs must be <= 7000 Angstroms.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact cutoff. Let me think. The optical range is about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) to 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). So if the observed wavelength is longer than 7000 Angstroms, it's infrared, which is beyond the optical range. So the maximum redshift that allows the absorption line to still be in the optical is when lambda_obs = 7000 Angstroms.\n\nSo solving for z: 7000 = 1216 * (1 + z)\n1 + z = 7000 / 1216 \u2248 let's calculate that.\n\n7000 / 1216: 1216 * 5 is 6080. 7000 - 6080 = 920. 920/1216 \u2248 0.756. So 5.756. So 1 + z = 5.756 \u2192 z \u2248 4.756.\n\nWait, that's a redshift of about 4.75. But looking at the options, the highest option is A) 3, which is lower than 4.75. Hmm, but that can't be right because that would imply that the absorption line would be observed beyond 7000 Angstroms, which is infrared.\n\nWait, perhaps I have this backwards. Because the quasar's light is absorbed by the cloud, but the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. So the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the cloud's redshift is less than the quasar's.\n\nWait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud. So the minimum z for which the Lyman alpha absorption is still in the optical.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Because if the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar, the absorption line is in the quasar's spectrum. So the quasar's own redshift is higher than the cloud's. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line is 1216*(1 + z_cloud).\n\nBut the quasar's own light is at a higher redshift. So the quasar's emission line would be at a longer wavelength than the absorption line.\n\nWait, but in any case, the absorption line from the cloud needs to be observed in the optical, so within 400-700 nm.\n\nSo, solving for z_cloud: 1216*(1+z_cloud) <= 7000 Angstroms.\n\nAs I did before, 7000 / 1216 \u2248 5.756 \u2192 z_cloud \u2248 4.756. But none of the options go that high. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the quasar's emission line is in the optical, and the absorption line is at a shorter wavelength.\n\nWait, no, the quasar emits the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms in its own frame. But if the quasar is at a redshift z_quasar, then the quasar's Lyman alpha line would be observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But the cloud is in front of the quasar, so it's at a lower redshift, z_cloud < z_quasar.\n\nSo the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. But if this is observed in the optical, then it must be less than 7000 Angstroms.\n\nSo 1216*(1 + z_cloud) <= 7000 \u2192 (1 + z_cloud) <= 7000/1216 \u22485.756 \u2192 z_cloud <=4.756.\n\nBut that's the maximum z for the cloud. The question is about the lower limit. So wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The question is to find the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud so that it can be detected. So the minimum z where the cloud's absorption is still in the optical.\n\nWait, but if the cloud is at a very low redshift, then 1216*(1 + z_cloud) would be just a bit above 1216 Angstroms, which is in the far UV. But ground-based optical telescopes can't see UV because Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So for the absorption line to be in the optical (visible), the cloud's redshift must be such that the observed wavelength is in 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Angstroms). So the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >=4000 Angstroms (so that it's in the optical, not UV). Wait, no, because 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be between 4000 and 7000.\n\nWait, but 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. So without any redshift, the absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms, which is UV. So ground-based optical telescopes can't see that because the atmosphere blocks UV. So the cloud must be at a redshift where the absorption line is redshifted into the optical range (4000-7000 Angstroms) so that it can be observed.\n\nSo the minimum z is when the absorption line is just at 4000 Angstroms (the start of the optical range).\n\nSo let's set 1216*(1 + z_cloud) =4000 \u2192 1 + z_cloud =4000/1216 \u22483.29 \u2192 z_cloud\u22482.29.\n\nSo approximately 2.3. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is close. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.3. So if the cloud's z is 1.9, then the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1 +1.9) =1216*2.9= 3526.4 Angstroms, which is 352.6 nm, which is still UV. So ground-based optical telescopes can't see that. So the cloud must have a redshift higher than approximately 2.29 for the absorption to be in the optical range.\n\nSo the lower limit would be z_cloud \u22482.29, so the smallest possible z is just over 2.29. The options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. So the correct answer would be C)2.4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because 2.29 is approximately 2.3, so the next higher option is 2.4. So that would be the lower limit, meaning that any cloud with z >=2.4 would have the absorption line in the optical.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should consider that the optical range is up to 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). So the maximum z is when 1216*(1 + z) =7000 \u2192 z=5.756 as before. So the cloud's redshift must be between 2.29 and 5.756 for the absorption line to be in the optical.\n\nSo the question is to find the lower limit, which is approximately 2.29. So the options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. So 2.4 is the closest higher value, so it's the lower limit. So the answer is C)2.4.\n",

So for the absorption line to be in the optical (visible), the cloud's redshift must be such that the observed wavelength is in 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Angstroms). So the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >=4000 Angstroms (so that it's in the optical, not UV). Wait, no, because 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be between 4000 and 7000.\n\nWait, but 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. So without any redshift, the absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms, which is UV. So ground-based optical telescopes can't see that because the atmosphere blocks UV. So the cloud must be at a redshift where the absorption line is redshifted into the optical range (4000-7000 Angstroms) so that it can be observed.\n\nSo the minimum z is when the absorption line is just at 4000 Angstroms (the start of the optical range).\n\nSo let's set 1216*(1 + z_cloud) =4000 \u2192 1 + z_cloud =4000/1216 \u22483.29 \u2192 z_cloud\u22482.29.\n\nSo approximately 2.3. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is close. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.3. So if the cloud's z is 1.9, then the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1 +1.9) =1216*2.9= 3526.4 Angstroms, which is 352.6 nm, which is still UV. So ground-based optical telescopes can't see that. So the cloud must have a redshift higher than approximately 2.29 for the absorption to be in the optical range.\n\nSo the lower limit would be z_cloud \u22482.29, so the smallest possible z is just over 2.29. The options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. So the correct answer would be C)2.4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because 2.29 is approximately 2.3, so the next higher option is 2.4. So that would be the lower limit, meaning that any cloud with z >=2.4 would have the absorption line in the optical.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should consider that the optical range is up to 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). So the maximum z is when 1216*(1 + z) =7000 \u2192 z=5.756 as before. So the cloud's redshift must be between 2.29 and 5.756 for the absorption line to be in the optical.\n\nSo the question is to find the lower limit, which is approximately 2.29. So the options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. So 2.4 is the closest higher value, so it's the lower limit. So the answer is C)2.4.\n\n\nTo determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 Angstroms) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the redshift requirements for the absorption line to fall within the visible spectrum (4000\u20137000 Angstroms). \n\nThe observed wavelength of the absorption line is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emit}} \\cdot (1 + z)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\lambda_{\\text{emit}} = 1216 \\, \\text{Angstroms}\\), and \\(\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}\\) must lie within the optical range (4000\u20137000 Angstroms). To find the lower limit on \\(z\\), we ensure that the absorption line is just at the start of the optical range (\\(\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = 4000 \\, \\text{Angstroms}\\)):\n\n\\[\n4000 = 1216 \\cdot (1 + z)\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(z\\):\n\n\\[\n1 + z = \\frac{4000}{1216} \\approx 3.29 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad z \\approx 2.29\n\\]\n\nThus, the cloud must have a redshift \\(z \\geq 2.29\\) for the absorption line to be observed in the optical range. Among the given options, the closest value above this threshold is \\(z = 2.4\\). Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for the clouds to be detected is approximately \\(z = 2.4\\).\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, let's see. The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. \n\nWait, I remember that quasars emit light, and sometimes there are clouds of hydrogen in front of them that absorb specific wavelengths. Oh right, the Lyman alpha emission. The Lyman alpha wavelength is around 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. \n\nBut wait, when a cloud is at a certain redshift, it absorbs the light at a longer wavelength because of the redshift. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_emit multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift. \n\nNow, the thing is, optical ground-based telescopes can't observe ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So the observed wavelength has to be in the optical range, which is longer than about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). \n\nWait, so the Lyman alpha line is 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at a redshift z, then the observed wavelength lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z). We need this lambda_obs to be greater than 4000 Angstroms so that it's in the optical range. \n\nSo setting up the equation: 1216*(1+z) > 4000. Let me solve for z. \n\nDivide both sides by 1216: 1 + z > 4000 / 1216. Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1216. Hmm, 1216 is approximately 1200. 4000/1200 is about 3.333. So 4000/1216 is a bit less than that. Let me compute it more accurately. \n\n1216 * 3 = 3648. 3648 is less than 4000. 3.333 * 1216 = 4000, so 4000 / 1216 is approximately 3.29 (since 3.29 * 1216 \u2248 4000). Wait, wait, 1216 * 3.29 = let's see: 3 * 1216 is 3648. 0.29 * 1216 is about 352.64. So 3648 + 352.64 \u2248 3999. So yeah, 3.29 is about right. \n\nSo 1 + z > 3.29 \u2192 z > 2.29. So the minimum redshift is just over 2.29. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 2.4 and D is 1.9. So the lower limit is around 2.29, so the next possible option is C) 2.4. \n\nWait, but wait. Do I have to consider anything else? Like, maybe the quasar's own emission? Or maybe the fact that the absorption line is observed in the quasar's spectrum. Oh right, the quasar emits at a certain wavelength, and the hydrogen cloud at redshift z will absorb the quasar's light at (1 + z) * 1216 Angstrom. \n\nBut the quasar's emission itself might be redshifted as well. Wait, no, the quasar is behind the cloud, so the cloud's redshift is higher than the quasar's? Or is the cloud in front, so the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud? Wait, no, if the cloud is in front of the quasar, then the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Because the quasar is further away. So the cloud's redshift is less than the quasar's. But wait, no, because when the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the cloud's hydrogen absorbs at the cloud's rest frame 1216 Angstrom, which would appear redshifted by the cloud's z. \n\nBut regardless, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud, such that the absorption line is in the optical. So our earlier calculation should hold. \n\nSo the minimum z is about 2.29. So the options are C) 2.4 and D) 1.9. Since 2.29 is between 2 and 2.4, the lower limit would be that the redshift must be at least 2.29. So the lowest possible option is C) 2.4, because anything lower than that would not reach into the optical. \n\nWait, but another thought. Maybe the quasar's emission line is at a certain wavelength. Oh, no, the question is about the absorption line being observed. So the quasar's continuum is behind the cloud, which causes the absorption. So the absorption line's wavelength must be in the optical. \n\nSo yes, the calculation seems correct. The minimum z is around 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.3. So the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. The closest higher value is 2.4, so option C. \n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check the math. 4000 divided by 1216. Let's compute 1216 * 3 = 3648. 3648 + 1216= 4864. That's 4 times 1216. Hmm, 1216 * 3.29 is 4000, so 1+z=3.29 \u2192 z=2.29. So the lower limit is z>2.29. So the minimum redshift is just above 2.29. \n\nLooking at the options, C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit would be 2.29, but since the options don't have 2.3, the next possible is 2.4. \n\nSo the correct answer is C) 2.4. Or wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the Lyman-alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. The cloud is at redshift z, so the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). To be observable in optical, which is 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) and up. So 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 \u2192 1+z >= 4000/1216 \u2192 1+z \u2248 3.29 \u2192 z \u2248 2.29. So the redshift must be at least approximately 2.29. \n\nThe options are 1.9, 2.4, etc. So 2.4 is the first option higher than 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29, so the answer is C) 2.4.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshift. Hmm, let me think. The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.\n\nWait, redshift... right. Redshift tells us how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The formula I remember is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. So z = (\u03bb_obs - \u03bb_emit)/\u03bb_emit.\n\nThe Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame. But when it's absorbed, the cloud's movement (or the universe's expansion) causes this wavelength to shift. So the quasar emits light, and the hydrogen cloud absorbs some of it, particularly at Lyman alpha. But if the cloud is moving away, the absorption line would be at a longer wavelength (redshifted).\n\nBut wait, the question is about detecting the absorption. So the quasar's light is observed through the cloud. The cloud's hydrogen will absorb at a wavelength longer than 1216 Angstroms because it's moving away (or the universe is expanding, so the cloud is at a high redshift).\n\nNow, optical ground-based telescopes. Optical light is from about 400 to 700 nm, right? Wait, but 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the ultraviolet. Oh, because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is UV. But ground-based telescopes can't observe UV because the atmosphere absorbs it. So for the absorption line to be in the optical range, the redshift must shift that UV wavelength into the visible range.\n\nWait, so if the Lyman alpha is absorbed at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) in the rest frame of the cloud, then for us to see it in optical (say, about 500 nm or 5000 Angstroms), we need the observed wavelength to be in the optical range. So we can set up the equation: \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_emit * (1 + z).\n\nWe want \u03bb_obs to be in the optical, so let's pick a lower limit. Let's say the lower end of optical is around 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). So 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z). Solving for z: 4000 / 1216 = 1 + z. Let me calculate that.\n\n1216 * 3 is about 3648, which is less than 4000. 1216 * 3.3 is 1216 *3=3648, 1216 *0.3=364.8, so 3648+364.8=4012.8. Oh, that's close to 4000. So 3.3 would give us around 4000 Angstroms. Wait, but wait. 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm, which is violet, the lower end of optical. But maybe the lower limit is a bit higher than that.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is about when the Lyman alpha absorption line is just entering the optical range. Because if the cloud's redshift is too high, the absorption line would be in the infrared, which some telescopes can see, but ground-based optical might not. So we want the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical, so that it can be observed.\n\nWait, but wait again. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm). For it to be observed in the optical range (say, 400 nm to 700 nm), the redshift z must satisfy 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 Angstroms (since 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms). Because when z is high enough, the observed wavelength \u03bb_obs = 1216*(1+z) is longer than 4000 Angstroms, so in the optical.\n\nWait, but 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Let me compute the redshift when \u03bb_obs is 400 nm. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.\n\nSo z = (4000 / 1216) - 1.\n\nCompute 4000 / 1216: Let's see, 1216 * 3 = 3648. 4000 - 3648 = 352. 352/1216 \u2248 0.289. So 3 + 0.289 = ~3.289. So z \u2248 3.29. So the redshift would need to be at least about 3.3 for the Lyman alpha to be observed at 400 nm (violet light, which is near the edge of optical).\n\nBut wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So the possible answers are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Maybe I should think about the opposite. If the cloud is at redshift z, then the quasar's light that is at the Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 A) would be shifted to 1216*(1+z). For this to be in the optical, 1216*(1+z) should be less than about 700 nm (7000 A), but more than 400 nm (4000 A). So 4000 < 1216*(1+z) <7000.\n\nSo the lower limit on z is when 1216*(1+z) = 4000.\n\nSo z = (4000 / 1216) -1 \u2248 3.28.\n\nBut none of the options are around 3.3. The closest option is A)3. So would 3 be the lower limit? Because if z is 3, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(4) = 4864 Angstroms, which is 486.4 nm. That's in the visible range (blue-green). So yeah, that's within optical.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is about the lower limit. So what's the minimal z such that the absorption line is in the optical. So if z is lower than that, the absorption line would be in the UV, which ground-based telescopes can't see. So the minimal z is when the absorption line is just entering the optical (e.g., 400 nm).\n\nWait, but earlier calculation said that z would need to be about 3.28 for 400 nm. But option A is 3, which gives 4864 A (486 nm), which is blue. So for the Lyman alpha to be observable, the cloud must have a redshift z >= ~3.28. So with z=3, it's in the optical. So the lower limit is z=3. So the answer would be A)3.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should think about what the maximum wavelength the telescope can observe. If the ground-based telescope can't see beyond a certain wavelength, perhaps beyond 700 nm? No, wait, optical goes up to about 700 nm, but beyond that is infrared. So if the Lyman alpha is redshifted beyond 700 nm, it's in the infrared, which many optical telescopes can't capture. But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimal z where the Lyman alpha is just in the optical.\n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.\" So lower limit means the minimal z where they can be detected. So the minimal z is when the Lyman alpha is just entering the optical. So the minimal z is when \u03bb_obs >= 400 nm (4000 A). So z is (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 3.28. So any z above 3.28 would have the Lyman alpha in the optical. So the lower limit is around 3.3. But the options don't have that.\n\nThe closest option is A)3. Let me compute 1216*(1+3) = 1216 *4 = 4864 A, which is 486 nm (blue). So for z=3, the absorption line is in the optical. For z less than 3, it's in the UV, which can't be detected by optical telescopes. So the lower limit is z=3. So the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the quasar's emission. Wait, quasars emit light across the spectrum, but the absorption line from the hydrogen cloud would be in their spectrum. So if the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, the quasar's own light would be redshifted. Wait, no, the quasar is behind the cloud, so the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Wait, the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar.\n\nWait, no, the cloud is in the line of sight to the quasar, so the cloud is between us and the quasar. So the quasar's light passes through the cloud, and the cloud's hydrogen absorbs some of the quasar's light at the Lyman alpha wavelength in the rest frame of the cloud. But due to the expansion of the universe, the cloud is moving away from us, so the absorption occurs at a longer wavelength than 1216 A.\n\nWait, no, actually, the quasar's light is emitted at 1216 A in its own frame. But the cloud is at a certain redshift, say z_cloud. So the quasar's light that reaches the cloud is at a wavelength stretched by the quasar's redshift, z_quasar. But the cloud then absorbs at its own rest frame 1216 A, which would be at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in our observed frame.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about it in terms of the observed wavelength. The quasar's light that passes through the cloud will have a absorption line at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) A. If that absorption line is in the optical (say, between 4000 and 7000 A), then it can be detected. So the minimal z_cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 4000 A.\n\nSo z_cloud = (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 (3.29) -1 = 2.29. Wait, no, wait: 4000/1216 is approximately 3.29, so z_cloud is approximately 2.29.\n\nWait, wait, let me do the exact calculation. 4000 divided by 1216.\n\n1216 \u00d7 3 = 3648. 3648 + 352 = 4000. 352 /1216 = 0.289. So 3.289. So 3.289 -1 = 2.289. So z_cloud \u2248 2.29.\n\nSo the minimal z is about 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest is C)2.4, but option D is 1.9, which is lower. So wait, if z_cloud is 2.29, then 2.4 is higher than that, but 1.9 is lower. So if z_cloud is 2.29, then the absorption line is at 4000 A (400 nm). So the lower limit is 2.29. So any cloud with z_cloud >=2.29 would have the absorption line in the optical.\n\nBut the options don't have 2.29. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. But the quasar's light is redshifted due to its own z_quasar. So when the quasar emits light, the cloud (at z_cloud) would see the quasar's light at a wavelength \u03bb_quasar = emitted wavelength \u00d7 (1 + z_quasar). The cloud then absorbs at 1216 A in its rest frame, which would be observed by us as 1216 \u00d7 (1 + z_cloud) A.\n\nWait, no, I think I got that wrong. The quasar's emitted light is at 1216 A. The cloud, being at a certain redshift, would see the quasar's light redshifted. So from the cloud's frame, the quasar's light is at 1216 \u00d7 (1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the absorption line we observe is at 1216 \u00d7 (1 + z_cloud) A. Because the cloud is at redshift z_cloud, so any emission from the quasar that is absorbed by the cloud will have the absorption line at 1216 \u00d7 (1 + z_cloud) A.\n\nSo the condition is that 1216 \u00d7 (1 + z_cloud) >= 4000 A (since that's the lower end of optical). So z_cloud >= (4000 / 1216 ) -1 \u2248 3.289 -1 = 2.289.\n\nSo the minimal z is about 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest is C) 2.4 and D)1.9. So 2.29 is between options C and D. So which is the lower limit?\n\nWait, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z that allows detection. So any z >=2.29 would have the absorption line in the optical. So the lower limit is 2.29. The options given are 2.4 and 1.9. So 2.4 is higher than 2.29, which would satisfy the condition. But 1.9 is lower than 2.29, so the absorption line would be at 1216*(1+1.9) = 1216 *2.9 = 3526.4 A, which is 352.6 nm, still in the UV. So that's not in the optical.\n\nWait, no, 3526.4 A is 352.6 nm. Wait, optical is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So 352 nm is in the UV, so it's not observable by optical telescopes. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, the redshift must be at least about 2.29. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher value is C)2.4. So the minimal redshift is about 2.3, so any z >=2.3 would be detectable. So the lower limit is 2.3, so the minimal z is 2.3. The options don't have 2.3, but the closest is C)2.4.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again the numbers. 1216 * (1 + z) = 4000. So 1 + z = 4000/1216 \u2248 3.289. So z = 2.289. So the minimal z is 2.289.\n\nSo the options are:\n\nA)3: z=3. 1216*4=4864 A (486 nm, blue)\n\nB)1.2: 1216*2.2=2675.2 A (267.5 nm, far UV)\n\nC)2.4: 1216 * 3.4=4134.4 A (413 nm, violet)\n\nD)1.9: 1216 *2.9=3526.4 A (352 nm, near UV)\n\nSo option C (z=2.4) gives a wavelength of 413 nm, which is violet (just within optical). Option D (z=1.9) is 352 nm, which is in the UV, so not detectable by optical telescopes.\n\nSo the minimal z is about 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. The options don't have that, but option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So any z >=2.29 would be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29, so the minimal z is around 2.3. So the answer should be the smallest option that is >=2.29. The options are A)3, C)2.4.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)2.4.\n\nWait, but wait. The question says \"lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected.\" So the minimal z is when the Lyman alpha is just in the optical. So the minimal z is about 2.29, so any z >=2.29 would have the absorption line in the optical. So the lower limit is 2.29, which is not exactly an option. The closest higher option is C)2.4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Let me redo the exact calculation.\n\n4000 / 1216 = ?\n\n1216 \u00d7 3 = 3648. 4000 -3648= 352.\n\n352 /1216 = 0.289.\n\nSo 3.289, so z=2.289.\n\nSo the minimal z is approximately 2.29.\n\nSo the options are C)2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, but the options don't have that. So the correct answer would be C)2.4, as it's the minimal option provided that is higher than 2.29.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, perhaps I should think about the maximum wavelength that ground-based optical telescopes can observe. Some might have a cutoff at about 700 nm (7000 A), but others might have a higher limit. Wait, but for the lower limit, it's about when the line enters the optical.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the cloud's redshift must be such that the Lyman alpha absorption is within the observed frame's optical. So the minimal z is when the absorption line is at 4000 A (400 nm), which is the start of the optical range.\n\nSo the correct minimal z is approximately 2.29. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is C)2.4, which is the closest higher value. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the lower limit as when the Lyman alpha is just in the optical, which would be z\u22482.29, so the minimal z is 2.3. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct choice is C)2.4.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial question again. It says \"the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.\"\n\nSo the objects (the clouds) must have a redshift where their Lyman alpha absorption is in the optical. The minimal z is when the absorption line is at 4000 A. So the minimal z is (4000/1216)-1 \u22482.289. So any cloud with z >=2.289 would have the absorption line in the optical.\n\nLooking at the options, the only option higher than 2.289 is C)2.4 and A)3.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 2.3, but C is 2.4, which is higher. So the correct minimal z is about 2.3. So the lower limit is 2.3, so the answer would be C)2.4, as it's the smallest option provided that is higher than 2.3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the quasar's emission. Wait, the quasar emits the Lyman alpha line at 1216 A, but if the cloud is at a higher redshift, the quasar's Lyman alpha emission would be redshifted beyond the cloud's absorption. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it as the cloud being at a redshift z, and the quasar is at a higher redshift. So the quasar's light is redshifted more than the cloud's. So the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption occurs at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z_cloud) A. The quasar's light, which includes emission at 1216 A, would be redshifted to 1216*(1 + z_quasar) A. So for the absorption line to be present, the quasar's emission must be at a wavelength longer than the absorption line. Wait, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply about when the Lyman alpha line is shifted into the optical, regardless of the quasar's redshift. So the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >= 4000 A.\n\nSo the minimal z is (4000/1216)-1 \u22482.289.\n\nSo the options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. Since 2.289 is between D)1.9 and C)2.4, the lower limit is approximately 2.29, which isn't an option. But the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nSo the minimal z is about 2.3. The options higher than that are C)2.4 and A)3. So the lower limit is 2.3, so the correct answer would be C)2.4, as it's the smallest option higher than the minimal z.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is phrased as the minimal z where the cloud can be detected. So the minimal z is 2.29, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is C)2.4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the confusion is between the quasar's redshift and the cloud's redshift. Maybe the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's, so the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 A in its rest frame, but due to the quasar's redshift, it's observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). The cloud, being at a lower redshift (z_cloud < z_quasar), would absorb some of that light at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) A.\n\nWait, but for the absorption to be observed, the quasar's emission must have a wavelength longer than the absorption line. So 1216*(1 + z_quasar) must be longer than 1216*(1 + z_cloud). Which is always true since z_quasar > z_cloud.\n\nBut this might not affect the calculation of the minimal z_cloud. Because regardless, the absorption line would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) A. So the minimal z_cloud is when this is at 4000 A.\n\nSo I think the correct approach is to calculate when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 4000 A. So z_cloud = (4000/1216) -1 \u22482.289.\n\nSo the minimal z_cloud is about 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.3. The options don't have that, but the closest higher option is C)2.4. So the answer is C)2.4.\n\nWait, but another way: perhaps the Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm. The optical range for ground-based telescopes is about 400 nm to 700 nm. So the redshift required to shift 121.6 nm to 400 nm is z = (400/121.6) -1 \u2248 3.29 -1 = 2.29.\n\nSo yes, the minimal z is 2.29. The options are 2.4 and 1.9. So the correct answer is C)2.4.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to calculate when this wavelength is shifted into the optical range (approximately 400 nm to 700 nm). \n\nThe redshift \\( z \\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} - \\lambda_{\\text{emit}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\lambda_{\\text{emit}} = 1216 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\) (rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha line), and \\(\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}\\) is the observed wavelength in the optical range. For the Lyman alpha line to be detectable in the optical, it must be shifted to at least 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{4000}{1216} - 1 \\approx 3.289 - 1 = 2.289\n\\]\n\nThus, the minimal redshift is approximately \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshift. Hmm, let me think. The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.\n\nWait, redshift... right. Redshift tells us how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The formula I remember is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. So z = (\u03bb_obs - \u03bb_emit)/\u03bb_emit.\n\nThe Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame. But when it's absorbed, the cloud's movement (or the universe's expansion) causes this wavelength to shift. So the quasar emits light, and the hydrogen cloud absorbs some of it, particularly at Lyman alpha. But if the cloud is moving away, the absorption line would be at a longer wavelength (redshifted).\n\nBut wait, the question is about detecting the absorption. So the quasar's light is observed through the cloud. The cloud's hydrogen will absorb at a wavelength longer than 1216 Angstroms because it's moving away (or the universe is expanding, so the cloud is at a high redshift).\n\nNow, optical ground-based telescopes. Optical light is from about 400 to 700 nm, right? Wait, but 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the ultraviolet. Oh, because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is UV. But ground-based telescopes can't observe UV because the atmosphere absorbs it. So for the absorption line to be in the optical range, the redshift must shift that UV wavelength into the visible range.\n\nWait, so if the Lyman alpha is absorbed at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) in the rest frame of the cloud, then for us to see it in optical (say, about 500 nm or 5000 Angstroms), we need the observed wavelength to be in the optical range. So we can set up the equation: \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_emit * (1 + z).\n\nWe want \u03bb_obs to be in the optical, so let's pick a lower limit. Let's say the lower end of optical is around 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). So 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z). Solving for z: 4000 / 1216 = 1 + z. Let me calculate that.\n\n1216 * 3 is about 3648, which is less than 4000. 1216 * 3.3 is 1216 *3=3648, 1216 *0.3=364.8, so 3648+364.8=4012.8. Oh, that's close to 4000. So 3.3 would give us around 4000 Angstroms. Wait, but wait. 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm, which is violet, the lower end of optical. But maybe the lower limit is a bit higher than that.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is about when the Lyman alpha absorption line is just entering the optical range. Because if the cloud's redshift is too high, the absorption line would be in the infrared, which some telescopes can see, but ground-based optical might not. So we want the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical, so that it can be observed.\n\nWait, but wait again. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm). For it to be observed in the optical range (say, 400 nm to 700 nm), the redshift z must satisfy 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 Angstroms (since 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms). Because when z is high enough, the observed wavelength \u03bb_obs = 1216*(1+z) is longer than 4000 Angstroms, so in the optical.\n\nWait, but 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Let me compute the redshift when \u03bb_obs is 400 nm. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.\n\nSo z = (4000 / 1216) - 1.\n\nCompute 4000 / 1216: Let's see, 1216 * 3 = 3648. 4000 - 3648 = 352. 352/1216 \u2248 0.289. So 3 + 0.289 = ~3.289. So z \u2248 3.29. So the redshift would need to be at least about 3.3 for the Lyman alpha to be observed at 400 nm (violet light, which is near the edge of optical).\n\nBut wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So the possible answers are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Maybe I should think about the opposite. If the cloud is at redshift z, then the quasar's light that is at the Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 A) would be shifted to 1216*(1+z). For this to be in the optical, 1216*(1+z) should be less than about 700 nm (7000 A), but more than 400 nm (4000 A). So 4000 < 1216*(1+z) <7000.\n\nSo the lower limit on z is when 1216*(1+z) = 4000.\n\nSo z = (4000 / 1216) -1 \u2248 3.28.\n\nBut none of the options are around 3.3. The closest option is A)3. So would 3 be the lower limit? Because if z is 3, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(4) = 4864 Angstroms, which is 486.4 nm. That's in the visible range (blue-green). So yeah, that's within optical.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is about the lower limit. So what's the minimal z such that the absorption line is in the optical. So if z is lower than that, the absorption line would be in the UV, which ground-based telescopes can't see. So the minimal z is when the absorption line is just entering the optical (e.g., 400 nm).\n\nWait, but earlier calculation said that z would need to be about 3.28 for 400 nm. But option A is 3, which gives 4864 A (486 nm), which is blue. So for the Lyman alpha to be observable, the cloud must have a redshift z >= ~3.28. So with z=3, it's in the optical. So the lower limit is z=3. So the answer would be A)3.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should think about what the maximum wavelength the telescope can observe. If the ground-based telescope can't see beyond a certain wavelength, perhaps beyond 700 nm? No, wait, optical goes up to about 700 nm, but beyond that is infrared. So if the Lyman alpha is redshifted beyond 700 nm, it's in the infrared, which many optical telescopes can't capture. But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimal z where the Lyman alpha is just in the optical.\n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.\" So lower limit means the minimal z where they can be detected. So the minimal z is when the Lyman alpha is just entering the optical. So the minimal z is when \u03bb_obs >= 400 nm (4000 A). So z is (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 3.28. So any z above 3.28 would have the Lyman alpha in the optical. So the lower limit is around 3.3. But the options don't have that.\n\nThe closest option is A)3. Let me compute 1216*(1+3) = 1216 *4 = 4864 A, which is 486 nm (blue). So for z=3, the absorption line is in the optical. For z less than 3, it's in the UV, which can't be detected by optical telescopes. So the lower limit is z=3. So the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the quasar's emission. Wait, quasars emit light across the spectrum, but the absorption line from the hydrogen cloud would be in their spectrum. So if the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, the quasar's own light would be redshifted. Wait, no, the quasar is behind the cloud, so the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Wait, the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar.\n\nWait, no, the cloud is in the line of sight to the quasar, so the cloud is between us and the quasar. So the quasar's light passes through the cloud, and the cloud's hydrogen absorbs some of the quasar's light at the Lyman alpha wavelength in the rest frame of the cloud. But due to the expansion of the universe, the cloud is moving away from us, so the absorption occurs at a longer wavelength than 1216 A.\n\nWait, no, actually, the quasar's light is emitted at 1216 A in its own frame. But the cloud is at a certain redshift, say z_cloud. So the quasar's light that reaches the cloud is at a wavelength stretched by the quasar's redshift, z_quasar. But the cloud then absorbs at its own rest frame 1216 A, which would be at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in our observed frame.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about it in terms of the observed wavelength. The quasar's light that passes through the cloud will have a absorption line at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) A. If that absorption line is in the optical (say, between 4000 and 7000 A), then it can be detected. So the minimal z_cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 4000 A.\n\nSo z_cloud = (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 (3.29) -1 = 2.29. Wait, no, wait: 4000/1216 is approximately 3.29, so z_cloud is approximately 2.29.\n\nWait, wait, let me do the exact calculation. 4000 divided by 1216.\n\n1216 \u00d7 3 = 3648. 3648 + 352 = 4000. 352 /1216 = 0.289. So 3.289. So 3.289 -1 = 2.289. So z_cloud \u2248 2.29.\n\nSo the minimal z is about 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest is C)2.4, but option D is 1.9, which is lower. So wait, if z_cloud is 2.29, then 2.4 is higher than that, but 1.9 is lower. So if z_cloud is 2.29, then the absorption line is at 4000 A (400 nm). So the lower limit is 2.29. So any cloud with z_cloud >=2.29 would have the absorption line in the optical.\n\nBut the options don't have 2.29. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. But the quasar's light is redshifted due to its own z_quasar. So when the quasar emits light, the cloud (at z_cloud) would see the quasar's light at a wavelength \u03bb_quasar = emitted wavelength \u00d7 (1 + z_quasar). The cloud then absorbs at 1216 A in its rest frame, which would be observed by us as 1216 \u00d7 (1 + z_cloud) A.\n\nWait, no, I think I got that wrong. The quasar's emitted light is at 1216 A. The cloud, being at a certain redshift, would see the quasar's light redshifted. So from the cloud's frame, the quasar's light is at 1216 \u00d7 (1 + z_quasar) / (1 + z_cloud) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the absorption line we observe is at 1216 \u00d7 (1 + z_cloud) A. Because the cloud is at redshift z_cloud, so any emission from the quasar that is absorbed by the cloud will have the absorption line at 1216 \u00d7 (1 + z_cloud) A.\n\nSo the condition is that 1216 \u00d7 (1 + z_cloud) >= 4000 A (since that's the lower end of optical). So z_cloud >= (4000 / 1216 ) -1 \u2248 3.289 -1 = 2.289.\n\nSo the minimal z is about 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest is C) 2.4 and D)1.9. So 2.29 is between options C and D. So which is the lower limit?\n\nWait, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z that allows detection. So any z >=2.29 would have the absorption line in the optical. So the lower limit is 2.29. The options given are 2.4 and 1.9. So 2.4 is higher than 2.29, which would satisfy the condition. But 1.9 is lower than 2.29, so the absorption line would be at 1216*(1+1.9) = 1216 *2.9 = 3526.4 A, which is 352.6 nm, still in the UV. So that's not in the optical.\n\nWait, no, 3526.4 A is 352.6 nm. Wait, optical is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So 352 nm is in the UV, so it's not observable by optical telescopes. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, the redshift must be at least about 2.29. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher value is C)2.4. So the minimal redshift is about 2.3, so any z >=2.3 would be detectable. So the lower limit is 2.3, so the minimal z is 2.3. The options don't have 2.3, but the closest is C)2.4.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again the numbers. 1216 * (1 + z) = 4000. So 1 + z = 4000/1216 \u2248 3.289. So z = 2.289. So the minimal z is 2.289.\n\nSo the options are:\n\nA)3: z=3. 1216*4=4864 A (486 nm, blue)\n\nB)1.2: 1216*2.2=2675.2 A (267.5 nm, far UV)\n\nC)2.4: 1216 * 3.4=4134.4 A (413 nm, violet)\n\nD)1.9: 1216 *2.9=3526.4 A (352 nm, near UV)\n\nSo option C (z=2.4) gives a wavelength of 413 nm, which is violet (just within optical). Option D (z=1.9) is 352 nm, which is in the UV, so not detectable by optical telescopes.\n\nSo the minimal z is about 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. The options don't have that, but option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So any z >=2.29 would be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29, so the minimal z is around 2.3. So the answer should be the smallest option that is >=2.29. The options are A)3, C)2.4.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)2.4.\n\nWait, but wait. The question says \"lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected.\" So the minimal z is when the Lyman alpha is just in the optical. So the minimal z is about 2.29, so any z >=2.29 would have the absorption line in the optical. So the lower limit is 2.29, which is not exactly an option. The closest higher option is C)2.4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Let me redo the exact calculation.\n\n4000 / 1216 = ?\n\n1216 \u00d7 3 = 3648. 4000 -3648= 352.\n\n352 /1216 = 0.289.\n\nSo 3.289, so z=2.289.\n\nSo the minimal z is approximately 2.29.\n\nSo the options are C)2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, but the options don't have that. So the correct answer would be C)2.4, as it's the minimal option provided that is higher than 2.29.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, perhaps I should think about the maximum wavelength that ground-based optical telescopes can observe. Some might have a cutoff at about 700 nm (7000 A), but others might have a higher limit. Wait, but for the lower limit, it's about when the line enters the optical.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the cloud's redshift must be such that the Lyman alpha absorption is within the observed frame's optical. So the minimal z is when the absorption line is at 4000 A (400 nm), which is the start of the optical range.\n\nSo the correct minimal z is approximately 2.29. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is C)2.4, which is the closest higher value. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the lower limit as when the Lyman alpha is just in the optical, which would be z\u22482.29, so the minimal z is 2.3. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct choice is C)2.4.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial question again. It says \"the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.\"\n\nSo the objects (the clouds) must have a redshift where their Lyman alpha absorption is in the optical. The minimal z is when the absorption line is at 4000 A. So the minimal z is (4000/1216)-1 \u22482.289. So any cloud with z >=2.289 would have the absorption line in the optical.\n\nLooking at the options, the only option higher than 2.289 is C)2.4 and A)3.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 2.3, but C is 2.4, which is higher. So the correct minimal z is about 2.3. So the lower limit is 2.3, so the answer would be C)2.4, as it's the smallest option provided that is higher than 2.3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the quasar's emission. Wait, the quasar emits the Lyman alpha line at 1216 A, but if the cloud is at a higher redshift, the quasar's Lyman alpha emission would be redshifted beyond the cloud's absorption. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it as the cloud being at a redshift z, and the quasar is at a higher redshift. So the quasar's light is redshifted more than the cloud's. So the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption occurs at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z_cloud) A. The quasar's light, which includes emission at 1216 A, would be redshifted to 1216*(1 + z_quasar) A. So for the absorption line to be present, the quasar's emission must be at a wavelength longer than the absorption line. Wait, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply about when the Lyman alpha line is shifted into the optical, regardless of the quasar's redshift. So the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) >= 4000 A.\n\nSo the minimal z is (4000/1216)-1 \u22482.289.\n\nSo the options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. Since 2.289 is between D)1.9 and C)2.4, the lower limit is approximately 2.29, which isn't an option. But the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nSo the minimal z is about 2.3. The options higher than that are C)2.4 and A)3. So the lower limit is 2.3, so the correct answer would be C)2.4, as it's the smallest option higher than the minimal z.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is phrased as the minimal z where the cloud can be detected. So the minimal z is 2.29, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is C)2.4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the confusion is between the quasar's redshift and the cloud's redshift. Maybe the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's, so the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 A in its rest frame, but due to the quasar's redshift, it's observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). The cloud, being at a lower redshift (z_cloud < z_quasar), would absorb some of that light at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) A.\n\nWait, but for the absorption to be observed, the quasar's emission must have a wavelength longer than the absorption line. So 1216*(1 + z_quasar) must be longer than 1216*(1 + z_cloud). Which is always true since z_quasar > z_cloud.\n\nBut this might not affect the calculation of the minimal z_cloud. Because regardless, the absorption line would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) A. So the minimal z_cloud is when this is at 4000 A.\n\nSo I think the correct approach is to calculate when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 4000 A. So z_cloud = (4000/1216) -1 \u22482.289.\n\nSo the minimal z_cloud is about 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.3. The options don't have that, but the closest higher option is C)2.4. So the answer is C)2.4.\n\nWait, but another way: perhaps the Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm. The optical range for ground-based telescopes is about 400 nm to 700 nm. So the redshift required to shift 121.6 nm to 400 nm is z = (400/121.6) -1 \u2248 3.29 -1 = 2.29.\n\nSo yes, the minimal z is 2.29. The options are 2.4 and 1.9. So the correct answer is C)2.4.\n\n\nTo determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to calculate when this wavelength is shifted into the optical range (approximately 400 nm to 700 nm). \n\nThe redshift \\( z \\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} - \\lambda_{\\text{emit}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\lambda_{\\text{emit}} = 1216 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\) (rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha line), and \\(\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}\\) is the observed wavelength in the optical range. For the Lyman alpha line to be detectable in the optical, it must be shifted to at least 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{4000}{1216} - 1 \\approx 3.289 - 1 = 2.289\n\\]\n\nThus, the minimal redshift is approximately \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\). This means any cloud with a redshift \\( z \\geq 2.29 \\) will have its Lyman alpha absorption line in the optical range, making it detectable.\n\nNow, analyzing the options:\n\n- **A) 3**: At \\( z = 3 \\), the observed wavelength is \\( 1216 \\times (1 + 3) = 4864 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) (486 nm), which is in the optical range. However, this is higher than the minimal redshift of \\( 2.29 \\), so it is not the lower limit.\n- **B) 1.2**: At \\( z = 1.2 \\), the observed wavelength is \\( 1216 \\times (1 + 1.2) = 2675.2 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) (267.5 nm), which is in the ultraviolet (UV) range and not detectable by optical telescopes.\n- **C) 2.4**: At \\( z = 2.4 \\), the observed wavelength is \\( 1216 \\times (1 + 2.4) = 4134.4 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) (413 nm), which is in the optical range. This is slightly higher than the minimal redshift of \\( 2.29 \\), making it the closest valid option.\n- **D) 1.9**: At \\( z = 1.9 \\), the observed wavelength is \\( 1216 \\times (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) (352.6 nm), which is still in the UV range and not detectable by optical telescopes.\n\nThe minimal redshift for the Lyman alpha line to be detectable in the optical range is approximately \\( z \\approx 2.29 \\). Among the given options, the closest higher value is \\( z = 2.4 \\), which satisfies the condition. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.\n\nHmm, okay. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. So for it to be observed, especially from a quasar, the wavelength must shift into a region that's observable by the telescopes. But wait, ground-based optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs it. So if the Lyman alpha line is absorbed by hydrogen clouds, but we're using optical telescopes, how does that work?\n\nWait, no, the quasar emits light, and some of it is absorbed by the hydrogen. The absorption line would be at the rest wavelength of Lyman alpha, which is about 1216 Angstroms. But if the quasar is at a high redshift, that absorption line could shift into the visible spectrum, which optical telescopes can detect.\n\nSo the idea is that the Lyman alpha absorption line, which is at 1216A, gets redshifted. We need to find the minimum redshift where this redshifted wavelength is still in the optical range that ground-based telescopes can observe.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can detect? I think the optical range is roughly from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). But wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far ultraviolet. That's way below what optical telescopes can see. So how does this work?\n\nOh wait, the absorption line is at the rest frame of the hydrogen. But if the hydrogen is at a high redshift, the absorption line would be shifted into longer wavelengths. So the observed wavelength \u03bb_obs is \u03bb_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.\n\nWe want \u03bb_obs to be within the optical range that the telescope can detect. Let's see, optical is about 400-700 nm. So the maximum \u03bb_obs we can detect is 700 nm, which is 7000 Angstroms.\n\nSo we set \u03bb_rest * (1 + z) = 7000 Angstroms. Wait, because if it's higher than that, the wavelength would be in infrared or beyond, which optical telescopes might not detect well. Wait, but actually, some optical telescopes can go a bit into the near-infrared, but the question specifies \"optical\" so I'll stick to 700 nm as the upper limit.\n\nSo \u03bb_rest is 1216 Angstroms. So 1216 * (1 + z) = 7000.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud, which is at a certain redshift. The quasar itself is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the hydrogen cloud is between us and the quasar. The quasar's light, when it passes through the cloud, has the Lyman alpha line absorbed. The absorption line is at the rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. But from our perspective, that line is redshifted by the cloud's redshift.\n\nWait, but to observe this absorption line, the wavelength after redshift must be in the visible spectrum. So the cloud's redshift z must satisfy 1216 * (1 + z) <= 7000 Angstroms? Or wait, because if the cloud is at a higher redshift, the absorption line is further into the red. But if the cloud is too far (high z), the Lyman alpha line could be beyond the visible spectrum, so we can't detect it.\n\nSo the maximum redshift for which the Lyman alpha line is still in the visible is when 1216*(1+z) = 7000.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1 + z = 7000 / 1216 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n7000 divided by 1216. Hmm, 1216 *5 is 6080. 7000-6080=920. 1216*0.75 is about 912 (since 1216 *0.7=851.2, 0.05 is 60.8; so 851.2+60.8=912). So 5.75 would give 6080 + 912=6992. Close to 7000. So 5.75 gives 6992, which is just under 7000. So 5.75 is approximately 5.75.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute it more accurately. 7000 / 1216.\n\n1216 *5 =6080. 7000-6080=920. 920 /1216= approx 0.7568. So total z= 5.7568. So z \u22485.76.\n\nWait, that's way higher than any of the options given. The options are up to 3. So I must be missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the situation wrong. Let me think again. The quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. The quasar is at a redshift z_q, and the cloud is at a lower redshift z_c. So the Lyman alpha absorption line in the cloud is at wavelength 1216*(1+z_c) Angstroms.\n\nBut for that line to be in the observed frame, and for ground-based optical telescopes to detect it, it must be within the optical window. So the wavelength must be less than about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms), because beyond that, it's infrared, which isn't captured by optical telescopes.\n\nSo the maximum allowed wavelength is 7000 Angstroms. So the redshift z_c must satisfy 1216*(1+z_c) \u22647000.\n\nSo 1+z_c =7000/1216\u22485.7568. So z_c\u22484.7568.\n\nWait, but the options don't have anything near 4.75. The highest is option A)3. So perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm thinking about it the wrong way. The quasar's own emission is redshifted, but the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z_c), and that's what we're observing.\n\nWait, but the quasar's light is so bright, but the absorption is from intervening hydrogen. So the absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_c). If z_c is too high, then 1216*(1 + z_c) would be longer than 7000 Angstroms, making it infrared. So the maximum z_c that keeps the absorption line within optical is when 1216*(1+z_c) =7000.\n\nSo z_c= (7000/1216) -1\u22485.7568. So anything lower than that would have the absorption line in the optical.\n\nBut the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, wait, no. The lower limit would be the smallest redshift where the absorption is still in the optical. Because if the cloud is at a lower redshift, the absorption line is at a shorter wavelength, which is in the UV. But ground-based optical telescopes can't see UV, so we can't detect it. So for us to see the absorption line, the redshift must be such that 1216*(1+z_c) \u22647000.\n\nWait, but if the cloud is at z=0, the absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), which is in the far UV. Optical telescopes can't see that. So the cloud must be at a high enough redshift that the absorption line is in the visible range.\n\nWait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So the lower limit on redshift would be the smallest z_c where 1216*(1 +z_c) is in the visible range. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.\n\nIf z_c is high, the absorption line is redshifted into the visible. So the minimal z_c is the smallest z where the absorption line enters the visible.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, the absorption line shifts to longer wavelengths as z_c increases. So the minimum redshift is the smallest z_c that brings the absorption line into the visible. Because for lower z, the line is in UV, which we can't see. So the minimal z_c is when 1216*(1+z_c) is just equal to 400 nm, which is the start of the optical (violet) range.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the minimal z_c such that the absorption line is in the optical. So, to have the Lyman alpha line in the observed optical (say, between 400 and 700 nm), the redshift must be such that 400 nm \u2264 1216*(1 + z_c) \u2264700 nm.\n\nWait, no, because 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So when the cloud is at redshift z_c, the observed wavelength is 121.6*(1+z_c) nm. We want this to be in the optical, say 400-700 nm.\n\nSo, 400 \u2264 121.6*(1 + z_c) \u2264700.\n\nSo, dividing all parts by 121.6:\n\n400/121.6 \u2264 (1 + z_c) \u2264700/121.6.\n\nCompute these:\n\n400 /121.6 = approx 3.29.\n\n700 /121.6 \u2248 5.756.\n\nSo (1 + z_c) must be between ~3.29 and ~5.756.\n\nSo z_c is between 2.29 and 4.756.\n\nSo the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. Now, looking at the options, the closest lower limit is 2.4 (option C) and 1.9 (option D). Wait, 2.29 is closer to 2.4 than 1.9. So the lower limit on the redshift is around 2.29, so the minimal z_c is about 2.3. So the lower limit would be 2.29, so the answer would be the smallest z that is above this, which is option C) 2.4.\n\nWait, but the question says 'lower limit on the redshift' of the object. So the objects (the hydrogen clouds) must have a redshift greater than or equal to z=2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So any cloud with z >=2.29 can be detected because the Lyman alpha line is in the optical.\n\nSo the question is asking for the lower limit, which is 2.29. Looking at the options, the only option higher than that is option C)2.4. But wait, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3, but the options don't have that. So the next higher option is 2.4, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I may have made a mistake here. Because the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the cloud's redshift is less than the quasar's. So the question is about the cloud's redshift. So when the cloud's redshift is such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is in the optical, which is 400-700 nm.\n\nSo the minimal redshift for the cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 400 nm.\n\nWait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) =4000.\n\nSo 1 + z_cloud =4000/1216\u22483.29.\n\nSo z_cloud\u22482.29.\n\nSo any cloud with z_cloud >=2.29 would have the absorption line in the optical. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3.\n\nLooking at the options, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nSo the minimal redshift is about 2.3, so the lower limit is 2.3. The options don't have 2.3, but option C is 2.4, which is the smallest option higher than 2.3. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3, so the minimal redshift is 2.3. Therefore, the correct answer would be the option just above that, which is C)2.4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the maximum wavelength observed is 700 nm (7000 Angstroms), so the maximum z is (7000/1216) -1\u22485.756. So any cloud with z_cloud <=5.756 would have the absorption line in the optical. But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift, which is the minimal z_cloud such that the absorption line is in the optical. So the minimal z is when the absorption line is at 400 nm.\n\nSo I think the lower limit is approximately 2.29, which is closest to option C)2.4.\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the quasar's own emission is at a higher redshift. For example, the quasar is at z_q, and the hydrogen cloud is at z_cloud. The absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. For the absorption line to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) <=7000 Angstroms.\n\nSo the maximum possible z_cloud is (7000/1216) -1\u22485.756. But the quasar must be at a higher redshift, so z_q > z_cloud.\n\nBut the question is about the lower limit of the cloud's redshift. So the minimal z_cloud is when the absorption line is just in the optical. So the minimal z_cloud is when the Lyman alpha is at 400 nm.\n\nSo z_cloud=(4000/1216) -1\u22483.29-1=2.29.\n\nSo the lower limit is z_cloud\u22482.29. So the minimal redshift is 2.29, which is about 2.3. The options given are 2.4 (C) and 1.9 (D). So 2.3 is between options C and D. The closest higher option is C)2.4.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)2.4.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.\n\nHmm, okay. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. So for it to be observed, especially from a quasar, the wavelength must shift into a region that's observable by the telescopes. But wait, ground-based optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs it. So if the Lyman alpha line is absorbed by hydrogen clouds, but we're using optical telescopes, how does that work?\n\nWait, no, the quasar emits light, and some of it is absorbed by the hydrogen. The absorption line would be at the rest wavelength of Lyman alpha, which is about 1216 Angstroms. But if the quasar is at a high redshift, that absorption line could shift into the visible spectrum, which optical telescopes can detect.\n\nSo the idea is that the Lyman alpha absorption line, which is at 1216A, gets redshifted. We need to find the minimum redshift where this redshifted wavelength is still in the optical range that ground-based telescopes can observe.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can detect? I think the optical range is roughly from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). But wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far ultraviolet. That's way below what optical telescopes can see. So how does this work?\n\nOh wait, the absorption line is at the rest frame of the hydrogen. But if the hydrogen is at a high redshift, the absorption line would be shifted into longer wavelengths. So the observed wavelength \u03bb_obs is \u03bb_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.\n\nWe want \u03bb_obs to be within the optical range that the telescope can detect. Let's see, optical is about 400-700 nm. So the maximum \u03bb_obs we can detect is 700 nm, which is 7000 Angstroms.\n\nSo we set \u03bb_rest * (1 + z) = 7000 Angstroms. Wait, because if it's higher than that, the wavelength would be in infrared or beyond, which optical telescopes might not detect well. Wait, but actually, some optical telescopes can go a bit into the near-infrared, but the question specifies \"optical\" so I'll stick to 700 nm as the upper limit.\n\nSo \u03bb_rest is 1216 Angstroms. So 1216 * (1 + z) = 7000.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud, which is at a certain redshift. The quasar itself is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the hydrogen cloud is between us and the quasar. The quasar's light, when it passes through the cloud, has the Lyman alpha line absorbed. The absorption line is at the rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. But from our perspective, that line is redshifted by the cloud's redshift.\n\nWait, but to observe this absorption line, the wavelength after redshift must be in the visible spectrum. So the cloud's redshift z must satisfy 1216 * (1 + z) <= 7000 Angstroms? Or wait, because if the cloud is at a higher redshift, the absorption line is further into the red. But if the cloud is too far (high z), the Lyman alpha line could be beyond the visible spectrum, so we can't detect it.\n\nSo the maximum redshift for which the Lyman alpha line is still in the visible is when 1216*(1+z) = 7000.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1 + z = 7000 / 1216 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\n7000 divided by 1216. Hmm, 1216 *5 is 6080. 7000-6080=920. 1216*0.75 is about 912 (since 1216 *0.7=851.2, 0.05 is 60.8; so 851.2+60.8=912). So 5.75 would give 6080 + 912=6992. Close to 7000. So 5.75 gives 6992, which is just under 7000. So 5.75 is approximately 5.75.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute it more accurately. 7000 / 1216.\n\n1216 *5 =6080. 7000-6080=920. 920 /1216= approx 0.7568. So total z= 5.7568. So z \u22485.76.\n\nWait, that's way higher than any of the options given. The options are up to 3. So I must be missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the situation wrong. Let me think again. The quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. The quasar is at a redshift z_q, and the cloud is at a lower redshift z_c. So the Lyman alpha absorption line in the cloud is at wavelength 1216*(1+z_c) Angstroms.\n\nBut for that line to be in the observed frame, and for ground-based optical telescopes to detect it, it must be within the optical window. So the wavelength must be less than about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms), because beyond that, it's infrared, which isn't captured by optical telescopes.\n\nSo the maximum allowed wavelength is 7000 Angstroms. So the redshift z_c must satisfy 1216*(1+z_c) \u22647000.\n\nSo 1+z_c =7000/1216\u22485.7568. So z_c\u22484.7568.\n\nWait, but the options don't have anything near 4.75. The highest is option A)3. So perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm thinking about it the wrong way. The quasar's own emission is redshifted, but the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z_c), and that's what we're observing.\n\nWait, but the quasar's light is so bright, but the absorption is from intervening hydrogen. So the absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_c). If z_c is too high, then 1216*(1 + z_c) would be longer than 7000 Angstroms, making it infrared. So the maximum z_c that keeps the absorption line within optical is when 1216*(1+z_c) =7000.\n\nSo z_c= (7000/1216) -1\u22485.7568. So anything lower than that would have the absorption line in the optical.\n\nBut the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, wait, no. The lower limit would be the smallest redshift where the absorption is still in the optical. Because if the cloud is at a lower redshift, the absorption line is at a shorter wavelength, which is in the UV. But ground-based optical telescopes can't see UV, so we can't detect it. So for us to see the absorption line, the redshift must be such that 1216*(1+z_c) \u22647000.\n\nWait, but if the cloud is at z=0, the absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), which is in the far UV. Optical telescopes can't see that. So the cloud must be at a high enough redshift that the absorption line is in the visible range.\n\nWait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So the lower limit on redshift would be the smallest z_c where 1216*(1 +z_c) is in the visible range. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.\n\nIf z_c is high, the absorption line is redshifted into the visible. So the minimal z_c is the smallest z where the absorption line enters the visible.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, the absorption line shifts to longer wavelengths as z_c increases. So the minimum redshift is the smallest z_c that brings the absorption line into the visible. Because for lower z, the line is in UV, which we can't see. So the minimal z_c is when 1216*(1+z_c) is just equal to 400 nm, which is the start of the optical (violet) range.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the minimal z_c such that the absorption line is in the optical. So, to have the Lyman alpha line in the observed optical (say, between 400 and 700 nm), the redshift must be such that 400 nm \u2264 1216*(1 + z_c) \u2264700 nm.\n\nWait, no, because 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So when the cloud is at redshift z_c, the observed wavelength is 121.6*(1+z_c) nm. We want this to be in the optical, say 400-700 nm.\n\nSo, 400 \u2264 121.6*(1 + z_c) \u2264700.\n\nSo, dividing all parts by 121.6:\n\n400/121.6 \u2264 (1 + z_c) \u2264700/121.6.\n\nCompute these:\n\n400 /121.6 = approx 3.29.\n\n700 /121.6 \u2248 5.756.\n\nSo (1 + z_c) must be between ~3.29 and ~5.756.\n\nSo z_c is between 2.29 and 4.756.\n\nSo the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. Now, looking at the options, the closest lower limit is 2.4 (option C) and 1.9 (option D). Wait, 2.29 is closer to 2.4 than 1.9. So the lower limit on the redshift is around 2.29, so the minimal z_c is about 2.3. So the lower limit would be 2.29, so the answer would be the smallest z that is above this, which is option C) 2.4.\n\nWait, but the question says 'lower limit on the redshift' of the object. So the objects (the hydrogen clouds) must have a redshift greater than or equal to z=2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So any cloud with z >=2.29 can be detected because the Lyman alpha line is in the optical.\n\nSo the question is asking for the lower limit, which is 2.29. Looking at the options, the only option higher than that is option C)2.4. But wait, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3, but the options don't have that. So the next higher option is 2.4, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I may have made a mistake here. Because the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the cloud's redshift is less than the quasar's. So the question is about the cloud's redshift. So when the cloud's redshift is such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is in the optical, which is 400-700 nm.\n\nSo the minimal redshift for the cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 400 nm.\n\nWait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) =4000.\n\nSo 1 + z_cloud =4000/1216\u22483.29.\n\nSo z_cloud\u22482.29.\n\nSo any cloud with z_cloud >=2.29 would have the absorption line in the optical. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3.\n\nLooking at the options, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nSo the minimal redshift is about 2.3, so the lower limit is 2.3. The options don't have 2.3, but option C is 2.4, which is the smallest option higher than 2.3. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3, so the minimal redshift is 2.3. Therefore, the correct answer would be the option just above that, which is C)2.4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the maximum wavelength observed is 700 nm (7000 Angstroms), so the maximum z is (7000/1216) -1\u22485.756. So any cloud with z_cloud <=5.756 would have the absorption line in the optical. But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift, which is the minimal z_cloud such that the absorption line is in the optical. So the minimal z is when the absorption line is at 400 nm.\n\nSo I think the lower limit is approximately 2.29, which is closest to option C)2.4.\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the quasar's own emission is at a higher redshift. For example, the quasar is at z_q, and the hydrogen cloud is at z_cloud. The absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. For the absorption line to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) <=7000 Angstroms.\n\nSo the maximum possible z_cloud is (7000/1216) -1\u22485.756. But the quasar must be at a higher redshift, so z_q > z_cloud.\n\nBut the question is about the lower limit of the cloud's redshift. So the minimal z_cloud is when the absorption line is just in the optical. So the minimal z_cloud is when the Lyman alpha is at 400 nm.\n\nSo z_cloud=(4000/1216) -1\u22483.29-1=2.29.\n\nSo the lower limit is z_cloud\u22482.29. So the minimal redshift is 2.29, which is about 2.3. The options given are 2.4 (C) and 1.9 (D). So 2.3 is between options C and D. The closest higher option is C)2.4.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)2.4.\n\n\nTo determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 \u00c5) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the situation as follows:\n\n1. **Key Concept**: The Lyman alpha absorption line at rest wavelength 1216 \u00c5 is redshifted to longer wavelengths due to the cloud's redshift \\( z \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects with ground-based optical telescopes. Let me try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.\n\nHmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet range, around 121.6 nm (since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm). But wait, wait, wait! No, wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, right? So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Oh wait, no, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So that's in the far ultraviolet. But optical telescopes can't see that because the atmosphere blocks UV light. So ground-based optical telescopes can't observe UV, so the light must be redshifted into the optical range.\n\nSo the idea is that the quasar emits light at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), but due to the expansion of the universe, this wavelength is stretched. The cloud's hydrogen would absorb this light, creating a absorption line. But if the redshift is too high, the absorption line might shift into the infrared, which ground-based optical telescopes can't see. Wait, but wait, ground-based telescopes can observe visible light, which is 400-700 nm. So we need the absorbed wavelength to be in that range.\n\nSo the formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. Or z = (lambda_obs / lambda_emit) - 1.\n\nSo the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. Let's convert that to Angstroms for consistency: 1216 A is 121.6 nm. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing units. 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 A is 121.6 nm. So emitted lambda is 1216 A.\n\nWe need the observed lambda to be in the optical range, say up to 700 nm (since beyond that is infrared and optical is up to about 700 nm). Wait, but optical is roughly 400-700 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 700 nm, then what's the redshift?\n\nWait, let me do the calculation. Let's set lambda_obs to be 700 nm. But wait, 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. Because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. Oh right! So 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms.\n\nSo z = (7000 A / 1216 A) -1 = (7000 / 1216) -1 \u2248 let me calculate that.\n\n7000 divided by 1216 is approximately 5.758. So 5.758 minus 1 is 4.758. So z \u2248 4.76.\n\nWait, but that's the redshift when the Lyman alpha line is at 700 nm. But ground-based optical telescopes can only observe up to about 700 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 700 nm, the redshift is about 4.76. So any object with a redshift higher than that would have the Lyman alpha line in the infrared, which optical telescopes can't see. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift would be when the Lyman alpha line is just at the upper limit of optical, which is about 700 nm.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the lower limit is the minimum redshift where the object can be detected. But if the redshift is too low, the Lyman alpha line might be in the UV, which optical telescopes can't see. So the minimum redshift is when the Lyman alpha is redshifted into the optical window. So for example, when the observed wavelength is 400 nm (the lower end of optical), but wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.\n\nSo let's calculate that. lambda_obs = 400 nm = 4000 A.\n\nz = (4000 / 1216) - 1 \u2248 3.29 -1 = 2.29. So z \u2248 2.29.\n\nSo if the redshift is higher than 2.29, the Lyman alpha would be in the optical range. Because when z is 2.29, the observed wavelength is 4000 A (400 nm), which is violet, still in the optical. So if the redshift is higher than that, the wavelength is longer than 400 nm, which is visible.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. So the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 A, but due to redshift, the absorption line is observed at a longer wavelength. So for the absorption to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be between 4000 A (400 nm) and 7000 A (700 nm). So the redshift z must be such that lambda_obs >= 4000 A.\n\nSo solving for z: z = (lambda_obs / 1216) -1 >= (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 3.29 -1 = 2.29.\n\nSo the minimum redshift (lower limit) is when z is about 2.29. So any z above that would have the absorption line in the optical.\n\nBut looking at the options: the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nSo 2.29 is close to option C) 2.4, but perhaps the reasoning is that the upper limit is 7000 A, which gives a higher z.\n\nWait, but if the redshift is higher than 2.29, the absorption line would be in the optical. So the lower limit on z is 2.29. So the minimum z is about 2.3, but the question says to estimate the lower limit. So if the redshift is lower than 2.29, the line would be in the UV, which optical telescopes can't see. So the lower limit is z=2.29, meaning any object with z >=2.29 can be detected.\n\nSo the question is asking for the lower limit, meaning the smallest z for which it's detectable. So the lower limit is about 2.29, so any higher z would be detectable. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3, so the lower limit is z=2.3.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is C)2.4, but wait, perhaps the actual calculation is a bit different.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the limit of the optical telescope. Do optical telescopes cover up to 700 nm or perhaps a bit beyond? Because sometimes near-infrared is considered, but no, the question says optical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is in the rest frame of the cloud. So the quasar is at a higher redshift, and the cloud is in front, so the cloud's own redshift is z_cloud, and the quasar is at a higher redshift, z_quasar.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the clouds are absorbing the quasar's light. So the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. So the Lyman alpha line is absorbed by the cloud, which is at a lower redshift than the quasar.\n\nBut in any case, for the absorption line to be in the optical, the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216 A*(1 + z_cloud) is within the optical range.\n\nSo for the cloud's redshift, if the absorption line is at 4000 A (400 nm), then z_cloud = (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 3.29 -1 = 2.29.\n\nSo the cloud's redshift must be at least 2.29 for the absorption line to be in the optical. So the lower limit on the cloud's redshift is about 2.3.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option C) 2.4.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps the quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's. So the quasar's light is at a higher redshift, so when the cloud absorbs at Lyman alpha, the wavelength observed is (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 A.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the quasar's light is redshifted, but the absorption occurs at the rest frame of the cloud. So the absorption line in the quasar's frame is at (1 + z_quasar) * (1216 A). But I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The quasar emits light with Lyman alpha at 1216 A in its own rest frame. But because the quasar is moving away, the wavelength we observe is (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 A. However, the neutral hydrogen cloud is between us and the quasar, so it's at a lower redshift. So the cloud's rest frame is such that the quasar's light is at (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 A, but the cloud's own Lyman alpha is at 1216 A in its rest frame.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think in terms of observed wavelengths. The quasar's Lyman alpha is at a wavelength lambda_quasar = 1216 A * (1 + z_quasar).\n\nThe neutral hydrogen cloud, which is at a redshift z_cloud, will absorb light at its own Lyman alpha, which in the cloud's rest frame is 1216 A. So in our observed frame, the absorption line is at lambda_cloud = 1216 A * (1 + z_cloud).\n\nBut the quasar's light is at a higher redshift. So the absorption line (which is in the quasar's light) is at lambda_abs = lambda_quasar * (1 + z_cloud_quasar) ? Wait, no. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the redshifts here.\n\nAlternatively, the cloud is at redshift z_cloud, and the quasar is at a higher redshift z_quasar. So the light from the quasar that we see has been redshifted by (1 + z_quasar). But the cloud, being at a lower redshift, will absorb at 1216 A in its frame, which corresponds to 1216 A * (1 + z_cloud) in our frame.\n\nSo for the absorption line to be in the optical, 1216 A * (1 + z_cloud) must be less than or equal to 7000 A (700 nm).\n\nSo 1216 (1 + z_cloud) <= 7000.\n\nSo 1 + z_cloud <= 7000 / 1216 \u2248 5.758.\n\nSo z_cloud <= 4.758.\n\nWait, but that's the upper limit on the cloud's redshift. But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift, so that the absorption is detected in optical. So the lower limit would be when the absorption line is at the lower end of the optical range, say 400 nm (4000 A).\n\nSo 1216 (1 + z_cloud) >= 4000.\n\nSo 1 + z_cloud >= 4000 / 1216 \u2248 3.29.\n\nSo z_cloud >= 2.29.\n\nSo the lower limit on the cloud's redshift is approximately 2.29. So the minimum redshift is around 2.3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the quasar's light is redshifted beyond the optical, but the absorption line is in the quasar's spectrum. Wait, no, the quasar's light is redshifted, but the absorption line from the intervening cloud is in the quasar's spectrum. So the absorption line is at a shorter wavelength than the quasar's emission.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nThe key point is that the Lyman alpha absorption line, at 1216 A, is redshifted into the optical range. So the observed wavelength must be between 4000 A (400 nm) and 7000 A (700 nm).\n\nSo for the observed wavelength lambda_obs = 1216 A * (1 + z) >= 4000 A.\n\nSo z >= (4000/1216) - 1 \u2248 3.29 -1 = 2.29.\n\nSo the minimum z is about 2.29. So the lower limit is z >= 2.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher value is 2.4 (option C). So the answer would be C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the quasar's redshift. Because if the quasar is at a higher redshift, but the absorption line from the cloud is at a lower redshift, but that doesn't affect our calculation here.\n\nWait, but the question is about the redshift of the objects, which are the clouds. So the clouds' redshift must be at least 2.29.\n\nSo the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\n2.29 is closest to 2.4 (option C). So the answer is C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 \u00c5) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the observed wavelength of the absorption line falls within the optical range (approximately 400\u2013700 nm, or 4000\u20137000 \u00c5).\n\nThe redshift formula is:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}} - 1\n\\]\n\nHere, the emitted wavelength is \\(\\lambda_{\\text{emit}} = 1216 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\), and the observed wavelength \\(\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}\\) must be within the optical range.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects with ground-based optical telescopes. Let me try to think it through step by step.\n\nThe question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.\n\nHmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet range, around 121.6 nm (since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm). But wait, wait, wait! No, wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, right? So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Oh wait, no, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So that's in the far ultraviolet. But optical telescopes can't see that because the atmosphere blocks UV light. So ground-based optical telescopes can't observe UV, so the light must be redshifted into the optical range.\n\nSo the idea is that the quasar emits light at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), but due to the expansion of the universe, this wavelength is stretched. The cloud's hydrogen would absorb this light, creating a absorption line. But if the redshift is too high, the absorption line might shift into the infrared, which ground-based optical telescopes can't see. Wait, but wait, ground-based telescopes can observe visible light, which is 400-700 nm. So we need the absorbed wavelength to be in that range.\n\nSo the formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. Or z = (lambda_obs / lambda_emit) - 1.\n\nSo the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. Let's convert that to Angstroms for consistency: 1216 A is 121.6 nm. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing units. 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 A is 121.6 nm. So emitted lambda is 1216 A.\n\nWe need the observed lambda to be in the optical range, say up to 700 nm (since beyond that is infrared and optical is up to about 700 nm). Wait, but optical is roughly 400-700 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 700 nm, then what's the redshift?\n\nWait, let me do the calculation. Let's set lambda_obs to be 700 nm. But wait, 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. Because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. Oh right! So 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms.\n\nSo z = (7000 A / 1216 A) -1 = (7000 / 1216) -1 \u2248 let me calculate that.\n\n7000 divided by 1216 is approximately 5.758. So 5.758 minus 1 is 4.758. So z \u2248 4.76.\n\nWait, but that's the redshift when the Lyman alpha line is at 700 nm. But ground-based optical telescopes can only observe up to about 700 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 700 nm, the redshift is about 4.76. So any object with a redshift higher than that would have the Lyman alpha line in the infrared, which optical telescopes can't see. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift would be when the Lyman alpha line is just at the upper limit of optical, which is about 700 nm.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the lower limit is the minimum redshift where the object can be detected. But if the redshift is too low, the Lyman alpha line might be in the UV, which optical telescopes can't see. So the minimum redshift is when the Lyman alpha is redshifted into the optical window. So for example, when the observed wavelength is 400 nm (the lower end of optical), but wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.\n\nSo let's calculate that. lambda_obs = 400 nm = 4000 A.\n\nz = (4000 / 1216) - 1 \u2248 3.29 -1 = 2.29. So z \u2248 2.29.\n\nSo if the redshift is higher than 2.29, the Lyman alpha would be in the optical range. Because when z is 2.29, the observed wavelength is 4000 A (400 nm), which is violet, still in the optical. So if the redshift is higher than that, the wavelength is longer than 400 nm, which is visible.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. So the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 A, but due to redshift, the absorption line is observed at a longer wavelength. So for the absorption to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be between 4000 A (400 nm) and 7000 A (700 nm). So the redshift z must be such that lambda_obs >= 4000 A.\n\nSo solving for z: z = (lambda_obs / 1216) -1 >= (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 3.29 -1 = 2.29.\n\nSo the minimum redshift (lower limit) is when z is about 2.29. So any z above that would have the absorption line in the optical.\n\nBut looking at the options: the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.\n\nSo 2.29 is close to option C) 2.4, but perhaps the reasoning is that the upper limit is 7000 A, which gives a higher z.\n\nWait, but if the redshift is higher than 2.29, the absorption line would be in the optical. So the lower limit on z is 2.29. So the minimum z is about 2.3, but the question says to estimate the lower limit. So if the redshift is lower than 2.29, the line would be in the UV, which optical telescopes can't see. So the lower limit is z=2.29, meaning any object with z >=2.29 can be detected.\n\nSo the question is asking for the lower limit, meaning the smallest z for which it's detectable. So the lower limit is about 2.29, so any higher z would be detectable. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3, so the lower limit is z=2.3.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is C)2.4, but wait, perhaps the actual calculation is a bit different.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the limit of the optical telescope. Do optical telescopes cover up to 700 nm or perhaps a bit beyond? Because sometimes near-infrared is considered, but no, the question says optical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is in the rest frame of the cloud. So the quasar is at a higher redshift, and the cloud is in front, so the cloud's own redshift is z_cloud, and the quasar is at a higher redshift, z_quasar.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the clouds are absorbing the quasar's light. So the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. So the Lyman alpha line is absorbed by the cloud, which is at a lower redshift than the quasar.\n\nBut in any case, for the absorption line to be in the optical, the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216 A*(1 + z_cloud) is within the optical range.\n\nSo for the cloud's redshift, if the absorption line is at 4000 A (400 nm), then z_cloud = (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 3.29 -1 = 2.29.\n\nSo the cloud's redshift must be at least 2.29 for the absorption line to be in the optical.

So the quasar's light is at a higher redshift, so when the cloud absorbs at Lyman alpha, the wavelength observed is (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 A.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.
