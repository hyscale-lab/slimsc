      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, the Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Oh wait, sigma is the Pauli vector, right? So sigma has components sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, each being the Pauli matrices.\n\nWait, what's the Pauli vector? Oh right, it's like a vector where each component is a Pauli matrix. So sigma \u00b7 n would be sigma_x * n_x + sigma_y * n_y + sigma_z * n_z. And n is a unit vector, so n_x squared plus n_y squared plus n_z squared equals 1.\n\nSo H is epsilon multiplied by that dot product. I need to find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian. Eigenvalues of H, okay. Since H is a 2x2 matrix because it's built from Pauli matrices, its eigenvalues should be something simple, like plus and minus something.\n\nI remember that for a Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are plus and minus 1. Because each Pauli matrix (like sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But wait, in this case, H is a combination of them. So how does that affect the eigenvalues?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the general form. Suppose H = a \u00b7 sigma, where a is a vector. Then what are the eigenvalues of H? Oh right, I think the eigenvalues are plus and minus the magnitude of a. Because H is a 2x2 matrix, and for such a matrix, the eigenvalues are sqrt(a_x\u00b2 + a_y\u00b2 + a_z\u00b2) times the Pauli matrices' eigenvalues. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.\n\nThe Pauli matrices are traceless and have determinant -I. So the eigenvalues of any linear combination would be \u00b1||a||, where ||a|| is the magnitude of the vector a. Because the trace is zero (since each Pauli matrix is traceless), and the determinant would be -(||a||^2). Because for a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues \u03bb and -\u03bb, the trace is zero and determinant is -\u03bb\u00b2.\n\nSo in this case, a is the vector multiplied by epsilon. Wait, no: H is \u03b5 times (sigma \u00b7 n). So sigma \u00b7 n is a vector in the direction of n with magnitude 1, since n is a unit vector. Because sigma \u00b7 n = sigma_x n_x + sigma_y n_y + sigma_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, the square of sigma \u00b7 n is (sigma_x n_x + ... )^2. When you square that, you get sigma_x^2 n_x^2 + sigma_y^2 n_y^2 + sigma_z^2 n_z^2 + cross terms. But sigma_i squared is I, the identity matrix, right? Because each Pauli matrix squared is I. So sigma_x^2 is I, same for sigma_y and sigma_z. So sigma \u00b7 n squared equals (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I = I, because n is a unit vector. So (sigma \u00b7 n)^2 = I.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of sigma \u00b7 n are plus and minus 1. Because when you square it, you get I, so the eigenvalues squared are 1, so the eigenvalues are \u00b11.\n\nSo H is epsilon multiplied by sigma \u00b7 n. So the eigenvalues of H would be epsilon multiplied by the eigenvalues of sigma \u00b7 n. So that's epsilon times plus 1 and epsilon times minus 1. So the eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. Option C has factors of hbar/2. Why would that be? Oh wait, wait, perhaps I'm forgetting something. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11, but their matrices are 2x2, so when you have an operator like sigma \u00b7 n, which is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are \u00b11. So when you multiply by epsilon, which has units of energy, the eigenvalues of H would be \u00b1epsilon.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. I think I might have confused the scaling. Because sometimes spin matrices have factors. Let me think: the Pauli matrices are dimensionless? Wait, no, in the context of spin, the spin operator is S = (\u210f/2) sigma. So the eigenvalues of S would be \u00b1\u210f/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = epsilon sigma \u00b7 n. So it's not scaled by \u210f/2, but by epsilon.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of H would be \u00b1epsilon.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B: +epsilon, -epsilon.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.\n\nThe problem says: Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n. Here, n is an arbitrary unit vector, \u03b5 is a constant with energy dimensions, and the components of \u03c3 are the Pauli spin matrices. The question is asking about the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian operator. The options are A through D, each with different possible eigenvalues.\n\nHmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems. The Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z, each of which is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be a combination of these three matrices multiplied by the components of the unit vector n. So, \u03c3 \u00b7 n = n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n). Since \u03b5 is an energy constant, and n is a unit vector, the direction of n doesn't affect the magnitude, only the direction of the spin component measured.\n\nWait, eigenvalues of a spin operator. I think the spin matrices have eigenvalues related to their respective components. For example, the spin operator S \u00b7 n, where S is the spin angular momentum, has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. But wait, in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given with the Pauli matrices, which are related to spin.\n\nWait, the Pauli matrices are \u03c3 = 2S/\u0127. So \u03c3 \u00b7 n = 2(S \u00b7 n)/\u0127. So the Hamiltonian H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be H = (2 \u03b5 / \u0127) (S \u00b7 n). \n\nWait, but S \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. So substituting that in, H would have eigenvalues (2 \u03b5 / \u0127) * (\u00b1 \u0127/2) ) = \u00b1 \u03b5.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Let me think again.\n\nThe Pauli matrices are \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z. Each has eigenvalues \u00b11. But when you take a linear combination, like \u03c3 \u00b7 n, the eigenvalues of that operator would be \u00b11, because each term in the combination squares to identity, but perhaps I should think in terms of the matrix representation.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to note that \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a vector in the space of 2x2 matrices, and for any unit vector n, \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a Hermitian matrix. The eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be \u00b11, because the trace is zero (since n is a unit vector and the diagonal elements of \u03c3 matrices are zero except \u03c3_z, which is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So for \u03c3 \u00b7 n, the trace would be n_z * Tr(\u03c3_z) = n_z * (1 -1) = 0. The eigenvalues must add up to zero, and be symmetric around zero. So they must be +1 and -1.\n\nBut wait, the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n). So the eigenvalues would be \u03b5 multiplied by the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So the eigenvalues would be \u00b1 \u03b5.\n\nLooking at the options, option B says +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. Option C is \u00b1 \u03b5 hbar/2. So why would that be?\n\nWait, wait. Let me think about the units. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless because they're matrix operators. So \u03b5 has dimensions of energy. So \u03c3 \u00b7 n is dimensionless, so H has energy dimension.\n\nWait, but the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n are \u00b11, so H's eigenvalues would be \u00b1\u03b5. So option B is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Maybe I'm missing a factor of \u0127 somewhere. Because in the spin operator, S = \u0127/2 \u03c3. So S \u00b7 n = (\u0127/2)(\u03c3 \u00b7 n). So if the Hamiltonian were H = \u03c9 S \u00b7 n, where \u03c9 is some energy-related constant, then the eigenvalues would be \u00b1 \u03c9 \u0127/2.\n\nBut in this problem, H is \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So if we substitute S = \u0127/2 \u03c3, then H = 2 \u03b5 (S \u00b7 n)/\u0127. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nWait, but the problem states that H is \u03b5 times \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So regardless of how S is defined, the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n are \u00b11, so H's eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u03b5. So that would make option B correct.\n\nWait, another approach: let's compute the eigenvalues directly. Let me choose a specific n for simplicity, say n along z-axis. So n = (0,0,1). Then \u03c3 \u00b7 n = \u03c3_z.\n\n\u03c3_z is the Pauli matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The eigenvalues of \u03c3_z are 1 and -1. So H would be \u03b5 \u03c3_z, so eigenvalues are \u03b5 * 1 and \u03b5 * (-1), so \u00b1 \u03b5. So yes, option B.\n\nAlternatively, if n were along x-axis, \u03c3 \u00b7 n = \u03c3_x, which has eigenvalues \u00b11. So same result.\n\nThus, the eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u03b5. So the correct answer is option B.\n",

So if we substitute S = \u0127/2 \u03c3, then H = 2 \u03b5 (S \u00b7 n)/\u0127. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nWait, but the problem states that H is \u03b5 times \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So regardless of how S is defined, the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n are \u00b11, so H's eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u03b5. So that would make option B correct.\n\nWait, another approach: let's compute the eigenvalues directly. Let me choose a specific n for simplicity, say n along z-axis. So n = (0,0,1). Then \u03c3 \u00b7 n = \u03c3_z.\n\n\u03c3_z is the Pauli matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The eigenvalues of \u03c3_z are 1 and -1. So H would be \u03b5 \u03c3_z, so eigenvalues are \u03b5 * 1 and \u03b5 * (-1), so \u00b1 \u03b5. So yes, option B.\n\nAlternatively, if n were along x-axis, \u03c3 \u00b7 n = \u03c3_x, which has eigenvalues \u00b11. So same result.\n\nThus, the eigenvalues are \u00b1 \u03b5. So the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nThe Hamiltonian operator is given as \\( H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\), where \\( \\vec{n} \\) is an arbitrary unit vector, \\( \\varepsilon \\) is an energy constant, and \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\) represents the Pauli spin matrices. The task is to determine the eigenvalues of \\( H \\).\n\nThe Pauli matrices (\\( \\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z \\)) are Hermitian and have eigenvalues \\( \\pm 1 \\). The dot product \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \\( \\vec{n} \\). Since \\( \\vec{n} \\) is a unit vector, \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\) is also Hermitian and has eigenvalues \\( \\pm 1 \\).\n\nThe Hamiltonian \\( H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\) is proportional to \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\), with the proportionality constant \\( \\varepsilon \\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \\( H \\) are simply \\( \\varepsilon \\) multiplied by the eigenvalues of \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\), which are \\( \\pm 1 \\). This gives the eigenvalues of \\( H \\) as \\( \\pm \\varepsilon \\).\n\nTo confirm, consider specific cases:\n1. If \\( \\vec{n} \\) is along the \\( z \\)-axis (\\( n = (0, 0, 1) \\)), then \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\sigma_z \\), which has eigenvalues \\( \\pm 1 \\). Thus, \\( H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_z \\) has eigenvalues \\( \\pm \\varepsilon \\).\n2. Similarly, if \\( \\vec{n} \\) is along the \\( x \\)-axis (\\( n = (1, 0, 0) \\)), \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\sigma_x \\), which also has eigenvalues \\( \\pm 1 \\). Hence, \\( H = \\varepsilon \\sigma_x \\) has eigenvalues \\( \\pm \\varepsilon \\).\n\nIn all cases, the eigenvalues of \\( H \\) are \\( \\pm \\varepsilon \\). This matches option B.\n\nAnswer: B",

Oh right, if you have a vector multiplied by the Pauli matrices, like a\u00b7\u03c3 where a is a vector, then the eigenvalues are \u00b1|a|. Because the square of a\u00b7\u03c3 is (a\u00b7\u03c3)^2 = a\u00b2 I, where I is the identity matrix. So the eigenvalues of a\u00b7\u03c3 are \u00b1|a|.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.

So \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be nx\u03c3x + ny\u03c3y + nz\u03c3z, right?\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix... I think each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Oh wait, but wait, when you have a matrix like a\u03c3 \u00b7 n, where a is a scalar, then the eigenvalues would be a times the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. Because if you have an operator like A = a * B, where B has eigenvalues \u03bb, then A has eigenvalues a*\u03bb.\n\nSo \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a vector of Pauli matrices dotted with n. Since n is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n should be +1 and -1. Because any Pauli matrix has those eigenvalues, and their linear combination here (dot product) would also have the same eigenvalues. Because the Pauli matrices are all Hermitian and have eigenvalues \u00b11, regardless of their orientation.\n\nSo the Hamiltonian H is \u03b5 times that operator. So the eigenvalues of H would be \u03b5 multiplied by the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. Which would be \u03b5*(+1) and \u03b5*(-1), so +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. Option C has \u03b5 multiplied by hbar over 2, which doesn't sound right because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11, not \u00b1hbar/2. Oh wait, wait a second. Do the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11 or \u00b1hbar/2? Because I think I might be mixing up some concepts here.\n\nWait, no. The Pauli matrices themselves, when multiplied by some constants, represent spin operators. Spin operators have eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2. For example, the spin operator S is (\u0127/2) \u03c3. So \u03c3 would have eigenvalues \u00b11 in that case. So if H is \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, then the eigenvalues would be \u03b5*(\u00b11), which is \u00b1\u03b5. But wait, if H is the Hamiltonian, which is an energy operator, then its eigenvalues should have units of energy. Let's check the units of each option.\n\n\u03b5 is given as an energy constant. So option B's eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5, which has units of energy. Option C has \u03b5 multiplied by \u0127/2. Since \u0127 has units of J\u00b7s, but \u03b5 is energy, so \u03b5 * \u0127 has units of J\u00b7s * J, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, because if \u03b5 is energy (J), then \u03b5 * \u0127/2 would be J * (J\u00b7s)/2, which is (J\u00b2\u00b7s)/2. That's not energy. So option C's units don't make sense, so it's not the right answer.\n\nSo the correct eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5, which is option B.\n",

Let me think about what I remember from my studies.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given as H = \u03b5\u03c3\u00b7n, where \u03c3 is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, n is a unit vector, and \u03b5 is an energy constant. Hmm, Pauli matrices... I remember that the Pauli matrices are \u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z. So \u03c3\u00b7n would be the dot product, which would be n_x \u03c3x + n_y \u03c3y + n_z \u03c3z. \n\nEigenvalues of a Pauli matrix... wait, each Pauli matrix individually has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But wait, in this case, the Hamiltonian is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. So, the operator H is proportional to a Pauli matrix in some direction n.\n\nWait, the general form for a spin operator is something like H = w\u00b7S, where w is a vector. And for spin-1/2 particles, S is (\u0127/2)\u03c3. So if the Hamiltonian is proportional to \u03c3\u00b7n, then perhaps the eigenvalues relate to the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices multiplied by some factor.\n\nBut wait, the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues \u00b11. So if H is \u03b5 times \u03c3\u00b7n, which is a vector of Pauli matrices dotted with a unit vector n, then \u03c3\u00b7n is a 2x2 matrix whose eigenvalues are \u00b11. Because any Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, and any linear combination like \u03c3\u00b7n (since n is a unit vector) would also have eigenvalues \u00b11, right?\n\nWait, let me think again. The operator \u03c3\u00b7n is a matrix. Let's call it A. The eigenvalues of A are the solutions to det(A - \u03bbI) = 0. But since A is a real 2x2 matrix, and trace is zero (since the diagonal elements are zero for \u03c3\u00b7n when n is a unit vector?), wait, no. Let me compute the trace. The Pauli matrices each have trace zero. So if A is a linear combination, like n_x \u03c3x + n_y \u03c3y + n_z \u03c3z, the trace is n_x * Tr(\u03c3x) + ... etc. But each \u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z has trace zero, so the trace of A is zero. \n\nThe eigenvalues of A must satisfy \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 = 0 (since trace is sum of eigenvalues), and \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 = determinant. What's the determinant of A? For a 2x2 matrix, determinant is (Tr(A)^2 - Tr(A^2)) / 4, but Tr(A) is zero. So determinant is (- Tr(A\u00b2)) /4. Wait, I'm not sure about that formula. Alternatively, for any 2x2 matrix, the determinant is (\u03bb1)(\u03bb2) = (Tr(A)^2 - Tr(A^2))/4? Hmm, I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should compute A squared.\n\nWait, A is \u03c3\u00b7n. Let's compute A\u00b2. A\u00b2 = (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2. Since \u03c3i are Pauli matrices, I remember that \u03c3i \u03c3j = \u03b4ij I + i \u03b5ijk \u03c3k. So, (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = (n_x \u03c3x + n_y \u03c3y + n_z \u03c3z)^2. Expanding that, each \u03c3i \u03c3i term is I (since \u03c3i\u00b2 = I for each i), and the cross terms will involve \u03c3i \u03c3j where i\u2260j. But when you square, each term comes twice. Let's see: (n_x \u03c3x + n_y \u03c3y + n_z \u03c3z)^2 = n_x\u00b2 \u03c3x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 \u03c3y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 \u03c3z\u00b2 + n_x n_y \u03c3x \u03c3y + n_x n_y \u03c3y \u03c3x + n_x n_z \u03c3x \u03c3z + n_x n_z \u03c3z \u03c3x + n_y n_z \u03c3y \u03c3z + n_y n_z \u03c3z \u03c3y.\n\nEach \u03c3i\u00b2 is I, so the first three terms are n_x\u00b2 I + n_y\u00b2 I + n_z\u00b2 I. The cross terms: \u03c3x \u03c3y = i \u03c3z, \u03c3y \u03c3x = -i \u03c3z. So n_x n_y (i \u03c3z -i \u03c3z) )= 0? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute each cross term. \n\nn_x n_y \u03c3x \u03c3y = n_x n_y i \u03c3z, and n_x n_y \u03c3y \u03c3x = n_x n_y (-i \u03c3z). Adding them together gives n_x n_y i \u03c3z + n_x n_y (-i \u03c3z) = 0. Similarly for all other cross terms. So the cross terms cancel out. Therefore, A\u00b2 = (n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2) I. But since n is a unit vector, n_x\u00b2 +n_y\u00b2 +n_z\u00b2 = 1. So A\u00b2 = I. \n\nSo A squared is the identity matrix. Therefore, the eigenvalues of A must satisfy \u03bb\u00b2 = 1. So \u03bb can be +1 or -1. \n\nThus, the eigenvalues of A (which is \u03c3\u00b7n) are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H, which is \u03b5 times A, would be \u03b5*1 and \u03b5*(-1), so +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is \"+\u03b5, -\u03b5\". So the correct answer should be B. \n\nWait, but I thought the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11. So when multiplied by \u03b5, the eigenvalues would be \u00b1\u03b5. That makes sense.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given as H = \u03b5\u03c3\u00b7n, where \u03c3 is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, n is a unit vector, and \u03b5 is an energy constant. Hmm, Pauli matrices... I remember that the Pauli matrices are \u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z. So \u03c3\u00b7n would be the dot product, which would be n_x \u03c3x + n_y \u03c3y + n_z \u03c3z. \n\nEigenvalues of a Pauli matrix... wait, each Pauli matrix individually has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But wait, in this case, the Hamiltonian is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. So, the operator H is proportional to a Pauli matrix in some direction n.\n\nWait, the general form for a spin operator is something like H = w\u00b7S, where w is a vector. And for spin-1/2 particles, S is (\u0127/2)\u03c3. So if the Hamiltonian is proportional to \u03c3\u00b7n, then perhaps the eigenvalues relate to the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices multiplied by some factor.\n\nBut wait, the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues \u00b11. So if H is \u03b5 times \u03c3\u00b7n, which is a vector of Pauli matrices dotted with a unit vector n, then \u03c3\u00b7n is a 2x2 matrix whose eigenvalues are \u00b11. Because any Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, and any linear combination like \u03c3\u00b7n (since n is a unit vector) would also have eigenvalues \u00b11, right?\n\nWait, let me think again. The operator \u03c3\u00b7n is a matrix. Let's call it A. The eigenvalues of A are the solutions to det(A - \u03bbI) = 0. But since A is a real 2x2 matrix, and trace is zero (since the diagonal elements are zero for \u03c3\u00b7n when n is a unit vector?), wait, no. Let me compute the trace. The Pauli matrices each have trace zero. So if A is a linear combination, like n_x \u03c3x + n_y \u03c3y + n_z \u03c3z, the trace is n_x * Tr(\u03c3x) + ... etc. But each \u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z has trace zero, so the trace of A is zero. \n\nThe eigenvalues of A must satisfy \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 = 0 (since trace is sum of eigenvalues), and \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 = determinant. What's the determinant of A? For a 2x2 matrix, determinant is (Tr(A)^2 - Tr(A^2)) / 4, but Tr(A) is zero. So determinant is (- Tr(A\u00b2)) /4. Wait, I'm not sure about that formula. Alternatively, for any 2x2 matrix, the determinant is (\u03bb1)(\u03bb2) = (Tr(A)^2 - Tr(A^2))/4? Hmm, I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should compute A squared.\n\nWait, A is \u03c3\u00b7n. Let's compute A\u00b2. A\u00b2 = (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2. Since \u03c3i are Pauli matrices, I remember that \u03c3i \u03c3j = \u03b4ij I + i \u03b5ijk \u03c3k. So, (\u03c3\u00b7n)^2 = (n_x \u03c3x + n_y \u03c3y + n_z \u03c3z)^2. Expanding that, each \u03c3i \u03c3i term is I (since \u03c3i\u00b2 = I for each i), and the cross terms will involve \u03c3i \u03c3j where i\u2260j. But when you square, each term comes twice. Let's see: (n_x \u03c3x + n_y \u03c3y + n_z \u03c3z)^2 = n_x\u00b2 \u03c3x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 \u03c3y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 \u03c3z\u00b2 + n_x n_y \u03c3x \u03c3y + n_x n_y \u03c3y \u03c3x + n_x n_z \u03c3x \u03c3z + n_x n_z \u03c3z \u03c3x + n_y n_z \u03c3y \u03c3z + n_y n_z \u03c3z \u03c3y.\n\nEach \u03c3i\u00b2 is I, so the first three terms are n_x\u00b2 I + n_y\u00b2 I + n_z\u00b2 I. The cross terms: \u03c3x \u03c3y = i \u03c3z, \u03c3y \u03c3x = -i \u03c3z. So n_x n_y (i \u03c3z -i \u03c3z) )= 0? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute each cross term. \n\nn_x n_y \u03c3x \u03c3y = n_x n_y i \u03c3z, and n_x n_y \u03c3y \u03c3x = n_x n_y (-i \u03c3z). Adding them together gives n_x n_y i \u03c3z + n_x n_y (-i \u03c3z) = 0. Similarly for all other cross terms. So the cross terms cancel out. Therefore, A\u00b2 = (n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2) I. But since n is a unit vector, n_x\u00b2 +n_y\u00b2 +n_z\u00b2 = 1. So A\u00b2 = I. \n\nSo A squared is the identity matrix. Therefore, the eigenvalues of A must satisfy \u03bb\u00b2 = 1. So \u03bb can be +1 or -1. \n\nThus, the eigenvalues of A (which is \u03c3\u00b7n) are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H, which is \u03b5 times A, would be \u03b5*1 and \u03b5*(-1), so +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is \"+\u03b5, -\u03b5\".

But wait, that's for each individual Pauli matrix. But when you have a linear combination like \u03c3 \u00b7 n, what are its eigenvalues?\n\nWait, n is a unit vector, so n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2 =1. So the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a combination of the Pauli matrices, each scaled by n's components.\n\nI recall that for any unit vector n, the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues \u00b11. Because, think about it, the Pauli matrices are spin operators. The eigenvalue equation for \u03c3 \u00b7 n would be \u03c3 \u00b7 n |\u03c8> = \u03bb |\u03c8>, where \u03bb is \u00b11.

For any unit vector \\( \\vec{n} \\), the eigenvalues of \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\) are \\( \\pm 1 \\), as the spin-1/2 system can only have eigenvalues \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\) for this operator.\n\nSince the Hamiltonian \\( H \\) is \\( \\varepsilon \\) times \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\), the eigenvalues of \\( H \\) are simply \\( \\varepsilon \\) times the eigenvalues of \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \\( H \\) are \\( +\\varepsilon \\) and \\( -\\varepsilon \\).\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n- **Option A**: \\( +1, -1 \\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \\( \\varepsilon \\).\n- **Option B**: \\( +\\varepsilon, -\\varepsilon \\) is correct, as derived above.\n- **Option C**: \\( +\\varepsilon \\hbar/2, -\\varepsilon \\hbar/2 \\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\) are \\( \\pm 1 \\), not \\( \\pm \\hbar/2 \\).\n- **Option D**: \\( +\\hbar/2, -\\hbar/2 \\) is incorrect because it does not involve \\( \\varepsilon \\) and is unrelated to the given Hamiltonian.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B**, as the eigenvalues of \\( H \\) are \\( +\\varepsilon \\) and \\( -\\varepsilon \\).\n\nAnswer: B",
