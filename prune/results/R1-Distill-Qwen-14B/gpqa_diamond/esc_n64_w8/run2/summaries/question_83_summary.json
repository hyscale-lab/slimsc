      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.\n\nHmm. Right, so first, I should probably figure out what happens when we mix the acetic acid with water. Dilution changes the concentration, so I need to calculate the new concentration after mixing.\n\nLet me think about the dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm\u00b3, and we add 20 cm\u00b3 of water. So the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity \u00d7 Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, after dilution, the new concentration is moles / total volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, wait, 0.001 divided by 0.04 is 0.025. So the concentration becomes 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. 20 cm\u00b3 is 0.02 L. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Diluting into 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L) gives 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M. Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction will be CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O.\n\nAt 25% titration: That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So first, I need to find the equivalence point volume, then take 25% of that as the volume added for the first part.\n\nWait, let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will have reacted with NaOH. So moles of NaOH needed equals moles of acetic acid.\n\nMoles of acetic acid is 0.001 moles (from earlier). Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm\u00b3. So equivalence point is when 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added.\n\n25% titration would be 25% of 10 cm\u00b3, so 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.\n\nFirst, pH at 25% titration.\n\nAt 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions (CH3COO^-). Let's find the moles reacted.\n\nMoles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo, moles of acetic acid reacted: 0.00025 mol. So the initial moles were 0.001 mol. So remaining acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total solution volume after adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is 40 cm\u00b3 + 2.5 cm\u00b3 = 42.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0425 L).\n\nSo, the concentrations are:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, since acetic acid is a weak acid and we're dealing with a buffer solution (a mixture of acid and conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) \u2248 4.73 (since log(5.405)=0.732, so 4.732). Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, wait: pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nLog(1.85) is about 0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 10^-5.267. So pKa is 4.73 (since 5-0.267 is 4.733).\n\nSo pH = 4.73 + log( (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) )\n\nWait, but the [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) ) \u2192 the 0.0425 cancels out. So it's 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.\n\nSo log(1/3) is log(0.3333) \u2248 -0.477.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 - 0.477 \u2248 4.253. Hmm, that's around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So the first part would be 4.26.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. After adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH, moles of NaOH added is 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. So, the reaction converts 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.\n\nSo moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.\n\nTotal solution volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa + log ( [A^-]/[HA] )\n\nWhich is 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) \u2192 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.3333.\n\nSo log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So about 4.25. So the first pH is approximately 4.25, which matches option A's first value of 4.26.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will consist of the sodium acetate in solution, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic, because the acetate ion is a weak base.\n\nThe acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe concentration of acetate comes from the moles of NaOH added. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added are 0.001 mol (since initial acetic acid was 0.001 mol). The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 (from equivalence point) = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nWait, no, wait: Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C. So Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nNow, to find the pH, we can set up the hydrolysis equation. Let's denote [CH3COO^-] as 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.\n\nThe hydrolysis equation is:\n\nCH3COO^- \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe expression for Kb is ( [CH3COOH][OH^-] ) / [CH3COO^-] ) \u2248 x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small (5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = Kb * 0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 1.04e-5 M \u2192 pOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98 \u2192 pH = 14 - 4.98 \u2248 9.02.\n\nWait, that's about 9.02, but looking at the options, the equivalence point pHs are varying.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute Kb.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 pKa \u2248 4.73. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10, yes.\n\nWait, but when I compute x\u00b2 = Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2192 Let me compute that accurately.\n\nsqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * 1e-5.5 \u2192 sqrt(1.081) \u2248 1.04, so 1.04e-5.5 \u2192 Wait, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6? No, wait, 1e-5 is 1e-5, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-5.5 is approx 3.16e-6.\n\nWait, but 1e-5.5 is sqrt(1e-11) = 1e-5.5 = 3.16e-6.\n\nSo 1.04 * 3.16e-6 \u2248 3.27e-6 M. Wait, that can't be right, because 1.081e-11 is 1.081 x 10^-11. So sqrt(1.081e-11) is sqrt(1.081)*sqrt(1e-11) \u2192 approx 1.04 * 1e-5.5. Wait, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6, so 1.04 * 3.16e-6 \u2248 3.27e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 3.27e-6 \u2192 pOH = -log(3.27e-6) \u2248 5.48 \u2192 pH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\nHmm, that's around 8.52, which matches option A's second value of 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. Did I miscalculate the Kb?\n\nWait, Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * (1e-14 / 1e-5) ) \u2192 1e-9 / 1.85 \u2192 0.5405e-9 \u2192 5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation for x is sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) \u2192 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. sqrt(1.081e-11) is about 1.04e-5.5 \u2192 1e-5.5 is approximately 3.16e-6. So 1.04 * 3.16e-6 \u2248 3.27e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.27e-6 \u2192 pOH is about 5.48 \u2192 pH 8.52.\n\nSo for the equivalence point, pH is around 8.52.\n\nSo putting it together, the pH at 25% titration is about 4.25, and at equivalence point about 8.52. Looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 4.26; 8.52 \u2192 which matches.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the 25% titration part. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. When 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH is added, the moles of NaOH are 0.0025 L \u00d7 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo the moles of acetic acid react as follows:\n\nCH3COOH + OH^- \u2192 CH3COO^- + H2O.\n\nSo moles of CH3COOH before reaction: 0.001 mol.\n\nMoles reacted: 0.00025 mol \u2192 so moles remaining: 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 2.5 cm\u00b3 = 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa + log( [A^-]/[HA] ) \u2192 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) \u2192 0.005882/0.017647 \u2248 0.3333.\n\nlog(0.3333) \u2248 -0.477. So 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So pH \u22484.25. So option A's first value is 4.26, which is close enough.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is approximately 4.25, and equivalence point is 8.52. So the correct option is A.\n\nBut wait, let me check the other options. Option D is 4.57; 6.92. That would be if we were using the initial concentration without dilution. Wait, no, because in this problem, we diluted first, so the initial concentration is lower.\n\nWait, another thought: when you dilute a weak acid, the pH doesn't drop as much as a strong acid would. But in this case, since we're adding a base, the buffer calculation is correct.\n\nWait, another thing to consider: Did I calculate the equivalence point correctly?\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is 0.001 mol in 50 cm\u00b3 (0.05 L). So 0.02 M acetate.\n\nThen, the Kb is 5.405e-10, as before.\n\nSo the calculation for [OH^-] is correct, leading to pH 8.52.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.\n\nHmm. Right, so first, I should probably figure out what happens when we mix the acetic acid with water. Dilution changes the concentration, so I need to calculate the new concentration after mixing.\n\nLet me think about the dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm\u00b3, and we add 20 cm\u00b3 of water. So the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity \u00d7 Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, after dilution, the new concentration is moles / total volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, wait, 0.001 divided by 0.04 is 0.025. So the concentration becomes 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. 20 cm\u00b3 is 0.02 L. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Diluting into 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L) gives 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M. Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction will be CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O.\n\nAt 25% titration: That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So first, I need to find the equivalence point volume, then take 25% of that as the volume added for the first part.\n\nWait, let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will have reacted with NaOH. So moles of NaOH needed equals moles of acetic acid.\n\nMoles of acetic acid is 0.001 moles (from earlier). Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm\u00b3. So equivalence point is when 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added.\n\n25% titration would be 25% of 10 cm\u00b3, so 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.\n\nFirst, pH at 25% titration.\n\nAt 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions (CH3COO^-). Let's find the moles reacted.\n\nMoles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo, moles of acetic acid reacted: 0.00025 mol. So the initial moles were 0.001 mol. So remaining acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total solution volume after adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is 40 cm\u00b3 + 2.5 cm\u00b3 = 42.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0425 L).\n\nSo, the concentrations are:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, since acetic acid is a weak acid and we're dealing with a buffer solution (a mixture of acid and conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) \u2248 4.73 (since log(5.405)=0.732, so 4.732). Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, wait: pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nLog(1.85) is about 0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 10^-5.267. So pKa is 4.73 (since 5-0.267 is 4.733).\n\nSo pH = 4.73 + log( (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) )\n\nWait, but the [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) ) \u2192 the 0.0425 cancels out. So it's 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.\n\nSo log(1/3) is log(0.3333) \u2248 -0.477.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 - 0.477 \u2248 4.253. Hmm, that's around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So the first part would be 4.26.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. After adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH, moles of NaOH added is 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. So, the reaction converts 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.\n\nSo moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.\n\nTotal solution volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa + log ( [A^-]/[HA] )\n\nWhich is 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) \u2192 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.3333.\n\nSo log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So about 4.25. So the first pH is approximately 4.25, which matches option A's first value of 4.26.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point?\n\nAt equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will consist of the sodium acetate in solution, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic, because the acetate ion is a weak base.\n\nThe acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe concentration of acetate comes from the moles of NaOH added. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added are 0.001 mol (since initial acetic acid was 0.001 mol). The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 (from equivalence point) = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nWait, no, wait: Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C. So Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nNow, to find the pH, we can set up the hydrolysis equation. Let's denote [CH3COO^-] as 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.\n\nThe hydrolysis equation is:\n\nCH3COO^- \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe expression for Kb is ( [CH3COOH][OH^-] ) / [CH3COO^-] ) \u2248 x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small (5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = Kb * 0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 1.04e-5 M \u2192 pOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98 \u2192 pH = 14 - 4.98 \u2248 9.02.\n\nWait, that's about 9.02, but looking at the options, the equivalence point pHs are varying.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute Kb.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 pKa \u2248 4.73. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10, yes.\n\nWait, but when I compute x\u00b2 = Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2192 Let me compute that accurately.\n\nsqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * 1e-5.5 \u2192 sqrt(1.081) \u2248 1.04, so 1.04e-5.5 \u2192 Wait, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6? No, wait, 1e-5 is 1e-5, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-5.5 is approx 3.16e-6.\n\nWait, but 1e-5.5 is sqrt(1e-11) = 1e-5.5 = 3.16e-6.\n\nSo 1.04 * 3.16e-6 \u2248 3.27e-6 M. Wait, that can't be right, because 1.081e-11 is 1.081 x 10^-11. So sqrt(1.081e-11) is sqrt(1.081)*sqrt(1e-11) \u2192 approx 1.04 * 1e-5.5. Wait, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6, so 1.04 * 3.16e-6 \u2248 3.27e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 3.27e-6 \u2192 pOH = -log(3.27e-6) \u2248 5.48 \u2192 pH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\nHmm, that's around 8.52, which matches option A's second value of 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. Did I miscalculate the Kb?\n\nWait, Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * (1e-14 / 1e-5) ) \u2192 1e-9 / 1.85 \u2192 0.5405e-9 \u2192 5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation for x is sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) \u2192 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. sqrt(1.081e-11) is about 1.04e-5.5 \u2192 1e-5.5 is approximately 3.16e-6. So 1.04 * 3.16e-6 \u2248 3.27e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.27e-6 \u2192 pOH is about 5.48 \u2192 pH 8.52.\n\nSo for the equivalence point, pH is around 8.52.\n\nSo putting it together, the pH at 25% titration is about 4.25, and at equivalence point about 8.52. Looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 4.26; 8.52 \u2192 which matches.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the 25% titration part. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. When 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH is added, the moles of NaOH are 0.0025 L \u00d7 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo the moles of acetic acid react as follows:\n\nCH3COOH + OH^- \u2192 CH3COO^- + H2O.\n\nSo moles of CH3COOH before reaction: 0.001 mol.\n\nMoles reacted: 0.00025 mol \u2192 so moles remaining: 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 2.5 cm\u00b3 = 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa + log( [A^-]/[HA] ) \u2192 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) \u2192 0.005882/0.017647 \u2248 0.3333.\n\nlog(0.3333) \u2248 -0.477. So 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So pH \u22484.25. So option A's first value is 4.26, which is close enough.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is approximately 4.25, and equivalence point is 8.52. So the correct option is A.\n\nBut wait, let me check the other options. Option D is 4.57; 6.92. That would be if we were using the initial concentration without dilution. Wait, no, because in this problem, we diluted first, so the initial concentration is lower.\n\nWait, another thought: when you dilute a weak acid, the pH doesn't drop as much as a strong acid would. But in this case, since we're adding a base, the buffer calculation is correct.\n\nWait, another thing to consider: Did I calculate the equivalence point correctly?\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is 0.001 mol in 50 cm\u00b3 (0.05 L). So 0.02 M acetate.\n\nThen, the Kb is 5.405e-10, as before.\n\nSo the calculation for [OH^-] is correct, leading to pH 8.52.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm\u00b3 (0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M, giving moles of acetic acid as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.02 \\, \\text{L} = 0.001 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nAfter dilution with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). The new concentration is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \\frac{0.001 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.04 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.025 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\n### pH at 25% Titration\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.0025 \\, \\text{L} = 0.00025 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nThis reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \\, \\text{mol},\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of acetate ion formed} = 0.00025 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nThe total volume of the solution is now:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \\, \\text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \\, \\text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \\, \\text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \\, \\text{L}.\n\\]\n\nThe concentrations are:\n\n\\[\n[\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH}] = \\frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \\approx 0.017647 \\, \\text{M},\n\\]\n\\[\n[\\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^-] = \\frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \\approx 0.005882 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = \\text{p}K_a + \\log \\left( \\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} \\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\text{p}K_a = -\\log(1.85 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 4.73\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this should be a classic acid-base titration problem.\n\nAlright, let's break down the problem. We start with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm\u00b3. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Oh, right, 20 + 20 is 40, so the volume doubles. So the concentration after dilution would be half, right? Because concentration is moles over volume. So the original moles of acetic acid would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm\u00b3, the volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L), so the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.\n\nThen we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is to find the pH at 25% titration. Oh, 25% means we've added enough NaOH to neutralize 25% of the acetic acid. Let me think about the moles here. The moles of acetic acid initially after dilution are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed for 25% titration is 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe volume of NaOH needed would be moles divided by concentration. So 0.00025 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm\u00b3. But wait, maybe I don't need the volume right now. Let me think about what happens at 25% titration. At that point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate. So the solution will contain both acetic acid and acetate ions, making it a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). The pKa is given by the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) which is approximately 4.73, because I remember that acetic acid's pKa is around 4.76, but let me calculate it precisely.\n\nWait, 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4). Let me compute that. Log(5.405e4) is log(5.405) + 4. Log(5) is about 0.699, and 5.405 is a bit higher. Log(5.405) is approximately 0.7328. So pKa is 4.7328, which rounds to 4.73.\n\nNow, in the buffer solution, the moles of acetic acid and acetate. Initially, after dilution, we have 0.001 mol acetic acid. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol has been neutralized. So moles of HA (acetic acid) remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of A- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 mol.\n\nBut wait, when you dilute, the concentration changes. The total volume at 25% titration is the initial volume (40 cm\u00b3) plus the volume of NaOH added (2.5 cm\u00b3). Wait, 40 cm\u00b3 is 0.04 L, and 2.5 cm\u00b3 is 0.0025 L. So total volume is 0.0425 L. So the concentrations are [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 and [A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425.\n\nWait, but maybe I can calculate the ratio first. The ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.333) which is about -0.477. So pH = pKa + (-0.477) = 4.73 - 0.477 = approximately 4.253. Hmm, that's around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26, option D has 4.57. So perhaps 4.26 is the pH at 25% titration.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me re-calculate the ratio. At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So the ratio of acetate to acetic acid is 0.25 / (1 - 0.25) = 1/3. So yes, log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is approximately 4.25. So the first value is around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26, and option D is 4.57. So perhaps the first pH is 4.26.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So moles of NaOH needed would be equal to moles of acetic acid. Initially, after dilution, moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3. So total volume at equivalence is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 (0.05 L).\n\nThe reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so in solution, it will hydrolyze to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is moles / volume. Moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, volume is 0.05 L. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10. The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Let's set up the equation.\n\nLet x be [OH^-]. Then [CH3COOH] = x, and [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02).\n\nSo Kb \u2248 x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.\n\nSolving for x: x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let me calculate that. Log(3.288) is about 0.5166, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.5166 -6 = -5.4834. So pOH is 5.4834, so pH is 14 -5.4834 = 8.5166, approximately 8.52.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the Kb calculation again. Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. Let me compute that more accurately. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is 1/(1.85e5) * 1e-14/(1e-14) \u2192 wait, wait. Let me compute 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. 1e-14 is 0.0000000000001, and 1.85e-5 is 0.0000185. So 0.0000000000001 divided by 0.0000185 is approximately 5.405e-10, which is correct.\n\nSo, the [OH^-] is about 3.288e-6, as I had. So pOH is about 5.483, pH is 8.517, which rounds to 8.52.\n\nLooking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So that matches. But wait, let me check the other options. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, that's lower. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-calculate the equivalence point. Oh wait, wait a second. I think I messed up the volume calculation. The initial solution after dilution is 40 cm\u00b3, and at equivalence point, 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added, so total volume is 50 cm\u00b3. But wait, 40 cm\u00b3 is 0.04 L, and 10 cm\u00b3 is 0.01 L, so total is 0.05 L, which is correct.\n\nSo the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.\n\nSo the Kb is 5.405e-10, and [OH^-] is about 3.288e-6, so pOH is about 5.483, pH is 8.517, which rounds to 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which matches our calculations. But wait, let me check the first part again.\n\nAt 25% titration, the pH was around 4.25, which is option A's first value. So the correct answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation. Let me recheck. The ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is about 4.25. Option A says 4.26, which is close.\n\nWait, but let me compute the pH more precisely. Maybe I approximated too much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dilution affects the concentrations, but I think I accounted for that.\n\nWait, another approach: when 25% of the acid is neutralized, the moles of HA and A- are as follows. HA: 0.75 * 0.001 = 0.00075 mol. A-: 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol. The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 2.5 cm\u00b3 = 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M. [A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nSo the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is exactly -0.4771. So pH = 4.73 - 0.4771 = 4.2529, which is 4.25. So 4.25 rounds to 4.25. Option A is 4.26, which is very close. So that's the first part.\n\nSo the two pH values are approximately 4.25 and 8.52. Looking at the options, option A matches. But wait, what about the other options? Option D has pH of 4.57 and 6.92. Why would that be? Maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. At equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution is basic.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M acetate. So the Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe formula for Kb: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nAssuming x is small compared to 0.02, so:\n\nx^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 \u2192 x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 \u2192 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M. So [OH-] is 3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH is -log(3.288e-6).\n\nCalculating log(3.288e-6): log(3.288) is about 0.5166, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.5166 -6 = -5.4834. So pOH is 5.4834 \u2192 pH = 14 -5.4834 \u2248 8.5166, which is about 8.52.\n\nSo option A's equivalence point is 8.52, which matches.\n\nWait, but option D has 6.92, which is much lower. That would be more like the pH at the half-equivalence point, but wait, no, the half-equivalence point is the pKa. Oh right, at half equivalence, pH = pKa, which is 4.73. But that's not one of the options for the equivalence point.\n\nSo the correct pH at equivalence point is around 8.52. So the correct answer is option A.\n\nWait, but I'm seeing another possible mistake. Did I correctly account for the dilution at 25% titration?\n\nWait, the initial solution after adding 20 cm\u00b3 of water is 40 cm\u00b3. Then adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH, so the total is 42.5 cm\u00b3. So in that case, the concentrations are correct. So the [A-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.00588 M, and [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M. So the ratio is 1/3, which gives pH as 4.25. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think about whether the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation requires activity coefficients or not, but I think for this level, we're assuming concentrations are sufficient.\n\nSo the first pH is about 4.25, and the equivalence point is about 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. So the correct answer should be option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this should be a classic acid-base titration problem.\n\nAlright, let's break down the problem. We start with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm\u00b3. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Oh, right, 20 + 20 is 40, so the volume doubles. So the concentration after dilution would be half, right? Because concentration is moles over volume. So the original moles of acetic acid would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm\u00b3, the volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L), so the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.\n\nThen we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is to find the pH at 25% titration. Oh, 25% means we've added enough NaOH to neutralize 25% of the acetic acid. Let me think about the moles here. The moles of acetic acid initially after dilution are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed for 25% titration is 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe volume of NaOH needed would be moles divided by concentration. So 0.00025 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm\u00b3. But wait, maybe I don't need the volume right now. Let me think about what happens at 25% titration. At that point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate. So the solution will contain both acetic acid and acetate ions, making it a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). The pKa is given by the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) which is approximately 4.73, because I remember that acetic acid's pKa is around 4.76, but let me calculate it precisely.\n\nWait, 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4). Let me compute that. Log(5.405e4) is log(5.405) + 4. Log(5) is about 0.699, and 5.405 is a bit higher. Log(5.405) is approximately 0.7328. So pKa is 4.7328, which rounds to 4.73.\n\nNow, in the buffer solution, the moles of acetic acid and acetate. Initially, after dilution, we have 0.001 mol acetic acid. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol has been neutralized. So moles of HA (acetic acid) remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of A- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 mol.\n\nBut wait, when you dilute, the concentration changes. The total volume at 25% titration is the initial volume (40 cm\u00b3) plus the volume of NaOH added (2.5 cm\u00b3). Wait, 40 cm\u00b3 is 0.04 L, and 2.5 cm\u00b3 is 0.0025 L. So total volume is 0.0425 L. So the concentrations are [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 and [A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425.\n\nWait, but maybe I can calculate the ratio first. The ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.333) which is about -0.477. So pH = pKa + (-0.477) = 4.73 - 0.477 = approximately 4.253. Hmm, that's around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26, option D has 4.57. So perhaps 4.26 is the pH at 25% titration.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me re-calculate the ratio. At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So the ratio of acetate to acetic acid is 0.25 / (1 - 0.25) = 1/3. So yes, log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is approximately 4.25. So the first value is around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26, and option D is 4.57. So perhaps the first pH is 4.26.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So moles of NaOH needed would be equal to moles of acetic acid. Initially, after dilution, moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3. So total volume at equivalence is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 (0.05 L).\n\nThe reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so in solution, it will hydrolyze to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is moles / volume. Moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, volume is 0.05 L. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10. The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Let's set up the equation.\n\nLet x be [OH^-]. Then [CH3COOH] = x, and [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02).\n\nSo Kb \u2248 x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.\n\nSolving for x: x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let me calculate that. Log(3.288) is about 0.5166, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.5166 -6 = -5.4834. So pOH is 5.4834, so pH is 14 -5.4834 = 8.5166, approximately 8.52.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the Kb calculation again. Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. Let me compute that more accurately. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is 1/(1.85e5) * 1e-14/(1e-14) \u2192 wait, wait. Let me compute 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. 1e-14 is 0.0000000000001, and 1.85e-5 is 0.0000185. So 0.0000000000001 divided by 0.0000185 is approximately 5.405e-10, which is correct.\n\nSo, the [OH^-] is about 3.288e-6, as I had. So pOH is about 5.483, pH is 8.517, which rounds to 8.52.\n\nLooking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So that matches. But wait, let me check the other options. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, that's lower. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-calculate the equivalence point. Oh wait, wait a second. I think I messed up the volume calculation. The initial solution after dilution is 40 cm\u00b3, and at equivalence point, 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added, so total volume is 50 cm\u00b3. But wait, 40 cm\u00b3 is 0.04 L, and 10 cm\u00b3 is 0.01 L, so total is 0.05 L, which is correct.\n\nSo the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.\n\nSo the Kb is 5.405e-10, and [OH^-] is about 3.288e-6, so pOH is about 5.483, pH is 8.517, which rounds to 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which matches our calculations. But wait, let me check the first part again.\n\nAt 25% titration, the pH was around 4.25, which is option A's first value. So the correct answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation. Let me recheck. The ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is about 4.25. Option A says 4.26, which is close.\n\nWait, but let me compute the pH more precisely. Maybe I approximated too much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dilution affects the concentrations, but I think I accounted for that.\n\nWait, another approach: when 25% of the acid is neutralized, the moles of HA and A- are as follows. HA: 0.75 * 0.001 = 0.00075 mol. A-: 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol. The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 2.5 cm\u00b3 = 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M. [A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nSo the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is exactly -0.4771. So pH = 4.73 - 0.4771 = 4.2529, which is 4.25. So 4.25 rounds to 4.25. Option A is 4.26, which is very close. So that's the first part.\n\nSo the two pH values are approximately 4.25 and 8.52. Looking at the options, option A matches. But wait, what about the other options? Option D has pH of 4.57 and 6.92. Why would that be? Maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. At equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution is basic.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M acetate. So the Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe formula for Kb: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nAssuming x is small compared to 0.02, so:\n\nx^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 \u2192 x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 \u2192 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M. So [OH-] is 3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH is -log(3.288e-6).\n\nCalculating log(3.288e-6): log(3.288) is about 0.5166, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.5166 -6 = -5.4834. So pOH is 5.4834 \u2192 pH = 14 -5.4834 \u2248 8.5166, which is about 8.52.\n\nSo option A's equivalence point is 8.52, which matches.\n\nWait, but option D has 6.92, which is much lower. That would be more like the pH at the half-equivalence point, but wait, no, the half-equivalence point is the pKa. Oh right, at half equivalence, pH = pKa, which is 4.73. But that's not one of the options for the equivalence point.\n\nSo the correct pH at equivalence point is around 8.52. So the correct answer is option A.\n\nWait, but I'm seeing another possible mistake. Did I correctly account for the dilution at 25% titration?\n\nWait, the initial solution after adding 20 cm\u00b3 of water is 40 cm\u00b3. Then adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH, so the total is 42.5 cm\u00b3. So in that case, the concentrations are correct. So the [A-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.00588 M, and [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M. So the ratio is 1/3, which gives pH as 4.25. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think about whether the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation requires activity coefficients or not, but I think for this level, we're assuming concentrations are sufficient.\n\nSo the first pH is about 4.25, and the equivalence point is about 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. So the correct answer should be option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the titration of diluted acetic acid with NaOH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\nWe start with 20.00 cm\u00b3 (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water results in a total volume of 40.00 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Concentration after dilution} = \\frac{\\text{Initial moles}}{\\text{Total volume}} = \\frac{(0.05 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.02 \\, \\text{L})}{0.04 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.025 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M.\n\n### Step 2: pH at 25% Titration\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of acetic acid initially are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.04 \\, \\text{L} = 0.001 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nAt 25% titration, 0.25 \u00d7 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.00025 mol of acetate ions (A\u207b). The remaining moles of acetic acid (HA) are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of HA} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nThe total volume at 25% titration is the initial volume (40.00 cm\u00b3) plus the volume of NaOH added (2.5 cm\u00b3), giving a total volume of 42.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0425 L). The concentrations of HA and A\u207b are:\n\n\\[\n[\\text{HA}] = \\frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \\approx 0.017647 \\, \\text{M}, \\quad [\\text{A}^-] = \\frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \\approx 0.005882 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = \\text{p}K_a + \\log \\left( \\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} \\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( K_a = 1.85 \\times 10^{-5} \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{p}K_a = -\\log(1.85 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 4.73.\n\\]\n\nThe ratio \\(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} = \\frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \\approx \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 4.73 + \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 4.73 - 0.477 \\approx 4.25.\n\\]\n\nThis rounds to approximately **4.26**.\n\n### Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 mol, so 0.001 mol of acetate ions (A\u207b) are formed. The total volume at the equivalence point is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \\, \\text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \\, \\text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \\, \\text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \\, \\text{L}.\n\\]\n\nThe concentration of acetate ions is:\n\n\\[\n[\\text{A}^-] = \\frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nAcetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, and its hydrolysis in water produces OH\u207b ions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^- + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\leftrightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH} + \\text{OH}^-.\n\\]\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is \\( K_b = \\frac{K_w}{K_a} \\), where \\( K_w = 1 \\times 10^{-14} \\) and \\( K_a = 1.85 \\times 10^{-5} \\). Thus:\n\n\\[\nK_b = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 5.405 \\times 10^{-10}.\n\\]\n\nLet \\([OH^-] = x\\). The expression for \\( K_b \\) is:\n\n\\[\nK_b = \\frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\\text{A}^-]}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting:\n\n\\[\n5.405 \\times 10^{-10} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02}.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 0.02 \\times 5.405 \\times 10^{-10} = 1.081 \\times 10^{-11}, \\quad x = \\sqrt{1.081 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 3.288 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\([OH^-] \\approx 3.288 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{M}\\). The pOH is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pOH} = -\\log(3.288 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 5.483.\n\\]\n\nThe pH is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 14 - \\text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 \\approx 8.52.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:\n\n**A) 4.26; 8.52**\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they should react in a neutralization reaction.\n\nFirst, the initial setup: We have 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm\u00b3. I think I need to find the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution.\n\nThe formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/(V1+V2). Wait, no, wait, that's when you have two solutions mixing. But in this case, it's just acetic acid being diluted with water. So initial volume is 20 cm\u00b3, initial concentration 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm\u00b3 water, volume is 40 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm\u00b3) / 40 cm\u00b3 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.\n\nNext, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The problem asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.\n\nI think for the equivalence point, I need to calculate how much NaOH is needed to neutralize all the acetic acid. But wait, the question doesn't ask for the volume at equivalence; it's just about pH. So I need to find the pH at 25% of that equivalence volume, and the pH at equivalence.\n\nWait, but the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, moles of acetic acid initially. Volume is 20 cm\u00b3, 0.05 M. Moles = Molarity \u00d7 Volume (in liters). So 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.\n\nWhen we dilute with 20 cm\u00b3 of water, the concentration is 0.025 M, but the moles stay the same, right? Because we're just adding water. So moles of acetic acid is still 0.001 mol.\n\nSo at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed will be 0.001 mol as well. Because the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.\n\nSo moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo equivalence point is when 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added.\n\nBut the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH has been added.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure. The equivalence volume is 10 cm\u00b3, so 25% of that is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at that point, how much acetic acid has reacted?\n\nEach mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH added at 2.5 cm\u00b3 is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. Moles reacted: 0.00025 mol. Remaining moles of CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo the solution at 25% titration is a buffer solution, a mixture of acetic acid and its conjugate base. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nBut wait, the pKa is given by Ka. The Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is about 4.74, maybe 4.73 or 4.74.\n\nWait, precise calculation: 1.85e-5 is 1.85 \u00d7 10^-5. Let me compute log(1.85) accurately. Log(1.85)=0.2672 (since log(2)=0.3010, log(1.8)=0.2553, so 1.85 is around 0.2672). So pKa is 5 - 0.2672? Wait, wait. Wait, no. pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5) = -(log(1.85) + log(1e-5)) )= -(0.2672 -5) )= 4.7328. So approximately 4.73.\n\nSo back to the Henderson equation. [A^-] is 0.00025 mol, [HA] is 0.00075 mol.\n\nBut wait, the solution volume is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Let me check. The initial solution after dilution is 40 cm\u00b3. When we add 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH, the total volume is 42.5 cm\u00b3. But for the purpose of calculating concentrations, since the same volume is used for both, it will cancel out in the ratio. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.\n\nSo log(1/3) is log(0.333) \u2248 -0.477. So pH = pKa + (-0.477) \u2192 4.73 - 0.477 \u2248 4.253. So approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92, option A has 4.26 and 8.52, etc. Hmm. So maybe 4.26 is the pH at 25% titration.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Are the moles correct? Let me recheck. Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm\u00b3 water, volume is 40 cm\u00b3, so concentration is 0.025 M, but moles are still 0.001. When titrating, at 25% of the equivalence point, which is 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH, moles of NaOH is 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol. So yes, correct. So moles of acetate are 0.00025, and remaining acetic acid is 0.00075.\n\nSo the Henderson equation gives pH \u2248 4.73 + log( (0.00025)/(0.00075) ) \u2192 log(1/3)= -0.477 \u2192 pH=4.73-0.477=4.253, which is about 4.25. So the first pH is approximately 4.25.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, and option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, 4.25 is close to 4.26. So maybe that's the first value.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will consist of sodium acetate in water, which will hydrolyze to form a basic solution. So the pH should be above 7.\n\nWait, but sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe pH can be calculated by finding the Kb of the acetate ion. Since Ka * Kb = Kw = 1e-14.\n\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate at equivalence point: moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. The total volume is initial 40 cm\u00b3 plus the 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added, so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, Kb is 5.405e-10. The hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] \u2248 x^2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x^2 = Kb * 0.02 \u2192 x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 M \u2192 pOH = -log(3.288e-6). Let me calculate that.\n\nLog(3.288)=0.516, so pOH=5.516 - 6 \u2192 5.484? Wait, no. Wait, 3.288e-6 is 3.288 \u00d7 10^-6. So log(3.288e-6) is log(3.288) + log(1e-6) \u2192 0.517 + (-6) \u2192 -5.483. So pOH=5.483. Therefore, pH=14 - 5.483=8.517, approximately 8.52.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So that's the first pH (4.26) and equivalence pH (8.52). But wait, the equivalence point's pH is about 8.52, but earlier I thought that the initial buffer was around 4.25, which matches option A's first value.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculations for the equivalence point. Because sometimes, when the salt is made from a weak acid and strong base, the solution is basic. But is my calculation correct?\n\nYes, I think so. The Kb is correct, the concentration is 0.02 M. So the calculation seems right. So pH at equivalence is around 8.52.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52. That seems to fit. But another option is D: 4.57; 6.92. Hmm, wait, why is there another option?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about the equivalence point. Oh wait, wait! Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. But the acetate comes from a weak acid, so the solution is basic. So the pH should be above 7, which 8.52 is.\n\nSo if option A is 4.26 and 8.52, that would be the correct pair.\n\nBut wait, let me check the Henderson calculation again. Wait, when I did the Henderson equation, I considered the ratio [A^-]/[HA] = 1/3, giving pH \u2248 4.25. So 4.26 is very close. So the first value is 4.26, the second is 8.52. So option A is the one.\n\nWait, but wait, another thought: perhaps when I diluted the acetic acid, I made a mistake. Let me check the initial moles again.\n\nWait, initial volume is 20 cm\u00b3, 0.05 M. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then, adding 20 cm\u00b3 of water, the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.\n\nWhen titrating, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm\u00b3) is 2.5 cm\u00b3. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So that's correct. So the buffer calculation is correct.\n\nBut wait, wait another point. The problem says 25% titration. So 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So that would mean that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added would be 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol. So yes, same as before.\n\nSo the buffer pH is around 4.26, and the equivalence pH is around 8.52. So the correct option is A.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options again:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17;6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nHmm, but wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Because sometimes, when you have a solution of sodium acetate, the pH is calculated using the formula for a weak base.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way I calculated it is correct. Let me recompute the Kb and the pH.\n\nKb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nConcentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nThe Kb expression: Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02) \u2192 x\u00b2 = Kb * 0.02 \u2192 (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 \u2192 [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH = log(1/(3.288e-6)) \u2192 wait no, pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let me compute that accurately.\n\n3.288e-6 is 3.288 \u00d71e-6. Log(3.288)=0.517, so log(3.288e-6)=0.517 -6= -5.483. So pOH=5.483. pH=14-5.483=8.517 \u2192 approx 8.52. So correct.\n\nSo the equivalence point pH is 8.52, and the 25% titration pH is 4.26. So option A is the right choice.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: the options don't have 8.52 as the second value except option A. So the correct answer must be A.\n\nWait, but another thought: when I diluted the acetic acid, perhaps I should have considered the dilution correctly. Let me recheck that. The initial volume is 20 cm\u00b3, adding 20 cm\u00b3 of water. So total volume 40 cm\u00b3. Moles of acetic acid are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. So concentration after dilution is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.\n\nSo at 25% titration, moles of NaOH added is 0.00025, as before. So buffer ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 1/3, pH is 4.26.\n\nWait, but in the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Where would that come from? Maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Because I thought the equivalence point would be basic, but perhaps I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should use the formula for the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with a strong base. The pH can be calculated using:\n\npH = pKa + 1/2 pKw + (1/2) log (C / C') ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to go back to the calculation. Let me recompute the Kb and the hydrolysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the solution is at equivalence, the concentration is 0.02 M of acetate. The Kb is 5.405e-10. So, the concentration of OH- is sqrt(Kb * C) \u2192 sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 3.288e-6 M. So [OH-] is 3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH is 5.483, pH is 8.517.\n\nHmm, so the equivalence point is pH 8.52, which matches option A. So the correct answer is option A.\n\nWait, but wait another point. I'm now confused because when I think about the equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the solution should be basic, which it is in this case. So the pH should be around 8.52.\n\nBut looking at the options again, option A is 4.26;8.52. So that should be the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they should react in a neutralization reaction.\n\nFirst, the initial setup: We have 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm\u00b3. I think I need to find the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution.\n\nThe formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/(V1+V2). Wait, no, wait, that's when you have two solutions mixing. But in this case, it's just acetic acid being diluted with water. So initial volume is 20 cm\u00b3, initial concentration 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm\u00b3 water, volume is 40 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm\u00b3) / 40 cm\u00b3 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.\n\nNext, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The problem asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.\n\nI think for the equivalence point, I need to calculate how much NaOH is needed to neutralize all the acetic acid. But wait, the question doesn't ask for the volume at equivalence; it's just about pH. So I need to find the pH at 25% of that equivalence volume, and the pH at equivalence.\n\nWait, but the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, moles of acetic acid initially. Volume is 20 cm\u00b3, 0.05 M. Moles = Molarity \u00d7 Volume (in liters). So 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.\n\nWhen we dilute with 20 cm\u00b3 of water, the concentration is 0.025 M, but the moles stay the same, right? Because we're just adding water. So moles of acetic acid is still 0.001 mol.\n\nSo at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed will be 0.001 mol as well. Because the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.\n\nSo moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo equivalence point is when 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added.\n\nBut the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH has been added.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure. The equivalence volume is 10 cm\u00b3, so 25% of that is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at that point, how much acetic acid has reacted?\n\nEach mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH added at 2.5 cm\u00b3 is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. Moles reacted: 0.00025 mol. Remaining moles of CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo the solution at 25% titration is a buffer solution, a mixture of acetic acid and its conjugate base. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nBut wait, the pKa is given by Ka. The Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is about 4.74, maybe 4.73 or 4.74.\n\nWait, precise calculation: 1.85e-5 is 1.85 \u00d7 10^-5. Let me compute log(1.85) accurately. Log(1.85)=0.2672 (since log(2)=0.3010, log(1.8)=0.2553, so 1.85 is around 0.2672). So pKa is 5 - 0.2672? Wait, wait. Wait, no. pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5) = -(log(1.85) + log(1e-5)) )= -(0.2672 -5) )= 4.7328. So approximately 4.73.\n\nSo back to the Henderson equation. [A^-] is 0.00025 mol, [HA] is 0.00075 mol.\n\nBut wait, the solution volume is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Let me check. The initial solution after dilution is 40 cm\u00b3. When we add 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH, the total volume is 42.5 cm\u00b3. But for the purpose of calculating concentrations, since the same volume is used for both, it will cancel out in the ratio. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.\n\nSo log(1/3) is log(0.333) \u2248 -0.477. So pH = pKa + (-0.477) \u2192 4.73 - 0.477 \u2248 4.253. So approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92, option A has 4.26 and 8.52, etc. Hmm. So maybe 4.26 is the pH at 25% titration.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Are the moles correct? Let me recheck. Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm\u00b3 water, volume is 40 cm\u00b3, so concentration is 0.025 M, but moles are still 0.001. When titrating, at 25% of the equivalence point, which is 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH, moles of NaOH is 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol. So yes, correct. So moles of acetate are 0.00025, and remaining acetic acid is 0.00075.\n\nSo the Henderson equation gives pH \u2248 4.73 + log( (0.00025)/(0.00075) ) \u2192 log(1/3)= -0.477 \u2192 pH=4.73-0.477=4.253, which is about 4.25. So the first pH is approximately 4.25.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, and option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, 4.25 is close to 4.26. So maybe that's the first value.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will consist of sodium acetate in water, which will hydrolyze to form a basic solution. So the pH should be above 7.\n\nWait, but sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe pH can be calculated by finding the Kb of the acetate ion. Since Ka * Kb = Kw = 1e-14.\n\nKb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration of acetate at equivalence point: moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. The total volume is initial 40 cm\u00b3 plus the 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added, so 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, Kb is 5.405e-10. The hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] \u2248 x^2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x^2 = Kb * 0.02 \u2192 x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 M \u2192 pOH = -log(3.288e-6). Let me calculate that.\n\nLog(3.288)=0.516, so pOH=5.516 - 6 \u2192 5.484? Wait, no. Wait, 3.288e-6 is 3.288 \u00d7 10^-6. So log(3.288e-6) is log(3.288) + log(1e-6) \u2192 0.517 + (-6) \u2192 -5.483. So pOH=5.483. Therefore, pH=14 - 5.483=8.517, approximately 8.52.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So that's the first pH (4.26) and equivalence pH (8.52). But wait, the equivalence point's pH is about 8.52, but earlier I thought that the initial buffer was around 4.25, which matches option A's first value.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculations for the equivalence point. Because sometimes, when the salt is made from a weak acid and strong base, the solution is basic. But is my calculation correct?\n\nYes, I think so. The Kb is correct, the concentration is 0.02 M. So the calculation seems right. So pH at equivalence is around 8.52.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52. That seems to fit. But another option is D: 4.57; 6.92. Hmm, wait, why is there another option?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about the equivalence point. Oh wait, wait! Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. But the acetate comes from a weak acid, so the solution is basic. So the pH should be above 7, which 8.52 is.\n\nSo if option A is 4.26 and 8.52, that would be the correct pair.\n\nBut wait, let me check the Henderson calculation again. Wait, when I did the Henderson equation, I considered the ratio [A^-]/[HA] = 1/3, giving pH \u2248 4.25. So 4.26 is very close. So the first value is 4.26, the second is 8.52. So option A is the one.\n\nWait, but wait, another thought: perhaps when I diluted the acetic acid, I made a mistake. Let me check the initial moles again.\n\nWait, initial volume is 20 cm\u00b3, 0.05 M. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then, adding 20 cm\u00b3 of water, the total volume is 40 cm\u00b3. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.\n\nWhen titrating, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm\u00b3) is 2.5 cm\u00b3. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So that's correct. So the buffer calculation is correct.\n\nBut wait, wait another point. The problem says 25% titration. So 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So that would mean that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added would be 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol. So yes, same as before.\n\nSo the buffer pH is around 4.26, and the equivalence pH is around 8.52. So the correct option is A.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options again:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17;6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nHmm, but wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Because sometimes, when you have a solution of sodium acetate, the pH is calculated using the formula for a weak base.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way I calculated it is correct. Let me recompute the Kb and the pH.\n\nKb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nConcentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nThe Kb expression: Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02) \u2192 x\u00b2 = Kb * 0.02 \u2192 (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 \u2192 [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH = log(1/(3.288e-6)) \u2192 wait no, pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let me compute that accurately.\n\n3.288e-6 is 3.288 \u00d71e-6. Log(3.288)=0.517, so log(3.288e-6)=0.517 -6= -5.483. So pOH=5.483. pH=14-5.483=8.517 \u2192 approx 8.52. So correct.\n\nSo the equivalence point pH is 8.52, and the 25% titration pH is 4.26. So option A is the right choice.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: the options don't have 8.52 as the second value except option A. So the correct answer must be A.\n\nWait, but another thought: when I diluted the acetic acid, perhaps I should have considered the dilution correctly. Let me recheck that. The initial volume is 20 cm\u00b3, adding 20 cm\u00b3 of water. So total volume 40 cm\u00b3. Moles of acetic acid are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. So concentration after dilution is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.\n\nSo at 25% titration, moles of NaOH added is 0.00025, as before. So buffer ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 1/3, pH is 4.26.\n\nWait, but in the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Where would that come from? Maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Because I thought the equivalence point would be basic, but perhaps I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should use the formula for the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with a strong base. The pH can be calculated using:\n\npH = pKa + 1/2 pKw + (1/2) log (C / C') ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to go back to the calculation. Let me recompute the Kb and the hydrolysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the solution is at equivalence, the concentration is 0.02 M of acetate. The Kb is 5.405e-10. So, the concentration of OH- is sqrt(Kb * C) \u2192 sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 3.288e-6 M. So [OH-] is 3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH is 5.483, pH is 8.517.\n\nHmm, so the equivalence point is pH 8.52, which matches option A. So the correct answer is option A.\n\nWait, but wait another point. I'm now confused because when I think about the equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the solution should be basic, which it is in this case. So the pH should be around 8.52.\n\nBut looking at the options again, option A is 4.26;8.52. So that should be the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of CH}_3\\text{COOH} = 0.05 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.02 \\, \\text{L} = 0.001 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nAfter diluting with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm\u00b3. The new concentration is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Concentration of CH}_3\\text{COOH} = \\frac{0.001 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.04 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.025 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\n### At 25% Titration\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. The equivalence point requires neutralizing all 0.001 mol of acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume of NaOH at equivalence point} = \\frac{\\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \\frac{0.001 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.1 \\, \\text{M}} = 0.01 \\, \\text{L} = 10 \\, \\text{cm}^3.\n\\]\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 (i.e., 2.5 cm\u00b3) of NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.0025 \\, \\text{L} = 0.00025 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nThis neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining moles of CH}_3\\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \\, \\text{mol},\n\\]\nand forms:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of CH}_3\\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nThe solution is a buffer, and the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = \\text{pKa} + \\log \\left( \\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} \\right).\n\\]\n\nThe \\( \\text{pKa} \\) is calculated from \\( \\text{Ka} = 1.85 \\times 10^{-5} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{pKa} = -\\log(1.85 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 4.73.\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of conjugate base to weak acid is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} = \\frac{0.00025}{0.00075} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 4.73 + \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \\approx 4.26.\n\\]\n\n### At Equivalence Point\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions (\\( \\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^- \\)).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.\n\nThe question says: We dilute 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, first, let's figure out the initial situation after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, its concentration decreases, which will affect its pH. But then, when we titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, the pH will change based on how much base is added.\n\nSo, the first part is about the 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Wait, but I should probably find out the initial moles of acetic acid to figure out the equivalence point, then determine what happens at 25% of that.\n\nLet me start by calculating the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution. The volume is 20.00 cm\u00b3 (which is 0.020 L) and the concentration is 0.05 M. Moles = Molarity \u00d7 Volume, so 0.05 * 0.020 = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, but when we dilute it with 20 cm\u00b3 water, the total volume becomes 40 cm\u00b3 (0.040 L). So the new concentration is moles divided by volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nNow, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001, as before. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm\u00b3. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH.\n\nWait, but the question asks about 25% titration. That would be 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at this point, how much of the acetic acid has been neutralized?\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid moles have reacted with NaOH. So moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O), the moles of acetic acid neutralized is 0.00025, and the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Also, the moles of acetate ion produced are 0.00025.\n\nBut wait, the total volume at this point is the initial solution (40 cm\u00b3) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm\u00b3), so 42.5 cm\u00b3 or 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, the concentrations would be:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M\n\nNow, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa is the negative logarithm of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) which is approximately 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, and 1.85 is closer to 2, which is 0.3 more, so maybe around 4.73? Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1.85e-5)^-1 \u2192 log(5.405e4). Log(5.405e4) is log(5.405) + log(1e4) \u2192 0.7328 +4 = 4.7328, so approximately 4.73.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )\n\nLet me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) \u2248 -0.4771.\n\nSo pH \u2248 4.73 - 0.4771 \u2248 4.25. Hmm, looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So 4.25 is close to 4.26, which is option A's first value. But wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. When 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH is added, that's 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles of OH- added. So that's correct.\n\nSo in the solution, moles of acetic acid is 0.00075, and acetate is 0.00025. The total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm\u00b3, which is 0.0425 L.\n\nSo [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M\n\n[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M\n\nThe ratio is (0.005882)/(0.017647) = 0.3333, which is 1/3. So log(1/3) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. That's about 4.25. So the closest option is A (4.26) or D (4.57). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me calculate 0.00025 / 0.0425. 0.00025 is 2.5e-4, divided by 42.5e-3 L. So 2.5e-4 / 4.25e-2 = (2.5 /4.25) * 1e-2. 2.5 /4.25 is approximately 0.5882. So 0.5882e-2 is 5.882e-3 M.\n\nSimilarly, 0.00075 /0.0425 is 7.5e-4 / 4.25e-2 = (7.5/4.25) * 1e-2. 7.5 /4.25 is about 1.7647, so 1.7647e-2 M. So ratio is (5.882e-3)/(1.7647e-2) )= 0.3333.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nSo pH is 4.73 -0.477 =4.253, which is about 4.25. So option A's first part is 4.26, which is very close.\n\nNow, for the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic. The pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.\n\nSo, moles of acetate at equivalence point: same as initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles. The total volume is the initial solution (40 cm\u00b3) plus the volume of NaOH added at equivalence (10 cm\u00b3) \u2192 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion (A^-) reacts with water:\n\nA^- + H2O \u2194 HA + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe expression for Kb is [HA][OH^-] / [A^-]\n\nAssuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, which is small compared to initial concentration.\n\nSo Kb \u2248 x\u00b2 / (0.02) \u2192 x\u00b2 = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH = -log(3.288e-6) \u2192 log(3.288) is about 0.516, so pOH \u2248 5.484 \u2192 pH = 14 -5.484 = 8.516.\n\nWait, that's approximately 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is about 8.52.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that would make sense. But wait, let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nConcentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02) \u2192 x\u00b2= 0.02 *5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 3.288e-6 M. So [OH-] is 3.288e-6, which is 3.288e-6. pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let me compute that accurately.\n\nLog(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) \u2192 log(3.288) is about 0.5169, so 0.5169 -6 \u2192 -5.483. So pOH is 5.483, so pH is 14 -5.483 = 8.517, which rounds to 8.52.\n\nSo the equivalence point pH is 8.52. So the first part is around 4.25, and the second is 8.52. So looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have both values as in option A. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOption A) 4.26; 8.52\n\nOption D) 4.57; 6.92\n\nSo according to this, the correct pair would be option A. But wait, let me think again. Because another thought: when you dilute the acetic acid, the initial pH after dilution might be lower than before, but the titration starts from there.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me double-check.\n\nInitial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm\u00b3, 0.05 M \u2192 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then adding 20 cm\u00b3 of water, total volume 40 cm\u00b3. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So that's correct.\n\nAt 25% titration, 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH added. Moles NaOH = 0.0025 L *0.1 M =0.00025 mol. So correct.\n\nSo the buffer calculation is correct. So the pH is about 4.25, which is 4.26 as option A says.\n\nWait, but I remember that when you have a buffer, the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but perhaps I should have considered the dilution of the buffer upon adding NaOH. Because when you add NaOH, the volume increases, which affects the concentrations.\n\nBut wait, I did account for that by using the total volume (42.5 cm\u00b3) when calculating the concentrations of HA and A^-.\n\nHmm, so everything seems correct. So option A would have the pH at 25% titration as 4.26 and equivalence at 8.52.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92, which seems off. So why would the pH at equivalence not be around 8.5?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Kb or the hydrolysis.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the pH at equivalence: using the formula for a salt of a weak acid.\n\nThe formula for pH is pKa + 0.5*pKb? No, wait, the pH is determined by the Kb of the acetate ion.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the approximation that for a weak base, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C), where C is the concentration of the base.\n\nSo C is 0.02 M, Kb is 5.405e-10.\n\nSo [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M. So pOH is log(3.288e-6) \u2192 about 5.48 \u2192 pH 8.52.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, which matches.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but let me check other options. Option D's equivalence pH is 6.92, which is much lower. That would be the case if the solution was a buffer, but not when all the acid is neutralized.\n\nSo why is option D an option? Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution. Let me check:\n\nOriginal volume: 20 cm\u00b3, 0.05 M \u2192 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then adding 20 cm\u00b3 water \u2192 total volume 40 cm\u00b3, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should not have considered the initial dilution because the titration is done with the diluted solution. Oh wait, the titration is done on the diluted solution, so the initial moles are 0.001, and when you add NaOH, it's all about neutralizing that.\n\nSo the calculations are correct.\n\nBut wait, in the 25% titration, the pH is 4.25, which is very close to option A's first value, 4.26. So option A would be the answer.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculation of the buffer's pH.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial pH is lower, and the 25% titration is a bit higher?\n\nWait, the initial pH of the diluted acetic acid can be calculated. Maybe that's necessary for a more accurate calculation, but the problem asks for pH at 25% titration, not the initial pH.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the dilution isn't 40 cm\u00b3 because when you add 20 cm\u00b3 of water to 20 cm\u00b3 of solution, the volume becomes 40 cm\u00b3. So the concentration is 0.025 M, correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way the problem is phrased, the initial solution is 20 cm\u00b3 0.05 M acetic acid, and then 20 cm\u00b3 water is added, making a 40 cm\u00b3 solution. Then titrated with 0.1 M NaOH.\n\nSo the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid. So 0.001 moles.\n\nVolume of NaOH needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm\u00b3.\n\nAt 25% titration, 2.5 cm\u00b3 added. So 0.25 \u00d7 0.001 =0.00025 moles of NaOH.\n\nSo that gives 0.00025 moles of acetate and 0.00075 moles of acetic acid.\n\nSo the buffer equation applies.\n\nWait, but another thing to consider: when you add NaOH, which is a strong base, it will increase the solution's volume. So the concentrations are as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have considered the dilution when calculating the pH at 25% titration. But I did that by using the new volume (42.5 cm\u00b3) to find the concentrations.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the calculation for the buffer's pH again.\n\npH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\npKa is 4.73.\n\n[A^-] is 0.00025 moles in 0.0425 L \u2192 0.005882 M.\n\n[HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.\n\nRatio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.\n\nLog(1/3) is -0.477.\n\nSo pH =4.73 -0.477 =4.253, which is 4.25. So that's correct.\n\nSo the first part is 4.25, which is option A's first value.\n\nSo the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which matches option A.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as \"25% titration; equivalence point.\" So the first number is 25%, second is equivalence.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nSo according to this, option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, I thought that when you have a buffer with [A^-] = (1/3) [HA], the pH is pKa - 0.477, which is about 4.25. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately.\n\nLet me compute the exact value.\n\npKa = -log(1.85e-5) \u2192 let's compute it precisely.\n\n1.85e-5 \u2192 log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.2672 -5 \u2192 -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328, about 4.73.\n\nThe ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.00025/0.00075 = 1/3, same as before.\n\nLog(1/3) is log(0.3333) = -0.4771.\n\nSo pH =4.7328 -0.4771 =4.2557 \u2192 approximately 4.26.\n\nSo the first pH is 4.26, which matches option A.\n\nThe equivalence pH is 8.52, which is option A.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the initial dilution of acetic acid. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm\u00b3 (0.020 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M, giving **0.001 moles** of acetic acid. After adding 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm\u00b3 (0.040 L), resulting in a diluted concentration of **0.025 M**.\n\n### 25% Titration\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The volume of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence point volume. The equivalence point requires **10 cm\u00b3** of 0.1 M NaOH to neutralize 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.\n\nThe question says: We dilute 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, first, let's figure out the initial situation after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, its concentration decreases, which will affect its pH. But then, when we titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, the pH will change based on how much base is added.\n\nSo, the first part is about the 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Wait, but I should probably find out the initial moles of acetic acid to figure out the equivalence point, then determine what happens at 25% of that.\n\nLet me start by calculating the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution. The volume is 20.00 cm\u00b3 (which is 0.020 L) and the concentration is 0.05 M. Moles = Molarity \u00d7 Volume, so 0.05 * 0.020 = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, but when we dilute it with 20 cm\u00b3 water, the total volume becomes 40 cm\u00b3 (0.040 L). So the new concentration is moles divided by volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nNow, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001, as before. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm\u00b3. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH.\n\nWait, but the question asks about 25% titration. That would be 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at this point, how much of the acetic acid has been neutralized?\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid moles have reacted with NaOH. So moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O), the moles of acetic acid neutralized is 0.00025, and the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Also, the moles of acetate ion produced are 0.00025.\n\nBut wait, the total volume at this point is the initial solution (40 cm\u00b3) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm\u00b3), so 42.5 cm\u00b3 or 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, the concentrations would be:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M\n\nNow, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa is the negative logarithm of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) which is approximately 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, and 1.85 is closer to 2, which is 0.3 more, so maybe around 4.73? Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1.85e-5)^-1 \u2192 log(5.405e4). Log(5.405e4) is log(5.405) + log(1e4) \u2192 0.7328 +4 = 4.7328, so approximately 4.73.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )\n\nLet me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) \u2248 -0.4771.\n\nSo pH \u2248 4.73 - 0.4771 \u2248 4.25. Hmm, looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So 4.25 is close to 4.26, which is option A's first value. But wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. When 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH is added, that's 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles of OH- added. So that's correct.\n\nSo in the solution, moles of acetic acid is 0.00075, and acetate is 0.00025. The total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm\u00b3, which is 0.0425 L.\n\nSo [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M\n\n[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M\n\nThe ratio is (0.005882)/(0.017647) = 0.3333, which is 1/3. So log(1/3) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. That's about 4.25. So the closest option is A (4.26) or D (4.57). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me calculate 0.00025 / 0.0425. 0.00025 is 2.5e-4, divided by 42.5e-3 L. So 2.5e-4 / 4.25e-2 = (2.5 /4.25) * 1e-2. 2.5 /4.25 is approximately 0.5882. So 0.5882e-2 is 5.882e-3 M.\n\nSimilarly, 0.00075 /0.0425 is 7.5e-4 / 4.25e-2 = (7.5/4.25) * 1e-2. 7.5 /4.25 is about 1.7647, so 1.7647e-2 M. So ratio is (5.882e-3)/(1.7647e-2) )= 0.3333.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nSo pH is 4.73 -0.477 =4.253, which is about 4.25. So option A's first part is 4.26, which is very close.\n\nNow, for the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic. The pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.\n\nSo, moles of acetate at equivalence point: same as initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles. The total volume is the initial solution (40 cm\u00b3) plus the volume of NaOH added at equivalence (10 cm\u00b3) \u2192 50 cm\u00b3 or 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion (A^-) reacts with water:\n\nA^- + H2O \u2194 HA + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25\u00b0C, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe expression for Kb is [HA][OH^-] / [A^-]\n\nAssuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, which is small compared to initial concentration.\n\nSo Kb \u2248 x\u00b2 / (0.02) \u2192 x\u00b2 = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH = -log(3.288e-6) \u2192 log(3.288) is about 0.516, so pOH \u2248 5.484 \u2192 pH = 14 -5.484 = 8.516.\n\nWait, that's approximately 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is about 8.52.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that would make sense. But wait, let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nConcentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02) \u2192 x\u00b2= 0.02 *5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 3.288e-6 M. So [OH-] is 3.288e-6, which is 3.288e-6. pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let me compute that accurately.\n\nLog(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) \u2192 log(3.288) is about 0.5169, so 0.5169 -6 \u2192 -5.483. So pOH is 5.483, so pH is 14 -5.483 = 8.517, which rounds to 8.52.\n\nSo the equivalence point pH is 8.52. So the first part is around 4.25, and the second is 8.52. So looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have both values as in option A. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOption A) 4.26; 8.52\n\nOption D) 4.57; 6.92\n\nSo according to this, the correct pair would be option A. But wait, let me think again. Because another thought: when you dilute the acetic acid, the initial pH after dilution might be lower than before, but the titration starts from there.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me double-check.\n\nInitial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm\u00b3, 0.05 M \u2192 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then adding 20 cm\u00b3 of water, total volume 40 cm\u00b3. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So that's correct.\n\nAt 25% titration, 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH added. Moles NaOH = 0.0025 L *0.1 M =0.00025 mol. So correct.\n\nSo the buffer calculation is correct. So the pH is about 4.25, which is 4.26 as option A says.\n\nWait, but I remember that when you have a buffer, the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but perhaps I should have considered the dilution of the buffer upon adding NaOH. Because when you add NaOH, the volume increases, which affects the concentrations.\n\nBut wait, I did account for that by using the total volume (42.5 cm\u00b3) when calculating the concentrations of HA and A^-.\n\nHmm, so everything seems correct. So option A would have the pH at 25% titration as 4.26 and equivalence at 8.52.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92, which seems off. So why would the pH at equivalence not be around 8.5?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Kb or the hydrolysis.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the pH at equivalence: using the formula for a salt of a weak acid.\n\nThe formula for pH is pKa + 0.5*pKb? No, wait, the pH is determined by the Kb of the acetate ion.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the approximation that for a weak base, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C), where C is the concentration of the base.\n\nSo C is 0.02 M, Kb is 5.405e-10.\n\nSo [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.288e-6 M. So pOH is log(3.288e-6) \u2192 about 5.48 \u2192 pH 8.52.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, which matches.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option A.\n\nWait, but let me check other options. Option D's equivalence pH is 6.92, which is much lower. That would be the case if the solution was a buffer, but not when all the acid is neutralized.\n\nSo why is option D an option? Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution. Let me check:\n\nOriginal volume: 20 cm\u00b3, 0.05 M \u2192 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then adding 20 cm\u00b3 water \u2192 total volume 40 cm\u00b3, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should not have considered the initial dilution because the titration is done with the diluted solution. Oh wait, the titration is done on the diluted solution, so the initial moles are 0.001, and when you add NaOH, it's all about neutralizing that.\n\nSo the calculations are correct.\n\nBut wait, in the 25% titration, the pH is 4.25, which is very close to option A's first value, 4.26. So option A would be the answer.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculation of the buffer's pH.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial pH is lower, and the 25% titration is a bit higher?\n\nWait, the initial pH of the diluted acetic acid can be calculated. Maybe that's necessary for a more accurate calculation, but the problem asks for pH at 25% titration, not the initial pH.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the dilution isn't 40 cm\u00b3 because when you add 20 cm\u00b3 of water to 20 cm\u00b3 of solution, the volume becomes 40 cm\u00b3. So the concentration is 0.025 M, correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way the problem is phrased, the initial solution is 20 cm\u00b3 0.05 M acetic acid, and then 20 cm\u00b3 water is added, making a 40 cm\u00b3 solution. Then titrated with 0.1 M NaOH.\n\nSo the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid. So 0.001 moles.\n\nVolume of NaOH needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm\u00b3.\n\nAt 25% titration, 2.5 cm\u00b3 added. So 0.25 \u00d7 0.001 =0.00025 moles of NaOH.\n\nSo that gives 0.00025 moles of acetate and 0.00075 moles of acetic acid.\n\nSo the buffer equation applies.\n\nWait, but another thing to consider: when you add NaOH, which is a strong base, it will increase the solution's volume. So the concentrations are as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have considered the dilution when calculating the pH at 25% titration. But I did that by using the new volume (42.5 cm\u00b3) to find the concentrations.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the calculation for the buffer's pH again.\n\npH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\npKa is 4.73.\n\n[A^-] is 0.00025 moles in 0.0425 L \u2192 0.005882 M.\n\n[HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.\n\nRatio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.\n\nLog(1/3) is -0.477.\n\nSo pH =4.73 -0.477 =4.253, which is 4.25. So that's correct.\n\nSo the first part is 4.25, which is option A's first value.\n\nSo the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which matches option A.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as \"25% titration; equivalence point.\" So the first number is 25%, second is equivalence.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nSo according to this, option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, I thought that when you have a buffer with [A^-] = (1/3) [HA], the pH is pKa - 0.477, which is about 4.25. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately.\n\nLet me compute the exact value.\n\npKa = -log(1.85e-5) \u2192 let's compute it precisely.\n\n1.85e-5 \u2192 log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.2672 -5 \u2192 -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328, about 4.73.\n\nThe ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.00025/0.00075 = 1/3, same as before.\n\nLog(1/3) is log(0.3333) = -0.4771.\n\nSo pH =4.7328 -0.4771 =4.2557 \u2192 approximately 4.26.\n\nSo the first pH is 4.26, which matches option A.\n\nThe equivalence pH is 8.52, which is option A.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the initial dilution of acetic acid. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm\u00b3 (0.020 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M, giving **0.001 moles** of acetic acid. After adding 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm\u00b3 (0.040 L), resulting in a diluted concentration of **0.025 M**.\n\n### 25% Titration\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The volume of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence point volume. The equivalence point requires **10 cm\u00b3** of 0.1 M NaOH to neutralize 0.001 moles of acetic acid. Thus, at 25% titration, **2.5 cm\u00b3** of 0.1 M NaOH is added, providing **0.00025 moles** of NaOH. This neutralizes **0.00025 moles** of acetic acid, leaving **0.00075 moles** of un-neutralized acetic acid and producing **0.00025 moles** of acetate ions.\n\nThe total volume at this point is **42.5 cm\u00b3 (0.0425 L)**. The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:\n\n\\[\n[\\text{HA}] = \\frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \\approx 0.017647 \\, \\text{M}, \\quad [\\text{A}^-] = \\frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \\approx 0.005882 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = \\text{pKa} + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\text{pKa} = -\\log(1.85 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 4.73\\). The ratio \\(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} = \\frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \\approx 0.3333\\), and \\(\\log(0.3333) \\approx -0.477\\). Substituting:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 \\approx 4.25.\n\\]\n\nThus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### Equivalence Point\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming **0.001 moles** of acetate ions. The total volume is now **50.00 cm\u00b3 (0.050 L)**, giving a concentration of acetate ions:\n\n\\[\n[\\text{A}^-] = \\frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.02 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nThe acetate ion undergoes hydrolysis in water:\n\n\\[\n\\text{A}^- + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\leftrightarrow \\text{HA} + \\text{OH}^-.\n\\]\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is \\(K_b = \\frac{K_w}{K_a} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 5.405 \\times 10^{-10}\\).

Comparing with the options:\n\n- **A)** 4.26; 8.52  \n- **B)** 3.17; 6.73  \n- **C)** 4.73; 7.00  \n- **D)** 4.57; 6.92  \n\nThe correct answer is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this is a classic acid-base titration problem.\n\nAlright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. So the first thing I think is, diluting it will change the concentration. Oh right, because when you mix volumes, the concentration decreases. So I should calculate the new concentration after dilution.\n\nWait, the initial volume is 20 cm\u00b3 and concentration is 0.05 M. Diluting with another 20 cm\u00b3 of water makes the total volume 40 cm\u00b3. So the new concentration would be (0.05 M * 20 cm\u00b3) / 40 cm\u00b3. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 20 = 1 mmol. Divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.\n\nNext, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\nI think I need to find out what happens at 25% of the equivalence point and then at the equivalence point itself.\n\nFirst, let's find the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.\n\nMoles of acetic acid: original solution is 20 cm\u00b3 * 0.05 M. So 20 * 0.05 = 1 mmol. Or wait, 20 cm\u00b3 is 0.02 L, so 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. So 1 mmol.\n\nMolarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O.\n\nSo moles of NaOH needed at equivalence is 1 mmol. The volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration. So 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm\u00b3. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added.\n\nWait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added.\n\nNow, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions, and some remains.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid were 1 mmol. At 25% titration, 0.25 mmol of NaOH has reacted with acetic acid.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think: 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH is 0.0025 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol, which is 0.25 mmol. So yes, 0.25 mmol of NaOH reacts with 0.25 mmol of acetic acid, producing 0.25 mmol of acetate.\n\nSo the remaining acetic acid is 1 mmol - 0.25 mmol = 0.75 mmol. And the acetate produced is 0.25 mmol.\n\nBut wait, the total volume now is the initial diluted acetic acid (40 cm\u00b3) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm\u00b3). So 42.5 cm\u00b3 total. Hmm, but wait, when you add 2.5 cm\u00b3 to 40 cm\u00b3, it's 42.5 cm\u00b3. So the concentrations are:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.75 mmol / 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.75 /42.5 M. Let me calculate that. 0.75 /42.5 = 0.017647 M approximately.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.25 mmol /42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.25/42.5 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, this is a buffer solution because we have both the weak acid and its conjugate base. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nKa is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Let's see, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.\n\nNow, [A-] is 0.005882 M, [HA] is 0.017647 M.\n\nSo the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) \u2248 0.3333.\n\nLog(0.3333) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) \u2248 4.256. So approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. Option D is 4.57, which is higher.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. I think I may have made a mistake in the volumes. Because when you add 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH to 40 cm\u00b3, the total volume is 42.5 cm\u00b3. So the concentrations are correct as I did earlier.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26. That would point to option A or D. Let me see the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 4.26; 8.52\n\nOption D:4.57;6.92.\n\nWait, but let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.\n\nAt equivalence, the concentration of acetate is (total moles) / total volume.\n\nWait, the initial solution after dilution was 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L) of 0.025 M acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. So at equivalence, all that is converted to acetate, giving 0.001 mol of CH3COO^-.\n\nThe volume of NaOH added is 10 cm\u00b3 (from earlier). So total volume is 40 +10 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) \u22485.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction can be approximated because Kb is very small.\n\nThe concentration of OH- can be found using the formula for weak bases:\n\n[OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C)\n\nC is 0.02 M.\n\nSo sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98.\n\nSo pH = 14 -4.98 \u22489.02.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none of them have 9.02 as the equivalence point pH. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration. Let's re-calculate:\n\nAt equivalence, moles of acetate are 1 mmol (0.001 mol). The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (from acetic acid) +10 cm\u00b3 (NaOH) =50 cm\u00b3=0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.\n\nKb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 \u22485.405e-10.\n\nSo [OH-] = sqrt( (5.405e-10)(0.02) ) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5.\n\npOH is -log(1.04e-5) \u22484.98. So pH is 9.02. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I did something wrong.\n\nWait, let's check the options again. The options given are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB)3.17;6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nHmm, none have 9. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait. Did I miscalculate the Kb? Or perhaps the concentration?\n\nWait, another approach. Maybe I should have considered that the solution at equivalence is 0.02 M in acetate, but perhaps I should account for activity coefficients, but I think that's beyond the scope here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the pH at equivalence.\n\nWait, another way. The pH at equivalence for a weak acid titrated with a strong base can be found using the formula pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). But wait, at equivalence, HA is zero, so that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, considering the hydrolysis:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nSo Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) \u22485.405e-10.\n\nThe expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].\n\nAssuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, then:\n\nKb \u2248 x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.02, since x is very small.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = Kb *0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 \u2192 x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.\n\nSo [OH^-]=1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH =4.98 \u2192 pH=9.02. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 9. So perhaps I messed up the problem setup. Let me double-check the initial steps.\n\nWait, the initial solution: 20 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 cm\u00b3 of water. So 40 cm\u00b3 total. So the concentration is 0.025 M.\n\nMoles of acetic acid: 0.025 M *0.04 L=0.001 mol. Correct.\n\nAt equivalence, moles of NaOH needed: 0.001 mol. So volume is 0.001 /0.1=0.01 L=10 cm\u00b3. Correct.\n\nSo the total volume at equivalence is 40+10=50 cm\u00b3. So 0.05 L.\n\nSo acetate is 0.001 mol /0.05 L =0.02 M. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recompute Kb.\n\nKa is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 \u2192 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5.\n\n1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1 /1.85) * 1e-9 \u2248 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation seems right. Then why the pH is not matching any options?\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the solution is 0.02 M acetate. Because, wait, when you mix 40 cm\u00b3 of 0.025 M acetic acid with 10 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH, the total volume is 50 cm\u00b3. So the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. So 0.001 /0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not just acetate but also some unreacted acid? No, because at equivalence, all the acid has been neutralized.\n\nHmm, maybe I should use the exact method for the equivalence point pH, considering that acetate might not hydrolyze as much as I thought. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the initial dilution's effect is considered differently. Let me re-express all the steps.\n\nWait, the initial acetic acid is 20 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 *0.02 =0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L), so 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.\n\nAt equivalence, adding 10 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH (0.001 mol) gives 0.001 mol of acetate. Total volume 50 cm\u00b3, 0.05 L. So 0.001/0.05=0.02 M acetate.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the pH using the exact expression for hydrolysis, not the approximation.\n\nSo the hydrolysis equation: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-.\n\nThe expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].\n\nLet [OH^-] =x. Then [CH3COOH] =x.\n\nInitial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So at equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 -x.\n\nSo Kb = x^2 / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.\n\nAssuming x is very small, 0.02 -x \u22480.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 \u22485.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 \u2192 x=1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH=4.98 \u2192 pH=9.02.\n\nSo the pH at equivalence should be around 9.02. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOption A: pH at 25% is 4.26, equivalence 8.52.\n\nWait, 8.52 is much lower than my calculation. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I considered the solution at equivalence. Let me think: maybe the solution isn't 0.02 M acetate. Let me recalculate moles.\n\nWait, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M *0.02 L =0.001 mol. So when all is neutralized, you have 0.001 mol of acetate.\n\nThe total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm\u00b3=0.05 L.\n\nSo 0.001 mol /0.05 L=0.02 M. Correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the solution as just acetate, but maybe I should consider dilution in another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have considered the initial dilution and the addition of NaOH correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to have the solution before any NaOH is added, but no, the question says after adding 25% of the titrant.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I'm miscalculating the pH at the equivalence point. Let me think about the pH at equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula pH = \u00bd (pKa + pKw) because for a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the pH is around \u00bd (pKa +14). Let me compute that.\n\npKa is 4.733, so \u00bd (4.733 +14) = \u00bd (18.733)=9.3665. That's close to my previous calculation of 9.02, but not exactly. Hmm, but the options don't have anything near 9.36.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the initial solution when calculating the pH at 25% titration. Let me double-check that part.\n\nAt 25% titration, 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH is added. So moles of NaOH added:0.0025 L *0.1 M=0.00025 mol=0.25 mmol.\n\nSo moles of acetic acid initially:1 mmol.\n\nMoles reacted:0.25 mmol. So moles remaining:0.75 mmol.\n\nMoles of acetate formed:0.25 mmol.\n\nTotal volume:40 +2.5=42.5 cm\u00b3=0.0425 L.\n\nSo [CH3COOH]=0.75 mmol /42.5 cm\u00b3= 0.75/42.5 M.\n\nWait, 42.5 cm\u00b3 is 0.0425 L. So 0.75 mmol is 0.00075 mol. So [CH3COOH]=0.00075 /0.0425 \u22480.017647 M.\n\nSimilarly, [CH3COO^-] =0.00025 /0.0425 \u22480.005882 M.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).\n\npKa is 4.733.\n\nlog(0.005882/0.017647)=log(0.3333)= -0.477.\n\nSo pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So that's correct.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is about 4.26, which matches option A's first value. But then the equivalence pH is around 9.02, which isn't in the options.\n\nWait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should have considered the dilution of the NaOH at equivalence. But no, the total volume is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial solution after dilution has a concentration that I miscalculated.\n\nWait, initial 20 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. 20 cm\u00b3 is 0.02 L. So 0.05 *0.02=0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L), so 0.001/0.04=0.025 M. Correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is not 0.02 M, but something else. Wait, let's recheck the moles.\n\nAt equivalence, the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, correct. The total volume is 50 cm\u00b3 (0.05 L), so 0.001/0.05=0.02 M. Correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the pH using the exact quadratic formula instead of the approximation.\n\nSo Kb =5.405e-10.\n\nThe equation is x\u00b2/(0.02 -x)=5.405e-10.\n\nAssuming x is small, but let's see:\n\nx\u00b2 =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).\n\nx\u00b2 \u22485.405e-10 *0.02 \u21921.081e-11 \u2192 x\u22481.04e-5.\n\nBut let's see if x is 1.04e-5, then 0.02 -x is 0.02 -0.0000104 \u22480.0199896. So the change is negligible. So the approximation holds.\n\nSo the pH is 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the problem is that I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking about the pH when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, not 25% of the equivalence volume.\n\nWait, no, the question says \"25% titration\", which usually refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. So that would be 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH, as I did before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recheck.\n\nKa =1.85e-5.\n\nKw=1e-14.\n\nKb = Kw/Ka = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 \u22480.5405e-9=5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I used the wrong pKa. Let me check.\n\nKa=1.85e-5 \u2192 pKa=4.73. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let me think about the options again.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52.\n\nWait, 8.52 is lower than 9, so perhaps I'm missing something in the equivalence point calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence isn't just acetate but also some other factors. Or perhaps I should calculate it using the formula for a weak base.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should use the formula pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA]), but HA is zero here, so that approach won't help. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the solution as a buffer near the equivalence point, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the initial calculation of the equivalence point.\n\nWait, let me think: when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is in the basic region because the salt of a weak acid and strong base is basic.\n\nWait, but in the options, the equivalence pH is either 8.52, 6.73,7.00, or 6.92. These are all below 7 except 8.52.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I made a mistake in the way I calculated the equivalence point.\n\nWait, let me try another approach for the equivalence point. Maybe I should calculate it using the formula for a salt solution.\n\nThe formula for pH of a salt (CH3COO^-) is:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nBut at equivalence, [HA]=0, so that's not directly applicable. Alternatively, using the hydrolysis approach, as I did earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence has a higher concentration of OH- than I calculated, leading to a higher pH than I found. But according to my calculation, it's around 9.02.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the mistake is that I didn't account for activity coefficients or other factors, but that's unlikely in a problem at this level.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the initial concentration after dilution isn't 0.025 M. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal volume: 20 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L =0.001 mol.\n\nAfter adding 20 cm\u00b3 of water, total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). So concentration is 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.\n\nSo I'm confident that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the pH at the equivalence point. Let me try using the exact quadratic equation without approximation.\n\nSo Kb =5.405e-10.\n\nThe equation is x\u00b2/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.\n\nMultiply both sides by (0.02 -x):\n\nx\u00b2 =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).\n\nExpanding: x\u00b2 =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.\n\nBring all terms to one side: x\u00b2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 +4ac)]/(2a).\n\nHere, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.\n\nDiscriminant: b\u00b2 +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11).\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 *1e-20 \u224829.218e-20 =2.9218e-19.\n\n4ac=4 *1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11.\n\nWait, no, wait: the equation is x\u00b2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.\n\nSo a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.\n\nSo discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac \u2192 (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11).\n\nSo D=2.9218e-19 +4.324e-11.\n\nWait, 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19. So D\u22484.324e-11.\n\nSquare root of D is sqrt(4.324e-11) \u22486.576e-6.\n\nSo x = [ -5.405e-10 \u00b16.576e-6 ] / 2.\n\nWe take the positive root:\n\nx\u2248(6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 \u22486.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.\n\nSo [OH-]\u22483.288e-6 \u2192 pOH=5.48 \u2192 pH=8.52.\n\nAh! So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52. That matches option A's second value.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought x was around 1e-5, giving pH around 9.02. But with the exact calculation, I get x\u22483.29e-6, which gives pH=8.52.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So why did the approximation give a different result?\n\nAh, because when x is not negligible compared to 0.02, the approximation [A-] \u22480.02 isn't valid. In this case, 3.29e-6 is much smaller than 0.02, so why the difference?\n\nWait, let me compute 3.29e-6 /0.02 \u2192 1.645e-4, which is about 0.016%, so the approximation should hold. Hmm, but why the difference in results?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the quadratic approach. Let me recheck the calculations.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the quadratic formula. Let me re-calculate.\n\nThe quadratic equation is x\u00b2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.\n\nThe discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11).\n\nWait, because c is negative, so 4ac=4*1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11.\n\nBut in the quadratic formula, D = b\u00b2 -4ac. So since c is negative, -4ac becomes positive.\n\nSo D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.\n\nWait, 5.405e-10 squared is (5.405)^2 *1e-20 \u219229.218 *1e-20 =2.9218e-19.\n\n4 *1 *1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.\n\nSo D=2.9218e-19 +4.324e-11 \u22484.324e-11 (since 2.9e-19 is negligible).\n\nSo sqrt(D) \u2248sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.\n\nSo x = [ -5.405e-10 \u00b16.576e-6 ] / 2.\n\nThe positive solution is (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 \u2248 (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.\n\nSo [OH-] =3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH=5.48 \u2192 pH=8.52.\n\nAh, that's the correct calculation. So I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought the approximation gives a higher pH. So the correct pH at equivalence is around 8.52.\n\nSo now, the pH at 25% is 4.26, and at equivalence it's 8.52. Which matches option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the dilution of acetic acid and then determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid\nThe initial solution is 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. After diluting with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm\u00b3.

These values match the first option.\n\n**Answer: A**",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this is a classic acid-base titration problem.\n\nAlright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. So the first thing I think is, diluting it will change the concentration. Oh right, because when you mix volumes, the concentration decreases. So I should calculate the new concentration after dilution.\n\nWait, the initial volume is 20 cm\u00b3 and concentration is 0.05 M. Diluting with another 20 cm\u00b3 of water makes the total volume 40 cm\u00b3. So the new concentration would be (0.05 M * 20 cm\u00b3) / 40 cm\u00b3. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 20 = 1 mmol. Divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.\n\nNext, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\nI think I need to find out what happens at 25% of the equivalence point and then at the equivalence point itself.\n\nFirst, let's find the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.\n\nMoles of acetic acid: original solution is 20 cm\u00b3 * 0.05 M. So 20 * 0.05 = 1 mmol. Or wait, 20 cm\u00b3 is 0.02 L, so 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. So 1 mmol.\n\nMolarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O.\n\nSo moles of NaOH needed at equivalence is 1 mmol. The volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration. So 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm\u00b3. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added.\n\nWait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added.\n\nNow, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions, and some remains.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid were 1 mmol. At 25% titration, 0.25 mmol of NaOH has reacted with acetic acid.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think: 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH is 0.0025 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol, which is 0.25 mmol. So yes, 0.25 mmol of NaOH reacts with 0.25 mmol of acetic acid, producing 0.25 mmol of acetate.\n\nSo the remaining acetic acid is 1 mmol - 0.25 mmol = 0.75 mmol. And the acetate produced is 0.25 mmol.\n\nBut wait, the total volume now is the initial diluted acetic acid (40 cm\u00b3) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm\u00b3). So 42.5 cm\u00b3 total. Hmm, but wait, when you add 2.5 cm\u00b3 to 40 cm\u00b3, it's 42.5 cm\u00b3. So the concentrations are:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.75 mmol / 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.75 /42.5 M. Let me calculate that. 0.75 /42.5 = 0.017647 M approximately.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.25 mmol /42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.25/42.5 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, this is a buffer solution because we have both the weak acid and its conjugate base. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nHenderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nKa is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Let's see, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.\n\nNow, [A-] is 0.005882 M, [HA] is 0.017647 M.\n\nSo the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) \u2248 0.3333.\n\nLog(0.3333) is about -0.477.\n\nSo pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) \u2248 4.256. So approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. Option D is 4.57, which is higher.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. I think I may have made a mistake in the volumes. Because when you add 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH to 40 cm\u00b3, the total volume is 42.5 cm\u00b3. So the concentrations are correct as I did earlier.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26. That would point to option A or D. Let me see the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 4.26; 8.52\n\nOption D:4.57;6.92.\n\nWait, but let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.\n\nAt equivalence, the concentration of acetate is (total moles) / total volume.\n\nWait, the initial solution after dilution was 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L) of 0.025 M acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. So at equivalence, all that is converted to acetate, giving 0.001 mol of CH3COO^-.\n\nThe volume of NaOH added is 10 cm\u00b3 (from earlier). So total volume is 40 +10 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) \u22485.405e-10.\n\nSo Kb is 5.405e-10.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction can be approximated because Kb is very small.\n\nThe concentration of OH- can be found using the formula for weak bases:\n\n[OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C)\n\nC is 0.02 M.\n\nSo sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98.\n\nSo pH = 14 -4.98 \u22489.02.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none of them have 9.02 as the equivalence point pH. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration. Let's re-calculate:\n\nAt equivalence, moles of acetate are 1 mmol (0.001 mol). The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (from acetic acid) +10 cm\u00b3 (NaOH) =50 cm\u00b3=0.05 L.\n\nSo [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.\n\nKb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 \u22485.405e-10.\n\nSo [OH-] = sqrt( (5.405e-10)(0.02) ) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5.\n\npOH is -log(1.04e-5) \u22484.98. So pH is 9.02. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I did something wrong.\n\nWait, let's check the options again. The options given are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB)3.17;6.73\n\nC)4.73;7.00\n\nD)4.57;6.92\n\nHmm, none have 9. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait. Did I miscalculate the Kb? Or perhaps the concentration?\n\nWait, another approach. Maybe I should have considered that the solution at equivalence is 0.02 M in acetate, but perhaps I should account for activity coefficients, but I think that's beyond the scope here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the pH at equivalence.\n\nWait, another way. The pH at equivalence for a weak acid titrated with a strong base can be found using the formula pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). But wait, at equivalence, HA is zero, so that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, considering the hydrolysis:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nSo Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) \u22485.405e-10.\n\nThe expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].\n\nAssuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, then:\n\nKb \u2248 x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.02, since x is very small.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = Kb *0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 \u2192 x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.\n\nSo [OH^-]=1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH =4.98 \u2192 pH=9.02. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 9. So perhaps I messed up the problem setup. Let me double-check the initial steps.\n\nWait, the initial solution: 20 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 cm\u00b3 of water. So 40 cm\u00b3 total. So the concentration is 0.025 M.\n\nMoles of acetic acid: 0.025 M *0.04 L=0.001 mol. Correct.\n\nAt equivalence, moles of NaOH needed: 0.001 mol. So volume is 0.001 /0.1=0.01 L=10 cm\u00b3. Correct.\n\nSo the total volume at equivalence is 40+10=50 cm\u00b3. So 0.05 L.\n\nSo acetate is 0.001 mol /0.05 L =0.02 M. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recompute Kb.\n\nKa is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 \u2192 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5.\n\n1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1 /1.85) * 1e-9 \u2248 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation seems right. Then why the pH is not matching any options?\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the solution is 0.02 M acetate. Because, wait, when you mix 40 cm\u00b3 of 0.025 M acetic acid with 10 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH, the total volume is 50 cm\u00b3. So the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. So 0.001 /0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not just acetate but also some unreacted acid? No, because at equivalence, all the acid has been neutralized.\n\nHmm, maybe I should use the exact method for the equivalence point pH, considering that acetate might not hydrolyze as much as I thought. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the initial dilution's effect is considered differently. Let me re-express all the steps.\n\nWait, the initial acetic acid is 20 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 *0.02 =0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L), so 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.\n\nAt equivalence, adding 10 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH (0.001 mol) gives 0.001 mol of acetate. Total volume 50 cm\u00b3, 0.05 L. So 0.001/0.05=0.02 M acetate.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the pH using the exact expression for hydrolysis, not the approximation.\n\nSo the hydrolysis equation: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-.\n\nThe expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].\n\nLet [OH^-] =x. Then [CH3COOH] =x.\n\nInitial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So at equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 -x.\n\nSo Kb = x^2 / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.\n\nAssuming x is very small, 0.02 -x \u22480.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 \u22485.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 \u2192 x=1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH=4.98 \u2192 pH=9.02.\n\nSo the pH at equivalence should be around 9.02. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOption A: pH at 25% is 4.26, equivalence 8.52.\n\nWait, 8.52 is much lower than my calculation. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I considered the solution at equivalence. Let me think: maybe the solution isn't 0.02 M acetate. Let me recalculate moles.\n\nWait, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M *0.02 L =0.001 mol. So when all is neutralized, you have 0.001 mol of acetate.\n\nThe total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm\u00b3=0.05 L.\n\nSo 0.001 mol /0.05 L=0.02 M. Correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the solution as just acetate, but maybe I should consider dilution in another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have considered the initial dilution and the addition of NaOH correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to have the solution before any NaOH is added, but no, the question says after adding 25% of the titrant.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I'm miscalculating the pH at the equivalence point. Let me think about the pH at equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula pH = \u00bd (pKa + pKw) because for a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the pH is around \u00bd (pKa +14). Let me compute that.\n\npKa is 4.733, so \u00bd (4.733 +14) = \u00bd (18.733)=9.3665. That's close to my previous calculation of 9.02, but not exactly. Hmm, but the options don't have anything near 9.36.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the initial solution when calculating the pH at 25% titration. Let me double-check that part.\n\nAt 25% titration, 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH is added. So moles of NaOH added:0.0025 L *0.1 M=0.00025 mol=0.25 mmol.\n\nSo moles of acetic acid initially:1 mmol.\n\nMoles reacted:0.25 mmol. So moles remaining:0.75 mmol.\n\nMoles of acetate formed:0.25 mmol.\n\nTotal volume:40 +2.5=42.5 cm\u00b3=0.0425 L.\n\nSo [CH3COOH]=0.75 mmol /42.5 cm\u00b3= 0.75/42.5 M.\n\nWait, 42.5 cm\u00b3 is 0.0425 L. So 0.75 mmol is 0.00075 mol. So [CH3COOH]=0.00075 /0.0425 \u22480.017647 M.\n\nSimilarly, [CH3COO^-] =0.00025 /0.0425 \u22480.005882 M.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).\n\npKa is 4.733.\n\nlog(0.005882/0.017647)=log(0.3333)= -0.477.\n\nSo pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So that's correct.\n\nSo the pH at 25% is about 4.26, which matches option A's first value. But then the equivalence pH is around 9.02, which isn't in the options.\n\nWait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should have considered the dilution of the NaOH at equivalence. But no, the total volume is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial solution after dilution has a concentration that I miscalculated.\n\nWait, initial 20 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. 20 cm\u00b3 is 0.02 L. So 0.05 *0.02=0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L), so 0.001/0.04=0.025 M. Correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is not 0.02 M, but something else. Wait, let's recheck the moles.\n\nAt equivalence, the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, correct. The total volume is 50 cm\u00b3 (0.05 L), so 0.001/0.05=0.02 M. Correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the pH using the exact quadratic formula instead of the approximation.\n\nSo Kb =5.405e-10.\n\nThe equation is x\u00b2/(0.02 -x)=5.405e-10.\n\nAssuming x is small, but let's see:\n\nx\u00b2 =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).\n\nx\u00b2 \u22485.405e-10 *0.02 \u21921.081e-11 \u2192 x\u22481.04e-5.\n\nBut let's see if x is 1.04e-5, then 0.02 -x is 0.02 -0.0000104 \u22480.0199896. So the change is negligible. So the approximation holds.\n\nSo the pH is 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the problem is that I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking about the pH when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, not 25% of the equivalence volume.\n\nWait, no, the question says \"25% titration\", which usually refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. So that would be 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH, as I did before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recheck.\n\nKa =1.85e-5.\n\nKw=1e-14.\n\nKb = Kw/Ka = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 \u22480.5405e-9=5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I used the wrong pKa. Let me check.\n\nKa=1.85e-5 \u2192 pKa=4.73. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let me think about the options again.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52.\n\nWait, 8.52 is lower than 9, so perhaps I'm missing something in the equivalence point calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence isn't just acetate but also some other factors. Or perhaps I should calculate it using the formula for a weak base.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should use the formula pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA]), but HA is zero here, so that approach won't help. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the solution as a buffer near the equivalence point, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the initial calculation of the equivalence point.\n\nWait, let me think: when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is in the basic region because the salt of a weak acid and strong base is basic.\n\nWait, but in the options, the equivalence pH is either 8.52, 6.73,7.00, or 6.92. These are all below 7 except 8.52.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I made a mistake in the way I calculated the equivalence point.\n\nWait, let me try another approach for the equivalence point. Maybe I should calculate it using the formula for a salt solution.\n\nThe formula for pH of a salt (CH3COO^-) is:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nBut at equivalence, [HA]=0, so that's not directly applicable. Alternatively, using the hydrolysis approach, as I did earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence has a higher concentration of OH- than I calculated, leading to a higher pH than I found. But according to my calculation, it's around 9.02.\n\nHmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the mistake is that I didn't account for activity coefficients or other factors, but that's unlikely in a problem at this level.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the initial concentration after dilution isn't 0.025 M. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal volume: 20 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L =0.001 mol.\n\nAfter adding 20 cm\u00b3 of water, total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). So concentration is 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.\n\nSo I'm confident that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the pH at the equivalence point. Let me try using the exact quadratic equation without approximation.\n\nSo Kb =5.405e-10.\n\nThe equation is x\u00b2/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.\n\nMultiply both sides by (0.02 -x):\n\nx\u00b2 =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).\n\nExpanding: x\u00b2 =1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.\n\nBring all terms to one side: x\u00b2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 +4ac)]/(2a).\n\nHere, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.\n\nDiscriminant: b\u00b2 +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11).\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 *1e-20 \u224829.218e-20 =2.9218e-19.\n\n4ac=4 *1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11.\n\nWait, no, wait: the equation is x\u00b2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.\n\nSo a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.\n\nSo discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac \u2192 (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11).\n\nSo D=2.9218e-19 +4.324e-11.\n\nWait, 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19. So D\u22484.324e-11.\n\nSquare root of D is sqrt(4.324e-11) \u22486.576e-6.\n\nSo x = [ -5.405e-10 \u00b16.576e-6 ] / 2.\n\nWe take the positive root:\n\nx\u2248(6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 \u22486.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.\n\nSo [OH-]\u22483.288e-6 \u2192 pOH=5.48 \u2192 pH=8.52.\n\nAh! So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52. That matches option A's second value.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought x was around 1e-5, giving pH around 9.02. But with the exact calculation, I get x\u22483.29e-6, which gives pH=8.52.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So why did the approximation give a different result?\n\nAh, because when x is not negligible compared to 0.02, the approximation [A-] \u22480.02 isn't valid. In this case, 3.29e-6 is much smaller than 0.02, so why the difference?\n\nWait, let me compute 3.29e-6 /0.02 \u2192 1.645e-4, which is about 0.016%, so the approximation should hold. Hmm, but why the difference in results?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the quadratic approach. Let me recheck the calculations.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the quadratic formula. Let me re-calculate.\n\nThe quadratic equation is x\u00b2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.\n\nThe discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11).\n\nWait, because c is negative, so 4ac=4*1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11.\n\nBut in the quadratic formula, D = b\u00b2 -4ac. So since c is negative, -4ac becomes positive.\n\nSo D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.\n\nWait, 5.405e-10 squared is (5.405)^2 *1e-20 \u219229.218 *1e-20 =2.9218e-19.\n\n4 *1 *1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.\n\nSo D=2.9218e-19 +4.324e-11 \u22484.324e-11 (since 2.9e-19 is negligible).\n\nSo sqrt(D) \u2248sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.\n\nSo x = [ -5.405e-10 \u00b16.576e-6 ] / 2.\n\nThe positive solution is (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 \u2248 (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.\n\nSo [OH-] =3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH=5.48 \u2192 pH=8.52.\n\nAh, that's the correct calculation. So I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought the approximation gives a higher pH. So the correct pH at equivalence is around 8.52.\n\nSo now, the pH at 25% is 4.26, and at equivalence it's 8.52. Which matches option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the dilution of acetic acid and then determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid\nThe initial solution is 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. After diluting with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm\u00b3. The new concentration is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Concentration after dilution} = \\frac{\\text{Initial moles of acetic acid}}{\\text{Total volume}} = \\frac{0.05 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.02 \\, \\text{L}}{0.04 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.025 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the diluted acetic acid has a concentration of 0.025 M.\n\n### Step 2: Equivalence Point\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH. The moles of acetic acid initially present are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.02 \\, \\text{L} = 0.001 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nSince the reaction is 1:1, the moles of NaOH required are also 0.001 mol. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume of NaOH} = \\frac{\\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \\frac{0.001 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.1 \\, \\text{M}} = 0.01 \\, \\text{L} = 10 \\, \\text{cm}^3.\n\\]\n\nAt the equivalence point, the total volume of the solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \\, \\text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \\, \\text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \\, \\text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \\, \\text{L}.\n\\]\n\nThe concentration of acetate ions (\\( \\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^- \\)) at the equivalence point is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Concentration of acetate} = \\frac{\\text{Moles of acetate}}{\\text{Total volume}} = \\frac{0.001 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.05 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.02 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nThe solution at the equivalence point contains only acetate ions, which hydrolyze in water:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^- + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\leftrightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH} + \\text{OH}^-.\n\\]\n\nThe \\( K_b \\) for acetate is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nK_b = \\frac{K_w}{K_a} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 5.405 \\times 10^{-10}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the formula for weak base hydrolysis:\n\n\\[\n[\\text{OH}^-] = \\sqrt{K_b \\cdot C} = \\sqrt{(5.405 \\times 10^{-10}) \\cdot 0.02} \\approx 3.29 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nThe pOH is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pOH} = -\\log{[\\text{OH}^-]} = -\\log{(3.29 \\times 10^{-6})} \\approx 5.48.\n\\]\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 14 - \\text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: pH at 25% Titration\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (10 cm\u00b3) has been added. Thus, 2.5 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.0025 \\, \\text{L} = 0.00025 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nThis reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nThe moles of acetate formed are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nThe total volume of the solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \\, \\text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \\, \\text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \\, \\text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \\, \\text{L}.\n\\]\n\nThe concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:\n\n\\[\n[\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH}] = \\frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \\approx 0.0176 \\, \\text{M}, \\quad [\\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^-] = \\frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \\approx 0.0059 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = \\text{p}K_a + \\log{\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right)}.\n\\]\n\nThe \\( \\text{p}K_a \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{p}K_a = -\\log{(1.85 \\times 10^{-5})} \\approx 4.73.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 4.73 + \\log{\\left(\\frac{0.0059}{0.0176}\\right)} = 4.73 + \\log{(0.333)} \\approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match the first option.\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. \n\nAlright, first, let me read the problem again carefully. So, we have 20.00 cm\u00b3 (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka is given as 1.85e-5.\n\nWait, so what's the plan here? I think I should break this into parts. First, find out what the diluted acetic acid solution is. Then, determine the equivalence point volume. After that, calculate the pH at 25% of that equivalence point and then at the equivalence point.\n\nLet me start by calculating the diluted concentration. So, when we mix 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 mL of water, the total volume is 40 mL. The number of moles of acetic acid before dilution is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration is moles/volume. So, 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, that's 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me check that calculation. 20 mL is 0.02 L. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then, after adding 20 mL (0.02 L) water, the total volume is 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNext, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O. So, the mole ratio is 1:1.\n\nSo, to find the equivalence point, I need the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles were 0.001, so the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL.\n\nWait, but wait, that's only when you're at equivalence. But the question is about 25% titration. So, 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL of NaOH added.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 25% of the equivalence point means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, the moles of NaOH added would be 25% of 0.001 moles, which is 0.00025 moles. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume is 0.00025 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L = 2.5 mL. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, now, for the pH at 25% titration. Let me think. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been converted into acetate ions. So, it's a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should work here.\n\nBut wait, to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, I need the concentrations of acetic acid and its conjugate base. Let me think about the moles. Initially, we had 0.001 moles of acetic acid. At 25% titration, 25% of that is neutralized. So, moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 * 0.75 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed = 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume of the solution when 2.5 mL of NaOH is added. Wait, the initial solution after dilution was 40 mL. Then, adding 2.5 mL of NaOH solution: so total volume is 42.5 mL. Wait, is that right? Because 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL.\n\nSo, the concentrations are:\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L \u2248 0.017647 M.\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Let's see, 1.85e-5 is 1.85 * 10^-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.\n\nNow, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) \u2248 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.\n\nSo, pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) \u2248 4.256. So approximately 4.26. Let me look at the options. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute the exact values.\n\nMoles CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol. Volume is 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.\n\nRatio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.3333.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So that's the first part.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions. The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic.\n\nThe moles of NaOH at equivalence are 0.001 mol. The total volume is initial 40 mL plus 10 mL NaOH added, so 50 mL or 0.05 L.\n\nSo, concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-.\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThen, the hydrolysis equation is governed by Kb. The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the ICE table.\n\nAt equilibrium:\nCH3COO^-: 0.02 - x\nH2O: negligible\nCH3COOH: x\nOH^-: x\n\nSo, Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.02, since x is very small compared to 0.02.\n\nSo, x^2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo, [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 M. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u2248 9.02.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the options, none of them have 9.02. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5. So, Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85)*1e-9 \u2248 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nThen, Kb = 5.405e-10. So, (x^2)/0.02 = 5.405e-10 \u2192 x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 1.04e-5.\n\nSo, [OH^-] is 1.04e-5. pOH is log(1e-5) is 5, but since it's 1.04e-5, pOH is a bit less than 5. So, pOH \u2248 4.98, pH \u2248 9.02.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 9.02. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73  \n\nC) 4.73; 7.00\n\nD) 4.57; 6.92  \n\nHmm, none of these have 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, at equivalence point, the solution is a sodium acetate solution. The concentration is 0.02 M. So, the acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M. So, using Kb correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up the equation more accurately. Let me do that.\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nLet me let x = [OH^-] = [CH3COOH]. So,\n\nx^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.\n\nAssuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate denominator as 0.02.\n\nx^2 \u2248 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5. So, [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is 4.98, pH is 9.02.\n\nBut none of the options have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the initial moles.\n\nWait, let's go back. The initial moles of acetic acid: 20 mL * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. Then, after adding 20 mL water, it's 40 mL, so 0.025 M. Correct.\n\nThen, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 10 mL. Correct.\n\nAt equivalence, the volume is 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL, 0.05 L. So, [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nKa is 1.85e-5. So, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nWait, wait a second. Oh! Wait, no, wait. Wait, Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 \u2248 0.5405e-9 \u2192 5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nHmm, so the Kb is correct. Then, why is the pH not matching any of the options?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the exact solution without the approximation. Let's try that.\n\nx^2 = Kb * (0.02 - x) \u2192 x^2 + Kb x - 0.02 Kb = 0.\n\nWait, but that's a quadratic equation, which can be solved as x = [-Kb \u00b1 sqrt(Kb\u00b2 + 4 * 0.02 * Kb)] / 2.\n\nBut given that Kb is so small, x would be much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds. So, the initial calculation is correct.\n\nBut why are the options not showing 9.02? Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the equivalence point. Let me see. The question says, \"dilute 20 cm\u00b3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm\u00b3 water.\" So, 20 + 20 = 40 cm\u00b3. Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So, 0.001 mol NaOH needed. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is 10 mL. So, total volume at equivalence is 40 +10 =50 mL. Correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the solution at equivalence is a buffer? No, no. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted into acetate. So, solution is acetate ion in water. Correct.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recalculate.\n\nMoles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Yes.\n\nDiluted with 20 mL water: total 40 mL, so 0.04 L. So, 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the pH at equivalence should be around 9.02. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, wait, maybe the question is about 25% of the titration solution, not 25% of the equivalence point. Wait, no. The question says, \"25% titration\". So, that refers to 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So, that part is correct.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the first part. Let me recalculate the 25% titration.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the dilution. Let me go through that again.\n\nWait, when you add 20 mL of water to 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid, the total volume is 40 mL. The concentration becomes 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M. Correct.\n\nAt 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is added. So, moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, moles of acetic acid neutralized: 0.00025 mol. So, remaining acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\npH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647) \u2192 log(0.333) \u2248 -0.477.\n\nSo, pH \u2248 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is 4.26. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the pH at 25% is 4.26, and at equivalence it's about 9.02.\n\nBut the options don't have 9.02. So, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, looking at option A: 4.26; 8.52. Hmm, the first part matches, but the equivalence point is 8.52, not 9.02. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I forgot that the solution at equivalence is acetate, but I should consider that the acetate comes from a strong base, so maybe activity coefficients or something else. No, I think the approach is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using the same temperature, 25\u00b0C, so no issues with Kw.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the NaOH is being added to the diluted solution, and the dilution is in the calculation of the pH. Wait, no, the pH at equivalence is just based on the acetate concentration and Kb.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I used the wrong Ka value. Wait, the Ka given is 1.85e-5. So, pKa is 4.733, which is correct.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the pH at equivalence.\n\nWait, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M.\n\nSo, Kb = 5.405e-10.\n\nSo, Kb = x^2 / 0.02 \u2192 x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approximately 1.04e-5.\n\nSo, [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH = 4.98 \u2192 pH = 14 -4.98 = 9.02.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the options have a mistake, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using another approach. Let's try using the formula for a weak base.\n\nThe formula is pH = 14 - 0.5 (pKa - log C), where C is the concentration of the conjugate base.\n\nWait, wait, the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base is:\n\npH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) \u2192 but at equivalence, [HA] is zero, so that's not helpful. Alternatively, using the hydrolysis formula for acetate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximation.\n\nSo, Kb = x^2 / (0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.\n\nAssuming x is small, 0.02 -x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo, x^2 \u2248 0.02 * 5.405e-10 \u2192 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 1.04e-5.\n\npOH = log(1.04e-5) \u2192 log(1.04) is 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -4.983. So, pOH \u22484.983 \u2192 pH=9.017.\n\nSo, still around 9.02. But none of the options have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem was about the pH at 25% of the titration volume, not 25% of the equivalence point. No, the question says 25% titration, which is 25% of the equivalence point.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the initial dilution. Let me recheck the initial steps.\n\nWait, initial solution: 20 mL 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 mL water. So, new concentration is 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M. Correct.\n\nAt 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Moles NaOH: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. So, moles of acetic acid neutralized: 0.00025. Remaining HA: 0.00075 mol. Moles of A^-: 0.00025 mol. Correct.\n\nTotal volume 42.5 mL. So, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M. [A^-] \u2248 0.005882 M. Ratio is 1/3. So, pH = pKa + log(1/3) \u2192 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. So, 4.26.\n\nSo, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But its equivalence point is 8.52, which is lower than what I calculated. So, perhaps the mistake is in the equivalence point.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not just the acetate, but the solution includes the sodium ions as well. Wait, but sodium is a spectator ion and doesn't affect the pH. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence using the exact formula without the approximation. Let's try that.\n\nThe equation is x^2 = Kb*(0.02 -x). Let me plug in Kb =5.405e-10.\n\nx^2 +5.405e-10 x - 0.02 *5.405e-10 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-5.405e-10 \u00b1 sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 + 4 * 1 * 0.02 *5.405e-10 ) ] / 2.\n\nBut since x is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nThe discriminant is (5.405e-10)^2 + 4 *1*0.02*5.405e-10.\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n(5.405e-10)^2 = approx 2.92e-19.\n\n4*0.02*5.405e-10 = 0.08 *5.405e-10 =4.324e-11.\n\nSo, sqrt(2.92e-19 +4.324e-11) \u2248 sqrt(4.324e-11) \u2248 6.576e-6.\n\nSo, x \u2248 [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 \u2248 (6.576e-6)/2 \u2248 3.288e-6.\n\nWait, that's larger than our initial approximation. So, [OH^-] =3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH =5.485 \u2192 pH=8.515, which is approximately 8.52.\n\nOh! So, that's why option A has pH 8.52 at equivalence. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation earlier, leading to the wrong pH.\n\nWait, wait, but why did the approximation give me 9.02, while the exact solution gives 8.52?\n\nBecause the assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 isn't valid here. Let me see: x is 3.288e-6, which is 3.288e-6 compared to 0.02 (which is 2e-2). 3.288e-6 is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation should hold. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic solution.\n\nWait, the equation is x^2 = Kb*(0.02 -x).\n\nSo, x^2 + Kb x - 0.02 Kb = 0.\n\nSo, a=1, b=Kb, c= -0.02 Kb.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 +4ac)]/(2a).\n\nWait, but c is -0.02 Kb, so 4ac=4 *1*(-0.02 Kb) = -0.08 Kb.\n\nWait, wait, no, a=1, b= Kb, c= -0.02 Kb.\n\nSo, 4ac=4 *1* (-0.02 Kb) = -0.08 Kb.\n\nSo, the discriminant is (Kb)^2 + 4ac \u2192 (Kb)^2 - 0.08 Kb.\n\nWait, but that would make the discriminant Kb^2 - 0.08 Kb.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because Kb is positive, so 4ac is negative. So, the discriminant is Kb\u00b2 + (4ac) \u2192 Kb\u00b2 - 0.08 Kb.\n\nWait, but if Kb is 5.405e-10, then Kb\u00b2 is about 2.92e-19, and 0.08 Kb is 4.324e-11. So, 2.92e-19 -4.324e-11 is a negative number. That can't be, because sqrt of negative isn't real. So, I must have made a mistake in the quadratic setup.\n\nWait, no, the equation is x^2 = Kb (0.02 -x). So, x^2 + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.\n\nSo, a=1, b=Kb, c= -0.02 Kb.\n\nSo, discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (Kb)^2 -4 *1*(-0.02 Kb) = (Kb)^2 + 0.08 Kb.\n\nAh, I see, I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. So, discriminant is (Kb)^2 + 0.08 Kb.\n\nSo, let's compute that:\n\n(Kb)^2 = (5.405e-10)^2 \u2248 2.92e-19.\n\n0.08 Kb = 0.08 *5.405e-10 \u22484.324e-11.\n\nSo, D=2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 \u2248 4.324e-11, since 2.92e-19 is negligible.\n\nSo, sqrt(D) \u2248 sqrt(4.324e-11) \u2248 6.576e-6.\n\nSo, x = [-Kb + sqrt(D)]/(2a) \u2192 [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 \u2192 approximately (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.\n\nSo, [OH^-] =3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH=5.485 \u2192 pH=14-5.485=8.515, which is about 8.52.\n\nAh! So, that's why option A has 8.52 as the equivalence point pH.\n\nWait, but why did the approximation give me a different answer? Because I assumed x is much smaller than 0.02, but in reality, x is 3.288e-6, which is 3.288e-6 compared to 0.02, which is 2e-2. So, 3.288e-6 is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation should have worked. But in that case, why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I think I see the mistake. Because when I approximated x^2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02, I neglected the Kb x term in the denominator. But in reality, Kb is so small that Kb x is negligible compared to 0.02. Let me check:\n\nKb is 5.405e-10. x is 3.288e-6. Kb x =5.405e-10 *3.288e-6 \u2248 1.78e-15, which is negligible compared to 0.02. So, the approximation should hold, but when I used the exact calculation, I got a different result. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me recompute.\n\nWait, the exact solution gives [OH^-] \u22483.288e-6, which leads to pH \u22488.52, which is option A.\n\nBut earlier, when I assumed x is much smaller, I got [OH^-] \u22481.04e-5, leading to pH\u22489.02. But that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me recalculate the exact solution.\n\nWait, x^2 + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.\n\nPlugging in Kb=5.405e-10, 0.02 Kb=1.081e-11.\n\nSo, equation: x^2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [ -5.405e-10 \u00b1 sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 *1.081e-11 ) ]/(2).\n\nCompute the discriminant:\n\n(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.92e-19.\n\n4*1*1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.\n\nSo, sqrt(2.92e-19 +4.324e-11) = sqrt(4.324e-11) \u22486.576e-6.\n\nSo, x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 \u2192 approximately (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.\n\nSo, [OH^-]=3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH=5.485 \u2192 pH=8.515.\n\nSo, the exact solution gives pH\u22488.52.\n\nWait, but when I used the approximation, I got pH\u22489.02. So, that's a big discrepancy. But why is the approximation not working?\n\nAh, perhaps because Kb is not that small, and the approximation isn't valid. Let me check the size of Kb.\n\nKb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M. So, the approximation is valid when Kb << concentration. Here, 5.405e-10 << 0.02, so the approximation should be valid. But why the discrepancy in the results?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me try plugging x=3.288e-6 into the Kb equation.\n\nx^2 = (3.288e-6)^2 \u2248 1.081e-11.\n\nKb*(0.02 -x) \u22485.405e-10 * (0.02 -3.288e-6) \u22485.405e-10 *0.0199967 \u21925.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11.\n\nSo, x^2 =1.081e-11, which matches. So, the exact solution is correct.\n\nBut then why does the approximation give a different result?\n\nWait, because when I used the approximation, I wrote x^2= Kb *0.02 \u2192 x= sqrt(Kb *0.02)= sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.\n\nBut wait, the exact solution gave x=3.288e-6, which is about a third of that. So, why the big difference?\n\nAh, I think I see the mistake. Oh wait, no, because when I wrote x^2= Kb * (0.02 -x), but in the approximation, I wrote x^2= Kb *0.02. But in reality, x is not zero, so 0.02 -x is 0.02*(1 - x/(0.02)).\n\nBut if x is much smaller than 0.02, then 0.02 -x \u22480.02. So, why the exact solution gives a much smaller x than the approximation?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact solution. Let me compute Kb*(0.02 -x) for x=3.288e-6.\n\nKb=5.405e-10, 0.02 -x=0.0199967.\n\nSo, Kb*(0.02 -x)=5.405e-10 *0.0199967 \u22481.081e-11.\n\nx^2= (3.288e-6)^2=1.081e-11. So, yes, it's correct.\n\nBut the approximation x^2=Kb*0.02 \u2192 x=1.04e-5.\n\nBut that's three times larger than the exact solution. Hmm, why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps the approximation x^2= Kb*(0.02 -x) is not correct. Because the correct equation is x^2= Kb*(0.02 -x). So, the approximation x^2= Kb*0.02 would only be valid if x is negligible compared to 0.02, which it is. But why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct equation is x^2 = Kb*(0.02 -x). So, when x is much smaller than 0.02, 0.02 -x \u22480.02, so x^2\u2248Kb*0.02 \u2192 x\u2248sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.\n\nBut the exact solution is x\u22483.288e-6, which is about a third of that. So, perhaps the approximation isn't valid, but why?\n\nWait, perhaps because the approximation leads to x=1.04e-5, but when you plug that back into 0.02 -x, it's 0.02 -1.04e-5 \u22480.01999, which is very close to 0.02, so the approximation should hold. But why the exact solution is so different?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the quadratic equation.\n\nWait, let me recompute the quadratic solution.\n\nEquation: x^2 + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.\n\nKb =5.405e-10.\n\nSo, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -0.02 *5.405e-10= -1.081e-11.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) =2.92e-19 +4.324e-11\u22484.324e-11.\n\nsqrt(D)=6.576e-6.\n\nx= [-b + sqrt(D)]/(2a)= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/(2).\n\nWhich is approximately (6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6.\n\nSo, the exact solution is x=3.288e-6, which is about 3.288e-6.\n\nWait, but when I use the approximation, I get x=1.04e-5, which is about 3 times larger than the exact solution. That's a big difference, and it's causing the pH to be higher than it should be.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct pH at equivalence is 8.52, as per option A. So, the answer would be A) 4.26;8.52.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because the initial approximation gave a different result. But the exact solution seems to give pH=8.52, which matches option A.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence point it's approximately 8.52. So, option A is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. \n\nAlright, first, let me read the problem again carefully. So, we have 20.00 cm\u00b3 (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka is given as 1.85e-5.\n\nWait, so what's the plan here? I think I should break this into parts. First, find out what the diluted acetic acid solution is. Then, determine the equivalence point volume. After that, calculate the pH at 25% of that equivalence point and then at the equivalence point.\n\nLet me start by calculating the diluted concentration. So, when we mix 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 mL of water, the total volume is 40 mL. The number of moles of acetic acid before dilution is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration is moles/volume. So, 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, that's 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me check that calculation. 20 mL is 0.02 L. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then, after adding 20 mL (0.02 L) water, the total volume is 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNext, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O. So, the mole ratio is 1:1.\n\nSo, to find the equivalence point, I need the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles were 0.001, so the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL.\n\nWait, but wait, that's only when you're at equivalence. But the question is about 25% titration. So, 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL of NaOH added.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 25% of the equivalence point means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, the moles of NaOH added would be 25% of 0.001 moles, which is 0.00025 moles. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume is 0.00025 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L = 2.5 mL. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, now, for the pH at 25% titration. Let me think. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been converted into acetate ions. So, it's a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should work here.\n\nBut wait, to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, I need the concentrations of acetic acid and its conjugate base. Let me think about the moles. Initially, we had 0.001 moles of acetic acid. At 25% titration, 25% of that is neutralized. So, moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 * 0.75 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed = 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume of the solution when 2.5 mL of NaOH is added. Wait, the initial solution after dilution was 40 mL. Then, adding 2.5 mL of NaOH solution: so total volume is 42.5 mL. Wait, is that right? Because 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL.\n\nSo, the concentrations are:\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L \u2248 0.017647 M.\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nThe pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Let's see, 1.85e-5 is 1.85 * 10^-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.\n\nNow, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) \u2248 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.\n\nSo, pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) \u2248 4.256. So approximately 4.26. Let me look at the options. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute the exact values.\n\nMoles CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol. Volume is 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.\n\nRatio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.3333.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So that's the first part.\n\nNow, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions. The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic.\n\nThe moles of NaOH at equivalence are 0.001 mol. The total volume is initial 40 mL plus 10 mL NaOH added, so 50 mL or 0.05 L.\n\nSo, concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-.\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThen, the hydrolysis equation is governed by Kb. The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the ICE table.\n\nAt equilibrium:\nCH3COO^-: 0.02 - x\nH2O: negligible\nCH3COOH: x\nOH^-: x\n\nSo, Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 / 0.02, since x is very small compared to 0.02.\n\nSo, x^2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nx = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo, [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 M. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u2248 9.02.\n\nWait, but wait, looking at the options, none of them have 9.02. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5. So, Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85)*1e-9 \u2248 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nThen, Kb = 5.405e-10. So, (x^2)/0.02 = 5.405e-10 \u2192 x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 1.04e-5.\n\nSo, [OH^-] is 1.04e-5. pOH is log(1e-5) is 5, but since it's 1.04e-5, pOH is a bit less than 5. So, pOH \u2248 4.98, pH \u2248 9.02.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 9.02. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73  \n\nC) 4.73; 7.00\n\nD) 4.57; 6.92  \n\nHmm, none of these have 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, at equivalence point, the solution is a sodium acetate solution. The concentration is 0.02 M. So, the acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M. So, using Kb correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up the equation more accurately. Let me do that.\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nLet me let x = [OH^-] = [CH3COOH]. So,\n\nx^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.\n\nAssuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate denominator as 0.02.\n\nx^2 \u2248 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5. So, [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is 4.98, pH is 9.02.\n\nBut none of the options have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the initial moles.\n\nWait, let's go back. The initial moles of acetic acid: 20 mL * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. Then, after adding 20 mL water, it's 40 mL, so 0.025 M. Correct.\n\nThen, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 10 mL. Correct.\n\nAt equivalence, the volume is 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL, 0.05 L. So, [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nKa is 1.85e-5. So, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nWait, wait a second. Oh! Wait, no, wait. Wait, Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 \u2248 0.5405e-9 \u2192 5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nHmm, so the Kb is correct. Then, why is the pH not matching any of the options?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the exact solution without the approximation. Let's try that.\n\nx^2 = Kb * (0.02 - x) \u2192 x^2 + Kb x - 0.02 Kb = 0.\n\nWait, but that's a quadratic equation, which can be solved as x = [-Kb \u00b1 sqrt(Kb\u00b2 + 4 * 0.02 * Kb)] / 2.\n\nBut given that Kb is so small, x would be much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds. So, the initial calculation is correct.\n\nBut why are the options not showing 9.02? Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the equivalence point. Let me see. The question says, \"dilute 20 cm\u00b3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm\u00b3 water.\" So, 20 + 20 = 40 cm\u00b3. Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So, 0.001 mol NaOH needed. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is 10 mL. So, total volume at equivalence is 40 +10 =50 mL. Correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the solution at equivalence is a buffer? No, no. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted into acetate. So, solution is acetate ion in water. Correct.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recalculate.\n\nMoles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Yes.\n\nDiluted with 20 mL water: total 40 mL, so 0.04 L. So, 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the pH at equivalence should be around 9.02. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, wait, maybe the question is about 25% of the titration solution, not 25% of the equivalence point. Wait, no. The question says, \"25% titration\". So, that refers to 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So, that part is correct.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the first part. Let me recalculate the 25% titration.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the dilution. Let me go through that again.\n\nWait, when you add 20 mL of water to 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid, the total volume is 40 mL. The concentration becomes 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M. Correct.\n\nAt 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is added. So, moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, moles of acetic acid neutralized: 0.00025 mol. So, remaining acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\npH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647) \u2192 log(0.333) \u2248 -0.477.\n\nSo, pH \u2248 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is 4.26. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the pH at 25% is 4.26, and at equivalence it's about 9.02.\n\nBut the options don't have 9.02. So, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, looking at option A: 4.26; 8.52. Hmm, the first part matches, but the equivalence point is 8.52, not 9.02. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I forgot that the solution at equivalence is acetate, but I should consider that the acetate comes from a strong base, so maybe activity coefficients or something else. No, I think the approach is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using the same temperature, 25\u00b0C, so no issues with Kw.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the NaOH is being added to the diluted solution, and the dilution is in the calculation of the pH. Wait, no, the pH at equivalence is just based on the acetate concentration and Kb.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I used the wrong Ka value. Wait, the Ka given is 1.85e-5. So, pKa is 4.733, which is correct.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the pH at equivalence.\n\nWait, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M.\n\nSo, Kb = 5.405e-10.\n\nSo, Kb = x^2 / 0.02 \u2192 x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approximately 1.04e-5.\n\nSo, [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH = 4.98 \u2192 pH = 14 -4.98 = 9.02.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps the options have a mistake, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using another approach. Let's try using the formula for a weak base.\n\nThe formula is pH = 14 - 0.5 (pKa - log C), where C is the concentration of the conjugate base.\n\nWait, wait, the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base is:\n\npH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) \u2192 but at equivalence, [HA] is zero, so that's not helpful. Alternatively, using the hydrolysis formula for acetate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximation.\n\nSo, Kb = x^2 / (0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.\n\nAssuming x is small, 0.02 -x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo, x^2 \u2248 0.02 * 5.405e-10 \u2192 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 1.04e-5.\n\npOH = log(1.04e-5) \u2192 log(1.04) is 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -4.983. So, pOH \u22484.983 \u2192 pH=9.017.\n\nSo, still around 9.02. But none of the options have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem was about the pH at 25% of the titration volume, not 25% of the equivalence point. No, the question says 25% titration, which is 25% of the equivalence point.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the initial dilution. Let me recheck the initial steps.\n\nWait, initial solution: 20 mL 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 mL water. So, new concentration is 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M. Correct.\n\nAt 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Moles NaOH: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. So, moles of acetic acid neutralized: 0.00025. Remaining HA: 0.00075 mol. Moles of A^-: 0.00025 mol. Correct.\n\nTotal volume 42.5 mL. So, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M. [A^-] \u2248 0.005882 M. Ratio is 1/3. So, pH = pKa + log(1/3) \u2192 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. So, 4.26.\n\nSo, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But its equivalence point is 8.52, which is lower than what I calculated. So, perhaps the mistake is in the equivalence point.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not just the acetate, but the solution includes the sodium ions as well. Wait, but sodium is a spectator ion and doesn't affect the pH. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence using the exact formula without the approximation. Let's try that.\n\nThe equation is x^2 = Kb*(0.02 -x). Let me plug in Kb =5.405e-10.\n\nx^2 +5.405e-10 x - 0.02 *5.405e-10 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-5.405e-10 \u00b1 sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 + 4 * 1 * 0.02 *5.405e-10 ) ] / 2.\n\nBut since x is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nThe discriminant is (5.405e-10)^2 + 4 *1*0.02*5.405e-10.\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n(5.405e-10)^2 = approx 2.92e-19.\n\n4*0.02*5.405e-10 = 0.08 *5.405e-10 =4.324e-11.\n\nSo, sqrt(2.92e-19 +4.324e-11) \u2248 sqrt(4.324e-11) \u2248 6.576e-6.\n\nSo, x \u2248 [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 \u2248 (6.576e-6)/2 \u2248 3.288e-6.\n\nWait, that's larger than our initial approximation. So, [OH^-] =3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH =5.485 \u2192 pH=8.515, which is approximately 8.52.\n\nOh! So, that's why option A has pH 8.52 at equivalence. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation earlier, leading to the wrong pH.\n\nWait, wait, but why did the approximation give me 9.02, while the exact solution gives 8.52?\n\nBecause the assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 isn't valid here. Let me see: x is 3.288e-6, which is 3.288e-6 compared to 0.02 (which is 2e-2). 3.288e-6 is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation should hold. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic solution.\n\nWait, the equation is x^2 = Kb*(0.02 -x).\n\nSo, x^2 + Kb x - 0.02 Kb = 0.\n\nSo, a=1, b=Kb, c= -0.02 Kb.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 +4ac)]/(2a).\n\nWait, but c is -0.02 Kb, so 4ac=4 *1*(-0.02 Kb) = -0.08 Kb.\n\nWait, wait, no, a=1, b= Kb, c= -0.02 Kb.\n\nSo, 4ac=4 *1* (-0.02 Kb) = -0.08 Kb.\n\nSo, the discriminant is (Kb)^2 + 4ac \u2192 (Kb)^2 - 0.08 Kb.\n\nWait, but that would make the discriminant Kb^2 - 0.08 Kb.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because Kb is positive, so 4ac is negative. So, the discriminant is Kb\u00b2 + (4ac) \u2192 Kb\u00b2 - 0.08 Kb.\n\nWait, but if Kb is 5.405e-10, then Kb\u00b2 is about 2.92e-19, and 0.08 Kb is 4.324e-11. So, 2.92e-19 -4.324e-11 is a negative number. That can't be, because sqrt of negative isn't real. So, I must have made a mistake in the quadratic setup.\n\nWait, no, the equation is x^2 = Kb (0.02 -x). So, x^2 + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.\n\nSo, a=1, b=Kb, c= -0.02 Kb.\n\nSo, discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (Kb)^2 -4 *1*(-0.02 Kb) = (Kb)^2 + 0.08 Kb.\n\nAh, I see, I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. So, discriminant is (Kb)^2 + 0.08 Kb.\n\nSo, let's compute that:\n\n(Kb)^2 = (5.405e-10)^2 \u2248 2.92e-19.\n\n0.08 Kb = 0.08 *5.405e-10 \u22484.324e-11.\n\nSo, D=2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 \u2248 4.324e-11, since 2.92e-19 is negligible.\n\nSo, sqrt(D) \u2248 sqrt(4.324e-11) \u2248 6.576e-6.\n\nSo, x = [-Kb + sqrt(D)]/(2a) \u2192 [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 \u2192 approximately (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.\n\nSo, [OH^-] =3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH=5.485 \u2192 pH=14-5.485=8.515, which is about 8.52.\n\nAh! So, that's why option A has 8.52 as the equivalence point pH.\n\nWait, but why did the approximation give me a different answer? Because I assumed x is much smaller than 0.02, but in reality, x is 3.288e-6, which is 3.288e-6 compared to 0.02, which is 2e-2. So, 3.288e-6 is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation should have worked. But in that case, why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I think I see the mistake. Because when I approximated x^2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02, I neglected the Kb x term in the denominator. But in reality, Kb is so small that Kb x is negligible compared to 0.02. Let me check:\n\nKb is 5.405e-10. x is 3.288e-6. Kb x =5.405e-10 *3.288e-6 \u2248 1.78e-15, which is negligible compared to 0.02. So, the approximation should hold, but when I used the exact calculation, I got a different result. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me recompute.\n\nWait, the exact solution gives [OH^-] \u22483.288e-6, which leads to pH \u22488.52, which is option A.\n\nBut earlier, when I assumed x is much smaller, I got [OH^-] \u22481.04e-5, leading to pH\u22489.02. But that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me recalculate the exact solution.\n\nWait, x^2 + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.\n\nPlugging in Kb=5.405e-10, 0.02 Kb=1.081e-11.\n\nSo, equation: x^2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [ -5.405e-10 \u00b1 sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 *1.081e-11 ) ]/(2).\n\nCompute the discriminant:\n\n(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.92e-19.\n\n4*1*1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.\n\nSo, sqrt(2.92e-19 +4.324e-11) = sqrt(4.324e-11) \u22486.576e-6.\n\nSo, x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 \u2192 approximately (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.\n\nSo, [OH^-]=3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH=5.485 \u2192 pH=8.515.\n\nSo, the exact solution gives pH\u22488.52.\n\nWait, but when I used the approximation, I got pH\u22489.02. So, that's a big discrepancy. But why is the approximation not working?\n\nAh, perhaps because Kb is not that small, and the approximation isn't valid. Let me check the size of Kb.\n\nKb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M. So, the approximation is valid when Kb << concentration. Here, 5.405e-10 << 0.02, so the approximation should be valid. But why the discrepancy in the results?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me try plugging x=3.288e-6 into the Kb equation.\n\nx^2 = (3.288e-6)^2 \u2248 1.081e-11.\n\nKb*(0.02 -x) \u22485.405e-10 * (0.02 -3.288e-6) \u22485.405e-10 *0.0199967 \u21925.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11.\n\nSo, x^2 =1.081e-11, which matches. So, the exact solution is correct.\n\nBut then why does the approximation give a different result?\n\nWait, because when I used the approximation, I wrote x^2= Kb *0.02 \u2192 x= sqrt(Kb *0.02)= sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.\n\nBut wait, the exact solution gave x=3.288e-6, which is about a third of that. So, why the big difference?\n\nAh, I think I see the mistake. Oh wait, no, because when I wrote x^2= Kb * (0.02 -x), but in the approximation, I wrote x^2= Kb *0.02. But in reality, x is not zero, so 0.02 -x is 0.02*(1 - x/(0.02)).\n\nBut if x is much smaller than 0.02, then 0.02 -x \u22480.02. So, why the exact solution gives a much smaller x than the approximation?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact solution. Let me compute Kb*(0.02 -x) for x=3.288e-6.\n\nKb=5.405e-10, 0.02 -x=0.0199967.\n\nSo, Kb*(0.02 -x)=5.405e-10 *0.0199967 \u22481.081e-11.\n\nx^2= (3.288e-6)^2=1.081e-11. So, yes, it's correct.\n\nBut the approximation x^2=Kb*0.02 \u2192 x=1.04e-5.\n\nBut that's three times larger than the exact solution. Hmm, why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps the approximation x^2= Kb*(0.02 -x) is not correct. Because the correct equation is x^2= Kb*(0.02 -x). So, the approximation x^2= Kb*0.02 would only be valid if x is negligible compared to 0.02, which it is. But why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct equation is x^2 = Kb*(0.02 -x). So, when x is much smaller than 0.02, 0.02 -x \u22480.02, so x^2\u2248Kb*0.02 \u2192 x\u2248sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.\n\nBut the exact solution is x\u22483.288e-6, which is about a third of that. So, perhaps the approximation isn't valid, but why?\n\nWait, perhaps because the approximation leads to x=1.04e-5, but when you plug that back into 0.02 -x, it's 0.02 -1.04e-5 \u22480.01999, which is very close to 0.02, so the approximation should hold. But why the exact solution is so different?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the quadratic equation.\n\nWait, let me recompute the quadratic solution.\n\nEquation: x^2 + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.\n\nKb =5.405e-10.\n\nSo, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -0.02 *5.405e-10= -1.081e-11.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) =2.92e-19 +4.324e-11\u22484.324e-11.\n\nsqrt(D)=6.576e-6.\n\nx= [-b + sqrt(D)]/(2a)= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ]/(2).\n\nWhich is approximately (6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6.\n\nSo, the exact solution is x=3.288e-6, which is about 3.288e-6.\n\nWait, but when I use the approximation, I get x=1.04e-5, which is about 3 times larger than the exact solution. That's a big difference, and it's causing the pH to be higher than it should be.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct pH at equivalence is 8.52, as per option A. So, the answer would be A) 4.26;8.52.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because the initial approximation gave a different result. But the exact solution seems to give pH=8.52, which matches option A.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence point it's approximately 8.52. So, option A is correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the dilution of acetic acid, the titration with NaOH, and calculate the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid\nWe start with 20.00 cm\u00b3 (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with 20.00 cm\u00b3 (0.02 L) of water results in a total volume of 40.00 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). The moles of acetic acid remain the same, so the new concentration is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Concentration of diluted acetic acid} = \\frac{\\text{moles of acetic acid}}{\\text{total volume}} = \\frac{0.05 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.02 \\, \\text{L}}{0.04 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.025 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Titration and Equivalence Point\nThe reaction between acetic acid (CH\u2083COOH) and NaOH is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CH\u2083COOH} + \\text{NaOH} \\rightarrow \\text{CH\u2083COONa} + \\text{H\u2082O}.\n\\]\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized. The moles of acetic acid initially present are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of CH\u2083COOH} = 0.05 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.02 \\, \\text{L} = 0.001 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nSince NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume of NaOH} = \\frac{\\text{moles of NaOH}}{\\text{concentration of NaOH}} = \\frac{0.001 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.1 \\, \\text{M}} = 0.01 \\, \\text{L} = 10 \\, \\text{cm\u00b3}.\n\\]\n\nAt the equivalence point, the total volume of the solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \\, \\text{cm\u00b3} + 10 \\, \\text{cm\u00b3} = 50.00 \\, \\text{cm\u00b3} = 0.05 \\, \\text{L}.\n\\]\n\nThe concentration of acetate ions (CH\u2083COO\u207b) at the equivalence point is:\n\n\\[\n[\\text{CH\u2083COO\u207b}] = \\frac{\\text{moles of CH\u2083COO\u207b}}{\\text{total volume}} = \\frac{0.001 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.05 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.02 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point\nAt the equivalence point, the solution contains only acetate ions, which act as a weak base. The hydrolysis reaction is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CH\u2083COO\u207b} + \\text{H\u2082O} \\leftrightarrow \\text{CH\u2083COOH} + \\text{OH\u207b}.\n\\]\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \\(K_b\\), which is related to the acid dissociation constant \\(K_a\\) by:\n\n\\[\nK_b = \\frac{K_w}{K_a} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \\times 10^{-5}} = 5.405 \\times 10^{-10}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the expression for \\(K_b\\):\n\n\\[\nK_b = \\frac{[OH\u207b]^2}{[\\text{CH\u2083COO\u207b} - [OH\u207b]]}.\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\([OH\u207b] \\ll 0.02 \\, \\text{M}\\), we approximate \\([\\text{CH\u2083COO\u207b} - [OH\u207b]] \\approx 0.02 \\, \\text{M}\\). Thus:\n\n\\[\n[OH\u207b]^2 = K_b \\cdot [\\text{CH\u2083COO\u207b}] = (5.405 \\times 10^{-10}) \\cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \\times 10^{-11}.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n[OH\u207b] = \\sqrt{1.081 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 3.288 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nThe pOH is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pOH} = -\\log{[OH\u207b]} = -\\log{(3.288 \\times 10^{-6})} \\approx 5.485.\n\\]\n\nThe pH is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 14 - \\text{pOH} = 14 - 5.485 = 8.515 \\approx 8.52.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: pH at 25% Titration\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The moles of NaOH added are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \\cdot 0.001 = 0.00025 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nThis neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining moles of CH\u2083COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nThe moles of acetate ions formed are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of CH\u2083COO\u207b} = 0.00025 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nThe total volume of the solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \\, \\text{cm\u00b3} + 2.5 \\, \\text{cm\u00b3} = 42.50 \\, \\text{cm\u00b3} = 0.0425 \\, \\text{L}.\n\\]\n\nThe concentrations are:\n\n\\[\n[\\text{CH\u2083COOH}] = \\frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \\approx 0.017647 \\, \\text{M},\n\\]\n\\[\n[\\text{CH\u2083COO\u207b}] = \\frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \\approx 0.005882 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = \\text{pKa} + \\log{\\left(\\frac{[\\text{CH\u2083COO\u207b}]}{[\\text{CH\u2083COOH}]}\\right)}.\n\\]\n\nThe pKa is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pKa} = -\\log{(1.85 \\times 10^{-5})} \\approx 4.733.\n\\]\n\nThe ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{[\\text{CH\u2083COO\u207b}]}{[\\text{CH\u2083COOH}]} = \\frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \\approx 0.333.\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 4.733 + \\log{(0.333)} \\approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \\approx 4.26.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:\n\n**A) 4.26; 8.52**\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Since we're mixing equal volumes, the concentration should be halved. Oh wait, right! Because when you dilute a solution by doubling the volume, the concentration becomes half. So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nNext, when titrating, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base). The reaction should be:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O\n\nAt 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to calculate the moles of acetic acid and then determine how much is neutralized.\n\nLet me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially after dilution. Volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (20+20), which is 0.04 L. So moles = Molarity \u00d7 Volume = 0.025 M \u00d7 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.\n\nAt 25% titration, 0.25 \u00d7 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the moles of CH3COOH left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.\n\nThis sounds like a buffer solution situation. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nFirst, I need to find pKa. The Ka given is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) which is approximately 4.74. Wait, let me calculate that: log(1/(1.85e-5)) is log(5.405e4) \u2248 4.733, so around 4.73.\n\nNow, the concentrations of A^- and HA. Wait, the total volume at this point? Because after adding some NaOH, the volume increases. Hmm, but wait, when doing dilution, maybe it's easier to consider the ratio of moles since the volume cancels out in the Henderson equation.\n\nWait, no, because the solution's volume changes as we add NaOH. But wait, the question is about 25% titration, so let's figure out how much NaOH has been added.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's find the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is a strong base, each mole reacts with a mole of acetic acid. So for 25% titration, moles of NaOH added = 0.25 \u00d7 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo the total solution volume after adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nWait, but when calculating the concentrations of HA and A^-, the same volume will be used, so the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (moles A^-)/(moles HA).\n\nMoles HA: 0.00075 mol. Moles A^-: 0.00025 mol. So the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.\n\nSo plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = 4.73 + log(1/3). Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So 4.73 - 0.477 \u2248 4.253. So approximately 4.25.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact calculation. Log(1/3) is log(0.3333) which is approximately -0.4771. So 4.73 - 0.4771 = 4.2529. So about 4.25, which rounds to 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and D is 4.57. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I should recalculate the moles. Let me double-check.\n\nInitial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.04 L \u00d7 0.025 M = 0.001 mol.\n\nAt 25% titration, NaOH added: 0.00025 mol. So moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.\n\nSo the calculation is correct. So pH is approximately 4.25. The options have A) 4.26 and D) 4.57. Maybe I should carry more decimal places in pKa.\n\nKa is 1.85e-5. Let me compute pKa more accurately.\n\npKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.4054e4) = let me calculate that.\n\nLog(5.4054e4) = log(5.4054) + log(1e4) = 0.7327 +4 = 4.7327. So pKa is approximately 4.73.\n\nHenderson equation: 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.4771 = 4.2529, which is approximately 4.25. So the closest option is A) 4.26.\n\nWait, but let's think again. Wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration. Does that refer to 25% of the volume added, or 25% of the moles? I think it's moles. Because 25% titration refers to the fraction of the acid neutralized, which is based on moles, not volume.\n\nSo I think my approach was correct. So the pH at 25% is around 4.25, which is close to option A's first value of 4.26.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.\n\nThe moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would be equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. So the volume of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo the total solution volume at equivalence is 40 cm\u00b3 (original) + 10 cm\u00b3 (NaOH) = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nThe concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So in solution, it will hydrolyze according to:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute that accurately. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 \u2248 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.\n\nThe Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the equation:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nLet x be the [OH^-] produced.\n\nSo Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.02, since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nTaking square root: x \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M. The pOH is -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u2248 9.02.\n\nWait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options for equivalence point are 6.73, 7.00, 6.92, 8.52.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Because I thought the equivalence point would be higher than 7, but the options don't have 9.02. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the solution is 0.02 M in acetate, and use the Kb expression correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid-strong base titration. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.\n\nAnother approach: the pH can be calculated using the formula:\n\npH = pKa + 0.5 pKb ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid with a strong base is given by:\n\npH = pKa + 1/2 (pKa + pKw - log C )\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for a salt solution. Alternatively, the pH can be found using the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-calculate Kb.\n\nWait, let me redo the Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So the Kb expression:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nAssume x is small, so [CH3COO^-] \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98 \u2192 pH \u2248 9.02.\n\nBut none of the options have a pH near 9. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the stoichiometry. Let me recheck the moles.\n\nWait, the initial acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol. The NaOH at equivalence is 0.001 mol, correct. So the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm\u00b3 \u2192 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.02 M, which I did right.\n\nHmm, but according to this calculation, the pH is about 9.02, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the problem.\n\nWait, another thought: Oh wait, the NaOH is 0.1 M, and the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3. So the total volume is 50 cm\u00b3, correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the formula for a weak base. The acetate ion is a weak base, so the solution is basic, but perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let's compute [OH^-] again. Kb = 5.405e-10, conc = 0.02.\n\nUsing Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.02.\n\nSo x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH = 4.98 \u2192 pH = 9.02.\n\nBut none of the options have this. The options are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73  \n\nC) 4.73; 7.00\n\nD) 4.57; 6.92  \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me double-check that.\n\nOriginal volume: 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then diluted with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. So the new volume is 40 cm\u00b3, correct. So concentration is 0.05 M * (20/40) = 0.025 M. So initial moles after dilution are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to account for the fact that the NaOH is a strong base and the solution is being made more dilute as you add more of it. Wait, but in the equivalence point, the solution is 0.05 L with 0.001 mol of acetate, which is correct.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb value. Let me recompute it.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 \u2192 1/1.85 \u2248 0.5405, so Kb = 5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps I should consider that the solution is acetate in water, and maybe there's an error in the assumption of x being negligible. Let me compute without approximation.\n\nThe equation is Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.\n\nAssume x is small, so 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 \u2192 pH is about 9.02.\n\nBut none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the pH at 25% of the volume added, not 25% of the moles. Let me think about that.\n\nNo, I think the question refers to 25% of the moles, because it's a titration percentage, which is based on the amount of acid neutralized.\n\nWait, perhaps the equivalence point is not 9.02, but another value. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. The formula for pH is:\n\npH = pKa + log ( [A^-] / [HA] )\n\nWait, no, that's the Henderson equation, but at equivalence point, [HA] is zero, so that doesn't apply.\n\nWait, another approach: For the acetate ion, which is a weak base, the pH can be calculated using the Kb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the hydrolysis reaction more accurately.\n\nWait, another approach: The concentration is 0.02 M, Kb = 5.405e-10.\n\nThe expression is Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.\n\nSince Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x \u2248 sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH = log(1.04e5^-1) \u2192 Wait, no, [OH^-] is 1.04e-5. So pOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. pH = 14 -4.98 =9.02.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for the initial concentration. Let me recalculate the initial concentration after dilution.\n\nWait, initial volume is 20 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 cm\u00b3 of water. So the new volume is 40 cm\u00b3. So concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm\u00b3) / 40 cm\u00b3 = 0.025 M. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH at 25% titration, but perhaps the total volume is 42.5 cm\u00b3, so the concentrations are [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L, and [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 L. But since both are divided by the same volume, the ratio remains 1/3. So the pH would be the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the pKa. Let me recalculate pKa.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) \u2192 which is log(5.405e4) = 4.7327. So pKa is 4.73.\n\nSo, the Henderson equation gives pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 =4.253.\n\nSo that's approximately 4.25, which is very close to option A's first value of 4.26.\n\nNow, for the equivalence point, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the half-equivalence point for the first part.\n\nWait, wait, another thought: At 25% titration, perhaps it's the point where only 25% of the acid has been neutralized. So the buffer calculation is correct, giving pH around 4.25.\n\nBut the equivalence point calculation doesn't match any of the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the equivalence point calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the solution is at equivalence, it's a solution of sodium acetate, which is a strong electrolyte. So it dissociates completely into Na+ and CH3COO^-.\n\nThe acetate ion then reacts with water as a weak base.\n\nThe Kb is 5.405e-10, as before.\n\nThe formula for the pH is:\n\npH = 0.5 (pKa + pKw - log C )\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe pH can be calculated using the formula for a weak base:\n\npH = pKa + 0.5 (pKa + pKw - log C )\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The pH can be found using:\n\npH = pKa2 + 0.5 ( pKa2 - log C )\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base.\n\nThe formula is:\n\npH = pKa + log ( ( [A^-] ) / ( [HA] ) )\n\nBut at equivalence point, HA is zero, so that approach doesn't work. So I have to calculate it based on the Kb.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the expression again:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let x be [OH^-] at equilibrium.\n\nSo Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.\n\nAssuming x is small, 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH = 4.98 \u2192 pH = 14 -4.98 =9.02.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. The closest option for equivalence point is A) 8.52, D)6.92. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm using the wrong concentration for the equivalence point. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the volume at equivalence point is 40 +10=50 cm\u00b3. Moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact value without approximation. Let's solve for x in Kb = x\u00b2/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x)\n\nx\u00b2 = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x\n\nx\u00b2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 +4ac)]/(2a)\n\na=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.\n\nDiscriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*1.081e-11 = (2.92e-19) +4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11.\n\nsqrt(4.324e-11) \u2248 6.576e-6.\n\nSo x = [ -5.405e-10 \u00b16.576e-6 ] / 2.\n\nWe take the positive root: (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 \u2248 (6.576e-6)/2 \u22483.288e-6.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So [OH^-] \u22483.288e-6 \u2192 pOH=5.48 \u2192 pH=8.52.\n\nOh! So that's where option A's second value comes from. So the pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nWait, but earlier when I assumed x is negligible, I got [OH^-]\u22481.04e-5, leading to pH\u22489.02. But the quadratic solution gives a higher [OH^-], leading to lower pH.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should carry more precise calculations.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant again.\n\n(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.\n\n4ac=4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) \u2192 no, wait, c is -1.081e-11, so 4ac=4*1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11.\n\nWait, wait, no. The quadratic equation is x\u00b2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.\n\nSo a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.\n\nSo discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4(1)(-1.081e-11) = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11.\n\nSo sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)\u22486.576e-6.\n\nSo x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 \u2192 approximately (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.\n\nSo [OH^-] =3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH=5.48 \u2192 pH=8.52.\n\nAh, so I must have made a mistake earlier by ignoring the x in the denominator. So the correct pH at equivalence point is about 8.52, which matches option A's second value.\n\nSo for the first part, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence point, it's approximately 8.52. So the correct option is A) 4.26;8.52.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Since we're mixing equal volumes, the concentration should be halved. Oh wait, right! Because when you dilute a solution by doubling the volume, the concentration becomes half. So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\nNext, when titrating, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base). The reaction should be:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O\n\nAt 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to calculate the moles of acetic acid and then determine how much is neutralized.\n\nLet me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially after dilution. Volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (20+20), which is 0.04 L. So moles = Molarity \u00d7 Volume = 0.025 M \u00d7 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.\n\nAt 25% titration, 0.25 \u00d7 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the moles of CH3COOH left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.\n\nThis sounds like a buffer solution situation. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).\n\nFirst, I need to find pKa. The Ka given is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) which is approximately 4.74. Wait, let me calculate that: log(1/(1.85e-5)) is log(5.405e4) \u2248 4.733, so around 4.73.\n\nNow, the concentrations of A^- and HA. Wait, the total volume at this point? Because after adding some NaOH, the volume increases. Hmm, but wait, when doing dilution, maybe it's easier to consider the ratio of moles since the volume cancels out in the Henderson equation.\n\nWait, no, because the solution's volume changes as we add NaOH. But wait, the question is about 25% titration, so let's figure out how much NaOH has been added.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's find the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is a strong base, each mole reacts with a mole of acetic acid. So for 25% titration, moles of NaOH added = 0.25 \u00d7 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo the total solution volume after adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nWait, but when calculating the concentrations of HA and A^-, the same volume will be used, so the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (moles A^-)/(moles HA).\n\nMoles HA: 0.00075 mol. Moles A^-: 0.00025 mol. So the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.\n\nSo plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = 4.73 + log(1/3). Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So 4.73 - 0.477 \u2248 4.253. So approximately 4.25.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact calculation. Log(1/3) is log(0.3333) which is approximately -0.4771. So 4.73 - 0.4771 = 4.2529. So about 4.25, which rounds to 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and D is 4.57. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I should recalculate the moles. Let me double-check.\n\nInitial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.04 L \u00d7 0.025 M = 0.001 mol.\n\nAt 25% titration, NaOH added: 0.00025 mol. So moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.\n\nSo the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.\n\nSo the calculation is correct. So pH is approximately 4.25. The options have A) 4.26 and D) 4.57. Maybe I should carry more decimal places in pKa.\n\nKa is 1.85e-5. Let me compute pKa more accurately.\n\npKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.4054e4) = let me calculate that.\n\nLog(5.4054e4) = log(5.4054) + log(1e4) = 0.7327 +4 = 4.7327. So pKa is approximately 4.73.\n\nHenderson equation: 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.4771 = 4.2529, which is approximately 4.25. So the closest option is A) 4.26.\n\nWait, but let's think again. Wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration. Does that refer to 25% of the volume added, or 25% of the moles? I think it's moles. Because 25% titration refers to the fraction of the acid neutralized, which is based on moles, not volume.\n\nSo I think my approach was correct. So the pH at 25% is around 4.25, which is close to option A's first value of 4.26.\n\nNow, the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.\n\nThe moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would be equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. So the volume of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo the total solution volume at equivalence is 40 cm\u00b3 (original) + 10 cm\u00b3 (NaOH) = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nThe concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nNow, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So in solution, it will hydrolyze according to:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me compute that accurately. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 \u2248 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.\n\nThe Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the equation:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nLet x be the [OH^-] produced.\n\nSo Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.02, since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.\n\nTaking square root: x \u2248 sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M. The pOH is -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 \u2248 9.02.\n\nWait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options for equivalence point are 6.73, 7.00, 6.92, 8.52.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Because I thought the equivalence point would be higher than 7, but the options don't have 9.02. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the solution is 0.02 M in acetate, and use the Kb expression correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid-strong base titration. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.\n\nAnother approach: the pH can be calculated using the formula:\n\npH = pKa + 0.5 pKb ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid with a strong base is given by:\n\npH = pKa + 1/2 (pKa + pKw - log C )\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for a salt solution. Alternatively, the pH can be found using the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-calculate Kb.\n\nWait, let me redo the Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So the Kb expression:\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]\n\nAssume x is small, so [CH3COO^-] \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98 \u2192 pH \u2248 9.02.\n\nBut none of the options have a pH near 9. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the stoichiometry. Let me recheck the moles.\n\nWait, the initial acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol. The NaOH at equivalence is 0.001 mol, correct. So the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm\u00b3 \u2192 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.02 M, which I did right.\n\nHmm, but according to this calculation, the pH is about 9.02, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the problem.\n\nWait, another thought: Oh wait, the NaOH is 0.1 M, and the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3. So the total volume is 50 cm\u00b3, correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the formula for a weak base. The acetate ion is a weak base, so the solution is basic, but perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let's compute [OH^-] again. Kb = 5.405e-10, conc = 0.02.\n\nUsing Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.02.\n\nSo x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH = 4.98 \u2192 pH = 9.02.\n\nBut none of the options have this. The options are:\n\nA) 4.26; 8.52\n\nB) 3.17; 6.73  \n\nC) 4.73; 7.00\n\nD) 4.57; 6.92  \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me double-check that.\n\nOriginal volume: 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then diluted with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. So the new volume is 40 cm\u00b3, correct. So concentration is 0.05 M * (20/40) = 0.025 M. So initial moles after dilution are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to account for the fact that the NaOH is a strong base and the solution is being made more dilute as you add more of it. Wait, but in the equivalence point, the solution is 0.05 L with 0.001 mol of acetate, which is correct.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb value. Let me recompute it.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 \u2192 1/1.85 \u2248 0.5405, so Kb = 5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps I should consider that the solution is acetate in water, and maybe there's an error in the assumption of x being negligible. Let me compute without approximation.\n\nThe equation is Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.\n\nAssume x is small, so 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 \u2192 pH is about 9.02.\n\nBut none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the pH at 25% of the volume added, not 25% of the moles. Let me think about that.\n\nNo, I think the question refers to 25% of the moles, because it's a titration percentage, which is based on the amount of acid neutralized.\n\nWait, perhaps the equivalence point is not 9.02, but another value. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. The formula for pH is:\n\npH = pKa + log ( [A^-] / [HA] )\n\nWait, no, that's the Henderson equation, but at equivalence point, [HA] is zero, so that doesn't apply.\n\nWait, another approach: For the acetate ion, which is a weak base, the pH can be calculated using the Kb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the hydrolysis reaction more accurately.\n\nWait, another approach: The concentration is 0.02 M, Kb = 5.405e-10.\n\nThe expression is Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.\n\nSince Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x \u2248 sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH = log(1.04e5^-1) \u2192 Wait, no, [OH^-] is 1.04e-5. So pOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98. pH = 14 -4.98 =9.02.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for the initial concentration. Let me recalculate the initial concentration after dilution.\n\nWait, initial volume is 20 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 cm\u00b3 of water. So the new volume is 40 cm\u00b3. So concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm\u00b3) / 40 cm\u00b3 = 0.025 M. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm adding 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH at 25% titration, but perhaps the total volume is 42.5 cm\u00b3, so the concentrations are [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L, and [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 L. But since both are divided by the same volume, the ratio remains 1/3. So the pH would be the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the pKa. Let me recalculate pKa.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) \u2192 which is log(5.405e4) = 4.7327. So pKa is 4.73.\n\nSo, the Henderson equation gives pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 =4.253.\n\nSo that's approximately 4.25, which is very close to option A's first value of 4.26.\n\nNow, for the equivalence point, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the half-equivalence point for the first part.\n\nWait, wait, another thought: At 25% titration, perhaps it's the point where only 25% of the acid has been neutralized. So the buffer calculation is correct, giving pH around 4.25.\n\nBut the equivalence point calculation doesn't match any of the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recheck the equivalence point calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the solution is at equivalence, it's a solution of sodium acetate, which is a strong electrolyte. So it dissociates completely into Na+ and CH3COO^-.\n\nThe acetate ion then reacts with water as a weak base.\n\nThe Kb is 5.405e-10, as before.\n\nThe formula for the pH is:\n\npH = 0.5 (pKa + pKw - log C )\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe pH can be calculated using the formula for a weak base:\n\npH = pKa + 0.5 (pKa + pKw - log C )\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The pH can be found using:\n\npH = pKa2 + 0.5 ( pKa2 - log C )\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base.\n\nThe formula is:\n\npH = pKa + log ( ( [A^-] ) / ( [HA] ) )\n\nBut at equivalence point, HA is zero, so that approach doesn't work. So I have to calculate it based on the Kb.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the expression again:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let x be [OH^-] at equilibrium.\n\nSo Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.\n\nAssuming x is small, 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 \u2192 pOH = 4.98 \u2192 pH = 14 -4.98 =9.02.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. The closest option for equivalence point is A) 8.52, D)6.92. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm using the wrong concentration for the equivalence point. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the volume at equivalence point is 40 +10=50 cm\u00b3. Moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact value without approximation. Let's solve for x in Kb = x\u00b2/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x)\n\nx\u00b2 = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x\n\nx\u00b2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 +4ac)]/(2a)\n\na=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.\n\nDiscriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*1.081e-11 = (2.92e-19) +4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11.\n\nsqrt(4.324e-11) \u2248 6.576e-6.\n\nSo x = [ -5.405e-10 \u00b16.576e-6 ] / 2.\n\nWe take the positive root: (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 \u2248 (6.576e-6)/2 \u22483.288e-6.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So [OH^-] \u22483.288e-6 \u2192 pOH=5.48 \u2192 pH=8.52.\n\nOh! So that's where option A's second value comes from. So the pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nWait, but earlier when I assumed x is negligible, I got [OH^-]\u22481.04e-5, leading to pH\u22489.02. But the quadratic solution gives a higher [OH^-], leading to lower pH.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should carry more precise calculations.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant again.\n\n(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.\n\n4ac=4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) \u2192 no, wait, c is -1.081e-11, so 4ac=4*1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11.\n\nWait, wait, no. The quadratic equation is x\u00b2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.\n\nSo a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.\n\nSo discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4(1)(-1.081e-11) = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11.\n\nSo sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)\u22486.576e-6.\n\nSo x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 \u2192 approximately (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.\n\nSo [OH^-] =3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH=5.48 \u2192 pH=8.52.\n\nAh, so I must have made a mistake earlier by ignoring the x in the denominator. So the correct pH at equivalence point is about 8.52, which matches option A's second value.\n\nSo for the first part, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence point, it's approximately 8.52. So the correct option is A) 4.26;8.52.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm\u00b3 at 0.05 M, and it is diluted with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. Since the volumes are equal, the concentration is halved:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Concentration after dilution} = \\frac{0.05 \\, \\text{M}}{2} = 0.025 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nThe total moles of acetic acid after dilution are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.04 \\, \\text{L} = 0.001 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\n### At 25% Titration:\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.\n\nSo, the problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options given are A to D, each with two pH values.\n\nFirst, I think I need to break this down into parts. Let's handle each part one by one: the dilution, the titration at 25%, and the equivalence point.\n\nStarting with the dilution. When you mix two solutions, you can calculate the new concentration using the dilution formula. The initial solution is 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm\u00b3 (20 + 20).\n\nThe formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. Here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm\u00b3, and V2 is 40 cm\u00b3. So M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2. Let me calculate that: (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when it's diluted, it dissociates more, but the initial concentration after mixing is 0.025 M. Right, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the titration with NaOH. The NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.\n\nFirst, let's find out the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.\n\nMoles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: Molarity * Volume in liters. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Because 40 cm\u00b3 is 0.04 L.\n\nNaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / concentration. So 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, so the equivalence point is when 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH has been added. Now, for the 25% titration, we're adding 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH.\n\nLet me handle each case: 25% and equivalence.\n\nStarting with the 25% titration point.\n\nAt this point, some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The reaction is:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.001 moles.\n\nMoles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So NaOH is 0.00025 moles, which is 25% of the 0.001 moles of acetic acid.\n\nSo the reaction will consume 0.00025 moles of acetic acid and produce 0.00025 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).\n\nSo, after reaction:\n\nMoles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- (from NaOH): 0.00025 moles.\n\nThe total volume of the solution now is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Initial diluted solution was 40 cm\u00b3, and we've added 2.5 cm\u00b3. So total volume is 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo concentrations are:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let me compute that. 0.00075 is 7.5e-4. Divided by 0.0425 is approximately 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])\n\nKa is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) \u2192 wait, no. pKa is -log(Ka). Let me compute that.\n\npKa = -log(1.85e-5) \u2248 4.73 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 \u2248 4.733).\n\nSo pKa \u2248 4.73.\n\nNow, [A^-] is the acetate concentration, which is 0.005882 M. [HA] is 0.017647 M.\n\nSo log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = log(0.3333) \u2248 -0.477.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) \u2248 4.253. Let me check the calculation. Wait, 0.00025 / 0.0425 is 0.005882. 0.00075 / 0.0425 is 0.017647.\n\nSo the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.3333, which is 1/3. Log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.\n\nSo pH is 4.73 - 0.477 \u2248 4.253. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26; option D has 4.57. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps I should compute the exact values.\n\nLet me compute the exact ratio:\n\nMoles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.\n\nMoles of acetic acid: 0.00075 mol.\n\nSo ratio is (0.00025 / 0.00075) = 1/3.\n\nSo the log(1/3) is -0.4771.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 + (-0.4771) \u2248 4.2529, which is about 4.25. So option A is 4.26, which is close. So that's the pH at 25% titration.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: when we add NaOH, which is a strong base, it reacts with the weak acid. So the solution is a buffer, and the Henderson-Hasselbalch applies.\n\nNow, moving on to the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions and water.\n\nSo the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.\n\nThe moles of NaOH at equivalence are 0.001 mol, as calculated earlier. The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo the concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nSo the solution is 0.02 M CH3COO^-.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Ka. Since Kw = 1e-14 = Ka * Kb \u2192 Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Wait, 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10. Yes.\n\nBut wait, wait, that's Kb for acetate. So, in solution, the acetate ion will undergo hydrolysis, producing OH- ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression.\n\nLet me denote the change as follows:\n\nCH3COO^- \u21cc CH3COOH + OH^-\nInitial: 0.02 M; 0; 0\nChange: -x; +x; +x\nEquilibrium: 0.02 - x; x; x\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = (x^2)/(0.02 - x) \u2248 x\u00b2/(0.02) because x is very small compared to 0.02.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 1.04e-5 M \u2192 pOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98 \u2192 pH = 14 - 4.98 \u2248 9.02.\n\nWait, but that's around 9, but none of the options have a pH around 9 at equivalence. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recheck.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 \u2192 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so 0.5405e-9 \u2192 5.405e-10. That's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, when I calculated x, I got x \u2248 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5. So pOH is -log(1.04e-5). Let me compute that.\n\nLog(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -5 + 0.017 = -4.983. So pOH is 4.983 \u2192 pH is 14 - 4.983 \u2248 9.017.\n\nBut looking at the options, the equivalence pH options are 8.52 (A), 6.73 (B), 7.00 (C), 6.92 (D). None are near 9. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.\n\nWait, the equivalence point: moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol, as calculated earlier. The volume is 50 cm\u00b3 (40 +10). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M acetate. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not have used the Kb approach, but perhaps consider that the acetate comes from a strong base and a weak acid, so the solution is basic. So the pH should be higher than 7, but the options don't show that. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the Kb. Let me recheck.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5.\n\nLet me compute 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5:\n\n1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 \u2192 1 / 1.85 \u2248 0.5405 \u2192 0.5405e-9 \u2192 5.405e-10. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but then the pH comes out around 9, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps when the solution is at equivalence, the concentration isn't 0.02 M because I added 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH to 40 cm\u00b3 of solution. Wait, no, 40 +10 is 50 cm\u00b3, so 0.05 L. 0.001 mol / 0.05 L is 0.02 M. That's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximating x as negligible.\n\nSo, Kb = x\u00b2/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.\n\nLet me solve for x without approximation.\n\nx\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x).\n\nThis is a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 * 0.02) =0.\n\nWait, wait no: x\u00b2 = Kb (0.02 -x) \u2192 x\u00b2 + Kb x - Kb *0.02 =0.\n\nSo, coefficients are a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -5.405e-10 *0.02 \u2192 c= -1.081e-11.\n\nThe quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 +4ac)]/(2a).\n\nDiscriminant: b\u00b2 +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 * (1.081e-11) \u2192 approximately (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) \u2192 which is about 4.324e-11, since 2.92e-19 is negligible.\n\nSo sqrt(4.324e-11) \u2248 6.576e-6.\n\nSo x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 \u2192 approximately (6.576e-6)/2 \u2248 3.288e-6.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH = -log(3.288e-6) \u2192 log(3.288) is about 0.517 \u2192 so pOH = 5.483 \u2192 pH = 14 -5.483 \u22488.517.\n\nAh! So pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52. That matches option A, which says pH 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I got pH around 9.02, which is wrong. So using the exact quadratic solution gives me pH around 8.52. So that's correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nAt 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.26.\n\nAt equivalence, pH is approximately 8.52.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So the correct answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the 25% titration calculation.\n\nAt 25% titration, 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added. So moles of NaOH is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol.\n\nSo after reaction:\n\nMoles of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is 40 +2.5 =42.5 cm\u00b3 \u2192 0.0425 L.\n\nSo concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\npH = pKa + log (0.005882 / 0.017647) \u2192 pKa is 4.73.\n\nThe ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.3333 \u2192 log(0.3333) = -0.4771.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 - 0.4771 \u22484.2529 \u2192 approx 4.25. Option A is 4.26, which is very close.\n\nSo putting it all together, the pH at 25% is ~4.26, and at equivalence it's ~8.52. So the correct option is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.\n\nSo, the problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options given are A to D, each with two pH values.\n\nFirst, I think I need to break this down into parts. Let's handle each part one by one: the dilution, the titration at 25%, and the equivalence point.\n\nStarting with the dilution. When you mix two solutions, you can calculate the new concentration using the dilution formula. The initial solution is 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm\u00b3 (20 + 20).\n\nThe formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. Here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm\u00b3, and V2 is 40 cm\u00b3. So M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2. Let me calculate that: (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when it's diluted, it dissociates more, but the initial concentration after mixing is 0.025 M. Right, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the titration with NaOH. The NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.\n\nFirst, let's find out the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.\n\nMoles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: Molarity * Volume in liters. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Because 40 cm\u00b3 is 0.04 L.\n\nNaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / concentration. So 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3.\n\nWait, so the equivalence point is when 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH has been added. Now, for the 25% titration, we're adding 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH.\n\nLet me handle each case: 25% and equivalence.\n\nStarting with the 25% titration point.\n\nAt this point, some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The reaction is:\n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COONa + H2O\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.001 moles.\n\nMoles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So NaOH is 0.00025 moles, which is 25% of the 0.001 moles of acetic acid.\n\nSo the reaction will consume 0.00025 moles of acetic acid and produce 0.00025 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).\n\nSo, after reaction:\n\nMoles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^- (from NaOH): 0.00025 moles.\n\nThe total volume of the solution now is the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Initial diluted solution was 40 cm\u00b3, and we've added 2.5 cm\u00b3. So total volume is 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo concentrations are:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let me compute that. 0.00075 is 7.5e-4. Divided by 0.0425 is approximately 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\nNow, since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])\n\nKa is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) \u2192 wait, no. pKa is -log(Ka). Let me compute that.\n\npKa = -log(1.85e-5) \u2248 4.73 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 \u2248 4.733).\n\nSo pKa \u2248 4.73.\n\nNow, [A^-] is the acetate concentration, which is 0.005882 M. [HA] is 0.017647 M.\n\nSo log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = log(0.3333) \u2248 -0.477.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) \u2248 4.253. Let me check the calculation. Wait, 0.00025 / 0.0425 is 0.005882. 0.00075 / 0.0425 is 0.017647.\n\nSo the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.3333, which is 1/3. Log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.\n\nSo pH is 4.73 - 0.477 \u2248 4.253. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26; option D has 4.57. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps I should compute the exact values.\n\nLet me compute the exact ratio:\n\nMoles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.\n\nMoles of acetic acid: 0.00075 mol.\n\nSo ratio is (0.00025 / 0.00075) = 1/3.\n\nSo the log(1/3) is -0.4771.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 + (-0.4771) \u2248 4.2529, which is about 4.25. So option A is 4.26, which is close. So that's the pH at 25% titration.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: when we add NaOH, which is a strong base, it reacts with the weak acid. So the solution is a buffer, and the Henderson-Hasselbalch applies.\n\nNow, moving on to the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions and water.\n\nSo the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.\n\nThe moles of NaOH at equivalence are 0.001 mol, as calculated earlier. The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L.\n\nSo the concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nSo the solution is 0.02 M CH3COO^-.\n\nThe acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be calculated from Ka. Since Kw = 1e-14 = Ka * Kb \u2192 Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Wait, 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10. Yes.\n\nBut wait, wait, that's Kb for acetate. So, in solution, the acetate ion will undergo hydrolysis, producing OH- ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression.\n\nLet me denote the change as follows:\n\nCH3COO^- \u21cc CH3COOH + OH^-\nInitial: 0.02 M; 0; 0\nChange: -x; +x; +x\nEquilibrium: 0.02 - x; x; x\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = (x^2)/(0.02 - x) \u2248 x\u00b2/(0.02) because x is very small compared to 0.02.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 \u2248 Kb * 0.02 \u2192 x\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M.\n\nSo [OH^-] \u2248 1.04e-5 M \u2192 pOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.98 \u2192 pH = 14 - 4.98 \u2248 9.02.\n\nWait, but that's around 9, but none of the options have a pH around 9 at equivalence. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recheck.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 \u2192 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so 0.5405e-9 \u2192 5.405e-10. That's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, when I calculated x, I got x \u2248 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5. So pOH is -log(1.04e-5). Let me compute that.\n\nLog(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -5 + 0.017 = -4.983. So pOH is 4.983 \u2192 pH is 14 - 4.983 \u2248 9.017.\n\nBut looking at the options, the equivalence pH options are 8.52 (A), 6.73 (B), 7.00 (C), 6.92 (D). None are near 9. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.\n\nWait, the equivalence point: moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol, as calculated earlier. The volume is 50 cm\u00b3 (40 +10). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M acetate. That's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not have used the Kb approach, but perhaps consider that the acetate comes from a strong base and a weak acid, so the solution is basic. So the pH should be higher than 7, but the options don't show that. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the Kb. Let me recheck.\n\nKa = 1.85e-5 \u2192 Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5.\n\nLet me compute 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5:\n\n1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 \u2192 1 / 1.85 \u2248 0.5405 \u2192 0.5405e-9 \u2192 5.405e-10. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but then the pH comes out around 9, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps when the solution is at equivalence, the concentration isn't 0.02 M because I added 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH to 40 cm\u00b3 of solution. Wait, no, 40 +10 is 50 cm\u00b3, so 0.05 L. 0.001 mol / 0.05 L is 0.02 M. That's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximating x as negligible.\n\nSo, Kb = x\u00b2/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.\n\nLet me solve for x without approximation.\n\nx\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x).\n\nThis is a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 * 0.02) =0.\n\nWait, wait no: x\u00b2 = Kb (0.02 -x) \u2192 x\u00b2 + Kb x - Kb *0.02 =0.\n\nSo, coefficients are a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -5.405e-10 *0.02 \u2192 c= -1.081e-11.\n\nThe quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 +4ac)]/(2a).\n\nDiscriminant: b\u00b2 +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 * (1.081e-11) \u2192 approximately (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) \u2192 which is about 4.324e-11, since 2.92e-19 is negligible.\n\nSo sqrt(4.324e-11) \u2248 6.576e-6.\n\nSo x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 \u2192 approximately (6.576e-6)/2 \u2248 3.288e-6.\n\nSo [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 \u2192 pOH = -log(3.288e-6) \u2192 log(3.288) is about 0.517 \u2192 so pOH = 5.483 \u2192 pH = 14 -5.483 \u22488.517.\n\nAh! So pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52. That matches option A, which says pH 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I got pH around 9.02, which is wrong. So using the exact quadratic solution gives me pH around 8.52. So that's correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nAt 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.26.\n\nAt equivalence, pH is approximately 8.52.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So the correct answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the 25% titration calculation.\n\nAt 25% titration, 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added. So moles of NaOH is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol.\n\nSo after reaction:\n\nMoles of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.\n\nMoles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.\n\nThe total volume is 40 +2.5 =42.5 cm\u00b3 \u2192 0.0425 L.\n\nSo concentrations:\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.017647 M.\n\n[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M.\n\npH = pKa + log (0.005882 / 0.017647) \u2192 pKa is 4.73.\n\nThe ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 \u2248 0.3333 \u2192 log(0.3333) = -0.4771.\n\nSo pH = 4.73 - 0.4771 \u22484.2529 \u2192 approx 4.25. Option A is 4.26, which is very close.\n\nSo putting it all together, the pH at 25% is ~4.26, and at equivalence it's ~8.52. So the correct option is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm\u00b3 (0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M. After adding 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). Using the dilution formula \\( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \\), the new concentration is:\n\n\\[\nM_2 = \\frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{0.05 \\times 0.02}{0.04} = 0.025 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of CH}_3\\text{COOH} = 0.025 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.04 \\, \\text{L} = 0.001 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid reacts with NaOH. The moles of NaOH required are equal to the moles of acetic acid, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume of NaOH} = \\frac{\\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \\frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \\, \\text{L} = 10 \\, \\text{cm}^3.\n\\]\n\nThe total volume at the equivalence point is \\( 40.00 \\, \\text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \\, \\text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\). The concentration of acetate ions (\\( \\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^- \\)) is:\n\n\\[\n[\\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^-] = \\frac{\\text{Moles of CH}_3\\text{COO}^-}{\\text{Total Volume}} = \\frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^- + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\leftrightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH} + \\text{OH}^-.\n\\]\n\nThe \\( K_b \\) for acetate is calculated using \\( K_b = \\frac{K_w}{K_a} \\), where \\( K_w = 1 \\times 10^{-14} \\) and \\( K_a = 1.85 \\times 10^{-5} \\):\n\n\\[\nK_b = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 5.405 \\times 10^{-10}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the equilibrium expression for hydrolysis:\n\n\\[\nK_b = \\frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^-] - [OH^-]}.\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\( x \\ll 0.02 \\), we approximate:\n\n\\[\nK_b \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 = K_b \\times 0.02 = (5.405 \\times 10^{-10}) \\times 0.02 = 1.081 \\times 10^{-11},\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{1.081 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 1.04 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nThe hydroxide concentration is \\( [\\text{OH}^-] = 1.04 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{M} \\), so the pOH is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pOH} = -\\log(1.04 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 4.98.\n\\]\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 14 - \\text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.\n\\]\n\nHowever, this value is inconsistent with the options provided. Using the exact quadratic solution for \\( x \\) gives a slightly lower pH of approximately \\( 8.52 \\).\n\nAt 25% titration, 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH (0.00025 mol) reacts with 0.001 mol of acetic acid. The remaining moles of acetic acid and acetate ion are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of CH}_3\\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \\, \\text{mol},\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of CH}_3\\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \\, \\text{mol}.\n\\]\n\nThe total volume is \\( 40.00 \\, \\text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \\, \\text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\). The concentrations are:\n\n\\[\n[\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH}] = \\frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \\approx 0.0176 \\, \\text{M},\n\\]\n\\[\n[\\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^-] = \\frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \\approx 0.0059 \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = \\text{p}K_a + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^-]}{[\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH}]}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\text{p}K_a = -\\log(1.85 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 4.73 \\). Substituting the concentrations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 4.73 + \\log\\left(\\frac{0.0059}{0.0176}\\right) = 4.73 + \\log(0.333) \\approx 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25.\n\\]\n\nThis rounds to \\( 4.26 \\), matching the first value in option A.\n\nThus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \\( 4.26 \\), and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \\( 8.52 \\).
