Let me think about what this represents. Each term here is a projection operator. The first term, |0\u27e9\u27e80|, when multiplied by 1/2, gives a weight of 1/2 to the state |0\u27e9. Similarly, the second term gives a weight of 1/2 to |1\u27e9. So this looks like a classical mixture of the two basis states, right? Because it's an equal probability of being in state |0\u27e9 or |1\u27e9. \n\nWait, density matrices have certain properties. They should be Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and have a trace equal to 1. Let me check if this matrix meets those criteria. The matrix is obviously Hermitian because it's a sum of outer products of orthonormal vectors. The trace would be (1/2)(1) + (1/2)(1) = 1, so that's good. Positive semi-definite? Well, all eigenvalues should be non-negative. Let's compute the eigenvalues. The matrix \u03c1 is diagonal because it's a sum of |0\u27e9\u27e80| and |1\u27e9\u27e81|. So the diagonal entries are 1/2 and 1/2. Both are positive, so yes, it's positive semi-definite. \n\nNow, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |\u03c8\u27e9, it's represented as a vector on the surface of the sphere.

So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So \u03c1 = (1/2) I. \n\nSo substituting into the general form: I/2 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r\u00b7\u03c3. Subtract I: 0 = r\u00b7\u03c3. \n\nSo r\u00b7\u03c3 must be zero. That means that the Bloch vector r is zero.

The density matrix is Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and has a trace of 1, satisfying the properties of a valid density matrix.\n\nTo determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation.

I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state). \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what this matrix looks like. Let me write out the basis states. |0\u27e9 is [1, 0]^T and |1\u27e9 is [0, 1]^T. So |0\u27e9\u27e80| would be a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1\u27e9\u27e81| is 1 in (2,2) and zeros elsewhere. Adding these two matrices gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on both diagonal elements. Then, multiplying by 1/2, we get a matrix where the diagonal is [0.5, 0.5] and the off-diagonal elements are zero. So \u03c1 is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal.\n\nWait, what about the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space? I remember that for qubits, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. For pure states, it's a vector from the origin to a point on the unit sphere. But for mixed states, it's more complicated. I think the density matrix can be represented as a vector in a higher-dimensional space, maybe using the Bloch vector formalism.\n\nOh right! For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is \u03c1 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2, where I is the identity matrix, \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). \n\nSo if I express \u03c1 as (I + r_x \u03c3_x + r_y \u03c3_y + r_z \u03c3_z)/2, then I can compare it to the given \u03c1.

Let's express this using the identity and Pauli matrices.\n\nSo, let's compute (I + r_z \u03c3_z)/2, because in the given \u03c1, the off-diagonal elements are zero. The \u03c3_x and \u03c3_y terms would contribute to the off-diagonal elements. Since our \u03c1 has off-diagonal elements as zero, their coefficients must be zero.\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\u03c1 = (I + r_z \u03c3_z)/2 = (1/2)[[1,0],[0,1]] + (1/2) r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n= [[ (1 + r_z)/2 , 0 ], [0, (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]\n\nCompare this to our given \u03c1, which is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Since their corresponding Pauli matrices contribute to the off-diagonal elements, and in our \u03c1 those are zero, that implies that their coefficients (r_x and r_y) must be zero. \n\nSo the Bloch vector r has components (r_x, r_y, r_z) = (0,0,0). Wait, but looking back at the given options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which would be the origin. But wait, the density matrix for a completely mixed state is (I/2), which is exactly what we have here. Because for a mixed state of |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9 with equal probabilities, the density matrix is diagonal with 0.5 on both diagonal elements. \n\nSo the Bloch vector is at the origin because the state is completely mixed, not a pure state.

For a mixed state, the density matrix can be represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere, where the vector has a length less than or equal to 1.\n\nSo, how do I find the Bloch vector corresponding to the given \u03c1? The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is \u03c1 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2, where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (rx, ry, rz). Let me expand this.\n\nThe Pauli matrices are \u03c3x = [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], \u03c3z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Adding rx \u03c3x/2 gives [[1/2, rx/2], [rx/2, 1/2]]. Similarly, ry \u03c3y/2 is [[0, -i ry/2], [i ry/2, 0]], and rz \u03c3z/2 is [[rz/2, 0], [0, -rz/2]]. Adding all these together:\n\n\u03c1 = (I + rx \u03c3x + ry \u03c3y + rz \u03c3z ) / 2 = (1/2) [[1 + rz, rx - i ry], [rx + i ry, 1 - rz]].\n\nBut in our case, the given \u03c1 is diagonal: [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

So:\n\n(1 + rz)/2 = 1/2 \u2192 1 + rz = 1 \u2192 rz = 0.\n\nSimilarly, the (2,2) element is (1 - rz)/2. Plugging rz=0, it becomes (1)/2 = 1/2, which matches. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

Expanding this, the off-diagonal terms of \\(\\rho\\) are proportional to \\(r_x - i r_y\\), and the diagonal terms depend on \\(r_z\\). Since the given \\(\\rho\\) has zero off-diagonal terms, it implies \\(r_x = 0\\) and \\(r_y = 0\\). Additionally, the diagonal terms of \\(\\rho\\) are \\(1/2\\), which corresponds to \\(r_z = 0\\).

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe density matrix given is \u03c1 = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix would have a trace of 1 and be idempotent (squared equals itself). But this one is (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. Wait, that looks like a mixed state of |0> and |1>, each with probability 1/2. Because when you have a density matrix like p|a><a| + (1-p)|b><b|, it's a mixed state with probabilities p and 1-p for states |a> and |b>.\n\nSo what does this state represent? It's an equal superposition in terms of probabilities. But wait, no, it's a probabilistic mixture, not a superposition. So it's like being in state |0> half the time and |1> the other half. That's a completely mixed state for a single qubit, right? Because each of the basis states is equally likely.\n\nNow, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the mapping from density matrices to geometrical points. I think for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), where the state is represented as (sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03c6), sin(\u03b8)sin(\u03c6), cos(\u03b8)).\n\nWait, but how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch vector? Oh right, the density matrix for a single qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. The general form is \u03c1 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2, where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z). So for a pure state, the Bloch vector has magnitude 1, but for a mixed state, the magnitude is less than 1.\n\nIn our case, the given density matrix is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that. |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with [1, 0], |1><1| is [0,1]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So when multiplied by 1/2, the density matrix \u03c1 is (I)/2. So \u03c1 = I/2.\n\nNow, using the formula \u03c1 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2. Let me set \u03c1 equal to I/2. So I/2 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r\u00b7\u03c3. Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r\u00b7\u03c3. So r\u00b7\u03c3 is zero, meaning that r must be the zero vector.\n\nWait, because \u03c3 is the vector of Pauli matrices: \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z. So r\u00b7\u03c3 is r_x \u03c3_x + r_y \u03c3_y + r_z \u03c3_z. So if r is zero, then r\u00b7\u03c3 is zero. That makes sense because our \u03c1 is I/2, which is the completely mixed state.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in qubit space. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the density matrix given is \u03c1 = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So this must be a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>.\n\nWait, |0> and |1> are the basis states for a qubit. So each term in the density matrix is a projector onto these states. The coefficients are 1/2 each, meaning each state has a 50% probability. So this is a completely mixed state, right? Because the state is in a superposition of the two basis states, but with equal probabilities.\n\nNow, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space. Hmm. I'm a bit confused about what the qubit space refers to here. I think in terms of Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on a unit sphere. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.\n\nThe Bloch vector (r) for a qubit is usually written as r = (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the Pauli matrices. For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices. The formula I recall is:\n\n\u03c1 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2\n\nWhere \u03c3 represents the Pauli matrices. So if I can express the given \u03c1 in this form, I can find the components of r.\n\nLet me write out \u03c1 again. It's (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait a second, |0><0| is the projector onto state |0>, which in matrix form is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Then, \u03c1 becomes (1/2)I.\n\nSo \u03c1 = (I)/2. Let me compare this with the general form (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2. If I set them equal, (I)/2 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2. Subtracting I/2 from both sides gives 0 = r\u00b7\u03c3. So r\u00b7\u03c3 must be zero.\n\nWhat does that mean for r? The Pauli matrices \u03c3 are [[\u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z]]. Each \u03c3 matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], and [[1,0],[0,-1]], respectively. So r\u00b7\u03c3 is r_x \u03c3x + r_y \u03c3y + r_z \u03c3z.\n\nIf r\u00b7\u03c3 = 0, then each component must be zero because the \u03c3 matrices are linearly independent. So r_x must be zero, r_y must be zero, and r_z must be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).\n\nWait, but what does that point represent on the Bloch sphere? Oh right, the origin. That makes sense because the density matrix is (I/2), which is the maximally mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, pure states are on the surface (like r being a unit vector), and the completely mixed state is at the origin.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the answer. Let me double-check. The density matrix being the identity over 2 means it's a completely mixed state, so the Bloch vector is zero. Yep, that matches.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in qubit space. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nAlright, the density matrix given is \u03c1 = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So this must be a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>.\n\nWait, |0> and |1> are the basis states for a qubit. So each term in the density matrix is a projector onto these states. The coefficients are 1/2 each, meaning each state has a 50% probability. So this is a completely mixed state, right? Because the state is in a superposition of the two basis states, but with equal probabilities.\n\nNow, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space. Hmm. I'm a bit confused about what the qubit space refers to here. I think in terms of Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on a unit sphere. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.\n\nThe Bloch vector (r) for a qubit is usually written as r = (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the Pauli matrices. For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices. The formula I recall is:\n\n\u03c1 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2\n\nWhere \u03c3 represents the Pauli matrices. So if I can express the given \u03c1 in this form, I can find the components of r.\n\nLet me write out \u03c1 again. It's (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait a second, |0><0| is the projector onto state |0>, which in matrix form is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Then, \u03c1 becomes (1/2)I.\n\nSo \u03c1 = (I)/2. Let me compare this with the general form (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2. If I set them equal, (I)/2 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2. Subtracting I/2 from both sides gives 0 = r\u00b7\u03c3. So r\u00b7\u03c3 must be zero.\n\nWhat does that mean for r? The Pauli matrices \u03c3 are [[\u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z]]. Each \u03c3 matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], and [[1,0],[0,-1]], respectively. So r\u00b7\u03c3 is r_x \u03c3x + r_y \u03c3y + r_z \u03c3z.\n\nIf r\u00b7\u03c3 = 0, then each component must be zero because the \u03c3 matrices are linearly independent. So r_x must be zero, r_y must be zero, and r_z must be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).\n\nWait, but what does that point represent on the Bloch sphere? Oh right, the origin. That makes sense because the density matrix is (I/2), which is the maximally mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, pure states are on the surface (like r being a unit vector), and the completely mixed state is at the origin.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the answer. Let me double-check. The density matrix being the identity over 2 means it's a completely mixed state, so the Bloch vector is zero. Yep, that matches.\n\n\nThe given density matrix is \n\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| + \\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis represents a mixed state, specifically a maximally mixed state, as it assigns equal probabilities (50%) to the basis states \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation, where the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \\(\\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\\) as:\n\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( I + \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(I\\) is the identity matrix and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)\\) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \\(\\rho\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} I.\n\\]\n\nComparing this with the general form \\(\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} (I + \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\), it is clear that \\(\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = 0\\). Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this implies \\(r_x = 0\\), \\(r_y = 0\\), and \\(r_z = 0\\).
