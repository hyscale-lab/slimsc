      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons, positrons, and photons. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nSo, an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and one is moving in the upper-right direction while the other is in the lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.\n\nWait, okay. So, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron are each other's antiparticles, their annihilation would produce gamma rays or photons. The setup here says two photons are produced.\n\nI think energy and momentum must be conserved here. Because in any closed system, the total energy and momentum should remain the same before and after the collision.\n\nLet me think about the initial setup. So, the electron and positron are moving towards each other. The electron is moving left to right (since it's coming from the left and moving along the horizontal axis), and the positron is moving right to left (since it's coming from the right and moving along the same axis).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal, so direction is to the right. The positron is moving from the right along the horizontal, so direction is to the left. Oh wait, the question says, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So the positron is moving to the left? Or right? Wait, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the problem says the positron is moving from the right. So, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right. So if the electron is moving from the left towards the right, and the positron is moving from the right towards the left. So they're moving towards each other.\n\nHmm. So, they collide head-on. So, before collision, the electron is moving right (positive x-direction), the positron is moving left (negative x-direction). After collision, two photons are produced. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are both in the right, but one is upper-right and the other is lower-right.\n\nWait, no. The directions are measured as one moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So, both are moving to the right but in opposite vertical directions. So the angle between them is something we need to find.\n\nWait, but both are moving to the right, so the angle between their directions would be, say, 180 degrees minus the angle each makes with the horizontal. Or maybe it's the angle between them in the plane.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. If one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right, their directions are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis. So the angle between them would be 2\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle each makes with the horizontal. Or wait, maybe the angle between them is 180 - 2\u03b8? Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nBut first, I should probably compute the initial momentum and energy of the system to figure out what the photons' momenta should be.\n\nSo, let's calculate the initial momentum and energy. The electron and positron are moving towards each other.\n\nBut wait, their velocities are given via Lorentz factors. So the Lorentz factor \u03b3 is 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron.\n\nWait, the Lorentz factor is \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So for each particle, their gamma is given. So I can find their relativistic momentum and energies.\n\nWait, but particles have rest mass. The electron and positron have the same rest mass, right? So the rest mass is m_e c\u00b2 each.\n\nSo, for the electron: its gamma is 4, so its total energy is \u03b3 m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2. Its momentum is \u03b3 m_e v. But wait, another way to write relativistic momentum is p = \u03b3 m v. But since v = c\u00b2 / (gamma m_e c^2) * ... Wait, maybe it's easier to compute in terms of gamma.\n\nWait, another approach: for a particle, the momentum p is gamma m v, and the energy is gamma m c\u00b2. So for the electron, which is moving to the right, its momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But since the positron has the same mass as the electron, m_p = m_e.\n\nWait, but the positron's gamma is 2. So let me compute the momenta.\n\nWait, but I might need to find the velocities in terms of gamma. Alternatively, since I know gamma, I can relate momentum to gamma.\n\nWait, another formula: p = gamma m v. And we also have gamma = (1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)^(-1/2). So, maybe it's easier to express p in terms of gamma and m.\n\nWait, let me think. We can write v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). So for the electron, gamma_e =4, so v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4). So v_e is (sqrt(15)/4) c, which is approximately 0.968 c.\n\nSimilarly, the positron has gamma_p = 2. So v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c*sqrt(3/4) = c*(sqrt(3)/2), which is about 0.866 c.\n\nBut since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative. So its momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p. So, the positron's momentum is negative, as it's moving left.\n\nWait, let's compute the magnitudes. Let me compute the momentum of the electron and the positron.\n\nElectron:\ngamma_e =4, mass = m_e.\np_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nBut v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c.\n\nSo p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e * sqrt(15) c.\n\nSimilarly, positron:\ngamma_p =2,\nv_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2^2)) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c.\nBut since it's moving to the left, v_p = - (sqrt(3)/2) c.\n\nSo p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * ( - sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e * sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = [m_e sqrt(15) c ] + [ - m_e sqrt(3) c ].\n\nWait, let's compute that. m_e is common, so p_initial = m_e c [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ].\n\nHmm. Let me compute the numerical value of sqrt(15) and sqrt(3). sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872, and sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) is around 2.14. So p_initial \u2248 m_e c * 2.14.\n\nWait, but let me keep it symbolic for now. So p_initial = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ).\n\nNow, the total energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. Each has energy gamma m_e c^2.\n\nSo, E_initial = (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e c\u00b2 = (4 + 2) m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter the collision, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon. The problem states that both photons have the same energy. So each has E_photon = (6 m_e c^2) / 2 = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So each photon has energy 3 m_e c\u00b2. Now, photons carry momentum, and their momentum is E/c, but direction matters.\n\nPhotons are massless, so their energy E and momentum p are related by E = pc. So each photon's momentum magnitude is E_photon / c = (3 m_e c^2) / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nBut the directions of the photons are such that one is moving upper-right, and the other lower-right. So both are moving in the positive x-direction, but one is angled upwards and the other downwards.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but one is at an angle above the x-axis, the other below.\n\nSo, their momenta vectors are in the right half-plane, but symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis.\n\nHmm. Now, since photons are massless, their momentum vectors have magnitude p = E/c, but direction. So, the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the initial total momentum of the system.\n\nWait, but in the initial system, the total momentum was p_initial = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) in the positive x-direction.\n\nWait, wait, the positron's momentum was negative because it was moving to the left. So, in terms of direction, the electron's momentum is positive (right), and the positron's is negative (left). So the total initial momentum is p_initial = (gamma_e m_e v_e) - (gamma_p m_e v_p). Because the positron is moving left, so its velocity is negative, and so its momentum is negative.\n\nWait, so the total initial momentum is the sum of the two momenta. The electron is moving right, so positive, the positron left, so negative.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought p_initial = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ), but let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nElectron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nv_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e\u00b2) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c.\n\nSo p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) ) = m_e * sqrt(15) c.\n\nPositron's momentum: p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p.\n\nv_p is to the left, so v_p = - sqrt(3)/2 c.\n\nSo p_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ).\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) in the positive x-direction.\n\nAfter collision, the photons' momenta must sum to this same total.\n\nEach photon has momentum p_photon = E_photon / c = (3 m_e c\u00b2) / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nBut since each photon's direction is upper-right and lower-right, their momentum vectors are in the right half-plane, but symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis.\n\nLet me denote the angle each photon makes with the x-axis as \u03b8 above and \u03b8 below. So their momenta vectors are (p_photon * cos\u03b8, p_photon * sin\u03b8) and (p_photon * cos\u03b8, -p_photon * sin\u03b8).\n\nWait, but wait. Since both photons have the same energy and same magnitude of momentum, their momentum vectors have the same magnitude, but directions symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nSo the sum of their momenta would be (2 p_photon cos\u03b8, 0), because the y-components cancel out. Because one is positive and the other is negative.\n\nBut the total initial momentum is all along the x-axis, so the sum of the photons' momenta must also be along the x-axis. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, the total momentum after collision is (2 * p_photon * cos\u03b8, 0).\n\nThis must equal the initial momentum, which is (m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ), 0).\n\nSo,\n\n2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nBut p_photon is 3 m_e c, so:\n\n2 * (3 m_e c) * cos\u03b8 = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nSo,\n\ncos\u03b8 = [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] / 6\n\nHmm, let me compute that.\n\nsqrt(15) is approx 3.872, sqrt(3) is approx 1.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) is about 2.14.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 2.14 / 6 \u2248 0.3567.\n\nWhat angle has a cosine of about 0.3567? Let me think.\n\nI remember that cos(69\u00b0) is about 0.358. So \u03b8 is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nSo each photon makes an angle of about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. Therefore, the angle between the two photons would be 2\u03b8, which is about 138 degrees.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each is 69 degrees from the x-axis, so the angle between them is 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] more accurately.\n\nsqrt(15) \u2248 3.872983346\nsqrt(3) \u2248 1.732050808\nDifference: 3.872983346 -1.732050808 = 2.140932538\n\nDivide by 6: 2.140932538 /6 \u2248 0.35682209.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.3568. Let me find \u03b8.\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees. Let me double-check:\n\ncos(69\u00b0) \u2248 0.3584. Close enough.\n\nSo \u03b8 is about 69 degrees, so the angle between the two photons is 2 * 69 = 138 degrees. So the answer is C) 138.\n",

Let me compute the numerical value of sqrt(15) and sqrt(3). sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872, and sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) is around 2.14. So p_initial \u2248 m_e c * 2.14.\n\nWait, but let me keep it symbolic for now. So p_initial = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ).\n\nNow, the total energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. Each has energy gamma m_e c^2.\n\nSo, E_initial = (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e c\u00b2 = (4 + 2) m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter the collision, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon. The problem states that both photons have the same energy. So each has E_photon = (6 m_e c^2) / 2 = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So each photon has energy 3 m_e c\u00b2. Now, photons carry momentum, and their momentum is E/c, but direction matters.\n\nPhotons are massless, so their energy E and momentum p are related by E = pc. So each photon's momentum magnitude is E_photon / c = (3 m_e c^2) / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nBut the directions of the photons are such that one is moving upper-right, and the other lower-right. So both are moving in the positive x-direction, but one is angled upwards and the other downwards.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but one is at an angle above the x-axis, the other below.\n\nSo, their momenta vectors are in the right half-plane, but symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis.\n\nHmm. Now, since photons are massless, their momentum vectors have magnitude p = E/c, but direction. So, the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the initial total momentum of the system.\n\nWait, but in the initial system, the total momentum was p_initial = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) in the positive x-direction.\n\nWait, wait, the positron's momentum was negative because it was moving to the left. So, in terms of direction, the electron's momentum is positive (right), and the positron's is negative (left). So the total initial momentum is p_initial = (gamma_e m_e v_e) - (gamma_p m_e v_p). Because the positron is moving left, so its velocity is negative, and so its momentum is negative.\n\nWait, so the total initial momentum is the sum of the two momenta. The electron is moving right, so positive, the positron left, so negative.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought p_initial = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ), but let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nElectron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nv_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e\u00b2) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c.\n\nSo p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) ) = m_e * sqrt(15) c.\n\nPositron's momentum: p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p.\n\nv_p is to the left, so v_p = - sqrt(3)/2 c.\n\nSo p_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ).\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) in the positive x-direction.\n\nAfter collision, the photons' momenta must sum to this same total.\n\nEach photon has momentum p_photon = E_photon / c = (3 m_e c\u00b2) / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nBut since each photon's direction is upper-right and lower-right, their momentum vectors are in the right half-plane, but symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis.\n\nLet me denote the angle each photon makes with the x-axis as \u03b8 above and \u03b8 below. So their momenta vectors are (p_photon * cos\u03b8, p_photon * sin\u03b8) and (p_photon * cos\u03b8, -p_photon * sin\u03b8).\n\nWait, but wait. Since both photons have the same energy and same magnitude of momentum, their momentum vectors have the same magnitude, but directions symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nSo the sum of their momenta would be (2 p_photon cos\u03b8, 0), because the y-components cancel out. Because one is positive and the other is negative.\n\nBut the total initial momentum is all along the x-axis, so the sum of the photons' momenta must also be along the x-axis. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, the total momentum after collision is (2 * p_photon * cos\u03b8, 0).\n\nThis must equal the initial momentum, which is (m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ), 0).\n\nSo,\n\n2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nBut p_photon is 3 m_e c, so:\n\n2 * (3 m_e c) * cos\u03b8 = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nSo,\n\ncos\u03b8 = [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] / 6\n\nHmm, let me compute that.\n\nsqrt(15) is approx 3.872, sqrt(3) is approx 1.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) is about 2.14.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 2.14 / 6 \u2248 0.3567.\n\nWhat angle has a cosine of about 0.3567? Let me think.\n\nI remember that cos(69\u00b0) is about 0.358. So \u03b8 is approximately 69 degrees.\n\nSo each photon makes an angle of about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. Therefore, the angle between the two photons would be 2\u03b8, which is about 138 degrees.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each is 69 degrees from the x-axis, so the angle between them is 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] more accurately.\n\nsqrt(15) \u2248 3.872983346\nsqrt(3) \u2248 1.732050808\nDifference: 3.872983346 -1.732050808 = 2.140932538\n\nDivide by 6: 2.140932538 /6 \u2248 0.35682209.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.3568. Let me find \u03b8.\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees. Let me double-check:\n\ncos(69\u00b0) \u2248 0.3584. Close enough.\n\nSo \u03b8 is about 69 degrees, so the angle between the two photons is 2 * 69 = 138 degrees. So the answer is C) 138.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate to produce two photons. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - The electron moves to the right (positive x-direction) with a Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma_e = 4 \\).\n   - The positron moves to the left (negative x-direction) with a Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma_p = 2 \\).\n   - Both particles have the same rest mass \\( m_e \\).\n\n2. **Conservation Laws**:\n   - **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the collision is conserved.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves an electron and a positron annihilating each other and producing two photons. I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce gamma-ray photons. But let's see what the problem says.\n\nAlright, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, both annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between these two photons.\n\nWait, Lorentz factor is gamma. Gamma is the factor by which time and length dilate. But in terms of energy and momentum, gamma is important because it relates the rest mass energy to the total energy. The rest mass of an electron and positron is the same, right? So the electron has gamma 4, and the positron has gamma 2.\n\nI think I should calculate the total energy and momentum before the collision. Because in any collision, energy and momentum are conserved. So the total energy of the system before annihilation should equal the total energy after, and same with momentum.\n\nSo the initial system consists of an electron and a positron moving towards each other. Let's model this in one dimension first. Wait, but the photons are moving in different directions, one upper-right and one lower-right. So their directions aren't purely along the horizontal axis. Hmm, so maybe I should consider conservation of momentum in both x and y directions, or maybe in 2D.\n\nWait, the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So both photons are moving to the right, but one is above the axis and the other is below. So the angle between them is the angle each makes with the horizontal, but in opposite vertical directions. So the total angle between them would be twice the angle each makes with the horizontal. Or maybe not, perhaps it's the angle between their vectors, which could be 180 minus twice each angle. I'm not sure yet, but let's proceed.\n\nFirst, let me compute the total energy and momentum before the collision.\n\nEach particle's energy is gamma * m c^2. The rest mass of an electron is m = 9.1e-31 kg, but perhaps I don't need to plug in numbers. The positron has the same mass as the electron, so m_e for both.\n\nElectron's gamma is 4, so energy E_e = 4 m c\u00b2. Since it's moving to the left, its momentum p_e is negative. Because momentum is in the direction of motion. So if the horizontal axis is x, and left is negative, right is positive. So the electron's velocity is to the left, so momentum is negative. The positron is moving to the right, so its momentum is positive.\n\nWait, the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is to the left? Wait, no. Wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if I imagine the electron is on the left moving right, and the positron is on the right moving left. So they're approaching each other.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis. So that's to the right direction. The positron is moving from the right along the horizontal axis. So that's to the left direction. So they are moving towards each other.\n\nSo their velocities are opposite. So their momenta are opposite in direction.\n\nSo for the electron (e-), gamma is 4. So its momentum p_e is gamma * m_e * v_e, but the direction is to the right (positive x). The positron (e+), gamma is 2, so its momentum p_p is gamma * m_e * v_p, but direction is to the left (negative x).\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, the momentum direction is determined by the velocity. So if the electron is moving from left to right, its velocity is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its velocity is negative. So their momenta would be in opposite directions.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate their momentum vectors?\n\nActually, let me think in terms of momentum vectors. Let's take the positive x-axis as to the right.\n\nElectron: moving from left (so coming towards the right), so its velocity is positive. So its momentum is positive. Positron: moving from right, which would be towards the left, so its velocity is negative, so its momentum is negative.\n\nSo, the total momentum before collision is the sum of the two momenta.\n\nBut wait, for each particle, the momentum magnitude is gamma * m_e * v. But since velocity is in opposite directions, the positron's momentum is negative.\n\nWait, but let's calculate the actual values. Maybe we can find the velocity in terms of c. Because Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). So for each particle, we can find v.\n\nFor the electron: gamma_e = 4.\n\ngamma_e = 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nSolving for v_e:\n\nsqrt(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/4.\n\nSquare both sides: 1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/16.\n\nv_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16.\n\nv_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c * (sqrt(15)/4) \u2248 0.968 c.\n\nSimilarly for the positron: gamma_p = 2.\n\ngamma_p = 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nsqrt(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/2.\n\n1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/4.\n\nv_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3/4.\n\nv_p = c * sqrt(3/4) = c*(sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 0.866 c.\n\nSo, the electron is moving to the right with v_e \u2248 0.968 c, and the positron is moving to the left with v_p \u2248 0.866 c.\n\nSo the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nBut wait, actually, the relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v. So yes.\n\nSo p_e = 4 * m_e * (0.968 c) = 4 * 0.968 * m_e c \u2248 3.872 m_e c.\n\nThe positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative. So p_p = 2 * m_e * (-0.866 c) \u2248 -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p.\n\np_total = (3.872 - 1.732) m_e c \u2248 2.14 m_e c.\n\nWait, that's the total momentum in the x-direction.\n\nNow, the energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nEnergy of electron: E_e = gamma_e * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nEnergy of positron: E_p = gamma_p * m_e c\u00b2 = 2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nTotal energy E_total = 4 + 2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter the collision, the system consists of two photons. Each photon has energy E_photon, and since they have the same energy, E_photon is same for both.\n\nSo the total energy after is 2 E_photon. So 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nEach photon's energy is 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nNow, the two photons are moving in directions upper-right and lower-right. So their momenta are in the x and y directions. Let's model this in 2D.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 has momentum vector (p1x, p1y), and photon 2 has (p2x, p2y). Since photons are massless, their energy E = |p| c. So for each photon, E = |p| c \u2192 |p| = E/(c).\n\nSo for photon 1: |p1| = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nSimilarly, |p2| = 3 m_e c.\n\nSince the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, their y-components of momentum will be opposite in sign. Let's say photon 1 is moving in the upper-right, so its y component is positive, and photon 2 is moving in lower-right, so its y component is negative.\n\nSo, the total momentum after the collision must equal the total momentum before, which is 2.14 m_e c in the x-direction, and 0 in the y-direction (since before collision, the only momentum is along x).\n\nSo, summing the x and y components after collision:\n\nTotal x-momentum: p1x + p2x = 2.14 m_e c.\n\nTotal y-momentum: p1y + p2y = 0.\n\nSince the photons are symmetric in the y-direction, perhaps their y-components are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So p1y = - p2y.\n\nBut wait, each photon's momentum has magnitude 3 m_e c. So for photon 1, p1 = (p1x, p1y), and photon 2, p2 = (p2x, -p1y).\n\nBecause the sum of p1y and p2y must be zero.\n\nSo, the momentum vectors for the photons are:\n\np1x^2 + p1y^2 = (3 m_e c)^2,\n\np2x^2 + (p1y)^2 = (3 m_e c)^2.\n\nBut since p2x is another component, but I need to find the x and y components.\n\nSo the total x-momentum is p1x + p2x = 2.14 m_e c.\n\nLet me write down equations:\n\nEquation 1: p1x + p2x = 2.14 m_e c.\n\nEquation 2: p1y + p2y = 0 \u2192 p1y = -p2y.\n\nBut since p2y = -p1y, let me denote p1y = a, so p2y = -a.\n\nNow, for photon 1:\n\np1x^2 + a^2 = (3 m_e c)^2. \u2192 equation 3.\n\nFor photon 2:\n\np2x^2 + a^2 = (3 m_e c)^2. \u2192 equation 4.\n\nSo, equations 3 and 4 are the same, which makes sense because the photons have the same energy.\n\nSo subtracting equation 3 from equation 4:\n\np2x^2 - p1x^2 = 0 \u2192 p2x = \u00b1p1x.\n\nBut from equation 1: p1x + p2x = 2.14 m_e c.\n\nIf p2x = p1x, then 2 p1x = 2.14 \u2192 p1x = 1.07. So p2x = 1.07.\n\nBut then, let's see if that works.\n\nWait, but wait. If p2x = p1x, then the sum is 2 p1x = 2.14 \u2192 p1x = 1.07 m_e c.\n\nThen, from equation 3:\n\n(1.07)^2 + a^2 = (3)^2 \u2192 1.1449 + a^2 = 9 \u2192 a^2 = 7.8551 \u2192 a \u2248 2.8 m_e c.\n\nSo p1y \u2248 2.8 m_e c, and p2y \u2248 -2.8 m_e c.\n\nBut then, each photon's momentum magnitude is sqrt(1.07\u00b2 + 2.8\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(1.14 +7.84)= sqrt(8.98)\u22482.997, which is about 3. So that works.\n\nBut wait, the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So photon 1's direction is determined by its momentum vector (1.07, 2.8), and photon 2's direction is (1.07, -2.8).\n\nWait, but that would make both photons moving in the same x-direction but opposite y. But wait, their x-components are positive, so both are moving to the right. But that's what the problem states. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but that would mean the angle between them is the angle between (1.07,2.8) and (1.07,-2.8). So the angle between these two vectors.\n\nLet me calculate the angle each makes with the x-axis, then find the angle between them.\n\nThe angle theta for photon 1 is arctan(2.8 / 1.07) \u2248 arctan(2.612) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, photon 2 is at arctan(-2.8/1.07) \u2192 -69 degrees, but since it's in the fourth quadrant (x positive, y negative), the angle from the x-axis is 69 degrees below the x-axis.\n\nSo the angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option C is 138.\n\nAlternatively, the angle between the two vectors can be found using the dot product.\n\nThe vectors are (1.07, 2.8) and (1.07, -2.8).\n\nDot product = (1.07)(1.07) + (2.8)(-2.8) = (1.1449) - (7.84) = -6.6951.\n\nThe magnitude of each vector is sqrt(1.07\u00b2 + 2.8\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(1.14 +7.84)= sqrt(8.98)= ~2.997.\n\nSo the dot product formula:\n\ncos(theta) = (dot product) / (|v1| |v2| )\n\n= (-6.6951)/( (2.997)^2 )\n\nWait, (2.997)^2 \u2248 8.98. So:\n\ncos(theta) \u2248 (-6.6951)/8.98 \u2248 -0.745.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(-0.745) \u2248 138 degrees.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees. So the correct answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves an electron and a positron annihilating each other and producing two photons. I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce gamma-ray photons. But let's see what the problem says.\n\nAlright, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, both annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between these two photons.\n\nWait, Lorentz factor is gamma. Gamma is the factor by which time and length dilate. But in terms of energy and momentum, gamma is important because it relates the rest mass energy to the total energy. The rest mass of an electron and positron is the same, right? So the electron has gamma 4, and the positron has gamma 2.\n\nI think I should calculate the total energy and momentum before the collision. Because in any collision, energy and momentum are conserved. So the total energy of the system before annihilation should equal the total energy after, and same with momentum.\n\nSo the initial system consists of an electron and a positron moving towards each other. Let's model this in one dimension first. Wait, but the photons are moving in different directions, one upper-right and one lower-right. So their directions aren't purely along the horizontal axis. Hmm, so maybe I should consider conservation of momentum in both x and y directions, or maybe in 2D.\n\nWait, the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So both photons are moving to the right, but one is above the axis and the other is below. So the angle between them is the angle each makes with the horizontal, but in opposite vertical directions. So the total angle between them would be twice the angle each makes with the horizontal. Or maybe not, perhaps it's the angle between their vectors, which could be 180 minus twice each angle. I'm not sure yet, but let's proceed.\n\nFirst, let me compute the total energy and momentum before the collision.\n\nEach particle's energy is gamma * m c^2. The rest mass of an electron is m = 9.1e-31 kg, but perhaps I don't need to plug in numbers. The positron has the same mass as the electron, so m_e for both.\n\nElectron's gamma is 4, so energy E_e = 4 m c\u00b2. Since it's moving to the left, its momentum p_e is negative. Because momentum is in the direction of motion. So if the horizontal axis is x, and left is negative, right is positive. So the electron's velocity is to the left, so momentum is negative. The positron is moving to the right, so its momentum is positive.\n\nWait, the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is to the left? Wait, no. Wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if I imagine the electron is on the left moving right, and the positron is on the right moving left. So they're approaching each other.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis. So that's to the right direction. The positron is moving from the right along the horizontal axis. So that's to the left direction. So they are moving towards each other.\n\nSo their velocities are opposite. So their momenta are opposite in direction.\n\nSo for the electron (e-), gamma is 4. So its momentum p_e is gamma * m_e * v_e, but the direction is to the right (positive x). The positron (e+), gamma is 2, so its momentum p_p is gamma * m_e * v_p, but direction is to the left (negative x).\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, the momentum direction is determined by the velocity. So if the electron is moving from left to right, its velocity is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its velocity is negative. So their momenta would be in opposite directions.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate their momentum vectors?\n\nActually, let me think in terms of momentum vectors. Let's take the positive x-axis as to the right.\n\nElectron: moving from left (so coming towards the right), so its velocity is positive. So its momentum is positive. Positron: moving from right, which would be towards the left, so its velocity is negative, so its momentum is negative.\n\nSo, the total momentum before collision is the sum of the two momenta.\n\nBut wait, for each particle, the momentum magnitude is gamma * m_e * v. But since velocity is in opposite directions, the positron's momentum is negative.\n\nWait, but let's calculate the actual values. Maybe we can find the velocity in terms of c. Because Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). So for each particle, we can find v.\n\nFor the electron: gamma_e = 4.\n\ngamma_e = 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nSolving for v_e:\n\nsqrt(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/4.\n\nSquare both sides: 1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/16.\n\nv_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16.\n\nv_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c * (sqrt(15)/4) \u2248 0.968 c.\n\nSimilarly for the positron: gamma_p = 2.\n\ngamma_p = 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2).\n\nsqrt(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/2.\n\n1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/4.\n\nv_p\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3/4.\n\nv_p = c * sqrt(3/4) = c*(sqrt(3)/2) \u2248 0.866 c.\n\nSo, the electron is moving to the right with v_e \u2248 0.968 c, and the positron is moving to the left with v_p \u2248 0.866 c.\n\nSo the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nBut wait, actually, the relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v. So yes.\n\nSo p_e = 4 * m_e * (0.968 c) = 4 * 0.968 * m_e c \u2248 3.872 m_e c.\n\nThe positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative. So p_p = 2 * m_e * (-0.866 c) \u2248 -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p.\n\np_total = (3.872 - 1.732) m_e c \u2248 2.14 m_e c.\n\nWait, that's the total momentum in the x-direction.\n\nNow, the energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nEnergy of electron: E_e = gamma_e * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nEnergy of positron: E_p = gamma_p * m_e c\u00b2 = 2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nTotal energy E_total = 4 + 2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter the collision, the system consists of two photons. Each photon has energy E_photon, and since they have the same energy, E_photon is same for both.\n\nSo the total energy after is 2 E_photon. So 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nEach photon's energy is 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nNow, the two photons are moving in directions upper-right and lower-right. So their momenta are in the x and y directions. Let's model this in 2D.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 has momentum vector (p1x, p1y), and photon 2 has (p2x, p2y). Since photons are massless, their energy E = |p| c. So for each photon, E = |p| c \u2192 |p| = E/(c).\n\nSo for photon 1: |p1| = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nSimilarly, |p2| = 3 m_e c.\n\nSince the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, their y-components of momentum will be opposite in sign. Let's say photon 1 is moving in the upper-right, so its y component is positive, and photon 2 is moving in lower-right, so its y component is negative.\n\nSo, the total momentum after the collision must equal the total momentum before, which is 2.14 m_e c in the x-direction, and 0 in the y-direction (since before collision, the only momentum is along x).\n\nSo, summing the x and y components after collision:\n\nTotal x-momentum: p1x + p2x = 2.14 m_e c.\n\nTotal y-momentum: p1y + p2y = 0.\n\nSince the photons are symmetric in the y-direction, perhaps their y-components are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So p1y = - p2y.\n\nBut wait, each photon's momentum has magnitude 3 m_e c. So for photon 1, p1 = (p1x, p1y), and photon 2, p2 = (p2x, -p1y).\n\nBecause the sum of p1y and p2y must be zero.\n\nSo, the momentum vectors for the photons are:\n\np1x^2 + p1y^2 = (3 m_e c)^2,\n\np2x^2 + (p1y)^2 = (3 m_e c)^2.\n\nBut since p2x is another component, but I need to find the x and y components.\n\nSo the total x-momentum is p1x + p2x = 2.14 m_e c.\n\nLet me write down equations:\n\nEquation 1: p1x + p2x = 2.14 m_e c.\n\nEquation 2: p1y + p2y = 0 \u2192 p1y = -p2y.\n\nBut since p2y = -p1y, let me denote p1y = a, so p2y = -a.\n\nNow, for photon 1:\n\np1x^2 + a^2 = (3 m_e c)^2. \u2192 equation 3.\n\nFor photon 2:\n\np2x^2 + a^2 = (3 m_e c)^2. \u2192 equation 4.\n\nSo, equations 3 and 4 are the same, which makes sense because the photons have the same energy.\n\nSo subtracting equation 3 from equation 4:\n\np2x^2 - p1x^2 = 0 \u2192 p2x = \u00b1p1x.\n\nBut from equation 1: p1x + p2x = 2.14 m_e c.\n\nIf p2x = p1x, then 2 p1x = 2.14 \u2192 p1x = 1.07. So p2x = 1.07.\n\nBut then, let's see if that works.\n\nWait, but wait. If p2x = p1x, then the sum is 2 p1x = 2.14 \u2192 p1x = 1.07 m_e c.\n\nThen, from equation 3:\n\n(1.07)^2 + a^2 = (3)^2 \u2192 1.1449 + a^2 = 9 \u2192 a^2 = 7.8551 \u2192 a \u2248 2.8 m_e c.\n\nSo p1y \u2248 2.8 m_e c, and p2y \u2248 -2.8 m_e c.\n\nBut then, each photon's momentum magnitude is sqrt(1.07\u00b2 + 2.8\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(1.14 +7.84)= sqrt(8.98)\u22482.997, which is about 3. So that works.\n\nBut wait, the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So photon 1's direction is determined by its momentum vector (1.07, 2.8), and photon 2's direction is (1.07, -2.8).\n\nWait, but that would make both photons moving in the same x-direction but opposite y. But wait, their x-components are positive, so both are moving to the right. But that's what the problem states. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but that would mean the angle between them is the angle between (1.07,2.8) and (1.07,-2.8). So the angle between these two vectors.\n\nLet me calculate the angle each makes with the x-axis, then find the angle between them.\n\nThe angle theta for photon 1 is arctan(2.8 / 1.07) \u2248 arctan(2.612) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, photon 2 is at arctan(-2.8/1.07) \u2192 -69 degrees, but since it's in the fourth quadrant (x positive, y negative), the angle from the x-axis is 69 degrees below the x-axis.\n\nSo the angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option C is 138.\n\nAlternatively, the angle between the two vectors can be found using the dot product.\n\nThe vectors are (1.07, 2.8) and (1.07, -2.8).\n\nDot product = (1.07)(1.07) + (2.8)(-2.8) = (1.1449) - (7.84) = -6.6951.\n\nThe magnitude of each vector is sqrt(1.07\u00b2 + 2.8\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(1.14 +7.84)= sqrt(8.98)= ~2.997.\n\nSo the dot product formula:\n\ncos(theta) = (dot product) / (|v1| |v2| )\n\n= (-6.6951)/( (2.997)^2 )\n\nWait, (2.997)^2 \u2248 8.98. So:\n\ncos(theta) \u2248 (-6.6951)/8.98 \u2248 -0.745.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(-0.745) \u2248 138 degrees.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees. So the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, producing two photons with equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.\n\n### Key Setup and Conservation Laws\n1. **Initial System**:  \n   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2.  \n   - The rest mass energy of each particle is \\( m_e c^2 \\).  \n   - Total energy before collision:  \n     \\[\n     E_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2\n     \\]\n   - Total momentum before collision:  \n     \\[\n     p_{\\text{total}} = p_e + p_p\n     \\]\n     where \\( p_e = \\gamma_e m_e v_e \\) and \\( p_p = \\gamma_p m_e v_p \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nSo, the setup is an electron and a positron moving along a horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right. Both have Lorentz factors, which I remember is gamma (\u03b3) equal to E/(m c\u00b2) or 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). The Lorentz factor for the electron is 4, and for the positron, it's 2.\n\nThey collide and annihilate each other, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I think about conservation laws here. Since the electron and positron are annihilating, the system's momentum and energy must be conserved. The photons must carry off the total energy and momentum of the system.\n\nWait, but electrons and positrons have equal rest mass but opposite charges. But in terms of momentum, their directions are opposite. So their total momentum before collision is the sum of their individual momenta.\n\nWait, let's clarify the directions. The electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis, so let's say the positive x-direction. The positron is moving from the right, so that's the negative x-direction. So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nBut wait, wait. No, wait. Let me get the directions right. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left. So, for example, if the positive x-axis is to the right, the electron is moving in the +x direction. The positron is moving from the right, so that would be in the -x direction. So their velocities are opposite in direction.\n\nBut wait, no, wait again. If the electron is moving from the left towards the right, and the positron is moving from the right towards the left, that's correct. So their momenta are opposite in direction.\n\nWait, but when they collide, they annihilate into two photons. So the total momentum after must equal the total before.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the total momentum of the system before the collision.\n\nEach particle's momentum is given by gamma * m * v. But wait, the electron and positron have the same rest mass, m_e. So the electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * v_e, and the positron's is gamma_p * m_e * v_p.\n\nWait, but since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its velocity is negative. So the total momentum is gamma_e m_e v_e - gamma_p m_e v_p. Because the positron's velocity is in the opposite direction.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of gamma. Because gamma is given. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute their relativistic momenta.\n\nWait, the relativistic momentum p is gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since gamma = E/(m c\u00b2), and E\u00b2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. Hmm.\n\nWait, but for a photon, momentum is E/c, and it's directed along the photon's direction.\n\nSo, the problem says that after annihilation, two photons are produced. Both have the same energy, E. So each photon has momentum E/c in their respective directions.\n\nThe directions: one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So they're symmetric with respect to the x-axis, I suppose. So their angles from the x-axis are theta and -theta, perhaps? Or maybe 180 minus that? Wait, no. Upper-right and lower-right would imply that both are in the right half-plane. So perhaps one is at angle theta above the x-axis, the other at angle theta below the x-axis.\n\nWait, but the problem says the directions were measured. One is upper-right, another lower-right. So their angles relative to the x-axis are, say, theta and 360 - theta? Or maybe 180 - theta? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, the two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right. So their angles are in the first and fourth quadrants. Let's say one makes an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and the other \u03b8 below. So the angle between them would be 2\u03b8. But wait, the question is asking for the angle between the two photons' directions, so that's 2\u03b8, right?\n\nBut how do I find \u03b8?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle between the two is 180 - 2\u03b8, depending on how they are arranged. Hmm, maybe I should draw a diagram. But since I can't, I'll try to visualize it.\n\nWait, the problem says that the two photons have the same energy. So their momenta have the same magnitude, but directions. So their momenta vectors would be symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nSo their y-components would be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, and their x-components would be the same in direction. Wait, no. Because the upper-right photon would have positive y and positive x components, while the lower-right would have negative y and positive x components. So their x-components are in the same direction, but their y-components are opposite.\n\nWait, but the total momentum before collision is along the x-axis. So the sum of the photons' momenta must also be along the x-axis. Because before collision, the system's momentum is along x, so after, the momentum must also be along x.\n\nSo the total momentum of the two photons in the y-direction must cancel out. Let me see. Let's denote the momenta of the two photons as p1 and p2.\n\np1 has components (p_x, p_y), and p2 has (p_x', p_y'). Since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are the same. So |p1| = |p2|.\n\nWait, but the energy of each photon is E, so their momentum is E/(c) in magnitude. So each photon's momentum vector has magnitude E/c.\n\nSo the components would be:\n\np1: (E/c * cos\u03b8, E/c * sin\u03b8 )\n\np2: (E/c * cos\u03c6, E/c * sin\u03c6 )\n\nBut the problem states that one photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So perhaps \u03b8 is positive, and \u03c6 is negative. Alternatively, maybe \u03c6 is 360 - \u03b8, but that would be in the lower-right.\n\nWait, but the angle between the two photons would be \u03b8 - (-\u03b8) = 2\u03b8, but perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, it's the angle between their directions, so the angle between p1 and p2 would be \u03b8 - (-\u03b8) = 2\u03b8.\n\nBut wait, the total momentum after collision must be along the x-axis because the initial momentum was along x. So the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero.\n\nSo:\n\nE/(c) sin\u03b8 + E/(c) sin\u03c6 = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to sin\u03b8 + sin\u03c6 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, the sum of the x-components must equal the initial total momentum.\n\nSo let's compute the initial total momentum.\n\nThe initial system consists of an electron moving to the right (let's say +x) and a positron moving to the left (-x). Wait, but the positron is moving from the right, which would be to the left, so its velocity is in -x direction.\n\nSo their momenta are:\n\np_electron = gamma_e * m_e * v_e\n\np_positron = gamma_p * m_e * v_p\n\nBut since the positron is moving in the -x direction, v_p is negative. So the momentum is gamma_p * m_e * (-v_p) in the x direction.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the signs. Let me think again. The electron is moving to the right, so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_e - p_p, where p_p is the positron's magnitude.\n\nWait, but wait, gamma_e is 4, and gamma_p is 2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute the momentum in terms of gamma. Alternatively, since E = gamma m c^2, and p = gamma m v.\n\nBut maybe another approach is better. Let's compute the total energy and total momentum before annihilation.\n\nSo the total energy is E_e + E_p = gamma_e m c\u00b2 + gamma_p m c\u00b2.\n\nThe total momentum is p_e - p_p (since the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction).\n\nWait, but p_e is gamma_e m_e v_e, and p_p is gamma_p m_e v_p, but v_p is in the opposite direction, so it's -v_p.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the positron is moving to the left (from the right), its velocity is negative. So p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p, but v_p is negative. So the positron's momentum is negative.\n\nSo the total momentum is p_e + p_p, but wait, p_p is negative because v_p is negative.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: p_e is in +x, p_p is in -x, so the total momentum is p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, no. Because p_p is the magnitude, but since it's moving in -x, its momentum is negative. So the total momentum is p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative) = p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to write p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e (v_e positive), and p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p (v_p negative). So the total momentum is p_e + p_p = gamma_e m_e v_e + gamma_p m_e v_p.\n\nBut since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, v_p is negative. So it's like p_e + (- |p_p|) ?\n\nWait, maybe I should express v_e and v_p in terms of gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express each momentum in terms of gamma.\n\nWait, another approach: for a particle moving at speed v, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo for the electron, gamma_e =4, so v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c.\n\nSimilarly, the positron has gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c. But since it's moving in the opposite direction, v_p is negative.\n\nSo the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\nSimilarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m_e |v_p| = 2 m_e (sqrt(3)/2) c = m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nBut since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but let me check that: the electron's momentum is positive, the positron's is negative, so when you add them, it's (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is P_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, after the collision, the two photons have momenta p1 and p2. Their sum must equal P_initial.\n\nBut since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their momenta are in the +x and +x directions, but with y-components in opposite directions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because the positron is moving to the left, and the electron to the right, so the total initial momentum is (p_e - p_p) in the x-direction.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier in the direction.\n\nWait, let's correct that. The electron is moving to the right (positive x), so its momentum is + p_e.\n\nThe positron is moving to the left (negative x), so its momentum is - p_p.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, no. Because p_p is the magnitude of the positron's momentum, which is in the negative x-direction. So the total momentum is p_e (positive) plus (-p_p) (because p_p is in -x), so P_initial = p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had p_e as 4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\np_p is 2 m_e (sqrt(3)/2) c = m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo P_initial = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, the photons' momenta must add up to this.\n\nEach photon's momentum has components.\n\nLet me denote the first photon's momentum as p1, and the second as p2.\n\nSince both photons have energy E, their magnitudes are E/c.\n\nBut since they're moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their angles from the x-axis are \u03b8 and -\u03b8, respectively.\n\nSo p1 has components (E/c cos\u03b8, E/c sin\u03b8).\n\np2 has components (E/c cos(-\u03b8), E/c sin(-\u03b8)) ) = (E/c cos\u03b8, - E/c sin\u03b8).\n\nWait, but that would mean the y-components cancel each other out, which is necessary because the initial system's momentum is along x.\n\nYes, because the initial y-momentum is zero, the total y-momentum after must also be zero.\n\nSo the sum of the y-components of p1 and p2 is E/c sin\u03b8 - E/c sin\u03b8 = 0. Perfect.\n\nThe sum of the x-components is E/c cos\u03b8 + E/c cos\u03b8 = 2 E/(c) cos\u03b8.\n\nThis sum must equal the initial x-momentum, which is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo:\n\n2 E/(c) cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBut wait, the energy of each photon is E. The total energy of the system before collision is E_e + E_p = (gamma_e m_e c\u00b2) + (gamma_p m_e c\u00b2) ) = (4 + 2) m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the photons' energies, which is 2 E. So 2 E = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAh, that's an important point. So each photon has energy E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo substituting E into the x-momentum equation:\n\n2 * (3 m_e c\u00b2) / c * cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n2 * 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 6 m_e c.\n\nSo:\n\n6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n\nCompute that value:\n\nsqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298\n\nsqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 -1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 / 6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.35682) \u2248 69 degrees (since cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)=0.3420, cos(69)\u22480.3584, which is close).\n\nWait, let me calculate it more accurately.\n\ncos(69 degrees) \u2248 0.3584.\n\nSo 0.35682 is a bit less than that, so maybe 69.2 degrees, but approximately 69 degrees.\n\nBut wait, the angle between the photons is 2\u03b8. Because each photon is at \u03b8 and -\u03b8 from the x-axis, so the angle between them is 2\u03b8.\n\nSo 2 * 69 degrees \u2248 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nSo, the setup is an electron and a positron moving along a horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right. Both have Lorentz factors, which I remember is gamma (\u03b3) equal to E/(m c\u00b2) or 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). The Lorentz factor for the electron is 4, and for the positron, it's 2.\n\nThey collide and annihilate each other, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I think about conservation laws here. Since the electron and positron are annihilating, the system's momentum and energy must be conserved. The photons must carry off the total energy and momentum of the system.\n\nWait, but electrons and positrons have equal rest mass but opposite charges. But in terms of momentum, their directions are opposite. So their total momentum before collision is the sum of their individual momenta.\n\nWait, let's clarify the directions. The electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis, so let's say the positive x-direction. The positron is moving from the right, so that's the negative x-direction. So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nBut wait, wait. No, wait. Let me get the directions right. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left. So, for example, if the positive x-axis is to the right, the electron is moving in the +x direction. The positron is moving from the right, so that would be in the -x direction. So their velocities are opposite in direction.\n\nBut wait, no, wait again. If the electron is moving from the left towards the right, and the positron is moving from the right towards the left, that's correct. So their momenta are opposite in direction.\n\nWait, but when they collide, they annihilate into two photons. So the total momentum after must equal the total before.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the total momentum of the system before the collision.\n\nEach particle's momentum is given by gamma * m * v. But wait, the electron and positron have the same rest mass, m_e. So the electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * v_e, and the positron's is gamma_p * m_e * v_p.\n\nWait, but since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its velocity is negative. So the total momentum is gamma_e m_e v_e - gamma_p m_e v_p. Because the positron's velocity is in the opposite direction.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of gamma. Because gamma is given. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute their relativistic momenta.\n\nWait, the relativistic momentum p is gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since gamma = E/(m c\u00b2), and E\u00b2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. Hmm.\n\nWait, but for a photon, momentum is E/c, and it's directed along the photon's direction.\n\nSo, the problem says that after annihilation, two photons are produced.

Hmm, maybe I should draw a diagram. But since I can't, I'll try to visualize it.\n\nWait, the problem says that the two photons have the same energy. So their momenta have the same magnitude, but directions. So their momenta vectors would be symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nSo their y-components would be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, and their x-components would be the same in direction.

The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_e - p_p, where p_p is the positron's magnitude.\n\nWait, but wait, gamma_e is 4, and gamma_p is 2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute the momentum in terms of gamma.

Let's compute the total energy and total momentum before annihilation.\n\nSo the total energy is E_e + E_p = gamma_e m c\u00b2 + gamma_p m c\u00b2.\n\nThe total momentum is p_e - p_p (since the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction).\n\nWait, but p_e is gamma_e m_e v_e, and p_p is gamma_p m_e v_p, but v_p is in the opposite direction, so it's -v_p.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if the positron is moving to the left (from the right), its velocity is negative. So p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p, but v_p is negative. So the positron's momentum is negative.\n\nSo the total momentum is p_e + p_p, but wait, p_p is negative because v_p is negative.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: p_e is in +x, p_p is in -x, so the total momentum is p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, no. Because p_p is the magnitude, but since it's moving in -x, its momentum is negative. So the total momentum is p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative) = p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to write p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e (v_e positive), and p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p (v_p negative). So the total momentum is p_e + p_p = gamma_e m_e v_e + gamma_p m_e v_p.\n\nBut since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, v_p is negative. So it's like p_e + (- |p_p|) ?\n\nWait, maybe I should express v_e and v_p in terms of gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express each momentum in terms of gamma.\n\nWait, another approach: for a particle moving at speed v, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo for the electron, gamma_e =4, so v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c.\n\nSimilarly, the positron has gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c. But since it's moving in the opposite direction, v_p is negative.\n\nSo the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\nSimilarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m_e |v_p| = 2 m_e (sqrt(3)/2) c = m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nBut since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but let me check that: the electron's momentum is positive, the positron's is negative, so when you add them, it's (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is P_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, after the collision, the two photons have momenta p1 and p2. Their sum must equal P_initial.\n\nBut since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their momenta are in the +x and +x directions, but with y-components in opposite directions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because the positron is moving to the left, and the electron to the right, so the total initial momentum is (p_e - p_p) in the x-direction.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier in the direction.\n\nWait, let's correct that. The electron is moving to the right (positive x), so its momentum is + p_e.\n\nThe positron is moving to the left (negative x), so its momentum is - p_p.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, no. Because p_p is the magnitude of the positron's momentum, which is in the negative x-direction. So the total momentum is p_e (positive) plus (-p_p) (because p_p is in -x), so P_initial = p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had p_e as 4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\np_p is 2 m_e (sqrt(3)/2) c = m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo P_initial = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, the photons' momenta must add up to this.\n\nEach photon's momentum has components.\n\nLet me denote the first photon's momentum as p1, and the second as p2.\n\nSince both photons have energy E, their magnitudes are E/c.\n\nBut since they're moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their angles from the x-axis are \u03b8 and -\u03b8, respectively.\n\nSo p1 has components (E/c cos\u03b8, E/c sin\u03b8).\n\np2 has components (E/c cos(-\u03b8), E/c sin(-\u03b8)) ) = (E/c cos\u03b8, - E/c sin\u03b8).\n\nWait, but that would mean the y-components cancel each other out, which is necessary because the initial system's momentum is along x.\n\nYes, because the initial y-momentum is zero, the total y-momentum after must also be zero.\n\nSo the sum of the y-components of p1 and p2 is E/c sin\u03b8 - E/c sin\u03b8 = 0. Perfect.\n\nThe sum of the x-components is E/c cos\u03b8 + E/c cos\u03b8 = 2 E/(c) cos\u03b8.\n\nThis sum must equal the initial x-momentum, which is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo:\n\n2 E/(c) cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBut wait, the energy of each photon is E. The total energy of the system before collision is E_e + E_p = (gamma_e m_e c\u00b2) + (gamma_p m_e c\u00b2) ) = (4 + 2) m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the photons' energies, which is 2 E. So 2 E = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAh, that's an important point. So each photon has energy E = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo substituting E into the x-momentum equation:\n\n2 * (3 m_e c\u00b2) / c * cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n2 * 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 6 m_e c.\n\nSo:\n\n6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.\n\nCompute that value:\n\nsqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298\n\nsqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 -1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 / 6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.35682) \u2248 69 degrees (since cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)=0.3420, cos(69)\u22480.3584, which is close).\n\nWait, let me calculate it more accurately.\n\ncos(69 degrees) \u2248 0.3584.\n\nSo 0.35682 is a bit less than that, so maybe 69.2 degrees, but approximately 69 degrees.\n\nBut wait, the angle between the photons is 2\u03b8. Because each photon is at \u03b8 and -\u03b8 from the x-axis, so the angle between them is 2\u03b8.\n\nSo 2 * 69 degrees \u2248 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.\n\nSo the answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy. The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, and we aim to find the angle between their directions.\n\n### Step 1: Conservation of Energy\nThe total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2\n\\]\nGiven \\(\\gamma_e = 4\\) and \\(\\gamma_p = 2\\), we find:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{total}} = (4 + 2) m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2\n\\]\nAfter annihilation, the total energy is shared equally between the two photons:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Conservation of Momentum\nThe total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. The electron moves to the right (+x direction), and the positron moves to the left (-x direction). Their relativistic momenta are:\n\\[\np_e = \\gamma_e m_e v_e, \\quad p_p = \\gamma_p m_e v_p\n\\]\nThe velocities are related to the Lorentz factors by:\n\\[\nv = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}\n\\]\nFor the electron (\\(\\gamma_e = 4\\)):\n\\[\nv_e = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4^2}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c\n\\]\nFor the positron (\\(\\gamma_p = 2\\)):\n\\[\nv_p = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2^2}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c\n\\]\nThe momenta are:\n\\[\np_e = \\gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m_e \\sqrt{15} c\n\\]\n\\[\np_p = \\gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c = m_e \\sqrt{3} c\n\\]\nThe total momentum before annihilation is:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e \\sqrt{15} c - m_e \\sqrt{3} c = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Momentum of the Photons\nEach photon has energy \\(E = 3 m_e c^2\\), and its momentum magnitude is:\n\\[\np_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E}{c} = \\frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c\n\\]\nThe photons move symmetrically with respect to the x-axis, making angles \\(\\theta\\) and \\(-\\theta\\) with the x-axis. Their momentum components are:\n\\[\np_1 = (p_{\\text{photon}} \\cos\\theta, p_{\\text{photon}} \\sin\\theta), \\quad p_2 = (p_{\\text{photon}} \\cos\\theta, -p_{\\text{photon}} \\sin\\theta)\n\\]\nThe total momentum after annihilation is:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{final}} = p_1 + p_2 = (2 p_{\\text{photon}} \\cos\\theta, 0)\n\\]\nEquating the x-components of momentum before and after annihilation:\n\\[\n2 p_{\\text{photon}} \\cos\\theta = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\n\\]\nSubstitute \\(p_{\\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c\\):\n\\[\n2 (3 m_e c) \\cos\\theta = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n6 \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}\n\\]\nApproximating \\(\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732\\):\n\\[\n\\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} \\approx \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.357\n\\]\n\\[\n\\theta \\approx \\arccos(0.357) \\approx 69^\\circ\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons\nThe photons are symmetrically placed at \\(\\theta\\) and \\(-\\theta\\), so the angle between them is:\n\\[\n\\phi = 2\\theta \\approx 2 \\cdot 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe problem says an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is coming from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is coming from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured\u2014one upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.\n\nHmm. So first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since an electron and a positron are involved, they annihilate into two photons because they have opposite charges. Wait, no, wait. Electrons and positrons have opposite charges, but when they annihilate, they typically produce gamma-ray photons. Oh right, but in this case, they produce two photons.\n\nI think in particle-antiparticle annihilation, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. So I'll need to calculate the initial momentum and energy of the electron and positron, then figure out the conditions for the photons.\n\nWait, but wait. The electron is moving from the left, so let's say to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so also to the left. Or wait, wait. The question says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So, if the electron is moving from left to right (positive x-direction), the positron is moving from the right towards the left (negative x-direction). Wait, no: moving along the horizontal axis from the right would mean moving towards the left, right? So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, I should clarify: the electron is moving from left (so to the right), and the positron is moving from the right (so to the left). So their velocities are opposite in direction. But I need to compute their relativistic momenta.\n\nWait, but Lorentz factor is gamma. So the Lorentz factor (gamma) is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. So each has their own gamma.\n\nWait, but the electron has charge -e, and the positron +e. But for momentum, since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta will be in opposite directions as well.\n\nWait, but I should think in terms of vectors. Let's define the electron's velocity as to the right (positive x), and the positron's velocity to the left (negative x). So their momenta would be in opposite directions.\n\nBut wait, their masses are the same. Both are electrons, just one is a positron. So the mass is same, m_e.\n\nSo for the electron, its momentum is gamma*m_e*v. Similarly for the positron, it's gamma_positron * m_e * v', but since it's moving to the left, the velocity v' is negative.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem states that the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, which I think means moving towards the left, so its velocity is negative.\n\nBut since the Lorentz factor is given, I can compute the momentum for each.\n\nWait, but how do I find the velocities? Hmm, because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So each has their own v.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I don't need to find the velocities directly. Because for momentum, p = gamma * m * v. But for each particle, since they have different gammas, their velocities and momenta will be different.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute their relativistic momenta in terms of gamma and mass.\n\nWait, but another approach is to compute the total energy and total momentum before annihilation, and then apply conservation to the photons.\n\nBecause when they annihilate, the total energy and momentum must be the same as the sum of the energies and momenta of the two photons.\n\nSo let's think about conservation.\n\nTotal initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron. Similarly, the total initial momentum is the sum of their momenta.\n\nWait, but since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative.\n\nSo let's denote:\n\nElectron: moving to the right (positive x), gamma_e =4.\n\nPositron: moving to the left (negative x), gamma_p=2.\n\nSo the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nSimilarly, the momentum of the positron is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p.\n\nBut since the positron is moving to the left, v_p is negative. So p_p is negative.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the positron is moving from the right, which would be towards the left, so its velocity is negative, yes.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e (positive) + p_p (negative). Let me compute the magnitudes.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to work in terms of gamma and beta. Because beta is v/c.\n\nWait, for a particle, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo for the electron, gamma_e=4, so beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2. So beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo the velocities are v_e = beta_e * c, and v_p = beta_p * c. But since the positron is moving to the left, v_p is negative.\n\nSo, the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 m_e (beta_e c) = 4 m_e c beta_e.\n\nSimilarly, the momentum of the positron is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 m_e (beta_p c) * (-1), since it's moving left. So p_p = -2 m_e c beta_p.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = (4 m_e c beta_e) - (2 m_e c beta_p).\n\nWait, let me compute beta_e and beta_p:\n\nbeta_e = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682.\n\nbeta_p = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo p_e = 4 m_e c * 0.9682 \u2248 3.8728 m_e c.\n\np_p = -2 m_e c * 0.8660 \u2248 -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo total momentum P_total = 3.8728 - 1.732 = 2.1408 m_e c approximately.\n\nWait, but wait: 4 * 0.9682 is about 3.8728, and 2 * 0.866 is about 1.732. So 3.8728 - 1.732 \u2248 2.1408. So the total momentum is positive, meaning to the right.\n\nNow, the total energy. The total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies.\n\nBut wait, in relativity, the total energy is gamma * m c\u00b2 for each particle.\n\nSo energy of electron, E_e = gamma_e m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nEnergy of positron, E_p = gamma_p m_e c\u00b2 = 2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy E_total = 4 + 2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the positron is a particle with the same mass as the electron, but opposite charge. So when considering annihilation, the rest mass energy is the same. So the total energy is indeed 4 + 2 =6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nNow, after annihilation, the two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon, and since both have the same energy, E_photon = E_total / 2 = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo each photon has energy 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but photons have energy E = h f, and momentum p = E/c. Also, the direction of the photon's momentum is the same as its direction of travel.\n\nNow, the problem states that one photon is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. So both are moving to the right, but in opposite vertical directions (upper and lower).\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, if both photons are moving to the right, then their momenta are in the positive x direction. But that can't be, because the initial total momentum is positive, but the two photons would add their momenta, which are in the same direction, so the total would be 2 * (E_photon/c) in the x-direction.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The problem says one photon is moving upper-right, another lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but their directions are at some angles above and below the x-axis. So their momenta have x and y components.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial total momentum is in the x-direction. So after annihilation, the total momentum of the photons must also be in the x-direction. Because momentum is conserved.\n\nSo the sum of the momenta of the two photons must equal the initial total momentum, which is about 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nEach photon has energy E = 3 m_e c\u00b2. So the magnitude of each photon's momentum is E/c = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo each photon's momentum has magnitude 3 m_e c, and their directions are symmetric in some way, perhaps symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So their y-components are in opposite directions, but their x-components are positive (to the right). So their momenta would add up to a net momentum in the x-direction.\n\nWait, but let me visualize this. Imagine two photons, both moving to the right, but one is angled up, the other down. So their momenta vectors are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively. The sum of their x-components should equal the initial total momentum in x.\n\nLet me denote the angles of the photons as theta and (360 - theta), but since both are in the right half-plane, perhaps it's better to think of them as symmetric around the x-axis.\n\nWait, but the problem says one is upper-right and another lower-right, so their angles relative to the x-axis are theta and (360 - theta) or perhaps theta and -theta. So their y-components would be +p_y and -p_y, canceling each other if symmetric. But their x-components would add up.\n\nWait, but in this case, the sum of the momenta must be the same as the initial momentum, which is 2.1408 m_e c in the x-direction.\n\nEach photon's momentum is 3 m_e c in magnitude. So the sum of their x-components is 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nEach photon's x-component is p_x = p * cos(theta), where theta is the angle from the x-axis. Since one is upper and the other lower, let's say their angles are theta and -theta.\n\nWait, but no, because both are moving to the right. So the angles are above and below the x-axis, but in the right direction. So their angles from the x-axis are theta and (360-theta) or perhaps 180-theta, but that's not correct because 180-theta would point to the left. So perhaps the angles are +alpha and -alpha, where alpha is the angle above and below the x-axis in the right direction.\n\nSo each photon has momentum components:\n\nPhoton 1: p1_x = 3 m_e c cos(alpha), p1_y = 3 m_e c sin(alpha)\n\nPhoton 2: p2_x = 3 m_e c cos(alpha), p2_y = -3 m_e c sin(alpha)\n\nWait, no, because if they are symmetric, their y-components would be opposite. So the total y-component would be zero, which is necessary because the initial total momentum has no y-component.\n\nSo the sum of the two photons' momenta in y-direction is zero, which is correct.\n\nIn the x-direction, the sum is 2 * 3 m_e c cos(alpha) = 6 m_e c cos(alpha).\n\nThis must equal the initial total momentum, which is P_initial = (4 m_e c beta_e) - (2 m_e c beta_p) = let's compute that exactly.\n\nWait, let's compute it again.\n\nGamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4.\n\nGamma_p=2, beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e =4 m_e (beta_e c) =4 m_e c (sqrt(15)/4) )= m_e c sqrt(15).\n\np_p = gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e (beta_p c) * (-1) = 2 m_e c (sqrt(3)/2) * (-1) )= -m_e c sqrt(3).\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBecause sqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3.87298 -1.732 = 2.14098, which matches earlier calculation.\n\nSo the total x-momentum is P_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nThis must equal the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta, which is 2 * (3 m_e c) cos(alpha).\n\nSo:\n\n2 * 3 m_e c cos(alpha) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWe can divide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos(alpha) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos(alpha) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.\n\nLet me compute that numerically.\n\nCompute sqrt(15): approx 3.87298.\n\nsqrt(3): approx 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 -1.73205 = 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos(alpha) \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo alpha \u2248 arccos(0.35682) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, because cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)\u22480.3420, so 0.3568 is about 69 degrees.\n\nWait, more accurately:\n\nLet me compute arccos(0.35682). Let's use a calculator.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it exactly.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better approach. Let me think.\n\nThe two photons are symmetric about the x-axis, each making an angle alpha with the x-axis, one above and the other below.\n\nThe angle between the two photons is 2*alpha, since one is at +alpha and the other at -alpha relative to the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2*alpha.\n\nWait, no, wait. The angle between them would be the angle from the first photon to the second. Since one is at +alpha and the other at -alpha, the angle between them is 2*alpha.\n\nWait, but wait. If one photon is at +alpha above the x-axis, and the other is at -alpha below, then the angle between them is 2 alpha, because you have to go from +alpha to -alpha, which is 180 - 2 alpha? No, wait. Let me think again.\n\nNo, the angle between the two photons is the angle between their directions. So if one is at +alpha and the other at -alpha, the angle between them is 2 alpha. Because from the first photon's direction, you turn 2 alpha to reach the second.\n\nWait, for example, if alpha is 30 degrees, then one photon is 30 degrees above x-axis, the other 30 degrees below. The angle between them would be 60 degrees.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2 alpha.\n\nSo our goal is to find 2 alpha.\n\nWe have cos(alpha) \u2248 0.3568, so alpha \u2248 69 degrees. So 2 alpha would be about 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees. So that's the likely answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWe had:\n\n6 cos(alpha) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nWait, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.87298, sqrt(3) is approx 1.73205.\n\nSo 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivided by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo alpha = arccos(0.35682).\n\nLet me compute this more accurately.\n\nWhat's the value of arccos(0.35682)?\n\nI can use a calculator approach.\n\nWe know that cos(60\u00b0) = 0.5, cos(70\u00b0) \u2248 0.3420, cos(69\u00b0) is about 0.3584.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\ncos(69\u00b0) \u2248 cos(69) \u2248 0.3584.\n\nWait, but 0.3568 is slightly less than 0.3584, so the angle would be a little more than 69 degrees, maybe 69.3 degrees.\n\nSo alpha is approximately 69.3 degrees, so 2 alpha is approximately 138.6 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, which is very close.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is about 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this is to compute the exact value using the cosine formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me re-express the equation.\n\nWe have:\n\n6 cos(alpha) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos(alpha) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.\n\nLet me compute this expression exactly.\n\nsqrt(15) is sqrt(15) \u22483.872983.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.7320508.\n\nSo (3.872983 - 1.7320508) = 2.1409322.\n\nDivided by 6: 2.1409322/6 \u2248 0.356822.\n\nSo cos(alpha) \u2248 0.356822.\n\nSo alpha = arccos(0.356822) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nAs I thought earlier.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2*69\u2248138 degrees.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C, 138.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy. The total energy and momentum before annihilation must equal the total energy and momentum after annihilation.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Energy and Momentum\n- The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor $\\gamma_e = 4$, and the positron moves to the left with $\\gamma_p = 2$. Both have the same rest mass $m_e$.\n- The total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron:\n  \\[\n  E_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.\n  \\]\n- The total momentum is the sum of the relativistic momenta of the electron and positron. Using $\\beta = v/c$ and $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}$:\n  \\[\n  \\beta_e = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_e^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}, \\quad \\beta_p = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_p^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\n  \\]\n  The momentum of the electron is $p_e = \\gamma_e m_e \\beta_e c$, and the momentum of the positron is $p_p = -\\gamma_p m_e \\beta_p c$ (negative because it moves left). Thus:\n  \\[\n  p_{\\text{total}} = p_e + p_p = 4 m_e c \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} - 2 m_e c \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Photon Energies and Momenta\n- After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies $E_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2$.\n- The momentum of each photon is $p_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c$.\n- The photons move in opposite vertical directions (upper-right and lower-right), so their momenta have equal magnitudes but opposite $y$-components. The total momentum in the $y$-direction is zero, and the total momentum in the $x$-direction is conserved.\n\n### Step 3: Momentum Conservation in the $x$-Direction\n- The total initial momentum in the $x$-direction is $p_{\\text{total}} = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})$.\n- After annihilation, the $x$-components of the photons' momenta must sum to $p_{\\text{total}}$. Let $\\alpha$ be the angle each photon makes with the $x$-axis. The $x$-component of each photon's momentum is $p_{\\text{photon},x} = p_{\\text{photon}} \\cos\\alpha = 3 m_e c \\cos\\alpha$.\n- Since there are two photons, the total $x$-momentum is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\cdot p_{\\text{photon},x} = 2 \\cdot 3 m_e c \\cos\\alpha = 6 m_e c \\cos\\alpha.\n  \\]\n  Equating this to the initial $x$-momentum:\n  \\[\n  6 m_e c \\cos\\alpha = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n  \\]\n  Dividing through by $m_e c$:\n  \\[\n  6 \\cos\\alpha = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}.\n  \\]\n  Solving for $\\cos\\alpha$:\n  \\[\n  \\cos\\alpha = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate $\\alpha$ and the Angle Between Photons\n- Numerically, $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.87298$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73205$, so:\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.87298 - 1.73205 = 2.14093.\n  \\]\n  Thus:\n  \\[\n  \\cos\\alpha = \\frac{2.14093}{6} \\approx 0.35682.\n  \\]\n  Using $\\arccos$, we find:\n  \\[\n  \\alpha \\approx \\arccos(0.35682) \\approx 69^\\circ.\n  \\]\n- The angle between the two photons is $2\\alpha$, as one photon is at $+\\alpha$ and the other at $-\\alpha$ relative to the $x$-axis. Therefore:\n  \\[\n  2\\alpha \\approx 2 \\cdot 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ.\n  \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is approximately **138 degrees**.\n\nAnswer: C",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe problem says an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is coming from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is coming from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured\u2014one upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.\n\nHmm. So first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since an electron and a positron are involved, they annihilate into two photons because they have opposite charges. Wait, no, wait. Electrons and positrons have opposite charges, but when they annihilate, they typically produce gamma-ray photons. Oh right, but in this case, they produce two photons.\n\nI think in particle-antiparticle annihilation, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. So I'll need to calculate the initial momentum and energy of the electron and positron, then figure out the conditions for the photons.\n\nWait, but wait. The electron is moving from the left, so let's say to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so also to the left. Or wait, wait. The question says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So, if the electron is moving from left to right (positive x-direction), the positron is moving from the right towards the left (negative x-direction). Wait, no: moving along the horizontal axis from the right would mean moving towards the left, right? So their velocities are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, I should clarify: the electron is moving from left (so to the right), and the positron is moving from the right (so to the left). So their velocities are opposite in direction. But I need to compute their relativistic momenta.\n\nWait, but Lorentz factor is gamma. So the Lorentz factor (gamma) is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. So each has their own gamma.\n\nWait, but the electron has charge -e, and the positron +e. But for momentum, since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta will be in opposite directions as well.\n\nWait, but I should think in terms of vectors. Let's define the electron's velocity as to the right (positive x), and the positron's velocity to the left (negative x). So their momenta would be in opposite directions.\n\nBut wait, their masses are the same. Both are electrons, just one is a positron. So the mass is same, m_e.\n\nSo for the electron, its momentum is gamma*m_e*v. Similarly for the positron, it's gamma_positron * m_e * v', but since it's moving to the left, the velocity v' is negative.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem states that the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, which I think means moving towards the left, so its velocity is negative.\n\nBut since the Lorentz factor is given, I can compute the momentum for each.\n\nWait, but how do I find the velocities? Hmm, because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So each has their own v.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I don't need to find the velocities directly. Because for momentum, p = gamma * m * v. But for each particle, since they have different gammas, their velocities and momenta will be different.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute their relativistic momenta in terms of gamma and mass.\n\nWait, but another approach is to compute the total energy and total momentum before annihilation, and then apply conservation to the photons.\n\nBecause when they annihilate, the total energy and momentum must be the same as the sum of the energies and momenta of the two photons.\n\nSo let's think about conservation.\n\nTotal initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron. Similarly, the total initial momentum is the sum of their momenta.\n\nWait, but since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative.\n\nSo let's denote:\n\nElectron: moving to the right (positive x), gamma_e =4.\n\nPositron: moving to the left (negative x), gamma_p=2.\n\nSo the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.\n\nSimilarly, the momentum of the positron is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p.\n\nBut since the positron is moving to the left, v_p is negative. So p_p is negative.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the positron is moving from the right, which would be towards the left, so its velocity is negative, yes.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e (positive) + p_p (negative). Let me compute the magnitudes.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to work in terms of gamma and beta. Because beta is v/c.\n\nWait, for a particle, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo for the electron, gamma_e=4, so beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2. So beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo the velocities are v_e = beta_e * c, and v_p = beta_p * c. But since the positron is moving to the left, v_p is negative.\n\nSo, the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 m_e (beta_e c) = 4 m_e c beta_e.\n\nSimilarly, the momentum of the positron is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 m_e (beta_p c) * (-1), since it's moving left. So p_p = -2 m_e c beta_p.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = (4 m_e c beta_e) - (2 m_e c beta_p).\n\nWait, let me compute beta_e and beta_p:\n\nbeta_e = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682.\n\nbeta_p = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo p_e = 4 m_e c * 0.9682 \u2248 3.8728 m_e c.\n\np_p = -2 m_e c * 0.8660 \u2248 -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo total momentum P_total = 3.8728 - 1.732 = 2.1408 m_e c approximately.\n\nWait, but wait: 4 * 0.9682 is about 3.8728, and 2 * 0.866 is about 1.732. So 3.8728 - 1.732 \u2248 2.1408. So the total momentum is positive, meaning to the right.\n\nNow, the total energy. The total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies.\n\nBut wait, in relativity, the total energy is gamma * m c\u00b2 for each particle.\n\nSo energy of electron, E_e = gamma_e m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nEnergy of positron, E_p = gamma_p m_e c\u00b2 = 2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo total energy E_total = 4 + 2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the positron is a particle with the same mass as the electron, but opposite charge. So when considering annihilation, the rest mass energy is the same. So the total energy is indeed 4 + 2 =6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nNow, after annihilation, the two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon, and since both have the same energy, E_photon = E_total / 2 = 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo each photon has energy 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, but photons have energy E = h f, and momentum p = E/c. Also, the direction of the photon's momentum is the same as its direction of travel.\n\nNow, the problem states that one photon is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. So both are moving to the right, but in opposite vertical directions (upper and lower).\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, if both photons are moving to the right, then their momenta are in the positive x direction. But that can't be, because the initial total momentum is positive, but the two photons would add their momenta, which are in the same direction, so the total would be 2 * (E_photon/c) in the x-direction.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The problem says one photon is moving upper-right, another lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but their directions are at some angles above and below the x-axis. So their momenta have x and y components.\n\nWait, but wait. The initial total momentum is in the x-direction. So after annihilation, the total momentum of the photons must also be in the x-direction. Because momentum is conserved.\n\nSo the sum of the momenta of the two photons must equal the initial total momentum, which is about 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nEach photon has energy E = 3 m_e c\u00b2. So the magnitude of each photon's momentum is E/c = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 3 m_e c.\n\nSo each photon's momentum has magnitude 3 m_e c, and their directions are symmetric in some way, perhaps symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So their y-components are in opposite directions, but their x-components are positive (to the right). So their momenta would add up to a net momentum in the x-direction.\n\nWait, but let me visualize this. Imagine two photons, both moving to the right, but one is angled up, the other down. So their momenta vectors are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively. The sum of their x-components should equal the initial total momentum in x.\n\nLet me denote the angles of the photons as theta and (360 - theta), but since both are in the right half-plane, perhaps it's better to think of them as symmetric around the x-axis.\n\nWait, but the problem says one is upper-right and another lower-right, so their angles relative to the x-axis are theta and (360 - theta) or perhaps theta and -theta. So their y-components would be +p_y and -p_y, canceling each other if symmetric. But their x-components would add up.\n\nWait, but in this case, the sum of the momenta must be the same as the initial momentum, which is 2.1408 m_e c in the x-direction.\n\nEach photon's momentum is 3 m_e c in magnitude. So the sum of their x-components is 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nEach photon's x-component is p_x = p * cos(theta), where theta is the angle from the x-axis. Since one is upper and the other lower, let's say their angles are theta and -theta.\n\nWait, but no, because both are moving to the right. So the angles are above and below the x-axis, but in the right direction. So their angles from the x-axis are theta and (360-theta) or perhaps 180-theta, but that's not correct because 180-theta would point to the left. So perhaps the angles are +alpha and -alpha, where alpha is the angle above and below the x-axis in the right direction.\n\nSo each photon has momentum components:\n\nPhoton 1: p1_x = 3 m_e c cos(alpha), p1_y = 3 m_e c sin(alpha)\n\nPhoton 2: p2_x = 3 m_e c cos(alpha), p2_y = -3 m_e c sin(alpha)\n\nWait, no, because if they are symmetric, their y-components would be opposite. So the total y-component would be zero, which is necessary because the initial total momentum has no y-component.\n\nSo the sum of the two photons' momenta in y-direction is zero, which is correct.\n\nIn the x-direction, the sum is 2 * 3 m_e c cos(alpha) = 6 m_e c cos(alpha).\n\nThis must equal the initial total momentum, which is P_initial = (4 m_e c beta_e) - (2 m_e c beta_p) = let's compute that exactly.\n\nWait, let's compute it again.\n\nGamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4.\n\nGamma_p=2, beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSo p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e =4 m_e (beta_e c) =4 m_e c (sqrt(15)/4) )= m_e c sqrt(15).\n\np_p = gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e (beta_p c) * (-1) = 2 m_e c (sqrt(3)/2) * (-1) )= -m_e c sqrt(3).\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBecause sqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3.87298 -1.732 = 2.14098, which matches earlier calculation.\n\nSo the total x-momentum is P_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nThis must equal the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta, which is 2 * (3 m_e c) cos(alpha).\n\nSo:\n\n2 * 3 m_e c cos(alpha) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWe can divide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos(alpha) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos(alpha) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.\n\nLet me compute that numerically.\n\nCompute sqrt(15): approx 3.87298.\n\nsqrt(3): approx 1.73205.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 -1.73205 = 2.14093.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo cos(alpha) \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo alpha \u2248 arccos(0.35682) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nWait, because cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)\u22480.3420, so 0.3568 is about 69 degrees.\n\nWait, more accurately:\n\nLet me compute arccos(0.35682). Let's use a calculator.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it exactly.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better approach. Let me think.\n\nThe two photons are symmetric about the x-axis, each making an angle alpha with the x-axis, one above and the other below.\n\nThe angle between the two photons is 2*alpha, since one is at +alpha and the other at -alpha relative to the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2*alpha.\n\nWait, no, wait. The angle between them would be the angle from the first photon to the second. Since one is at +alpha and the other at -alpha, the angle between them is 2*alpha.\n\nWait, but wait. If one photon is at +alpha above the x-axis, and the other is at -alpha below, then the angle between them is 2 alpha, because you have to go from +alpha to -alpha, which is 180 - 2 alpha? No, wait. Let me think again.\n\nNo, the angle between the two photons is the angle between their directions. So if one is at +alpha and the other at -alpha, the angle between them is 2 alpha. Because from the first photon's direction, you turn 2 alpha to reach the second.\n\nWait, for example, if alpha is 30 degrees, then one photon is 30 degrees above x-axis, the other 30 degrees below. The angle between them would be 60 degrees.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2 alpha.\n\nSo our goal is to find 2 alpha.\n\nWe have cos(alpha) \u2248 0.3568, so alpha \u2248 69 degrees. So 2 alpha would be about 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees. So that's the likely answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWe had:\n\n6 cos(alpha) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nWait, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.87298, sqrt(3) is approx 1.73205.\n\nSo 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093.\n\nDivided by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.35682.\n\nSo alpha = arccos(0.35682).\n\nLet me compute this more accurately.\n\nWhat's the value of arccos(0.35682)?\n\nI can use a calculator approach.\n\nWe know that cos(60\u00b0) = 0.5, cos(70\u00b0) \u2248 0.3420, cos(69\u00b0) is about 0.3584.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\ncos(69\u00b0) \u2248 cos(69) \u2248 0.3584.\n\nWait, but 0.3568 is slightly less than 0.3584, so the angle would be a little more than 69 degrees, maybe 69.3 degrees.\n\nSo alpha is approximately 69.3 degrees, so 2 alpha is approximately 138.6 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, which is very close.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is about 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this is to compute the exact value using the cosine formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me re-express the equation.\n\nWe have:\n\n6 cos(alpha) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nSo cos(alpha) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.\n\nLet me compute this expression exactly.\n\nsqrt(15) is sqrt(15) \u22483.872983.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.7320508.\n\nSo (3.872983 - 1.7320508) = 2.1409322.\n\nDivided by 6: 2.1409322/6 \u2248 0.356822.\n\nSo cos(alpha) \u2248 0.356822.\n\nSo alpha = arccos(0.356822) \u2248 69 degrees.\n\nAs I thought earlier.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2*69\u2248138 degrees.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C, 138.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy. The total energy and momentum before annihilation must equal the total energy and momentum after annihilation.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Energy and Momentum\n- The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor $\\gamma_e = 4$, and the positron moves to the left with $\\gamma_p = 2$. Both have the same rest mass $m_e$.\n- The total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron:\n  \\[\n  E_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.\n  \\]\n- The total momentum is the sum of the relativistic momenta of the electron and positron. Using $\\beta = v/c$ and $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}$:\n  \\[\n  \\beta_e = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_e^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}, \\quad \\beta_p = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_p^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\n  \\]\n  The momentum of the electron is $p_e = \\gamma_e m_e \\beta_e c$, and the momentum of the positron is $p_p = -\\gamma_p m_e \\beta_p c$ (negative because it moves left). Thus:\n  \\[\n  p_{\\text{total}} = p_e + p_p = 4 m_e c \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} - 2 m_e c \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Photon Energies and Momenta\n- After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies $E_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2$.\n- The momentum of each photon is $p_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c$.\n- The photons move in opposite vertical directions (upper-right and lower-right), so their momenta have equal magnitudes but opposite $y$-components. The total momentum in the $y$-direction is zero, and the total momentum in the $x$-direction is conserved.\n\n### Step 3: Momentum Conservation in the $x$-Direction\n- The total initial momentum in the $x$-direction is $p_{\\text{total}} = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})$.\n- After annihilation, the $x$-components of the photons' momenta must sum to $p_{\\text{total}}$. Let $\\alpha$ be the angle each photon makes with the $x$-axis. The $x$-component of each photon's momentum is $p_{\\text{photon},x} = p_{\\text{photon}} \\cos\\alpha = 3 m_e c \\cos\\alpha$.\n- Since there are two photons, the total $x$-momentum is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\cdot p_{\\text{photon},x} = 2 \\cdot 3 m_e c \\cos\\alpha = 6 m_e c \\cos\\alpha.\n  \\]\n  Equating this to the initial $x$-momentum:\n  \\[\n  6 m_e c \\cos\\alpha = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n  \\]\n  Dividing through by $m_e c$:\n  \\[\n  6 \\cos\\alpha = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}.\n  \\]\n  Solving for $\\cos\\alpha$:\n  \\[\n  \\cos\\alpha = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate $\\alpha$ and the Angle Between Photons\n- Numerically, $\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.87298$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73205$, so:\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.87298 - 1.73205 = 2.14093.\n  \\]\n  Thus:\n  \\[\n  \\cos\\alpha = \\frac{2.14093}{6} \\approx 0.35682.\n  \\]\n  Using $\\arccos$, we find:\n  \\[\n  \\alpha \\approx \\arccos(0.35682) \\approx 69^\\circ.\n  \\]\n- The angle between the two photons is $2\\alpha$, as one photon is at $+\\alpha$ and the other at $-\\alpha$ relative to the $x$-axis. Therefore:\n  \\[\n  2\\alpha \\approx 2 \\cdot 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ.\n  \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is approximately **138 degrees**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nAlright, the problem states that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured as one going upper-right and the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.\n\nWait, so Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). But maybe I don't need the actual velocities here. The important thing is that the particles are moving towards each other, so their momenta are opposite in direction.\n\nSo, the electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (coming from the right). When they collide, their momenta are opposite. So the total momentum before collision is the sum of their individual momenta, taking direction into account.\n\nSince they annihilate into two photons, the total momentum after must equal the total before. Photons carry momentum, and their direction and energy will determine the momentum vectors.\n\nWait, but photons have energy E = pc, since for massless particles, E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2, but m=0. So each photon's momentum is E/(c), and direction is determined by the angle.\n\nLet me think about conservation of energy and momentum here.\n\nFirst, let's compute the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. Since they're annihilating, the rest mass energy will contribute to the photons' energy. The rest mass energy of an electron is 0.511 MeV, so the positron has the same. So the total rest mass energy is 1.022 MeV. But wait, because they are moving, their total energy (relativistic) is gamma * m c\u00b2.\n\nSo, the electron's gamma is 4, so its energy is 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV. The positron's gamma is 2, so its energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. So the total energy before collision is 2.044 + 1.022 = 3.066 MeV.\n\nBut wait, when they annihilate, the photons must carry away this total energy. But wait, the problem says both photons have the same energy. So each photon would have energy E_photon = 3.066 / 2 = 1.533 MeV. Hmm, but wait, wait. Because the rest mass energy is 1.022 MeV, but their kinetic energy plus rest mass is the total. So yes, the total energy is the sum of their gamma * m c\u00b2.\n\nSo the two photons each have energy 1.533 MeV. Now, their momenta would be E/(c) each. So p_photon1 = E_photon / c, and same for p_photon2. But since photons are massless, their momentum is in the same direction as their energy.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, no. Because the direction of the momentum depends on the direction of the photon. So if one photon is going upper-right and the other lower-right, their momenta have components in both x and y directions.\n\nWait, but the initial system's momentum is along the horizontal (x) axis. The total momentum before collision is the sum of the electron's and positron's momenta. Let me compute that.\n\nElectron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But since gamma is 4, and m_e c\u00b2 is 0.511 MeV, but for momentum, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of gamma and beta.\n\nAlternatively, since for a particle, p = gamma m v. But v = beta c, so p = gamma m beta c. And since gamma beta = (v)/(sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) ) = (beta)/(sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2)) ) = (beta gamma).\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The total energy is sum of their energies, and the momentum is the sum of their relativistic momenta.\n\nElectron is moving to the right (positive x direction), positron moving to the left (negative x direction). So their momenta are in opposite directions.\n\nSo let me compute their momenta.\n\nElectron: gamma_e =4, m_e c = (0.511 MeV/c) * c = 0.511 MeV/(c\u00b2) * c = 0.511 MeV/(c). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of units where c=1 to make it easier, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute beta for each.\n\nWait, gamma = 4 for electron. So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_e\u00b2) \u2192 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_e\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1 - beta_e\u00b2) = 1/4 \u2192 1 - beta_e\u00b2 = 1/16 \u2192 beta_e\u00b2 = 15/16 \u2192 beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\nSimilarly, for positron gamma_p =2 \u2192 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_p\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1 - beta_p\u00b2)=1/2 \u2192 1 - beta_p\u00b2=1/4 \u2192 beta_p\u00b2=3/4 \u2192 beta_p= sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866 c.\n\nBut wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is -beta_p c.\n\nSo the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 * m_e * beta_e c. Similarly, positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 * m_e * (-beta_p c) = -2 m_e beta_p c.\n\nSo, the total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p = [4 m_e beta_e c ] + [ - 2 m_e beta_p c ].\n\nCompute this:\n\np_total = m_e c [4 beta_e - 2 beta_p ]\n\nWe have beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 \u22480.9682, beta_p = sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866.\n\nSo 4 beta_e = 4 * sqrt(15)/4 = sqrt(15) \u22483.872.\n\n2 beta_p = 2 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3) \u22481.732.\n\nSo p_total = m_e c (3.872 - 1.732) \u2248 m_e c (2.14).\n\nSo, p_total \u22482.14 m_e c.\n\nNow, after collision, the photons' momenta must add up to this. Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.\n\nEach photon's momentum has magnitude p1 and p2, which are E1/(c) and E2/(c), respectively. But the problem says E1=E2=1.533 MeV. So p1 = E1/(c) = 1.533 MeV / c, same for p2.\n\nWait, but each photon's momentum is a vector. Let me denote their directions. Photon 1 is moving upper-right, so its momentum vector has positive x and positive y components. Photon 2 is moving lower-right, so positive x and negative y components.\n\nLet me represent the momentum vectors as vectors.\n\nLet me denote photon 1's momentum as (p1x, p1y) and photon 2's as (p2x, p2y).\n\nSince the total momentum after collision is the sum of these two, it must equal the initial p_total in the x-direction and zero in the y-direction. Wait, because the initial system's momentum was only along the x-axis. So the sum of the photons' y-components must be zero, and the sum of their x-components must equal the initial total p_total.\n\nWait, but the initial system's momentum is along x, so the sum of the photons' momenta must also be along x. That is, the vector sum of the two photons' momenta must equal p_total in the x-direction and zero in the y-direction.\n\nSo:\n\np1x + p2x = p_total (which is in x-direction)\n\np1y + p2y = 0.\n\nBut since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are the same. So p1 = p2 = 1.533 MeV / c.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, because the energy of each photon is E = pc, so p = E/(c). So both photons have same p magnitude, p = E_photon / c = (1.533 MeV) / c.\n\nSo each photon's momentum has magnitude p = 1.533 MeV/c.\n\nBut their directions are upper-right and lower-right, which suggests that one is at some angle theta above the x-axis, and the other at the same angle below, but that's not necessarily the case. But in the problem, one is upper-right and the other lower-right. Wait, but the problem doesn't say they're symmetric. Hmm, wait, but the problem states that the two photons have same energy and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So their y-components would be opposite in sign, but their x-components would be same if their angles are symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nWait, but perhaps the two photons have the same magnitude of momentum, but their angles are such that their y-components cancel each other, and their x-components add up to the initial total momentum.\n\nWait, but the initial total momentum is in the x-direction. So let me model this.\n\nLet me denote the angles of the photons from the x-axis. Let's say photon 1 makes an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle phi below the x-axis.\n\nBut the problem states that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So both have positive x-components. Wait, but if both are going to the right, then their x-components would add up, and their y-components would be in opposite directions. But wait, the initial momentum is in the x-direction, so the sum of the y-components must be zero.\n\nSo, for the y-components:\n\np1y + p2y = 0.\n\nSince p1y = p sin(theta) and p2y = p sin(phi), but in opposite directions. So perhaps p1y = +p sin(theta), p2y = -p sin(phi).\n\nSo, p sin(theta) - p sin(phi) = 0 \u2192 sin(theta) = sin(phi).\n\nWhich would imply theta = phi or theta = 180 - phi. But since both photons are in the right half-plane (upper-right and lower-right), theta and phi are between 0 and 180. So, if theta = phi, their y-components would be same in magnitude but opposite in sign, but then the sum would be zero. Alternatively, if theta + phi = 180, but that doesn't make sense in this scenario.\n\nWait, but if theta = phi, then the angles are same in magnitude but one is above and the other below the x-axis. So, their y-components would be +p sin(theta) and -p sin(theta), which would cancel each other.\n\nSo, that would satisfy the condition p1y + p2y =0.\n\nSo, the sum of the x-components would be p (cos(theta) + cos(theta)) )= 2 p cos(theta).\n\nAnd this must equal the initial total momentum p_total.\n\nSo, 2 p cos(theta) = p_total.\n\nWait, but p is the same for both photons, since their energies are same. So, 2 p cos(theta) = p_total.\n\nBut p is 1.533 MeV/c, and p_total is 2.14 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait, m_e c is 0.511 MeV/c, since m_e c\u00b2 is 0.511 MeV.\n\nSo, m_e c = 0.511 MeV/(c) * c = 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2 * c = 0.511 MeV/(c) \u2192 Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe rest mass energy of the electron is m_e c\u00b2 = 0.511 MeV. So, m_e c = (0.511 MeV) / c.\n\nSo, p_total = 2.14 m_e c = 2.14 * (0.511 MeV/c) = 2.14 * 0.511 MeV/c \u2248 1.10 MeV/c.\n\nWait, because 2.14 * 0.5 is about 1.07, and 2.14 * 0.011 is about 0.0235, so around 1.0935 MeV/c.\n\nSo p_total \u22481.0935 MeV/c.\n\nNow, p for each photon is E_photon/c = 1.533 MeV/c.\n\nSo, 2 * p * cos(theta) = p_total.\n\nSo,\n\n2 * 1.533 MeV/c * cos(theta) = 1.0935 MeV/c.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.533 MeV/c:\n\n2 cos(theta) = 1.0935 / 1.533 \u2248 0.713.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) \u2248 0.713 / 2 = 0.3565.\n\nWait, wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait, 2 * (1.533) * cos(theta) = 1.0935.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = 1.0935 / (2 * 1.533).\n\nCalculate denominator: 2 * 1.533 \u22483.066.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) \u22481.0935 /3.066 \u22480.3565.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3565).\n\nLet me compute that. Arccos of 0.3565.\n\nWell, cos(60 degrees) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.342, so 0.3565 is a little less than 70 degrees. Let's see: 70 degrees is 0.3420, 69 is cos(69) \u2248 0.3584. Wait, wait, let me get precise values.\n\nWait, cos(69\u00b0) \u2248 0.3584. So 0.3565 is just a bit less than 69 degrees. Maybe around 69.5 degrees.\n\nSo theta \u2248 69.5 degrees.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, this would mean that each photon is at about 69.5 degrees from the x-axis, one above and one below. So the angle between the two photons would be 2 * theta = 139 degrees. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options exactly.\n\nWait, the options are 74, 172, 138, 96. Hmm, 138 is option C, which is close to 139. So that would be the angle between them.\n\nWait, but let me recheck my calculations. I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me recompute p_total.\n\nElectron's gamma is 4, so its momentum is p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c.\n\nSimilarly, positron's gamma is 2, so p_p = gamma_p m_e beta_p (-c).\n\nSo p_total = p_e + p_p = gamma_e m_e beta_e c + gamma_p m_e beta_p (-c).\n\nWait, beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u22480.9682.\n\nGamma_e =4, so p_e =4 * m_e * beta_e c.\n\nSimilarly, beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nGamma_p=2, so p_p =2 * m_e * beta_p * (-c).\n\nSo,\n\np_e =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e * sqrt(15) c \u2248 m_e * 3.872 c.\n\np_p =2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * (-c) = m_e * sqrt(3) * (-c) \u2248 m_e * 1.732 * (-c).\n\nSo, p_total = 3.872 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c = (3.872 -1.732) m_e c = 2.14 m_e c.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, each photon's momentum is E_photon / c = (1.533 MeV) / c.\n\nSo p_photon =1.533 MeV/c.\n\nNow, the sum of the x-components of the two photons must equal p_total.\n\nEach photon's x-component is p * cos(theta), where theta is the angle from the x-axis for each photon.\n\nSo,\n\np1x + p2x = p_total.\n\np1x = p * cos(theta1), p2x = p * cos(theta2).\n\nBut since the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, their angles from the x-axis are theta and -theta, assuming symmetry. So theta1 = theta, theta2 = -theta.\n\nWait, but in that case, the sum would be p*(cos(theta) + cos(theta)) = 2p cos(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n2p cos(theta) = p_total.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = p_total/(2p).\n\np is 1.533 MeV/c, p_total is 2.14 m_e c.\n\nWait, m_e c is 0.511 MeV/c.\n\nSo p_total =2.14 * 0.511 MeV/c \u22481.0935 MeV/c.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = (1.0935 MeV/c) / (2 * 1.533 MeV/c) )\n\nThe MeV/c units cancel out.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = 1.0935 / (2 * 1.533) = 1.0935 /3.066 \u22480.3565.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3565) \u224869 degrees, as before.\n\nSo the two photons are each at about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis.\n\nThe angle between them would be 2 * theta = 138 degrees, which is option C.\n\nSo, the answer should be C) 138.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nAlright, the problem states that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured as one going upper-right and the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.\n\nWait, so Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). But maybe I don't need the actual velocities here. The important thing is that the particles are moving towards each other, so their momenta are opposite in direction.\n\nSo, the electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (coming from the right). When they collide, their momenta are opposite. So the total momentum before collision is the sum of their individual momenta, taking direction into account.\n\nSince they annihilate into two photons, the total momentum after must equal the total before. Photons carry momentum, and their direction and energy will determine the momentum vectors.\n\nWait, but photons have energy E = pc, since for massless particles, E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2, but m=0. So each photon's momentum is E/(c), and direction is determined by the angle.\n\nLet me think about conservation of energy and momentum here.\n\nFirst, let's compute the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. Since they're annihilating, the rest mass energy will contribute to the photons' energy. The rest mass energy of an electron is 0.511 MeV, so the positron has the same. So the total rest mass energy is 1.022 MeV. But wait, because they are moving, their total energy (relativistic) is gamma * m c\u00b2.\n\nSo, the electron's gamma is 4, so its energy is 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV. The positron's gamma is 2, so its energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. So the total energy before collision is 2.044 + 1.022 = 3.066 MeV.\n\nBut wait, when they annihilate, the photons must carry away this total energy. But wait, the problem says both photons have the same energy. So each photon would have energy E_photon = 3.066 / 2 = 1.533 MeV. Hmm, but wait, wait. Because the rest mass energy is 1.022 MeV, but their kinetic energy plus rest mass is the total. So yes, the total energy is the sum of their gamma * m c\u00b2.\n\nSo the two photons each have energy 1.533 MeV. Now, their momenta would be E/(c) each. So p_photon1 = E_photon / c, and same for p_photon2. But since photons are massless, their momentum is in the same direction as their energy.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, no. Because the direction of the momentum depends on the direction of the photon. So if one photon is going upper-right and the other lower-right, their momenta have components in both x and y directions.\n\nWait, but the initial system's momentum is along the horizontal (x) axis. The total momentum before collision is the sum of the electron's and positron's momenta. Let me compute that.\n\nElectron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But since gamma is 4, and m_e c\u00b2 is 0.511 MeV, but for momentum, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of gamma and beta.\n\nAlternatively, since for a particle, p = gamma m v. But v = beta c, so p = gamma m beta c. And since gamma beta = (v)/(sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) ) = (beta)/(sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2)) ) = (beta gamma).\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The total energy is sum of their energies, and the momentum is the sum of their relativistic momenta.\n\nElectron is moving to the right (positive x direction), positron moving to the left (negative x direction). So their momenta are in opposite directions.\n\nSo let me compute their momenta.\n\nElectron: gamma_e =4, m_e c = (0.511 MeV/c) * c = 0.511 MeV/(c\u00b2) * c = 0.511 MeV/(c). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of units where c=1 to make it easier, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute beta for each.\n\nWait, gamma = 4 for electron. So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_e\u00b2) \u2192 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_e\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1 - beta_e\u00b2) = 1/4 \u2192 1 - beta_e\u00b2 = 1/16 \u2192 beta_e\u00b2 = 15/16 \u2192 beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682 c.\n\nSimilarly, for positron gamma_p =2 \u2192 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_p\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1 - beta_p\u00b2)=1/2 \u2192 1 - beta_p\u00b2=1/4 \u2192 beta_p\u00b2=3/4 \u2192 beta_p= sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866 c.\n\nBut wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is -beta_p c.\n\nSo the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 * m_e * beta_e c. Similarly, positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 * m_e * (-beta_p c) = -2 m_e beta_p c.\n\nSo, the total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p = [4 m_e beta_e c ] + [ - 2 m_e beta_p c ].\n\nCompute this:\n\np_total = m_e c [4 beta_e - 2 beta_p ]\n\nWe have beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 \u22480.9682, beta_p = sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866.\n\nSo 4 beta_e = 4 * sqrt(15)/4 = sqrt(15) \u22483.872.\n\n2 beta_p = 2 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3) \u22481.732.\n\nSo p_total = m_e c (3.872 - 1.732) \u2248 m_e c (2.14).\n\nSo, p_total \u22482.14 m_e c.\n\nNow, after collision, the photons' momenta must add up to this. Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.\n\nEach photon's momentum has magnitude p1 and p2, which are E1/(c) and E2/(c), respectively. But the problem says E1=E2=1.533 MeV. So p1 = E1/(c) = 1.533 MeV / c, same for p2.\n\nWait, but each photon's momentum is a vector. Let me denote their directions. Photon 1 is moving upper-right, so its momentum vector has positive x and positive y components. Photon 2 is moving lower-right, so positive x and negative y components.\n\nLet me represent the momentum vectors as vectors.\n\nLet me denote photon 1's momentum as (p1x, p1y) and photon 2's as (p2x, p2y).\n\nSince the total momentum after collision is the sum of these two, it must equal the initial p_total in the x-direction and zero in the y-direction. Wait, because the initial system's momentum was only along the x-axis. So the sum of the photons' y-components must be zero, and the sum of their x-components must equal the initial total p_total.\n\nWait, but the initial system's momentum is along x, so the sum of the photons' momenta must also be along x. That is, the vector sum of the two photons' momenta must equal p_total in the x-direction and zero in the y-direction.\n\nSo:\n\np1x + p2x = p_total (which is in x-direction)\n\np1y + p2y = 0.\n\nBut since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are the same. So p1 = p2 = 1.533 MeV / c.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, because the energy of each photon is E = pc, so p = E/(c). So both photons have same p magnitude, p = E_photon / c = (1.533 MeV) / c.\n\nSo each photon's momentum has magnitude p = 1.533 MeV/c.\n\nBut their directions are upper-right and lower-right, which suggests that one is at some angle theta above the x-axis, and the other at the same angle below, but that's not necessarily the case. But in the problem, one is upper-right and the other lower-right. Wait, but the problem doesn't say they're symmetric. Hmm, wait, but the problem states that the two photons have same energy and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So their y-components would be opposite in sign, but their x-components would be same if their angles are symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nWait, but perhaps the two photons have the same magnitude of momentum, but their angles are such that their y-components cancel each other, and their x-components add up to the initial total momentum.\n\nWait, but the initial total momentum is in the x-direction. So let me model this.\n\nLet me denote the angles of the photons from the x-axis. Let's say photon 1 makes an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle phi below the x-axis.\n\nBut the problem states that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So both have positive x-components. Wait, but if both are going to the right, then their x-components would add up, and their y-components would be in opposite directions. But wait, the initial momentum is in the x-direction, so the sum of the y-components must be zero.\n\nSo, for the y-components:\n\np1y + p2y = 0.\n\nSince p1y = p sin(theta) and p2y = p sin(phi), but in opposite directions. So perhaps p1y = +p sin(theta), p2y = -p sin(phi).\n\nSo, p sin(theta) - p sin(phi) = 0 \u2192 sin(theta) = sin(phi).\n\nWhich would imply theta = phi or theta = 180 - phi. But since both photons are in the right half-plane (upper-right and lower-right), theta and phi are between 0 and 180. So, if theta = phi, their y-components would be same in magnitude but opposite in sign, but then the sum would be zero. Alternatively, if theta + phi = 180, but that doesn't make sense in this scenario.\n\nWait, but if theta = phi, then the angles are same in magnitude but one is above and the other below the x-axis. So, their y-components would be +p sin(theta) and -p sin(theta), which would cancel each other.\n\nSo, that would satisfy the condition p1y + p2y =0.\n\nSo, the sum of the x-components would be p (cos(theta) + cos(theta)) )= 2 p cos(theta).\n\nAnd this must equal the initial total momentum p_total.\n\nSo, 2 p cos(theta) = p_total.\n\nWait, but p is the same for both photons, since their energies are same. So, 2 p cos(theta) = p_total.\n\nBut p is 1.533 MeV/c, and p_total is 2.14 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait, m_e c is 0.511 MeV/c, since m_e c\u00b2 is 0.511 MeV.\n\nSo, m_e c = 0.511 MeV/(c) * c = 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2 * c = 0.511 MeV/(c) \u2192 Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe rest mass energy of the electron is m_e c\u00b2 = 0.511 MeV. So, m_e c = (0.511 MeV) / c.\n\nSo, p_total = 2.14 m_e c = 2.14 * (0.511 MeV/c) = 2.14 * 0.511 MeV/c \u2248 1.10 MeV/c.\n\nWait, because 2.14 * 0.5 is about 1.07, and 2.14 * 0.011 is about 0.0235, so around 1.0935 MeV/c.\n\nSo p_total \u22481.0935 MeV/c.\n\nNow, p for each photon is E_photon/c = 1.533 MeV/c.\n\nSo, 2 * p * cos(theta) = p_total.\n\nSo,\n\n2 * 1.533 MeV/c * cos(theta) = 1.0935 MeV/c.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.533 MeV/c:\n\n2 cos(theta) = 1.0935 / 1.533 \u2248 0.713.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) \u2248 0.713 / 2 = 0.3565.\n\nWait, wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait, 2 * (1.533) * cos(theta) = 1.0935.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = 1.0935 / (2 * 1.533).\n\nCalculate denominator: 2 * 1.533 \u22483.066.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) \u22481.0935 /3.066 \u22480.3565.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3565).\n\nLet me compute that. Arccos of 0.3565.\n\nWell, cos(60 degrees) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.342, so 0.3565 is a little less than 70 degrees. Let's see: 70 degrees is 0.3420, 69 is cos(69) \u2248 0.3584. Wait, wait, let me get precise values.\n\nWait, cos(69\u00b0) \u2248 0.3584. So 0.3565 is just a bit less than 69 degrees. Maybe around 69.5 degrees.\n\nSo theta \u2248 69.5 degrees.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, this would mean that each photon is at about 69.5 degrees from the x-axis, one above and one below. So the angle between the two photons would be 2 * theta = 139 degrees. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options exactly.\n\nWait, the options are 74, 172, 138, 96. Hmm, 138 is option C, which is close to 139. So that would be the angle between them.\n\nWait, but let me recheck my calculations. I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me recompute p_total.\n\nElectron's gamma is 4, so its momentum is p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c.\n\nSimilarly, positron's gamma is 2, so p_p = gamma_p m_e beta_p (-c).\n\nSo p_total = p_e + p_p = gamma_e m_e beta_e c + gamma_p m_e beta_p (-c).\n\nWait, beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u22480.9682.\n\nGamma_e =4, so p_e =4 * m_e * beta_e c.\n\nSimilarly, beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660.\n\nGamma_p=2, so p_p =2 * m_e * beta_p * (-c).\n\nSo,\n\np_e =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e * sqrt(15) c \u2248 m_e * 3.872 c.\n\np_p =2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * (-c) = m_e * sqrt(3) * (-c) \u2248 m_e * 1.732 * (-c).\n\nSo, p_total = 3.872 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c = (3.872 -1.732) m_e c = 2.14 m_e c.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, each photon's momentum is E_photon / c = (1.533 MeV) / c.\n\nSo p_photon =1.533 MeV/c.\n\nNow, the sum of the x-components of the two photons must equal p_total.\n\nEach photon's x-component is p * cos(theta), where theta is the angle from the x-axis for each photon.\n\nSo,\n\np1x + p2x = p_total.\n\np1x = p * cos(theta1), p2x = p * cos(theta2).\n\nBut since the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, their angles from the x-axis are theta and -theta, assuming symmetry. So theta1 = theta, theta2 = -theta.\n\nWait, but in that case, the sum would be p*(cos(theta) + cos(theta)) = 2p cos(theta).\n\nSo,\n\n2p cos(theta) = p_total.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = p_total/(2p).\n\np is 1.533 MeV/c, p_total is 2.14 m_e c.\n\nWait, m_e c is 0.511 MeV/c.\n\nSo p_total =2.14 * 0.511 MeV/c \u22481.0935 MeV/c.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = (1.0935 MeV/c) / (2 * 1.533 MeV/c) )\n\nThe MeV/c units cancel out.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(theta) = 1.0935 / (2 * 1.533) = 1.0935 /3.066 \u22480.3565.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3565) \u224869 degrees, as before.\n\nSo the two photons are each at about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis.\n\nThe angle between them would be 2 * theta = 138 degrees, which is option C.\n\nSo, the answer should be C) 138.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, followed by the production of two photons with equal energy.

After they annihilate, the photons have the same energy but are moving in different directions. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.\n\nWait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Gamma equals the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. For the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, it's 2. But wait, wait. Positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, so it has the same mass. So their rest mass energies are both m*c\u00b2, which is the same for both.\n\nSo, the electron is moving from the left, positron from the right. So their velocities are in opposite directions. Let's think about their momenta. For relativistic particles, momentum p is gamma*m*v. But since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are in opposite directions as well.\n\nWait, but when they collide, their momenta would add vectorially. So, the total momentum before collision would be the sum of their individual momenta. But wait, since they're moving along the same line, the horizontal axis, their directions are opposite. So, the momentum of the positron is in the opposite direction to the electron's.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the electron is moving to the right (since it's moving from left along the horizontal axis), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right). So their momenta are in opposite directions. So, the total momentum is the sum of the magnitudes, but directions matter.\n\nWait no, wait. Wait, no, the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is towards the left. So, if the electron is moving to the right (let's say positive x-direction), and the positron to the left (negative x), their momenta are in opposite directions.\n\nSo, let's compute their momenta. The electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, positron's p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p.\n\nBut wait, since they're moving in opposite directions, the positron's velocity is negative. So, perhaps it's better to assign directions with signs.\n\nLet's let the electron's velocity be +v_e, and the positron's be -v_p. So their momenta would be p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e, and p_p = gamma_p * m_e * (-v_p). Hmm, but wait, I think gamma depends on the speed, so it's just a scalar factor. So, the direction comes from the velocity's sign.\n\nWait, but for an electron and positron, their charges are opposite, but their masses are the same. So, the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction to the electron's.\n\nWait, but in terms of magnitudes, the electron has gamma_e =4, positron gamma_p=2.\n\nSo, the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p. Wait, but p_p is in the opposite direction, so perhaps it's p_e (positive) minus p_p (since positron's momentum is opposite). Or wait, let me get the signs right.\n\nElectron is moving right (positive x), so its momentum is +gamma_e m v_e. Positron is moving left (negative x), so its momentum is gamma_p m (-v_p). So the total momentum P_total is gamma_e m v_e - gamma_p m v_p.\n\nWait, but since they are moving towards each other, their velocities are in opposite directions, so maybe the actual velocity magnitudes are such that v_e is in +x, v_p in -x.\n\nBut I think I need to compute the total momentum before annihilation. Because in the center of momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, but perhaps that's not the case here.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after annihilation, two photons are produced, and their energies are the same. So each photon has the same energy. But the directions are upper-right and lower-right, so they are symmetric in the upper and lower hemispheres. Hmm, that might imply some symmetry in the angles.\n\nWait, but photons must carry away momentum, and the total momentum after collision must be equal to the total before. So, let's think about the initial total momentum.\n\nLet me compute the initial momentum. Let me denote m_e as the mass of the electron (same as positron).\n\nElectron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Since gamma is 4 for the electron.\n\nPositron's momentum: p_p = gamma_p * m_e * (-v_p). Since gamma is 2 for the positron, and velocity is opposite.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the velocities. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the velocities in terms of gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the momenta in terms of gamma and beta. Because for each particle, beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).\n\nSo, for the electron, gamma_e =4. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.968.\n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2. So beta_p = sqrt(1 - (1/4))= sqrt(3/4)= sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866.\n\nSo, the electron's velocity is v_e = beta_e c = (sqrt(15)/4) c \u22480.968c.\n\nThe positron's velocity is v_p = beta_p c = (sqrt(3)/2) c \u22480.866c, but since it's moving to the left, its velocity is negative.\n\nSo, the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\nThe positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e (-sqrt(3)/2 c) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = [m_e sqrt(15) c] + [ - m_e sqrt(3) c ] = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nHmm, that's the total momentum before collision. So in the center of momentum frame, this would be the momentum, but the system is not at rest, so the photons must carry this momentum.\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are emitted. Each photon has energy E, and their directions are such that one is upper-right (let's say angle theta above x-axis) and the other is lower-right (theta below x-axis). Since their energies are the same, their magnitudes of momentum are the same.\n\nWait, but photons have momentum p_photon = E/c. So both photons have the same energy, so same magnitude of momentum. But their directions are symmetric in the upper and lower hemispheres.\n\nSo, the total momentum after collision is the sum of the two photons' momenta.\n\nLet me model this. Let each photon have momentum vectors:\n\nPhoton 1: p1 = (E/c) (cos(theta), sin(theta))\n\nPhoton 2: p2 = (E/c) (cos(theta), -sin(theta))\n\nSo, the total momentum after is p1 + p2 = (2 E cos(theta)/c, 0).\n\nWait, but the total momentum before was m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), which is a vector in the x-direction (since the y-components would cancel out in the initial momentum).\n\nWait, but the photons' total momentum is in the x-direction only. Because p1 and p2's y-components add to zero.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial total momentum is in the x-direction. So, the photons' momenta must add up to that same x-component. So, the sum of their x-components must equal the initial momentum.\n\nSo, the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta is 2 (E/c) cos(theta).\n\nBut the initial momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), which is along the x-axis.\n\nSo, 2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure about the signs. Since the initial momentum is in the positive x-direction, the sum of the photons' x-momenta must equal that.\n\nSo, 2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if I got the sign right for the positron's momentum. Let me double-check.\n\nThe positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left, which is negative x-direction. So its momentum is negative. So the initial total momentum is p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative). So p_e is positive, p_p is negative. So, p_total = p_e + p_p = (gamma_e m_e v_e) + (gamma_p m_e (-v_p)).\n\nSo, substituting the numbers:\n\ngamma_e=4, v_e= (sqrt(15)/4)c \u2192 so p_e =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\ngamma_p=2, v_p= (sqrt(3)/2) c \u2192 p_p =2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo, p_total = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, the sum of the photons' x-components must equal this.\n\nSo, 2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBut wait, E is the energy of each photon. Since each photon's energy is E, and their momentum is E/c. So the magnitude of each photon's momentum is E/c.\n\nSo, let me write the equation:\n\n2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBut I can also think about the energy conservation. The total energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nThe electron's energy is gamma_e m_e c\u00b2 =4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nThe positron's energy is gamma_p m_e c\u00b2=2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo, total energy before collision is (4 + 2) m_e c\u00b2=6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter collision, the photons have energies E each, so total energy is 2E.\n\nSo, 2E =6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E=3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo, each photon has energy E=3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So each photon's energy is 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The rest energy of the electron is m_e c\u00b2. So, 3 times that is a significant amount.\n\nNow, back to the momentum equation.\n\n2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSubstituting E=3 m_e c\u00b2:\n\n2 * (3 m_e c\u00b2 / c) * cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify: 2 * 3 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nCompute sqrt(15) and sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(15) \u22483.87298, sqrt(3)\u22481.73205.\n\nSo, sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u22483.87298 -1.73205\u22482.14093.\n\nSo, 6 cos(theta) \u22482.14093 \u2192 cos(theta)\u22482.14093/6 \u22480.35682.\n\nSo, theta\u2248acos(0.35682)\u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, but that's just the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. The question is asking for the angle between the two photons.\n\nSince one is at +theta and the other at -theta, the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nSo, 2 *69 \u2248138 degrees. Hmm, that's one of the options. Option C is 138.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me recalculate sqrt(15) - sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205. 3.87298 -1.73205 is 2.14093. Divided by 6 gives 0.35682.\n\nThen, arccos(0.35682) is about 69 degrees, so 2*69=138. So the angle between the photons is 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps the initial momentum is in the positive x-direction, and each photon has a component in the x-direction adding up to the initial momentum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the angle is 2 theta. Let me think again.\n\nEach photon is at angle theta above and below the x-axis. So the angle between them is the angle between the two vectors. Since one is theta above and the other theta below, the total angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nSo, yes, 2 theta would be the angle between the two photons.\n\nSo, in this case, theta is approximately 69 degrees, so 2 theta is 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, so that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute cos(theta)= (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.\n\nWait, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872983, sqrt(3) is 1.7320508.\n\nsqrt(15)-sqrt(3)=3.872983-1.7320508=2.140932.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.140932/6 \u22480.356822.\n\nNow, what's arccos(0.356822)?\n\nLet me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.356822) \u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.\n\nBut perhaps it's approximately 69 degrees, so 138 is the angle.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.\n",

Since the initial momentum is in the positive x-direction, the sum of the photons' x-momenta must equal that.\n\nSo, 2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if I got the sign right for the positron's momentum. Let me double-check.\n\nThe positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left, which is negative x-direction. So its momentum is negative. So the initial total momentum is p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative). So p_e is positive, p_p is negative. So, p_total = p_e + p_p = (gamma_e m_e v_e) + (gamma_p m_e (-v_p)).\n\nSo, substituting the numbers:\n\ngamma_e=4, v_e= (sqrt(15)/4)c \u2192 so p_e =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e sqrt(15) c.\n\ngamma_p=2, v_p= (sqrt(3)/2) c \u2192 p_p =2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.\n\nSo, p_total = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, the sum of the photons' x-components must equal this.\n\nSo, 2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBut wait, E is the energy of each photon. Since each photon's energy is E, and their momentum is E/c. So the magnitude of each photon's momentum is E/c.\n\nSo, let me write the equation:\n\n2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nBut I can also think about the energy conservation. The total energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nThe electron's energy is gamma_e m_e c\u00b2 =4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nThe positron's energy is gamma_p m_e c\u00b2=2 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo, total energy before collision is (4 + 2) m_e c\u00b2=6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter collision, the photons have energies E each, so total energy is 2E.\n\nSo, 2E =6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E=3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nSo, each photon has energy E=3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So each photon's energy is 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The rest energy of the electron is m_e c\u00b2. So, 3 times that is a significant amount.\n\nNow, back to the momentum equation.\n\n2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSubstituting E=3 m_e c\u00b2:\n\n2 * (3 m_e c\u00b2 / c) * cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify: 2 * 3 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nCompute sqrt(15) and sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(15) \u22483.87298, sqrt(3)\u22481.73205.\n\nSo, sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u22483.87298 -1.73205\u22482.14093.\n\nSo, 6 cos(theta) \u22482.14093 \u2192 cos(theta)\u22482.14093/6 \u22480.35682.\n\nSo, theta\u2248acos(0.35682)\u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, but that's just the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. The question is asking for the angle between the two photons.\n\nSince one is at +theta and the other at -theta, the angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nSo, 2 *69 \u2248138 degrees. Hmm, that's one of the options. Option C is 138.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me recalculate sqrt(15) - sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205. 3.87298 -1.73205 is 2.14093. Divided by 6 gives 0.35682.\n\nThen, arccos(0.35682) is about 69 degrees, so 2*69=138. So the angle between the photons is 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps the initial momentum is in the positive x-direction, and each photon has a component in the x-direction adding up to the initial momentum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the angle is 2 theta. Let me think again.\n\nEach photon is at angle theta above and below the x-axis. So the angle between them is the angle between the two vectors. Since one is theta above and the other theta below, the total angle between them is 2 theta.\n\nSo, yes, 2 theta would be the angle between the two photons.\n\nSo, in this case, theta is approximately 69 degrees, so 2 theta is 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, so that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute cos(theta)= (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.\n\nWait, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872983, sqrt(3) is 1.7320508.\n\nsqrt(15)-sqrt(3)=3.872983-1.7320508=2.140932.\n\nDivide by 6: 2.140932/6 \u22480.356822.\n\nNow, what's arccos(0.356822)?\n\nLet me compute it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.356822) \u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.\n\nBut perhaps it's approximately 69 degrees, so 138 is the angle.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate to produce two photons of equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Momentum of the System\nThe electron and positron move along the horizontal axis in opposite directions. Their momenta are calculated using the relativistic momentum formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\gamma m v\n\\]\n\n- For the electron (moving to the right), \\(\\gamma_e = 4\\), and its velocity is \\(v_e = \\beta_e c = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c\\). Thus, its momentum is:\n  \\[\n  p_e = \\gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m_e \\sqrt{15} c\n  \\]\n\n- For the positron (moving to the left), \\(\\gamma_p = 2\\), and its velocity is \\(v_p = \\beta_p c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c\\). Thus, its momentum is:\n  \\[\n  p_p = \\gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c = -m_e \\sqrt{3} c\n  \\]\n\nThe total momentum before the collision is:\n\\[\np_{\\text{total}} = p_e + p_p = m_e \\sqrt{15} c - m_e \\sqrt{3} c = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Energy Conservation\nThe total energy before the collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2\n\\]\n\nAfter the collision, the two photons have equal energies, so each photon has energy:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Momentum of the Photons\nEach photon has momentum:\n\\[\np_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{photon}}}{c} = \\frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c\n\\]\n\nThe photons are emitted symmetrically above and below the x-axis, making angles \\(\\theta\\) with the x-axis. The x-components of their momenta are:\n\\[\np_{\\text{photon}, x} = p_{\\text{photon}} \\cos\\theta = 3 m_e c \\cos\\theta\n\\]\n\nThe total x-momentum of the photons is:\n\\[\np_{\\text{total, x}} = 2 p_{\\text{photon}, x} = 6 m_e c \\cos\\theta\n\\]\n\nThis must equal the total momentum before the collision:\n\\[\n6 m_e c \\cos\\theta = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\(\\theta\\)\nDividing through by \\(m_e c\\):\n\\[\n6 \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.87298\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73205\\):\n\\[\n6 \\cos\\theta = 3.87298 - 1.73205 = 2.14093\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{2.14093}{6} \\approx 0.35682\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\arccos(0.35682) \\approx 69^\\circ\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Angle Between the Photons\nThe photons are emitted symmetrically above and below the x-axis, so the angle between them is:\n\\[\n\\phi = 2\\theta \\approx 2 \\cdot 69^\\circ = 138^\\circ\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe question is about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and energy and momentum are conserved. So the setup is that an electron is moving to the right (since it's moving from the left along the horizontal axis) with a Lorentz factor of 4. Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So gamma is 4 for the electron. The positron is moving to the left (from the right) with a gamma of 2.\n\nAfter the collision, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between their directions.\n\nHmm. So since the electron and positron are annihilating, their combined rest mass energy is converted into the photons' energy. Each has rest mass equal to the electron's mass, right? So the total rest mass energy is 2 * m_e * c\u00b2. But wait, since they are moving, their total energy includes kinetic energy as well.\n\nWait, but wait. Because each has a Lorentz factor, their total energies are gamma*m_e*c\u00b2 each. So the electron's energy is gamma_e * m_e c\u00b2, and the positron's is gamma_p * m_e c\u00b2. So the total energy of the system before collision is (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m_e c\u00b2. But since they're annihilating, this energy is converted into the photons' energy. But the problem states that the energies of both photons are the same. So each photon has energy (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m_e c\u00b2 divided by 2, because two photons.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. Each has energy gamma * m_e c\u00b2. So total energy is (4 + 2) * m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2. Then, since two photons are produced with equal energy, each photon's energy is 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, that's not considering their rest mass. Wait no, the rest mass of each is m_e c\u00b2. But when they are moving, their energies are higher. So the total energy is indeed 4 m_e c\u00b2 (electron) + 2 m_e c\u00b2 (positron) =6 m_e c\u00b2. So each photon has 3 m_e c\u00b2 of energy.\n\nBut wait, the photons are massless, so their energy is related to their frequency and momentum. The energy of a photon is E = pc, where p is the magnitude of the momentum vector.\n\nSo each photon's momentum would be E/c = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 3 m_e c. So each photon has momentum 3 m_e c.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the directions. One photon is going upper-right, the other lower-right. So their momentum vectors are in the same general direction, but one is above the x-axis and the other below.\n\nWait, but the electron was moving to the right (from left), and the positron to the left (from right). So their initial momenta are opposite in direction. The electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * v_e in the positive x-direction. The positron's momentum is gamma_p * m_e * v_p in the negative x-direction.\n\nWait, but when they annihilate, the total momentum must be conserved. So the sum of the initial momenta must equal the sum of the photons' momenta.\n\nSo initial total momentum: p_initial = p_e - p_p (since positron is moving opposite to electron).\n\nWait, let's compute p_initial. The electron's momentum is gamma_e m_e v_e, and since it's moving along +x, that's positive. The positron's momentum is gamma_p m_e v_p, but since it's moving to the left, that's negative. So p_initial = gamma_e m_e v_e - gamma_p m_e v_p.\n\nBut wait, since they are moving towards each other, perhaps I should think about their velocities. Let me compute v_e and v_p in terms of c.\n\nGamma_e is 4, so gamma_e = 1/sqrt(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2) =4. Let's solve for v_e.\n\n1/(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2) =16 \u2192 1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 =1/16 \u2192 v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 =15/16 \u2192 v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4). Hmm, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, so 3.872/4 is about 0.968 c. So v_e is approximately 0.968c.\n\nSimilarly for the positron, gamma_p is 2. So gamma_p=1/sqrt(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2)=2 \u2192 1/(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2)=4 \u2192 1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2=1/4 \u2192 v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2=3/4 \u2192 v_p= c*sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866 c.\n\nSo p_initial = gamma_e m_e v_e - gamma_p m_e v_p.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\ngamma_e =4, v_e = (sqrt(15)/4)c. So 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= m_e c sqrt(15).\n\nSimilarly, gamma_p=2, v_p= (sqrt(3)/2)c. So 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c) )= m_e c sqrt(3).\n\nSo p_initial = m_e c sqrt(15) - m_e c sqrt(3) = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) \u2248 m_e c (3.872 - 1.732) \u2248 m_e c (2.140).\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, the positron's velocity is to the left, so its momentum is negative. So p_initial = (gamma_e m_e v_e) + (gamma_p m_e v_p) * (-1) ) \u2192 because the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative. So I think I had that correct.\n\nWait, more accurately, the positron's velocity is in the negative x-direction, so its momentum is gamma_p m_e v_p, but v_p is negative, so the momentum is negative. So p_initial = gamma_e m_e v_e (positive) + gamma_p m_e v_p (negative), which is the same as I did before.\n\nSo p_initial is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, after annihilation, the two photons' momenta must add up to this p_initial.\n\nEach photon's momentum is 3 m_e c, as I thought earlier because E =3 m_e c^2, so p = E/c =3 m_e c.\n\nBut wait, their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So their momentum vectors have components in the x and y directions. Let me model them as vectors.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.\n\nPhoton 1: direction is upper-right. Let's say its momentum vector is p1 = (p1x, p1y).\n\nPhoton 2: direction is lower-right. Momentum vector p2 = (p2x, p2y).\n\nThe sum of the momentum vectors must be equal to the initial momentum p_initial, which is in the x-direction. So the y-components must cancel each other.\n\nSo:\n\np1x + p2x = p_initial (which is along x)\n\np1y + p2y = 0 \u2192 p2y = -p1y.\n\nAlso, the magnitudes of each photon's momentum are the same: |p1| = |p2| =3 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem states that both photons have the same energy. Since E=pc, their momenta magnitudes are the same. So |p1| = |p2| =3 m_e c.\n\nSo, let me write the momentum vectors in terms of angles.\n\nLet me assume that photon 1 makes an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle \u03b8 below the x-axis. Because their y-components are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nSo, for photon 1:\n\np1x = 3 m_e c cos\u03b8\n\np1y =3 m_e c sin\u03b8\n\nPhoton 2:\n\np2x =3 m_e c cos\u03b8 (since it's symmetric, same x-component)\n\np2y= -3 m_e c sin\u03b8\n\nWait, but wait, is that correct? If the angle is the same magnitude but opposite in direction, then yes. So their x-components are the same, and y-components are negatives.\n\nSo when you add their momenta:\n\np_total_x = p1x + p2x = 3 m_e c cos\u03b8 +3 m_e c cos\u03b8 =6 m_e c cos\u03b8\n\np_total_y = p1y + p2y= 3 m_e c sin\u03b8 -3 m_e c sin\u03b8=0.\n\nWhich matches the initial condition that the total momentum is along x.\n\nSo the total momentum after annihilation is 6 m_e c cos\u03b8 along x, which must equal the initial momentum p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, 6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWe can cancel m_e c from both sides:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nCompute sqrt(15) \u22483.872, sqrt(3)\u22481.732.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u22482.140.\n\nSo 6 cos\u03b8 \u22482.140 \u2192 cos\u03b8\u22482.140/6 \u22480.3567.\n\nWhat's the angle \u03b8 where cos\u03b8\u22480.3567? Let me think. cos(69\u00b0) is about 0.358, which is close. So \u03b8\u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, if \u03b8 is the angle each photon makes with the x-axis, then the angle between the two photons would be 2\u03b8. Because one is at +\u03b8, the other at -\u03b8, so the angle between them is 2\u03b8.\n\nSo if \u03b8 is about 69 degrees, then the angle between them is 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCompute 6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = approx 2.140.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 = 2.140 /6 \u22480.3567.\n\nLooking for \u03b8 where cos\u03b8 \u22480.3567. Let me use a calculator: cos\u207b\u00b9(0.3567) is approximately 69 degrees (since cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)=~0.3420, so 0.3567 is between 69 and 68. Let me compute cos(69): cos(69)\u22480.3584, which is very close to 0.3567. So \u03b8\u224869 degrees.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8 = 138 degrees. So the answer is option C) 138.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the setup.\n\nWait, in the setup, I assumed that both photons have the same x-component, but that's only if they're symmetric in their angles. But the problem states that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So perhaps the angles are symmetric about the x-axis. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the two photons are symmetric in the y-direction, so their x-components add up, and their y-components cancel.\n\nSo the setup is correct. So the angle between them is 2\u03b8, which is about 138 degrees. So the answer is C)138.\n",

So the setup is that an electron is moving to the right (since it's moving from the left along the horizontal axis) with a Lorentz factor of 4.

Let me think again. The initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. Each has energy gamma * m_e c\u00b2. So total energy is (4 + 2) * m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2. Then, since two photons are produced with equal energy, each photon's energy is 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, that's not considering their rest mass. Wait no, the rest mass of each is m_e c\u00b2. But when they are moving, their energies are higher. So the total energy is indeed 4 m_e c\u00b2 (electron) + 2 m_e c\u00b2 (positron) =6 m_e c\u00b2. So each photon has 3 m_e c\u00b2 of energy.\n\nBut wait, the photons are massless, so their energy is related to their frequency and momentum. The energy of a photon is E = pc, where p is the magnitude of the momentum vector.\n\nSo each photon's momentum would be E/c = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 3 m_e c. So each photon has momentum 3 m_e c.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the directions. One photon is going upper-right, the other lower-right. So their momentum vectors are in the same general direction, but one is above the x-axis and the other below.\n\nWait, but the electron was moving to the right (from left), and the positron to the left (from right). So their initial momenta are opposite in direction. The electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * v_e in the positive x-direction. The positron's momentum is gamma_p * m_e * v_p in the negative x-direction.\n\nWait, but when they annihilate, the total momentum must be conserved. So the sum of the initial momenta must equal the sum of the photons' momenta.\n\nSo initial total momentum: p_initial = p_e - p_p (since positron is moving opposite to electron).\n\nWait, let's compute p_initial. The electron's momentum is gamma_e m_e v_e, and since it's moving along +x, that's positive. The positron's momentum is gamma_p m_e v_p, but since it's moving to the left, that's negative. So p_initial = gamma_e m_e v_e - gamma_p m_e v_p.\n\nBut wait, since they are moving towards each other, perhaps I should think about their velocities. Let me compute v_e and v_p in terms of c.\n\nGamma_e is 4, so gamma_e = 1/sqrt(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2) =4. Let's solve for v_e.\n\n1/(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2) =16 \u2192 1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 =1/16 \u2192 v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 =15/16 \u2192 v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4). Hmm, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, so 3.872/4 is about 0.968 c. So v_e is approximately 0.968c.\n\nSimilarly for the positron, gamma_p is 2. So gamma_p=1/sqrt(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2)=2 \u2192 1/(1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2)=4 \u2192 1 - v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2=1/4 \u2192 v_p\u00b2/c\u00b2=3/4 \u2192 v_p= c*sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866 c.\n\nSo p_initial = gamma_e m_e v_e - gamma_p m_e v_p.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\ngamma_e =4, v_e = (sqrt(15)/4)c. So 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= m_e c sqrt(15).\n\nSimilarly, gamma_p=2, v_p= (sqrt(3)/2)c. So 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c) )= m_e c sqrt(3).\n\nSo p_initial = m_e c sqrt(15) - m_e c sqrt(3) = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) \u2248 m_e c (3.872 - 1.732) \u2248 m_e c (2.140).\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, the positron's velocity is to the left, so its momentum is negative. So p_initial = (gamma_e m_e v_e) + (gamma_p m_e v_p) * (-1) ) \u2192 because the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative. So I think I had that correct.\n\nWait, more accurately, the positron's velocity is in the negative x-direction, so its momentum is gamma_p m_e v_p, but v_p is negative, so the momentum is negative. So p_initial = gamma_e m_e v_e (positive) + gamma_p m_e v_p (negative), which is the same as I did before.\n\nSo p_initial is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, after annihilation, the two photons' momenta must add up to this p_initial.\n\nEach photon's momentum is 3 m_e c, as I thought earlier because E =3 m_e c^2, so p = E/c =3 m_e c.\n\nBut wait, their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So their momentum vectors have components in the x and y directions. Let me model them as vectors.\n\nLet me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.\n\nPhoton 1: direction is upper-right. Let's say its momentum vector is p1 = (p1x, p1y).\n\nPhoton 2: direction is lower-right. Momentum vector p2 = (p2x, p2y).\n\nThe sum of the momentum vectors must be equal to the initial momentum p_initial, which is in the x-direction. So the y-components must cancel each other.\n\nSo:\n\np1x + p2x = p_initial (which is along x)\n\np1y + p2y = 0 \u2192 p2y = -p1y.\n\nAlso, the magnitudes of each photon's momentum are the same: |p1| = |p2| =3 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem states that both photons have the same energy. Since E=pc, their momenta magnitudes are the same. So |p1| = |p2| =3 m_e c.\n\nSo, let me write the momentum vectors in terms of angles.\n\nLet me assume that photon 1 makes an angle \u03b8 above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle \u03b8 below the x-axis. Because their y-components are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nSo, for photon 1:\n\np1x = 3 m_e c cos\u03b8\n\np1y =3 m_e c sin\u03b8\n\nPhoton 2:\n\np2x =3 m_e c cos\u03b8 (since it's symmetric, same x-component)\n\np2y= -3 m_e c sin\u03b8\n\nWait, but wait, is that correct? If the angle is the same magnitude but opposite in direction, then yes. So their x-components are the same, and y-components are negatives.\n\nSo when you add their momenta:\n\np_total_x = p1x + p2x = 3 m_e c cos\u03b8 +3 m_e c cos\u03b8 =6 m_e c cos\u03b8\n\np_total_y = p1y + p2y= 3 m_e c sin\u03b8 -3 m_e c sin\u03b8=0.\n\nWhich matches the initial condition that the total momentum is along x.\n\nSo the total momentum after annihilation is 6 m_e c cos\u03b8 along x, which must equal the initial momentum p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, 6 m_e c cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWe can cancel m_e c from both sides:\n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nCompute sqrt(15) \u22483.872, sqrt(3)\u22481.732.\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u22482.140.\n\nSo 6 cos\u03b8 \u22482.140 \u2192 cos\u03b8\u22482.140/6 \u22480.3567.\n\nWhat's the angle \u03b8 where cos\u03b8\u22480.3567? Let me think. cos(69\u00b0) is about 0.358, which is close. So \u03b8\u224869 degrees.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, if \u03b8 is the angle each photon makes with the x-axis, then the angle between the two photons would be 2\u03b8. Because one is at +\u03b8, the other at -\u03b8, so the angle between them is 2\u03b8.\n\nSo if \u03b8 is about 69 degrees, then the angle between them is 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCompute 6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = approx 2.140.\n\nSo cos\u03b8 = 2.140 /6 \u22480.3567.\n\nLooking for \u03b8 where cos\u03b8 \u22480.3567. Let me use a calculator: cos\u207b\u00b9(0.3567) is approximately 69 degrees (since cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)=~0.3420, so 0.3567 is between 69 and 68. Let me compute cos(69): cos(69)\u22480.3584, which is very close to 0.3567. So \u03b8\u224869 degrees.\n\nSo the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8 = 138 degrees. So the answer is option C) 138.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the setup.\n\nWait, in the setup, I assumed that both photons have the same x-component, but that's only if they're symmetric in their angles. But the problem states that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So perhaps the angles are symmetric about the x-axis. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the two photons are symmetric in the y-direction, so their x-components add up, and their y-components cancel.\n\nSo the setup is correct. So the angle between them is 2\u03b8, which is about 138 degrees. So the answer is C)138.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, which produce two photons of equal energy.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on.\n\nAn electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate and produce two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are measured. One photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions. The options are A to D, with angles like 74, 172, etc.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the setup is an electron and a positron annihilating each other. I remember that when particles and their antiparticles meet, they can annihilate into photons. In this case, it's two photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy, which is interesting.\n\nWait, the electron and positron are moving towards each other. So, electron from left (say, positive x-direction), positron from right (negative x-direction). Their Lorentz factors are 4 and 2, respectively. Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So higher gamma means higher velocity, closer to c.\n\nI think I need to compute the total energy and momentum of the system before annihilation and then see how that translates into the photons' properties.\n\nSince energy and momentum must be conserved, the sum of the energies and momenta of the two photons should equal the total energy and momentum of the initial particles.\n\nBut wait, wait. Electrons and positrons have rest mass, and their kinetic energies are given by the Lorentz factors. The rest mass of an electron (and positron) is about 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2. But I think in this problem, since the Lorentz factors are given, maybe I can compute their total energies and momenta.\n\nLet me write down the variables. Let me denote:\n\nFor the electron:\nGamma_e = 4\nMass m_e = rest mass (m_e c\u00b2 is the rest energy)\nSo the total energy E_e = gamma * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nMomentum p_e = gamma * m_e v. But v can be expressed in terms of gamma. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), we can write v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Alternatively, p = gamma m_e v = gamma m_e c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nAlternatively, I remember that p = gamma m_e v = gamma m_e c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) = (gamma m_e c\u00b2) * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2)/c.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to compute p in terms of gamma and m_e c.\n\nLet me see: For a particle moving at velocity v, the momentum is p = gamma m_e v.\n\nBut since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), we can square both sides: gamma\u00b2 = 1/(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/gamma\u00b2 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/gamma\u00b2 \u2192 v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo, p_e = gamma * m_e * c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e\u00b2) \u2192 Let's compute this for the electron.\n\nGamma_e is 4, so 1/gamma_e\u00b2 is 1/16 = 0.0625. So sqrt(1 - 0.0625) = sqrt(0.9375) \u2248 0.9682. So p_e \u2248 4 * m_e c * 0.9682 \u2248 3.8728 m_e c.\n\nWait, but m_e c is a term I'm familiar with. m_e c is approximately 197.3 MeV\u00b7s/c\u00b2 * c = 197.3 MeV\u00b7s^{-1} (but units might complicate things, perhaps better to keep as m_e c). So, p_e \u2248 3.8728 m_e c.\n\nSimilarly for the positron: Gamma_p = 2. Let me compute its momentum.\n\nGamma_p = 2 \u2192 1/gamma_p\u00b2 = 1/4 = 0.25. sqrt(1 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.75) \u2248 0.8660. So p_p = 2 * m_e * c * 0.8660 \u2248 1.732 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait. Since the positron is moving in the opposite direction (from the right), its momentum is negative. So the positron's momentum is -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p = (3.8728 - 1.732) m_e c \u2248 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nTotal energy before collision is E_total = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced with the same energy. Let's denote their energies as E_photon each. So 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2. So each photon has energy 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, the rest mass energy is about 0.511 MeV, so m_e c\u00b2 \u2248 0.511 MeV. So 3 m_e c\u00b2 is about 1.533 MeV. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.\n\nNow, for the photons: each has energy E = h f = pc, since for photons, E = pc. So each photon has momentum p_photon = E/c = (3 m_e c\u00b2)/c = 3 m_e c.\n\nWait, but direction matters. Let me think about the momenta.\n\nPhoton 1: moving upper-right \u2192 direction is in the first quadrant. Let's say its momentum vector is (p1x, p1y) = (p1 cos(theta), p1 sin(theta)).\n\nPhoton 2: moving lower-right \u2192 direction in the fourth quadrant. Its momentum vector is (p2x, p2y) = (p2 cos(phi), -p2 sin(phi)), perhaps.\n\nWait, but the problem says both photons have the same energy. So E1 = E2 \u2192 p1 c = p2 c \u2192 p1 = p2. So their momenta magnitudes are the same, each p_photon = 3 m_e c.\n\nWait, no. Wait, earlier I thought E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2. So each photon's momentum is E/c = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 3 m_e c. So yes, same magnitude.\n\nBut their directions are different. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. So their x-components are positive (since moving right), but their y-components are opposite in sign.\n\nSo the total momentum of the two photons must equal the initial total momentum of the system, which was p_total = 2.1408 m_e c in the x-direction.\n\nLet me denote the angles of the photons as theta and phi from the x-axis. But wait, photon 1 is upper-right, so its angle is theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is lower-right, so its angle is phi below the x-axis, perhaps.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the directions were measured, one upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles with respect to the x-axis are theta and (360 - phi) if phi is measured from the x-axis downward. Or perhaps more accurately, if one is at +theta in y, the other is at -phi in y, but their x-components are positive.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model their angles relative to the x-axis as theta and -phi, but since they're both to the right, their x-components are positive. Alternatively, perhaps both angles are measured from the x-axis, one upward and one downward.\n\nBut since both photons are moving to the right, their x-components are positive. The y-components will be positive for the upper one and negative for the lower one.\n\nSo, the momentum vectors are:\n\nPhoton 1: (p_photon cos(theta), p_photon sin(theta))\nPhoton 2: (p_photon cos(phi), -p_photon sin(phi))\n\nWait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right, so the angles theta and phi would be in the upper and lower quadrants respectively. So perhaps their angles are theta and (360 - phi), but I'll model them as theta and -phi, where phi is the angle below the x-axis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the two angles as theta and 360-theta, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps they have angles theta and (180 - theta), but that would be if they were in opposite quadrants, but no, in this case, both are to the right, so their angles are between 0 and 180 degrees.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that photon 1 has an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 has an angle phi below the x-axis, both moving to the right.\n\nSo their momentum components are:\n\nPhoton 1: (p cos(theta), p sin(theta))\nPhoton 2: (p cos(phi), -p sin(phi))\n\nSince p_photon is the same for both, p = 3 m_e c.\n\nThe sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta should equal the total x-momentum before collision, which was 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nThe sum of the y-components should be zero, because the initial system has no net y-momentum (everything was moving along the x-axis before collision).\n\nSo, setting up the equations:\n\nSum of x-components: p cos(theta) + p cos(phi) = 2.1408 m_e c\n\nSum of y-components: p sin(theta) - p sin(phi) = 0 \u2192 sin(theta) = sin(phi)\n\nHmm, so from the y-component equation: sin(theta) = sin(phi). Which implies that theta and phi are either equal or supplementary angles. But given that one is above and the other is below, perhaps theta = 180 - phi. Wait, no, because for example, if theta is 30 degrees, phi could be 150 degrees, but that would make their sines equal but their angles in different quadrants. Alternatively, if theta is 30 and phi is 30, their sines would be same, but that would imply both photons are in same direction, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, but if one is in the upper half and the other in lower, then perhaps theta = 180 - phi, but sin(theta) = sin(phi) only if theta = phi or theta = 180 - phi. Wait, that's correct. Because sin(180 - x) = sin x.\n\nSo from the y-component equation, we have sin(theta) = sin(phi). Therefore, phi can be theta or 180 - theta.\n\nBut the problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles relative to the x-axis are such that one is above (theta) and the other is below (phi), but moving to the right. So, perhaps, phi = -theta, but that would imply sin(phi) = - sin(theta). But in that case, the y-components would be p sin(theta) and -p sin(theta), so their sum is zero.\n\nWait, that's exactly the condition given by the y-component equation. So perhaps phi is -theta, meaning the two photons are symmetric above and below the x-axis.\n\nBut wait, in that case, their angles from the x-axis would be theta and -theta, meaning that the angle between the two photons would be 2 theta.\n\nWait, but let's see. If the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, their y-components would cancel, as they should. So, their angles are theta and -theta. Thus, the angle between them would be 2 theta.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me proceed.\n\nSo, the sum of the x-components is p (cos(theta) + cos(phi)) = 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nBut since the photons are symmetric, phi = -theta, so cos(phi) = cos(-theta) = cos(theta). Therefore, the sum becomes p (cos(theta) + cos(theta)) = 2 p cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nGiven that p is 3 m_e c, substituting:\n\n2 * 3 m_e c * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c \u2192 6 m_e c cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c \u2192 Divide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos(theta) = 2.1408 \u2192 cos(theta) = 2.1408 / 6 \u2248 0.3568.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \u2248 69 degrees (since cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)\u22480.3420, so around 69 degrees).\n\nSo each photon is at about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. The angle between them would be 2 * theta \u2248 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, so that's the answer. But let me double-check my reasoning.\n\nWait, but the initial total momentum was 2.1408 m_e c in the x-direction, and each photon contributes 3 m_e c in the x-direction component of cos(theta), so the sum is 6 m_e c cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c \u2192 cos(theta) = 2.1408/(6) \u2248 0.3568, which is correct.\n\nSo theta \u2248 69 degrees, so the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, which is approximately 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the symmetry assumption holds. Because in this scenario, we assumed that the photons are symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis, leading to their y-components canceling. But does that necessarily have to be the case? Could there be another configuration where the y-components don't cancel, but the total momentum still adds up?\n\nWait, but the initial system has zero net momentum in the y-direction. So after the collision, the sum of the y-components of the photons must be zero. Therefore, any deviation from symmetry would require other conditions, but in this problem, the photons are described as moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, which suggests that their y-components are opposite in sign. So the symmetry makes sense.\n\nThus, the angle between them is 2*69 \u2248 138 degrees, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on.\n\nAn electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate and produce two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are measured. One photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions. The options are A to D, with angles like 74, 172, etc.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the setup is an electron and a positron annihilating each other. I remember that when particles and their antiparticles meet, they can annihilate into photons. In this case, it's two photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy, which is interesting.\n\nWait, the electron and positron are moving towards each other. So, electron from left (say, positive x-direction), positron from right (negative x-direction). Their Lorentz factors are 4 and 2, respectively. Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So higher gamma means higher velocity, closer to c.\n\nI think I need to compute the total energy and momentum of the system before annihilation and then see how that translates into the photons' properties.\n\nSince energy and momentum must be conserved, the sum of the energies and momenta of the two photons should equal the total energy and momentum of the initial particles.\n\nBut wait, wait. Electrons and positrons have rest mass, and their kinetic energies are given by the Lorentz factors. The rest mass of an electron (and positron) is about 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2. But I think in this problem, since the Lorentz factors are given, maybe I can compute their total energies and momenta.\n\nLet me write down the variables. Let me denote:\n\nFor the electron:\nGamma_e = 4\nMass m_e = rest mass (m_e c\u00b2 is the rest energy)\nSo the total energy E_e = gamma * m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nMomentum p_e = gamma * m_e v. But v can be expressed in terms of gamma. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), we can write v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Alternatively, p = gamma m_e v = gamma m_e c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nAlternatively, I remember that p = gamma m_e v = gamma m_e c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) = (gamma m_e c\u00b2) * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2)/c.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to compute p in terms of gamma and m_e c.\n\nLet me see: For a particle moving at velocity v, the momentum is p = gamma m_e v.\n\nBut since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), we can square both sides: gamma\u00b2 = 1/(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/gamma\u00b2 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/gamma\u00b2 \u2192 v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nSo, p_e = gamma * m_e * c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e\u00b2) \u2192 Let's compute this for the electron.\n\nGamma_e is 4, so 1/gamma_e\u00b2 is 1/16 = 0.0625. So sqrt(1 - 0.0625) = sqrt(0.9375) \u2248 0.9682. So p_e \u2248 4 * m_e c * 0.9682 \u2248 3.8728 m_e c.\n\nWait, but m_e c is a term I'm familiar with. m_e c is approximately 197.3 MeV\u00b7s/c\u00b2 * c = 197.3 MeV\u00b7s^{-1} (but units might complicate things, perhaps better to keep as m_e c). So, p_e \u2248 3.8728 m_e c.\n\nSimilarly for the positron: Gamma_p = 2. Let me compute its momentum.\n\nGamma_p = 2 \u2192 1/gamma_p\u00b2 = 1/4 = 0.25. sqrt(1 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.75) \u2248 0.8660. So p_p = 2 * m_e * c * 0.8660 \u2248 1.732 m_e c.\n\nWait, but wait. Since the positron is moving in the opposite direction (from the right), its momentum is negative. So the positron's momentum is -1.732 m_e c.\n\nSo total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p = (3.8728 - 1.732) m_e c \u2248 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nTotal energy before collision is E_total = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced with the same energy. Let's denote their energies as E_photon each. So 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2. So each photon has energy 3 m_e c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, the rest mass energy is about 0.511 MeV, so m_e c\u00b2 \u2248 0.511 MeV. So 3 m_e c\u00b2 is about 1.533 MeV. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.\n\nNow, for the photons: each has energy E = h f = pc, since for photons, E = pc. So each photon has momentum p_photon = E/c = (3 m_e c\u00b2)/c = 3 m_e c.\n\nWait, but direction matters. Let me think about the momenta.\n\nPhoton 1: moving upper-right \u2192 direction is in the first quadrant. Let's say its momentum vector is (p1x, p1y) = (p1 cos(theta), p1 sin(theta)).\n\nPhoton 2: moving lower-right \u2192 direction in the fourth quadrant. Its momentum vector is (p2x, p2y) = (p2 cos(phi), -p2 sin(phi)), perhaps.\n\nWait, but the problem says both photons have the same energy. So E1 = E2 \u2192 p1 c = p2 c \u2192 p1 = p2. So their momenta magnitudes are the same, each p_photon = 3 m_e c.\n\nWait, no. Wait, earlier I thought E_photon = 3 m_e c\u00b2. So each photon's momentum is E/c = 3 m_e c\u00b2 / c = 3 m_e c. So yes, same magnitude.\n\nBut their directions are different. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. So their x-components are positive (since moving right), but their y-components are opposite in sign.\n\nSo the total momentum of the two photons must equal the initial total momentum of the system, which was p_total = 2.1408 m_e c in the x-direction.\n\nLet me denote the angles of the photons as theta and phi from the x-axis. But wait, photon 1 is upper-right, so its angle is theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is lower-right, so its angle is phi below the x-axis, perhaps.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the directions were measured, one upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles with respect to the x-axis are theta and (360 - phi) if phi is measured from the x-axis downward. Or perhaps more accurately, if one is at +theta in y, the other is at -phi in y, but their x-components are positive.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model their angles relative to the x-axis as theta and -phi, but since they're both to the right, their x-components are positive. Alternatively, perhaps both angles are measured from the x-axis, one upward and one downward.\n\nBut since both photons are moving to the right, their x-components are positive. The y-components will be positive for the upper one and negative for the lower one.\n\nSo, the momentum vectors are:\n\nPhoton 1: (p_photon cos(theta), p_photon sin(theta))\nPhoton 2: (p_photon cos(phi), -p_photon sin(phi))\n\nWait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right, so the angles theta and phi would be in the upper and lower quadrants respectively. So perhaps their angles are theta and (360 - phi), but I'll model them as theta and -phi, where phi is the angle below the x-axis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the two angles as theta and 360-theta, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps they have angles theta and (180 - theta), but that would be if they were in opposite quadrants, but no, in this case, both are to the right, so their angles are between 0 and 180 degrees.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that photon 1 has an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 has an angle phi below the x-axis, both moving to the right.\n\nSo their momentum components are:\n\nPhoton 1: (p cos(theta), p sin(theta))\nPhoton 2: (p cos(phi), -p sin(phi))\n\nSince p_photon is the same for both, p = 3 m_e c.\n\nThe sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta should equal the total x-momentum before collision, which was 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nThe sum of the y-components should be zero, because the initial system has no net y-momentum (everything was moving along the x-axis before collision).\n\nSo, setting up the equations:\n\nSum of x-components: p cos(theta) + p cos(phi) = 2.1408 m_e c\n\nSum of y-components: p sin(theta) - p sin(phi) = 0 \u2192 sin(theta) = sin(phi)\n\nHmm, so from the y-component equation: sin(theta) = sin(phi). Which implies that theta and phi are either equal or supplementary angles. But given that one is above and the other is below, perhaps theta = 180 - phi. Wait, no, because for example, if theta is 30 degrees, phi could be 150 degrees, but that would make their sines equal but their angles in different quadrants. Alternatively, if theta is 30 and phi is 30, their sines would be same, but that would imply both photons are in same direction, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, but if one is in the upper half and the other in lower, then perhaps theta = 180 - phi, but sin(theta) = sin(phi) only if theta = phi or theta = 180 - phi. Wait, that's correct. Because sin(180 - x) = sin x.\n\nSo from the y-component equation, we have sin(theta) = sin(phi). Therefore, phi can be theta or 180 - theta.\n\nBut the problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles relative to the x-axis are such that one is above (theta) and the other is below (phi), but moving to the right. So, perhaps, phi = -theta, but that would imply sin(phi) = - sin(theta). But in that case, the y-components would be p sin(theta) and -p sin(theta), so their sum is zero.\n\nWait, that's exactly the condition given by the y-component equation. So perhaps phi is -theta, meaning the two photons are symmetric above and below the x-axis.\n\nBut wait, in that case, their angles from the x-axis would be theta and -theta, meaning that the angle between the two photons would be 2 theta.\n\nWait, but let's see. If the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, their y-components would cancel, as they should. So, their angles are theta and -theta. Thus, the angle between them would be 2 theta.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me proceed.\n\nSo, the sum of the x-components is p (cos(theta) + cos(phi)) = 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nBut since the photons are symmetric, phi = -theta, so cos(phi) = cos(-theta) = cos(theta). Therefore, the sum becomes p (cos(theta) + cos(theta)) = 2 p cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c.\n\nGiven that p is 3 m_e c, substituting:\n\n2 * 3 m_e c * cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c \u2192 6 m_e c cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c \u2192 Divide both sides by m_e c:\n\n6 cos(theta) = 2.1408 \u2192 cos(theta) = 2.1408 / 6 \u2248 0.3568.\n\nSo theta \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \u2248 69 degrees (since cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)\u22480.3420, so around 69 degrees).\n\nSo each photon is at about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. The angle between them would be 2 * theta \u2248 138 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, so that's the answer. But let me double-check my reasoning.\n\nWait, but the initial total momentum was 2.1408 m_e c in the x-direction, and each photon contributes 3 m_e c in the x-direction component of cos(theta), so the sum is 6 m_e c cos(theta) = 2.1408 m_e c \u2192 cos(theta) = 2.1408/(6) \u2248 0.3568, which is correct.\n\nSo theta \u2248 69 degrees, so the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, which is approximately 138 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the symmetry assumption holds. Because in this scenario, we assumed that the photons are symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis, leading to their y-components canceling. But does that necessarily have to be the case? Could there be another configuration where the y-components don't cancel, but the total momentum still adds up?\n\nWait, but the initial system has zero net momentum in the y-direction. So after the collision, the sum of the y-components of the photons must be zero. Therefore, any deviation from symmetry would require other conditions, but in this problem, the photons are described as moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, which suggests that their y-components are opposite in sign. So the symmetry makes sense.\n\nThus, the angle between them is 2*69 \u2248 138 degrees, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum.
