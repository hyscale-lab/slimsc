      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting zero. Hmm. Let me see. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through it step by step.\n\nAlright, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, those are the components of a vector, right? So the state vector is |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? So I think I need to check if this vector is normalized. Let me calculate its norm.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state should be normalized, meaning each component is divided by sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T. I'll keep that in mind because probabilities depend on the normalized state.\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write that down. P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P looks like this:\n\nP = [\n    [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n    [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n    [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n]\n\nWait, I remember that for observables, the eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So if I can find the eigenvalues of P, then I can see what possible values we can get when we measure it. But the question is specifically asking for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and compute the probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize P, find its eigenvalues, and see what the eigenvectors are for 0. Let me try that.\n\nBut wait, diagonalizing a 3x3 matrix can be a bit involved. Let me see if I can find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo let's compute the determinant of (P - \u03bb I):\n\n| -\u03bb        1/sqrt(2)      0        |\n|1/sqrt(2)  -\u03bb          1/sqrt(2)|\n|0         1/sqrt(2)    -\u03bb        |\n\nHmm, computing this determinant. Maybe expanding along the first row.\n\nSo the determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2) ],\n           [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ] ) \n- (1/sqrt(2)) * det( [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)],\n                     [0, -\u03bb] )\n+ 0 * something.\n\nSo first term: -\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (0)(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] = - (1/sqrt(2)) [ - \u03bb / sqrt(2) ] = (\u03bb) / 2\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo putting it all together, the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) + (\u03bb / 2) = 0\n\nLet me factor this:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me expand each term correctly.\n\nWait, the first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb * 1/2 )\n\nThen the second term is (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) ] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) )= (-\u03bb)/2. But since it's subtracted, the second term in the expansion is - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = + (\u03bb/2).\n\nWait, no, the expansion is:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb)*[ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (0)(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0.\n\nSo,\n\n= (-\u03bb) ( \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ].\n\nWhich is (-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)/2 ) + ( \u03bb/(2) )\n\nSo combining terms:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2 ) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the equation is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as \u03bb ( \u03bb^2 -1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (\u03bb-1)(\u03bb+1) = 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, so the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So when we measure the observable P, the possible outcomes are 1, -1, and 0.\n\nSo the question is about the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, then project the state vector onto that eigenvector and find the probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better approach. Since the observable is represented by the matrix P, and the state is |\u03c8>, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue \u03bb is |<v|\u03c8>|^2, where |v> is the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb.\n\nSo first, I need to find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo let's solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 \u2192 P |v> = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\n0  1/\u221a2  0\n\n1/\u221a2  0  1/\u221a2\n\n0  1/\u221a2  0\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: (0) v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\nFrom row 1 and 3, v2=0. Then from row 2, v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form [v1, 0, v3]^T with v1 = -v3. Let's choose v3 = a, so v1 = -a. So the eigenvector is [-a, 0, a]^T. We can factor out 'a' and write it as a vector in the direction [-1, 0, 1]^T, since a \u2260 0.\n\nSo the eigenvector is proportional to [-1, 0, 1]^T. Let me normalize it. The length is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector |v0> is (1/sqrt(2)) * [-1, 0, 1]^T.\n\nSo |v0> = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\nNow, the state vector |\u03c8> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, but normalized. Wait, earlier I calculated that the norm squared is 6, so the normalized state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nSo to find the probability, we compute the inner product of |\u03c8> with |v0>, and then square the absolute value.\n\nSo <v0|\u03c8> = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ] * [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) )= 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).\n\nSecond term: 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) =0.\n\nThird term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )=1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).\n\nSo sum is [1 +0 +1 ] / (sqrt(12)) ) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nWait, because sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3). So 2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check my calculations. I'm a bit new to this, so I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, the inner product:\n\n(-1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) = (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = 1/sqrt(12).\n\nSimilarly, (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) = 1/sqrt(12).\n\nSo the sum is 1/sqrt(12) + 1/sqrt(12) = 2/sqrt(12) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3). So the inner product is 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the correct answer is C) 1/3.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome. \n\nAlright, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, right? Because the probabilities have to add up to 1. Let me check that. So the state vector is (-1, 2, 1) as a column. Let me compute the norm squared. That would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector isn't normalized. I think I'll need to normalize it before proceeding because probabilities are based on the square of the amplitudes. So the actual state vector should be (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. \n\nNext, the observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down P. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Wait, that's a 3x3 matrix. So P is a Hermitian matrix because observables must be Hermitian to have real eigenvalues. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For P to be Hermitian, the elements must satisfy P_ij = P_ji*. So looking at the elements:\n\nP_12 = 1/sqrt(2), P_21 = 1/sqrt(2). Since these are real numbers, their complex conjugates are the same. Similarly, P_13 =0, P_23=1/sqrt(2), P_32=1/sqrt(2). Wait, no. Let me double-check the matrix. The second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), so P_23 is 1/sqrt(2), and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], so P_32 is 1/sqrt(2). So P_23 equals P_32, which is fine because they're real. And P_12 = P_21. So yes, P is Hermitian.\n\nNow, the question is to find the probability of measuring 0 when P is measured. So in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, you get one of its eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector.\n\nSo first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the expectation value and use that, but no, the question is specifically about the probability of getting 0, which is the eigenvalue 0.\n\nWait, but P is the observable, so the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So I should find the eigenvalues of P. Let me compute the eigenvalues of P.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nLet me write down the matrix P - \u03bb I:\n\nRow 1: [ -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2) ]\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n| -\u03bb    1/\u221a2      0    |\n|1/\u221a2   -\u03bb      1/\u221a2  |\n|0      1/\u221a2    -\u03bb    |\n\nHmm, calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. Let's use the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Maybe it's easier to expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] )\n- (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] )\n+ 0 * det(...) \n\nSo the first term is -\u03bb times [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nThe second term is -(1/\u221a2) times [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (0)(1/\u221a2) ) ] = -(1/\u221a2) * ( -\u03bb /\u221a2 ) = (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nThe third term is zero.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0.\n\nExpanding that:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor out \u03bb: \u03bb (-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb=0 and \u03bb\u00b2 =1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1.\n\nWait, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1. The question asks for the probability of getting 0.\n\nSo I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, and then compute the projection of the state vector onto that eigenvector.\n\nWait, but the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T. But we normalized it earlier, right? So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nSo let me proceed.\n\nFirst, find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0. So for P - 0 I = P, so we have the system:\n\n-\u03bb x + (1/\u221a2) y = 0 \u2192 x = (1/\u221a2) y (but \u03bb is zero, so equation is (1/\u221a2) y =0 \u2192 y=0? Wait, no, let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, for \u03bb=0, the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.\n\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.\n\nSo the system of equations for eigenvector v=(x,y,z) is:\n\n0*x + (1/\u221a2) y + 0*z = 0 \u2192 equation (1): (1/\u221a2) y =0 \u2192 y=0.\n\nEquation (2): (1/\u221a2) x + 0*y + (1/\u221a2) z =0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(x + z) =0 \u2192 x + z=0 \u2192 z= -x.\n\nEquation (3): 0*x + (1/\u221a2) y +0*z =0 \u2192 again, y=0.\n\nSo from equation (1), y=0.\n\nFrom equation (2), z = -x.\n\nSo the eigenvector is any vector of the form (x, 0, -x) = x*(1,0,-1).\n\nSo the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). But we can normalize this vector. The length is sqrt(1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is spanned by this vector.\n\nNow, the state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nTo find the probability of measuring 0, we need to compute the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0 in the state vector.\n\nAlternatively, the probability is |\u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2, where v is the normalized eigenvector, and \u03c8 is the normalized state.\n\nWait, \u03c8 is already normalized, right? Because we had to normalize it earlier. So \u03c8 is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nSo the inner product is v\u2020 \u03c8.\n\nv is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo let me compute v\u2020 \u03c8:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1/sqrt(2) )*(1/sqrt(6)) )\n\nWhich is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ].\n\nSo that's (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) as 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2 sqrt(3).\n\nSo the numerator is -2, so the inner product is (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector needs to be normalized. So the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1. Let me check that first. The components are -1, 2, and 1. Their squares are 1, 4, and 1. Adding those gives 1+4+1 = 6. Oh, so the vector isn't normalized. That might be important later.\n\nThe observable is represented by matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/\u221a2, 0), the second is (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2), and the third is (0, 1/\u221a2, 0). Wait, I should probably write that out more clearly. So matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it:\n\nP = [ [0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n       [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n       [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] ]\n\nI need to find the probability that measuring this observable yields 0. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable matrix, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach: the probability that the measurement yields a value 'a' is equal to the expectation value of the projection operator onto the eigenspace of 'a'. So for each eigenvalue a_i, you find the eigenvectors, project the state onto that eigenspace, calculate the norm squared of that projection, and that's the probability.\n\nBut to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0 and then project the state onto that eigenspace.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can diagonalize matrix P. Because if I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the inner product between the state and the eigenvector.\n\nWait, but wait. The state given is a column vector: let's call it |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1]. But as I saw earlier, it's not normalized. So first, perhaps I should normalize it. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1]. But I'm not sure if I should do this because the problem asks for the probability without mentioning normalization. Oh, wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized because probabilities have to sum to 1. So the given state isn't normalized, so perhaps I should normalize it first.\n\nWait, but the problem statement didn't mention anything about normalizing the state. Hmm, but in real quantum mechanics, the state must be a unit vector. So perhaps the given state is a typo, but for the purposes of solving this problem, maybe I should proceed by normalizing it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that the state is already normalized, but in this case, it's not. So I think I should proceed by first normalizing the state vector.\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = 1/sqrt(6) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nNow, the observable P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that P is a Hermitian matrix because it's an observable. So it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. Let me check if P is Hermitian. The elements of P are real, so the conjugate transpose is the same as the transpose. So P^T is:\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nWhich is the same as P, so yes, P is Hermitian. So that's correct.\n\nNow, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's compute the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nMatrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ],\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] - (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] + 0 [ ... ]\n\nWait, perhaps expanding the determinant along the first row:\n\ndet = -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] + 0 * [ ... ]\n\nWait, let me compute each part:\n\nThe (1,1) minor is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nWhich is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nThe (1,2) minor is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:\n\n[ 1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ]\n[0, -\u03bb ]\n\nWhich is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) = -\u03bb/\u221a2.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) + 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)/2.\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo the determinant is (-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2 = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nSet determinant to zero: -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2) = 0.\n\nSo eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1. So when we measure P, possible outcomes are 1, 0, and -1.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb=0, then project the state onto that eigenspace, and the square of the norm is the probability.\n\nLet's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the system is:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3) = 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 again v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, v3]^T, with v1 = -v3. Let me choose v3 = a, then v1 = -a. So the eigenvectors are a * [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, where a is any scalar.\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me plug this vector into P and see if it's an eigenvector.\n\nP * [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nCompute each component:\n\nFirst component: 0*(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + 0*(1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*(-1) + 0*(0) + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (-1 +1)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) +0*(1) =0.\n\nSo P * [ -1; 0; 1 ] = [0; 0; 0]. Hmm, that's zero vector. So that can't be right because an eigenvector shouldn't be the zero vector. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake. Because when \u03bb=0, the equation P v = 0. So the vector [ -1; 0; 1 ] is in the null space of P. So when we multiply P by this vector, we get zero, which implies that this vector is an eigenvector for \u03bb=0. But wait, that's correct because 0 is an eigenvalue.\n\nWait, but wait, let me compute that again. Let me compute P * [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nFirst component: (0)(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (0)(1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(0) + (1/\u221a2)(1) = (-1 +1)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + 0*(1) = 0.\n\nSo yes, P * [ -1; 0; 1 ] is [0;0;0], which is 0 times the vector. So that vector is indeed an eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo the eigenspace is one-dimensional, with any vector a * [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nWait, but wait, another way to check. Let me pick another vector. Suppose I have [1; 0; -1]. Then P multiplied by that vector would be:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)(0) +0*(-1) =0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(1) + 0*(0) + (1/\u221a2)(-1) = (1 -1)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThird component: same as first, 0.\n\nSo yeah, that's another eigenvector. So the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional, and any scalar multiple of [ -1; 0; 1 ] is an eigenvector.\n\nNow, the projection of the state |\u03c8> onto this eigenspace is given by the inner product of |\u03c8> with the eigenvector, multiplied by the eigenvector.\n\nBut wait, |\u03c8> is the given state vector: [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nWait, but I think I should use the normalized state vector. Because the state must be a unit vector in quantum mechanics. So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is [ -1; 0; 1 ], which has a norm sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(2). So to make it a unit vector, I should divide by sqrt(2), so the unit eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nSo the projection amplitude is the inner product of |\u03c8_normalized> and the eigenvector.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nInner product = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ] \u22c5 (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]\n\n= (1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))) [ (-1)(-1) + (2)(0) + (1)(1) ]\n\n= (1/sqrt(12)) [ 1 + 0 + 1 ] = (2)/sqrt(12) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, if the state wasn't normalized, perhaps I should compute the inner product without normalization and then take the square over the state's norm squared.\n\nLet me think again. The state is |\u03c8> = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nThe eigenvector is |v0> = [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nThe projection amplitude is ( |\u03c8> \u22c5 |v0> ) / ( <v0|v0> ), but wait, no. Wait, the projection coefficient is ( <v0| \u03c8> ) / ( <v0|v0> ), but since |v0> is an eigenvector, and the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is ( <v0|\u03c8> / <v0|v0> ) * |v0>.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: the probability is | <v0|\u03c8> |\u00b2 / <v0|v0>.\n\nBecause |v0> is a unit vector, <v0|v0> is 1. So the probability is just | <v0|\u03c8> |\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me compute that.\n\nCompute <v0|\u03c8> = [ -1, 0, 1 ] \u22c5 [ -1; 2; 1 ] = (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + (1)(1) = 1 +0 +1 = 2.\n\nThe norm of |v0> is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 )=sqrt(2). So the unit vector is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nSo the inner product is [ -1, 0, 1 ] \u22c5 [ -1; 2; 1 ] = 2.\n\nThe probability is (2)\u00b2 divided by (sqrt(6))\u00b2, because the state is not normalized. Wait, no. The state |\u03c8> isn't normalized; its norm is sqrt(6). So the probability is | <v0|\u03c8> |\u00b2 / ( <\u03c8|\u03c8> ).\n\nSo <v0|\u03c8> is 2, and <\u03c8|\u03c8> is 6. So the probability is (2)^2 / 6 =4/6=2/3.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier approach.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. When the state is not normalized, the probabilities are computed as | <v|\u03c8> |\u00b2 / ( <\u03c8|\u03c8> ), where v is the eigenvector (not necessarily normalized).\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct way is to normalize the state first. Because in quantum mechanics, the state is a unit vector, so perhaps the given state is supposed to be normalized, but in this case, it's not. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The state is given as [-1, 2, 1], which is not a unit vector. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability as | (v0 \u22c5 \u03c8) |\u00b2 divided by (\u03c8 \u22c5 \u03c8), where \u03c8 is the given vector, and v0 is the eigenvector (which isn't necessarily normalized).\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nv0 is the eigenvector [ -1, 0, 1 ].\n\n\u03c8 is [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nv0 \u22c5 \u03c8 = (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + (1)(1) = 1 + 0 +1 = 2.\n\nThe norm squared of \u03c8 is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1+4+1=6.\n\nSo the probability is (2)^2 /6 =4/6=2/3.\n\nSo the probability is 2/3.\n\nWait, that's option A. So the correct answer would be A) 2/3.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that when the state is normalized, the probability is 1/3. But perhaps that was a mistake because I forgot to account for the state not being normalized.\n\nSo let me redo this properly.\n\nThe formula for the probability is | <v0|\u03c8> |\u00b2 / ( <\u03c8|\u03c8> ), where <v0|\u03c8> is the inner product, and <\u03c8|\u03c8> is the norm squared of \u03c8.\n\nSo in this case, <v0|\u03c8> is 2, and <\u03c8|\u03c8> is 6. So 2\u00b2 is 4, 4/6=2/3. So the probability is 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A) 2/3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector needs to be normalized. So the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1. Let me check that first. The components are -1, 2, and 1. Their squares are 1, 4, and 1. Adding those gives 1+4+1 = 6. Oh, so the vector isn't normalized. That might be important later.\n\nThe observable is represented by matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/\u221a2, 0), the second is (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2), and the third is (0, 1/\u221a2, 0). Wait, I should probably write that out more clearly. So matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it:\n\nP = [ [0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n       [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n       [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] ]\n\nI need to find the probability that measuring this observable yields 0. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable matrix, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach: the probability that the measurement yields a value 'a' is equal to the expectation value of the projection operator onto the eigenspace of 'a'. So for each eigenvalue a_i, you find the eigenvectors, project the state onto that eigenspace, calculate the norm squared of that projection, and that's the probability.\n\nBut to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0 and then project the state onto that eigenspace.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can diagonalize matrix P. Because if I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the inner product between the state and the eigenvector.\n\nWait, but wait. The state given is a column vector: let's call it |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1]. But as I saw earlier, it's not normalized. So first, perhaps I should normalize it. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1]. But I'm not sure if I should do this because the problem asks for the probability without mentioning normalization. Oh, wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized because probabilities have to sum to 1. So the given state isn't normalized, so perhaps I should normalize it first.\n\nWait, but the problem statement didn't mention anything about normalizing the state. Hmm, but in real quantum mechanics, the state must be a unit vector. So perhaps the given state is a typo, but for the purposes of solving this problem, maybe I should proceed by normalizing it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that the state is already normalized, but in this case, it's not.

Hmm, that's zero vector. So that can't be right because an eigenvector shouldn't be the zero vector. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake. Because when \u03bb=0, the equation P v = 0. So the vector [ -1; 0; 1 ] is in the null space of P. So when we multiply P by this vector, we get zero, which implies that this vector is an eigenvector for \u03bb=0. But wait, that's correct because 0 is an eigenvalue.\n\nWait, but wait, let me compute that again. Let me compute P * [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nFirst component: (0)(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (0)(1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(0) + (1/\u221a2)(1) = (-1 +1)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + 0*(1) = 0.\n\nSo yes, P * [ -1; 0; 1 ] is [0;0;0], which is 0 times the vector. So that vector is indeed an eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo the eigenspace is one-dimensional, with any vector a * [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nWait, but wait, another way to check. Let me pick another vector.

So the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional, and any scalar multiple of [ -1; 0; 1 ] is an eigenvector.\n\nNow, the projection of the state |\u03c8> onto this eigenspace is given by the inner product of |\u03c8> with the eigenvector, multiplied by the eigenvector.\n\nBut wait, |\u03c8> is the given state vector: [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nWait, but I think I should use the normalized state vector. Because the state must be a unit vector in quantum mechanics. So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is [ -1; 0; 1 ], which has a norm sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(2). So to make it a unit vector, I should divide by sqrt(2), so the unit eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nSo the projection amplitude is the inner product of |\u03c8_normalized> and the eigenvector.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nInner product = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ] \u22c5 (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]\n\n= (1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))) [ (-1)(-1) + (2)(0) + (1)(1) ]\n\n= (1/sqrt(12)) [ 1 + 0 + 1 ] = (2)/sqrt(12) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, if the state wasn't normalized, perhaps I should compute the inner product without normalization and then take the square over the state's norm squared.\n\nLet me think again. The state is |\u03c8> = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nThe eigenvector is |v0> = [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nThe projection amplitude is ( |\u03c8> \u22c5 |v0> ) / ( <v0|v0> ), but wait, no. Wait, the projection coefficient is ( <v0| \u03c8> ) / ( <v0|v0> ), but since |v0> is an eigenvector, and the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is ( <v0|\u03c8> / <v0|v0> ) * |v0>.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: the probability is | <v0|\u03c8> |\u00b2 / <v0|v0>.\n\nBecause |v0> is a unit vector, <v0|v0> is 1. So the probability is just | <v0|\u03c8> |\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me compute that.\n\nCompute <v0|\u03c8> = [ -1, 0, 1 ] \u22c5 [ -1; 2; 1 ] = (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + (1)(1) = 1 +0 +1 = 2.\n\nThe norm of |v0> is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 )=sqrt(2). So the unit vector is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1; 0; 1 ].\n\nSo the inner product is [ -1, 0, 1 ] \u22c5 [ -1; 2; 1 ] = 2.\n\nThe probability is (2)\u00b2 divided by (sqrt(6))\u00b2, because the state is not normalized. Wait, no. The state |\u03c8> isn't normalized; its norm is sqrt(6). So the probability is | <v0|\u03c8> |\u00b2 / ( <\u03c8|\u03c8> ).\n\nSo <v0|\u03c8> is 2, and <\u03c8|\u03c8> is 6. So the probability is (2)^2 / 6 =4/6=2/3.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier approach.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. When the state is not normalized, the probabilities are computed as | <v|\u03c8> |\u00b2 / ( <\u03c8|\u03c8> ), where v is the eigenvector (not necessarily normalized).\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct way is to normalize the state first. Because in quantum mechanics, the state is a unit vector, so perhaps the given state is supposed to be normalized, but in this case, it's not. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The state is given as [-1, 2, 1], which is not a unit vector. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability as | (v0 \u22c5 \u03c8) |\u00b2 divided by (\u03c8 \u22c5 \u03c8), where \u03c8 is the given vector, and v0 is the eigenvector (which isn't necessarily normalized).\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nv0 is the eigenvector [ -1, 0, 1 ].\n\n\u03c8 is [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nv0 \u22c5 \u03c8 = (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + (1)(1) = 1 + 0 +1 = 2.\n\nThe norm squared of \u03c8 is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1+4+1=6.\n\nSo the probability is (2)^2 /6 =4/6=2/3.\n\nSo the probability is 2/3.\n\nWait, that's option A. So the correct answer would be A) 2/3.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that when the state is normalized, the probability is 1/3. But perhaps that was a mistake because I forgot to account for the state not being normalized.\n\nSo let me redo this properly.\n\nThe formula for the probability is | <v0|\u03c8> |\u00b2 / ( <\u03c8|\u03c8> ), where <v0|\u03c8> is the inner product, and <\u03c8|\u03c8> is the norm squared of \u03c8.\n\nSo in this case, <v0|\u03c8> is 2, and <\u03c8|\u03c8> is 6. So 2\u00b2 is 4, 4/6=2/3. So the probability is 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A) 2/3.\n\n\nThe state of the system is given as a column vector \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\), which is not normalized. The observable is represented by the matrix \\( P \\), with elements:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix} \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe task is to calculate the probability of measuring 0 as the outcome of the observable \\( P \\). To do this, we first determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\( P \\). Solving the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\), the eigenvalues are found to be \\( \\lambda = 1, 0, -1 \\). For \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), the corresponding eigenvector is \\( v_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n\nThe probability of measuring 0 is given by the projection of the state \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) onto the eigenspace of \\( \\lambda = 0 \\). This is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{| \\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle |^2}{\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle}.\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( \\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle = (-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \\). The norm squared of \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) is \\( \\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 \\). Thus, the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{|2|^2}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring 0 is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the outcome 0. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). And the matrix P is given with specific entries.\n\nWait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. So P should be a Hermitian matrix. Let me check the given P matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). To confirm if it's Hermitian, the matrix should be equal to its conjugate transpose. All the elements are real, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let me transpose P:\n\nTransposed P would have first column (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second column (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third column (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Comparing to original P, yes, because the original's second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), which matches the transposed first column, etc. So P is Hermitian, which makes sense because observables are Hermitian.\n\nNow, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1) as a column matrix. I should probably normalize this state vector because in quantum mechanics, states are represented by unit vectors. Wait, but the problem doesn't say anything about normalization. Let me calculate the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6), which is not 1. So the state vector is not normalized. Hmm, but for probabilities, we usually need the state to be normalized. So maybe the state is given as a vector, but I have to normalize it before proceeding. Or perhaps the given state is already normalized? Let me think: the sum of squares is 6, so the normalized state would be ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.\n\nWait, the question doesn't mention anything about normalization. So maybe the state is not normalized, but perhaps I should proceed without worrying about it for the probability? Or maybe the probabilities are unaffected by the overall normalization. Wait, no, because probabilities involve the inner product, which would be affected by the normalization.\n\nWait, in quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized because the total probability must be 1. So perhaps the given vector is just a representation, but the actual state is the normalized version. So I should first normalize the state vector.\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The norm squared is 6, so the normalized state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nNow, the observable P has eigenvalues, and when you measure P, you get one of its eigenvalues. The possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. But the question is about the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P, and see if 0 is an eigenvalue. Because if 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P has 0 as an eigenvalue, and the eigenvector corresponding to 0 is the vector that we need to project onto the state \u03c8.\n\nSo first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Let me construct the matrix P:\n\nP = [ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n       [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n       [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]\n\nHmm, solving for the eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the matrix (P - \u03bb I) is:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]\n[1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2) ]\n[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ]\n\nI need to compute the determinant of this matrix. Let's compute it.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] \n       - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (0)*(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] \n       + 0 * [ ... ] (since the third element is zero, this term drops out)\n\nSo compute each part:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * (\u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2)) )\nSecond term: -(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-\u03bb / sqrt(2)) ) - 0 ] = -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = (\u03bb) / 2 )\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2)\n\nExpanding:\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2)\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nSet this equal to zero: -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(1 - \u03bb\u00b2) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0, \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So when you measure P, you can get 0, 1, or -1.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, and then compute the inner product of the state \u03c8 with that eigenvector.\n\nWait, but the state \u03c8 is given as (-1,2,1), but normalized. So the normalized state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nSo first, let's find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0. Let's solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: (0) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (0) v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/sqrt(2))(v1 + v3) )=0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow 3: (0) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + (0) v3 = 0 \u2192 v2=0, which is same as row 1.\n\nSo from row 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, v3 ) where v1 = -v3. So let's set v3 = a, then v1 = -a. So the eigenvector is a * [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nBut we can choose a=1 for simplicity, so the eigenvector is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T. However, we need to normalize it. Let's compute its norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 +0^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nSo the eigenvector |v0> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nNow, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state |\u03c8> and |v0>.\n\nSo compute <v0 | \u03c8>:\n\n|\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ] \u00b7 (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nWait, wait: no, more accurately, the inner product is the conjugate transpose of |v0> multiplied by |\u03c8>.\n\nBut since all the entries are real, it's just the dot product.\n\nSo:\n\n< v0 | \u03c8 > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ] \u00b7 (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nCompute the dot product:\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 ]\n\n= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) [ 1 + 0 +1 ]\n\n= (2) / (sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the eigenvectors. Because sometimes there can be multiple eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue, but in this case, for \u03bb=0, we've found that the eigenvector is in the direction of [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the inner product.\n\nSo |v0> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\n|\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nDot product is (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 +1*1 ]\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(12)) * (1 +0 +1 )= (2)/sqrt(12) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the amplitude is 1/sqrt(3), so the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the correct answer is C) 1/3.\n",

Let's solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: (0) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (0) v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/sqrt(2))(v1 + v3) )=0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow 3: (0) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + (0) v3 = 0 \u2192 v2=0, which is same as row 1.\n\nSo from row 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, v3 ) where v1 = -v3. So let's set v3 = a, then v1 = -a. So the eigenvector is a * [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nBut we can choose a=1 for simplicity, so the eigenvector is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T. However, we need to normalize it. Let's compute its norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 +0^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nSo the eigenvector |v0> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nNow, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state |\u03c8> and |v0>.\n\nSo compute <v0 | \u03c8>:\n\n|\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ] \u00b7 (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nWait, wait: no, more accurately, the inner product is the conjugate transpose of |v0> multiplied by |\u03c8>.\n\nBut since all the entries are real, it's just the dot product.\n\nSo:\n\n< v0 | \u03c8 > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ] \u00b7 (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nCompute the dot product:\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 ]\n\n= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) [ 1 + 0 +1 ]\n\n= (2) / (sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the eigenvectors. Because sometimes there can be multiple eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue, but in this case, for \u03bb=0, we've found that the eigenvector is in the direction of [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the inner product.\n\nSo |v0> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.\n\n|\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nDot product is (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 +1*1 ]\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(12)) * (1 +0 +1 )= (2)/sqrt(12) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= 1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the amplitude is 1/sqrt(3), so the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the correct answer is C) 1/3.\n\n\nTo determine the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) and obtaining the outcome \\( 0 \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the state vector\nThe given state vector is \\( |\u03c8\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\). Its norm is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\| |\u03c8\\rangle \\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized state is:\n\n\\[\n|\u03c8\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the eigenvalues of \\( P \\)\nThe observable \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\). The characteristic polynomial is:\n\n\\[\n-\\lambda^3 + \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\lambda (\\lambda^2 - 1) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThus, the eigenvalues are \\( \\lambda = 0, \\pm 1 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the eigenvector for \\( \\lambda = 0 \\)\nFor \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), solve \\( P |v\\rangle = 0 \\). The equations are:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \\implies v_2 = 0 \\),\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (v_1 + v_3) = 0 \\implies v_1 = -v_3 \\),\n3. \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \\implies v_2 = 0 \\).\n\nThus, the eigenvector is of the form \\( |v\\rangle = a \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\), where \\( a \\) is a normalization constant. Normalizing this vector gives:\n\n\\[\n|v_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute the probability of measuring \\( 0 \\)\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \\( |\u03c8\\rangle \\) and \\( |v_0\\rangle \\):\n\n\\[\nP(0) = |\\langle v_0 | \u03c8 \\rangle|^2.\n\\]\n\nFirst, compute the inner product:\n\n\\[\n\\langle v_0 | \u03c8 \\rangle = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right).\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\langle v_0 | \u03c8 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{6}} \\left[ (-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} (1 + 0 + 1) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(0) = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe system's state at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that's a vector in three dimensions. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state of a system is a vector in a Hilbert space, typically represented as a column vector. So the state vector here is |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, I should probably check if this vector is normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their norm (the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components) is 1.\n\nLet me calculate that. The components are -1, 2, and 1. Their squares are 1, 4, and 1. Adding those gives 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm squared is 6, which is greater than 1. That means the vector isn't normalized. But wait, in quantum mechanics, observables are measured using the outer product of the state vector with itself, so maybe I need to normalize it first. Or perhaps the problem assumes it's normalized? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, no, the problem probably expects me to proceed without normalizing, but perhaps I should proceed as if it's normalized. Or maybe the given state isn't normalized, and I need to normalize it before calculating probabilities. Because, in reality, any state vector must be normalized to have a length of 1, otherwise the probabilities might not add up to 1.\n\nSo, first step: Normalize the state vector. The state vector is |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector would be (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nBut wait, does the problem mention that the state is already normalized? The problem says, \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1).\" So perhaps it's just given as a vector, not necessarily normalized. But in quantum mechanics, state vectors must be normalized, so I think I should proceed by normalizing it.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem doesn't require normalization because the observable is being measured, and perhaps the probabilities are calculated based on the given vector, regardless of normalization. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. No, I think I should proceed with the assumption that the state is normalized. Otherwise, the probabilities might not make sense. So I'll calculate the normalization factor first.\n\nSo normalization factor is 1/sqrt(6), and the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me write that as |\u03c8> = [ -1/(\u221a6), 2/(\u221a6), 1/(\u221a6) ]^T.\n\nNext, the observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So let me write this matrix out.\n\nP =\n[ 0          1/\u221a2         0        ]\n[1/\u221a2       0           1/\u221a2     ]\n[ 0          1/\u221a2         0        ]\n\nWait, wait, no, the first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), so that's correct. Second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So yeah, that's the matrix P.\n\nNow, the question is to find the probability that the measurement of the observable P will yield 0 at time t.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability of each outcome is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's amplitude when projected onto the state.\n\nSo, the first step is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix P. Because the observable's possible results are the eigenvalues, and the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the modulus squared of the inner product between the state vector and the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, the observable's eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So to find the probability of getting 0, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then compute the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value, but no, I need the probability for a specific outcome.\n\nWait, but perhaps the matrix P is a projection operator. Wait, let's see. Let me check what P squared is. Because if P is a projection operator, then P^2 should equal P.\n\nCalculating P squared:\n\nP is a 3x3 matrix. Let me compute P^2.\n\nFirst row:\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0] multiplied by each column of P.\n\nFirst element: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = (1/2) + 0 + 0 = 1/2.\n\nSecond element: 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nThird element: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nSo first row of P^2 is [1/2, 0, 1/2].\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute each element of P^2 more carefully.\n\nWait, when multiplying P by P, each element (i,j) is the dot product of row i of the first P and column j of the second P.\n\nSo let's compute each element.\n\nElement (1,1): row 1 of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], column 1 of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]. So 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = (1/2).\n\nElement (1,2): row 1 of P [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] dotted with column 2 of P [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]. So 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nElement (1,3): row1 [0,1/\u221a2,0] dotted with column3 [0,1/\u221a2,0]. So 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nSo first row of P^2 is [1/2, 0, 1/2].\n\nSecond row of P^2:\n\nRow 2 of P is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2].\n\nColumn 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]. So (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0.\n\nColumn 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]. So (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) = (1/2) + 0 + (1/2) = 1.\n\nColumn 3: [0,1/\u221a2,0]. So (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0.\n\nSo second row of P^2 is [0, 1, 0].\n\nThird row of P^2: row3 of P is [0,1/\u221a2,0].\n\nColumn1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]. So 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) +0*0 = 1/2.\n\nColumn2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]. So 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nColumn3: [0,1/\u221a2,0]. So 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) +0*0 = 1/2.\n\nSo third row of P^2 is [1/2, 0, 1/2].\n\nSo P^2 is:\n\n[1/2  0    1/2 ]\n[0    1    0   ]\n[1/2  0    1/2 ]\n\nHmm, which is not equal to P. So P is not a projection operator. So that approach might not work.\n\nWait, but maybe P is a Hermitian operator because it's an observable. Because in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, which have real eigenvalues.\n\nLet me check if P is Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. The given matrix P has real elements, so its conjugate transpose is the same as its transpose. Let me compute the transpose of P.\n\nTranspose of P would be:\n\nRow 1 becomes column1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nRow 2 becomes column2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2.\n\nRow3 becomes column3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nComparing with original P:\n\nOriginal P's first row is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], which is the same as the first column of the transpose. Second row is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2], which is same as the second column of transpose. Third row is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], same as third column of transpose. So P is equal to its transpose, hence Hermitian. So that's correct.\n\nNow, since P is Hermitian, it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. The possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of P.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the measurement yields 0. So first, we need to find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nLet me find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nMatrix P is:\n\n[ 0          1/\u221a2         0        ]\n[1/\u221a2       0           1/\u221a2     ]\n[ 0          1/\u221a2         0        ]\n\nSo P - \u03bb I is:\n\n[ -\u03bb        1/\u221a2         0        ]\n[1/\u221a2      -\u03bb          1/\u221a2     ]\n[ 0         1/\u221a2       -\u03bb        ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n| -\u03bb        1/\u221a2         0        |\n|1/\u221a2      -\u03bb          1/\u221a2     |\n| 0         1/\u221a2       -\u03bb        |\n\nCalculating this determinant. Let me expand along the first row.\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ -\u03bb    1/\u221a2 ], [1/\u221a2  -\u03bb ] ) - (1/\u221a2) * det( [1/\u221a2  1/\u221a2], [0   -\u03bb] ) + 0 * something.\n\nSo first term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ) ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] = -(1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) - 0 ] = -(1/\u221a2)( -\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)( \u03bb /\u221a2 ) ) = \u03bb/(2 )\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo overall determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nSo expanding:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor this as \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1 ) = 0.\n\nSo solutions are \u03bb = 0, and -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2 =1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the question is to find the probability of getting 0. So the probability is the square of the norm of the projection of the state onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo first, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nLet's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nStarting with \u03bb=0.\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) x = 0 \u2192 P x = 0.\n\nSo the matrix is P as given.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\nEquation 1: 0*x1 + (1/\u221a2) x2 + 0 x3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) x2 = 0 \u2192 x2 =0.\n\nEquation 2: (1/\u221a2) x1 + 0 x2 + (1/\u221a2) x3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(x1 + x3) ) = 0 \u2192 x1 + x3 = 0 \u2192 x3 = -x1.\n\nEquation3: 0 x1 + (1/\u221a2) x2 + 0 x3 = 0 \u2192 same as equation 1, so x2=0.\n\nSo from equation1, x2=0.\n\nFrom equation3, same as equation1.\n\nFrom equation2, x3 = -x1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form x1*(1, 0, -1) plus any scalar multiple. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1) up to scaling.\n\nBut since eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar, we can take the normalized eigenvector. The norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1\u00b2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, and any vector in that space is a multiple of (1, 0, -1).\n\nNow, the state vector is |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1]. But earlier I thought it's not normalized, but perhaps I should proceed with the given vector, because the problem might not require normalization for this calculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to proceed without normalizing, but I'm not sure. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, probabilities are calculated using the inner product, which requires the state to be normalized. So perhaps I should first normalize the state vector.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap.\n\nThe state is given as |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1], which has a norm squared of 6. So to make it a valid quantum state, it should be normalized. So the normalized state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6))[-1; 2; 1].\n\nNow, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of |\u03c8> in the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nThe eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (1, 0, -1), normalized as (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the amplitude is the inner product of |\u03c8> and the eigenvector.\n\nCompute <eigenvector | \u03c8>:\n\n(1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) \u00b7 ( (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1)/sqrt(6) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\n= [ -1/(sqrt(12)) ) ] + [ -1/(sqrt(12)) ) ]\n\n= [ -2/(sqrt(12)) ) ]\n\nBut sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so this is [ -2/(2*sqrt(3)) ) ] = [ -1/sqrt(3) ) ]\n\nThe square of the absolute value is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, the eigenvector is (1,0,-1), normalized as (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThe state |\u03c8> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, which when normalized is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nSo that's (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).\n\nWhich equals (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nsqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2\u221a3.\n\nSo (-2)/(2\u221a3) )= (-1)/\u221a3.\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the calculation.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe system's state at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that's a vector in three dimensions. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state of a system is a vector in a Hilbert space, typically represented as a column vector. So the state vector here is |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, I should probably check if this vector is normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their norm (the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components) is 1.\n\nLet me calculate that. The components are -1, 2, and 1. Their squares are 1, 4, and 1. Adding those gives 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm squared is 6, which is greater than 1. That means the vector isn't normalized. But wait, in quantum mechanics, observables are measured using the outer product of the state vector with itself, so maybe I need to normalize it first. Or perhaps the problem assumes it's normalized? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, no, the problem probably expects me to proceed without normalizing, but perhaps I should proceed as if it's normalized. Or maybe the given state isn't normalized, and I need to normalize it before calculating probabilities. Because, in reality, any state vector must be normalized to have a length of 1, otherwise the probabilities might not add up to 1.\n\nSo, first step: Normalize the state vector. The state vector is |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector would be (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nBut wait, does the problem mention that the state is already normalized? The problem says, \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1).\" So perhaps it's just given as a vector, not necessarily normalized. But in quantum mechanics, state vectors must be normalized, so I think I should proceed by normalizing it.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem doesn't require normalization because the observable is being measured, and perhaps the probabilities are calculated based on the given vector, regardless of normalization. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. No, I think I should proceed with the assumption that the state is normalized. Otherwise, the probabilities might not make sense. So I'll calculate the normalization factor first.\n\nSo normalization factor is 1/sqrt(6), and the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me write that as |\u03c8> = [ -1/(\u221a6), 2/(\u221a6), 1/(\u221a6) ]^T.\n\nNext, the observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So let me write this matrix out.\n\nP =\n[ 0          1/\u221a2         0        ]\n[1/\u221a2       0           1/\u221a2     ]\n[ 0          1/\u221a2         0        ]\n\nWait, wait, no, the first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), so that's correct. Second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So yeah, that's the matrix P.\n\nNow, the question is to find the probability that the measurement of the observable P will yield 0 at time t.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability of each outcome is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's amplitude when projected onto the state.\n\nSo, the first step is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix P. Because the observable's possible results are the eigenvalues, and the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the modulus squared of the inner product between the state vector and the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, the observable's eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So to find the probability of getting 0, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then compute the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value, but no, I need the probability for a specific outcome.\n\nWait, but perhaps the matrix P is a projection operator. Wait, let's see. Let me check what P squared is. Because if P is a projection operator, then P^2 should equal P.\n\nCalculating P squared:\n\nP is a 3x3 matrix. Let me compute P^2.\n\nFirst row:\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0] multiplied by each column of P.\n\nFirst element: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = (1/2) + 0 + 0 = 1/2.\n\nSecond element: 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nThird element: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nSo first row of P^2 is [1/2, 0, 1/2].\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute each element of P^2 more carefully.\n\nWait, when multiplying P by P, each element (i,j) is the dot product of row i of the first P and column j of the second P.\n\nSo let's compute each element.\n\nElement (1,1): row 1 of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], column 1 of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]. So 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = (1/2).\n\nElement (1,2): row 1 of P [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] dotted with column 2 of P [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]. So 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nElement (1,3): row1 [0,1/\u221a2,0] dotted with column3 [0,1/\u221a2,0]. So 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nSo first row of P^2 is [1/2, 0, 1/2].\n\nSecond row of P^2:\n\nRow 2 of P is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2].\n\nColumn 1 of P: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]. So (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0.\n\nColumn 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]. So (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) = (1/2) + 0 + (1/2) = 1.\n\nColumn 3: [0,1/\u221a2,0]. So (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0.\n\nSo second row of P^2 is [0, 1, 0].\n\nThird row of P^2: row3 of P is [0,1/\u221a2,0].\n\nColumn1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]. So 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) +0*0 = 1/2.\n\nColumn2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]. So 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nColumn3: [0,1/\u221a2,0]. So 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) +0*0 = 1/2.\n\nSo third row of P^2 is [1/2, 0, 1/2].\n\nSo P^2 is:\n\n[1/2  0    1/2 ]\n[0    1    0   ]\n[1/2  0    1/2 ]\n\nHmm, which is not equal to P. So P is not a projection operator. So that approach might not work.\n\nWait, but maybe P is a Hermitian operator because it's an observable. Because in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, which have real eigenvalues.\n\nLet me check if P is Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. The given matrix P has real elements, so its conjugate transpose is the same as its transpose. Let me compute the transpose of P.\n\nTranspose of P would be:\n\nRow 1 becomes column1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nRow 2 becomes column2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2.\n\nRow3 becomes column3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nComparing with original P:\n\nOriginal P's first row is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], which is the same as the first column of the transpose. Second row is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2], which is same as the second column of transpose. Third row is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], same as third column of transpose. So P is equal to its transpose, hence Hermitian. So that's correct.\n\nNow, since P is Hermitian, it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. The possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of P.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the measurement yields 0. So first, we need to find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nLet me find the eigenvalues of P.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nMatrix P is:\n\n[ 0          1/\u221a2         0        ]\n[1/\u221a2       0           1/\u221a2     ]\n[ 0          1/\u221a2         0        ]\n\nSo P - \u03bb I is:\n\n[ -\u03bb        1/\u221a2         0        ]\n[1/\u221a2      -\u03bb          1/\u221a2     ]\n[ 0         1/\u221a2       -\u03bb        ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n| -\u03bb        1/\u221a2         0        |\n|1/\u221a2      -\u03bb          1/\u221a2     |\n| 0         1/\u221a2       -\u03bb        |\n\nCalculating this determinant. Let me expand along the first row.\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ -\u03bb    1/\u221a2 ], [1/\u221a2  -\u03bb ] ) - (1/\u221a2) * det( [1/\u221a2  1/\u221a2], [0   -\u03bb] ) + 0 * something.\n\nSo first term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ) ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] = -(1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) - 0 ] = -(1/\u221a2)( -\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)( \u03bb /\u221a2 ) ) = \u03bb/(2 )\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo overall determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nSo expanding:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) + \u03bb/2 = 0.\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor this as \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1 ) = 0.\n\nSo solutions are \u03bb = 0, and -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2 =1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the question is to find the probability of getting 0. So the probability is the square of the norm of the projection of the state onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo first, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nLet's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nStarting with \u03bb=0.\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) x = 0 \u2192 P x = 0.\n\nSo the matrix is P as given.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\nEquation 1: 0*x1 + (1/\u221a2) x2 + 0 x3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) x2 = 0 \u2192 x2 =0.\n\nEquation 2: (1/\u221a2) x1 + 0 x2 + (1/\u221a2) x3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(x1 + x3) ) = 0 \u2192 x1 + x3 = 0 \u2192 x3 = -x1.\n\nEquation3: 0 x1 + (1/\u221a2) x2 + 0 x3 = 0 \u2192 same as equation 1, so x2=0.\n\nSo from equation1, x2=0.\n\nFrom equation3, same as equation1.\n\nFrom equation2, x3 = -x1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form x1*(1, 0, -1) plus any scalar multiple. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1) up to scaling.\n\nBut since eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar, we can take the normalized eigenvector. The norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1\u00b2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, and any vector in that space is a multiple of (1, 0, -1).\n\nNow, the state vector is |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1]. But earlier I thought it's not normalized, but perhaps I should proceed with the given vector, because the problem might not require normalization for this calculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to proceed without normalizing, but I'm not sure. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, probabilities are calculated using the inner product, which requires the state to be normalized. So perhaps I should first normalize the state vector.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap.\n\nThe state is given as |\u03c8> = [-1; 2; 1], which has a norm squared of 6. So to make it a valid quantum state, it should be normalized. So the normalized state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6))[-1; 2; 1].\n\nNow, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of |\u03c8> in the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nThe eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (1, 0, -1), normalized as (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the amplitude is the inner product of |\u03c8> and the eigenvector.\n\nCompute <eigenvector | \u03c8>:\n\n(1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) \u00b7 ( (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )\n\n= (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1)/sqrt(6) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\n= [ -1/(sqrt(12)) ) ] + [ -1/(sqrt(12)) ) ]\n\n= [ -2/(sqrt(12)) ) ]\n\nBut sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so this is [ -2/(2*sqrt(3)) ) ] = [ -1/sqrt(3) ) ]\n\nThe square of the absolute value is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, the eigenvector is (1,0,-1), normalized as (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThe state |\u03c8> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, which when normalized is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nSo that's (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).\n\nWhich equals (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nsqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2\u221a3.\n\nSo (-2)/(2\u221a3) )= (-1)/\u221a3.\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the inner product.\n\nEigenvector e = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nState \u03c8 = (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).\n\nInner product: (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\n= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).\n\n= (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nsqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so this is (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe square is 1/3.\n\nSo yes, the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\n\nThe state of the system is given as a column vector \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\), which is not normalized. The norm is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\|\\psi\\|^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized state is:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe observable \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix} \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability of measuring \\( P \\) and obtaining the value \\( 0 \\), we first determine the eigenvalues of \\( P \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting zero. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operator P is a 3x3 matrix with specific elements. \n\nWait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that observables correspond to Hermitian matrices, right? And the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the matrix. So, the eigenvalues of P would give me the possible results when measuring P. But the question is specifically asking for the probability of getting 0 as a result.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of matrix P. Because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues. If 0 is an eigenvalue, then there's a non-zero probability; otherwise, it's zero. So let me write down matrix P.\n\nP has first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Let me represent that as a matrix:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nHmm, okay. Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nLet me write down the matrix P - \u03bbI:\n\n[ -\u03bb , 1/\u221a2 , 0 ]\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb , 1/\u221a2 ]\n[0 , 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nCalculating the determinant of this matrix. The determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but I'll try.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ]\n+ 0 * [ ... ] (since the third element is zero, that term drops out)\n\nWait, more systematically, using the first row for expansion:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb) * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ]\n          - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ]\n          + 0 * [ something ]\n\nSo compute each part:\n\nFirst term: (-\u03bb) * [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2) * [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2 ) - 0 ) ] = -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb\n\nSet determinant equal to zero:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0\n=> \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0\n\nSo the solutions are \u03bb = 0, and \u03bb\u00b2 = 1 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nTherefore, the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, -1. So the probability of measuring 0 is non-zero.\n\nNow, to find the probability of getting 0, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, and then compute the inner product of the system's state with this eigenvector. The probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The system's state is given as a column vector: (-1, 2, 1). Is this a normalized state? Let's check.\n\nThe norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1 )= sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. Oh, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as unit vectors. So perhaps the state here is not normalized. So I need to normalize it first before proceeding.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention whether the state is normalized. Hmm, so maybe I should proceed without assuming normalization. Because the observable's probabilities are based on the state vector, so the probabilities are given by |<\u03c8|v>|\u00b2, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nBut if the state vector is not normalized, then I have to normalize it first. Because in quantum mechanics, the probabilities should sum to 1.\n\nSo first, let's compute the norm of the state vector. The state is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nNorm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * |\u03c8>.\n\nSo the actual state is |\u03c8_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me think again. The observable P's eigenstates form a basis. The probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of |\u03c8> in the direction of the eigenvector for 0.\n\nSo first, I need to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue of P.\n\nLet me start with \u03bb=0.\n\nFor \u03bb=0, the matrix (P - 0 I) = P. So we can find the eigenvectors by solving P |v> = 0.\n\nSo the system of equations is:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0\n0 v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0\n\nSo equation 1: (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\nEquation 3: (1/\u221a2) v2 =0 \u2192 same as equation 1. So v2=0.\n\nEquation 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + (1/\u221a2) v3 =0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, v3) where v1 = -v3. So the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1), multiplied by a scalar.\n\nWait, let's check. Let me plug v1=1, v3=-1, v2=0 into equation 2: (1/\u221a2)(1) + (1/\u221a2)(-1) = (1 -1)/\u221a2 = 0. Correct.\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is any scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1). Let's normalize it. Its norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but wait. Alternatively, the eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar, so any non-zero scalar multiple is acceptable.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are all vectors of the form [a, 0, -a]^T, where a \u22600.\n\nSo, now, the state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. We can write this as:\n\n|\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]\n\nWait, but earlier I thought to normalize it, but perhaps the probabilities are calculated without normalization since the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized for probabilities to make sense. So I think I should proceed by normalizing.\n\nSo the normalized state is |\u03c8_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]\n\nWait, but wait. Wait another thing. The given state is a column vector (-1, 2, 1). So to find the probability, I think the process is:\n\n1. Find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n2. For each eigenvalue \u03bb, compute the inner product of |\u03c8> with the eigenvector(s) of \u03bb.\n3. The probability is the square of the absolute value of that inner product.\n\nBut since the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are [1, 0, -1], up to normalization, the inner product would be between [ -1, 2, 1 ] and [1, 0, -1 ].\n\nSo let me compute the inner product <v | \u03c8>.\n\nWait, but wait. The eigenvector v is [1, 0, -1], and the state \u03c8 is [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nThe inner product is (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nBut wait, the eigenvector v is not normalized. The normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1], because the norm is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2).\n\nSo the correct inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ]^T \u00b7 [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ) ] = (1/sqrt(2)) ( -1 + 0 -1 ) = (1/sqrt(2)) (-2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait, the inner product is a scalar. The probability is the square of its absolute value.\n\nSo the absolute value is | -sqrt(2) | = sqrt(2). Squared is (sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 2.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't be more than 1. So I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nAh, because I forgot to normalize the state. Let me correct that.\n\nThe state is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, which has a norm of sqrt(6). So the normalized state is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nThe normalized eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].\n\nNow the inner product is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ] \u00b7 [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]\n\nCalculating each component:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).\n\nThat's (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).\n\nWhich sums to (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3). So denominator is 2 sqrt(3).\n\nSo (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is [ (-1)/sqrt(3) ]^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 1/3, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the eigenvectors.\n\nThe eigenvalues are 0,1,-1.\n\nFor \u03bb=0, the eigenvector is [1,0,-1], as we found.\n\nThe other eigenvalues: \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1.\n\nBut since the question is about the probability of getting 0, I don't need to consider them.\n\nSo the inner product is -1/sqrt(3), but the probability is the square of the absolute value, which is 1/3.\n\nSo the correct answer is C) 1/3.\n",

The normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1], because the norm is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2).\n\nSo the correct inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ]^T \u00b7 [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ) ] = (1/sqrt(2)) ( -1 + 0 -1 ) = (1/sqrt(2)) (-2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait, the inner product is a scalar. The probability is the square of its absolute value.\n\nSo the absolute value is | -sqrt(2) | = sqrt(2). Squared is (sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 2.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't be more than 1. So I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nAh, because I forgot to normalize the state. Let me correct that.\n\nThe state is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, which has a norm of sqrt(6). So the normalized state is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nThe normalized eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].\n\nNow the inner product is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ] \u00b7 [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]\n\nCalculating each component:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).\n\nThat's (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).\n\nWhich sums to (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3). So denominator is 2 sqrt(3).\n\nSo (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is [ (-1)/sqrt(3) ]^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 1/3, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the eigenvectors.\n\nThe eigenvalues are 0,1,-1.\n\nFor \u03bb=0, the eigenvector is [1,0,-1], as we found.\n\nThe other eigenvalues: \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1.\n\nBut since the question is about the probability of getting 0, I don't need to consider them.\n\nSo the inner product is -1/sqrt(3), but the probability is the square of the absolute value, which is 1/3.\n\nSo the correct answer is C) 1/3.\n\n\nTo determine the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) and obtaining the value \\( 0 \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \\( P \\)\nThe observable \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\). After calculating the determinant, we find the eigenvalues to be \\( \\lambda = 0, 1, -1 \\). Thus, the possible measurement outcomes are \\( 0, 1, -1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Eigenvector for \\( \\lambda = 0 \\)\nFor \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), we solve \\( P |v\\rangle = 0 \\) to find the eigenvector. The system of equations gives:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \\) \\(\\Rightarrow v_2 = 0 \\),\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} v_1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} v_3 = 0 \\) \\(\\Rightarrow v_1 = -v_3 \\),\n3. \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \\) \\(\\Rightarrow v_2 = 0 \\).\n\nThus, the eigenvector for \\( \\lambda = 0 \\) is of the form \\( |v\\rangle = a \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\), where \\( a \\neq 0 \\). Normalizing this eigenvector gives:\n\n\\[\n|v\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Inner Product and Probability\nThe state of the system is given as \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\). First, we normalize \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\). The norm is:\n\n\\[\n\\|\\psi\\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized state is:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi_{\\text{normalized}}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \\( |\\psi_{\\text{normalized}}\\rangle \\) and the normalized eigenvector \\( |v\\rangle \\):\n\n\\[\n\\langle v | \\psi_{\\text{normalized}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating the inner product:\n\n\\[\n\\langle v | \\psi_{\\text{normalized}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\left( (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} (-2) = -\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{12}} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nThe absolute value squared is:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\langle v | \\psi_{\\text{normalized}} \\rangle \\right|^2 = \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Answer: C**",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable is represented by the matrix P, which has specific elements. I need to find the probability that measuring this observable yields 0.\n\nWait, right. So, in quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by an operator, and the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is related to the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\nSo first, I think I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix P. The eigenvalues will give me the possible measurement outcomes. Then, I need to check if 0 is an eigenvalue of P. If it is, I can find the corresponding eigenvector and calculate the probability.\n\nLet me write down the matrix P. It's a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo, matrix P is:\n\n[ 0          1/\u221a2      0        ]\n[1/\u221a2       0         1/\u221a2     ]\n[ 0          1/\u221a2      0        ]\n\nI need to find its eigenvalues. To do that, I have to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nLet me write the matrix (P - \u03bbI):\n\n[ -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0        ]\n[1/\u221a2   -\u03bb        1/\u221a2     ]\n[ 0      1/\u221a2     -\u03bb        ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix should be zero. Let me compute the determinant.\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. I'll expand along the first row.\n\nSo,\n\n-\u03bb * det [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * det [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] \n+ 0 * det(...)\n\nWait, the third term is zero because the third element in the first row is zero.\n\nSo, the determinant becomes:\n\n-\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ]\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst part: -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond part: - (1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2 ) - 0 ] = - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0\n\nWait, wait. Let me recheck the signs.\n\nWait, the first term is -\u03bb times (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2), so that's -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2). The second term is (\u03bb/2). So adding them together:\n\n(-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2)) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0\n\nFactor out \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0\n\nWhich gives \u03bb = 0, or -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 = 0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2 =1 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo 0 is indeed an eigenvalue. That means when we measure P, 0 is a possible outcome.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb=0, because the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector component in the state vector.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think. The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me call this vector |\u03c8>.\n\nTo find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0, I need to find the projection of |\u03c8> onto the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nBut first, I need to find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo, for \u03bb=0, the matrix (P - 0 I) = P. So the system (P) v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3) = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0.\n\nRow3: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as row1, so v2=0.\n\nSo from row 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as v = [v1, 0, -v1] = v1 [1, 0, -1].\n\nSo any scalar multiple of [1, 0, -1] is an eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe can choose v1 =1, so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). But since eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar, this is the direction.\n\nNow, the state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nWe need to find the component of |\u03c8> in the direction of the eigenvector for 0.\n\nSo, the amplitude is the inner product of |\u03c8> and the normalized eigenvector.\n\nWait, but first, the eigenvector (1,0,-1) needs to be normalized. Let's compute its norm.\n\nThe norm squared is (1)^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 1+0+1=2. So the norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nLet me denote this normalized eigenvector as |v0>.\n\nNow, the amplitude is <v0 | \u03c8>.\n\nSo <v0 | \u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because the amplitude should be a complex number, but in this case, it's real.\n\nWait, let me recompute:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that's correct. So the amplitude is -sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude.\n\nSo |amplitude|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me recheck the eigenvectors and normalization.\n\nWait, the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (1,0,-1). The norm squared is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2, so the norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo when I compute the inner product with |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1], let's compute each term:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = -1/sqrt(2)\n0*(2) = 0\n(-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = -1/sqrt(2)\n\nAdding these gives -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). So the amplitude is -sqrt(2).\n\nBut wait, the inner product can't be greater than 1 in magnitude, because probabilities can't be more than 1. So this suggests I've messed up something.\n\nWait, but let's think. The state |\u03c8> is given as (-1,2,1). Is it a normalized vector? Let's check.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So |\u03c8> is not normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first before computing the probabilities.\n\nAh, that's where I went wrong. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector is supposed to be normalized (i.e., have a norm of 1). So if the state isn't normalized, the probabilities won't sum to 1.\n\nSo I need to normalize |\u03c8> before proceeding. Let me do that.\n\nThe normalized state vector |\u03c8_normalized> is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1].\n\nSo, let's recompute the inner product with the normalized |\u03c8>.\n\nThe normalized |\u03c8> is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nThe normalized eigenvector |v0> is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) \n\n= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))\n\n= (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe amplitude is -1/sqrt(3). The absolute value squared is (1/3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 1/3.\n",

That means when we measure P, 0 is a possible outcome.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb=0, because the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector component in the state vector.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think. The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me call this vector |\u03c8>.\n\nTo find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0, I need to find the projection of |\u03c8> onto the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nBut first, I need to find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo, for \u03bb=0, the matrix (P - 0 I) = P. So the system (P) v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3) = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0.\n\nRow3: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as row1, so v2=0.\n\nSo from row 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as v = [v1, 0, -v1] = v1 [1, 0, -1].\n\nSo any scalar multiple of [1, 0, -1] is an eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe can choose v1 =1, so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). But since eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar, this is the direction.\n\nNow, the state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nWe need to find the component of |\u03c8> in the direction of the eigenvector for 0.\n\nSo, the amplitude is the inner product of |\u03c8> and the normalized eigenvector.\n\nWait, but first, the eigenvector (1,0,-1) needs to be normalized. Let's compute its norm.\n\nThe norm squared is (1)^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 1+0+1=2. So the norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nLet me denote this normalized eigenvector as |v0>.\n\nNow, the amplitude is <v0 | \u03c8>.\n\nSo <v0 | \u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because the amplitude should be a complex number, but in this case, it's real.\n\nWait, let me recompute:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that's correct. So the amplitude is -sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude.\n\nSo |amplitude|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me recheck the eigenvectors and normalization.\n\nWait, the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (1,0,-1). The norm squared is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2, so the norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo when I compute the inner product with |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1], let's compute each term:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = -1/sqrt(2)\n0*(2) = 0\n(-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = -1/sqrt(2)\n\nAdding these gives -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). So the amplitude is -sqrt(2).\n\nBut wait, the inner product can't be greater than 1 in magnitude, because probabilities can't be more than 1. So this suggests I've messed up something.\n\nWait, but let's think. The state |\u03c8> is given as (-1,2,1). Is it a normalized vector? Let's check.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So |\u03c8> is not normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first before computing the probabilities.\n\nAh, that's where I went wrong. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector is supposed to be normalized (i.e., have a norm of 1). So if the state isn't normalized, the probabilities won't sum to 1.\n\nSo I need to normalize |\u03c8> before proceeding. Let me do that.\n\nThe normalized state vector |\u03c8_normalized> is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1].\n\nSo, let's recompute the inner product with the normalized |\u03c8>.\n\nThe normalized |\u03c8> is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nThe normalized eigenvector |v0> is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) \n\n= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))\n\n= (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe amplitude is -1/sqrt(3). The absolute value squared is (1/3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 1/3.\n\n\nTo calculate the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) and obtaining the value \\( 0 \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \\( P \\)\nThe observable \\( P \\) is given as:\n\n\\[\nP = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\). After computation, the eigenvalues are found to be \\( \\lambda = 0, 1, -1 \\). Thus, \\( 0 \\) is an eigenvalue of \\( P \\).\n\n### Step 2: Eigenvector for \\( \\lambda = 0 \\)\nFor \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), the eigenvector satisfies \\( P \\mathbf{v} = 0 \\). Solving the system of equations, the eigenvector corresponding to \\( \\lambda = 0 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v}_0 = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n-1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThis eigenvector is normalized to:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v}_0^{\\text{normalized}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n-1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: State Vector Normalization\nThe state vector is given as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{\\psi} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe norm of \\( \\mathbf{\\psi} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{\\psi}\\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized state vector is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{\\psi}_{\\text{normalized}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Amplitude and Probability\nThe amplitude of the eigenvector \\( \\mathbf{v}_0^{\\text{normalized}} \\) in \\( \\mathbf{\\psi}_{\\text{normalized}} \\) is given by the inner product:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}_0^{\\text{normalized}} | \\mathbf{\\psi}_{\\text{normalized}} \\rangle = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)(-1) + 0(2) + \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)(1).\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}_0^{\\text{normalized}} | \\mathbf{\\psi}_{\\text{normalized}} \\rangle = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude:\n\n\\[\nP(0) = \\left| -\\sqrt{2} \\right|^2 = 2.\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result is inconsistent with probabilities exceeding \\( 1 \\), indicating an error in normalization. Correcting this, the normalized state vector is used, and the inner product is recalculated:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}_0^{\\text{normalized}} | \\mathbf{\\psi}_{\\text{normalized}} \\rangle = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}} + \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\cdot \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}_0^{\\text{normalized}} | \\mathbf{\\psi}_{\\text{normalized}} \\rangle = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{12}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(0) = \\left| \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when you have an observable, like an operator, the possible results of a measurement are its eigenvalues. And the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is related to the eigenvectors. So the process probably involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P, then seeing how the state vector relates to them.\n\nWait, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector. And the operator P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down.\n\nP's first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, interesting. I think I should find the eigenvalues of P because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. The question asks for the probability of getting 0, so I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then calculate the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.\n\nFirst, maybe I should find the eigenvalues of P. To do that, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0. Let's write out P - \u03bbI.\n\nP - \u03bbI is:\n\nRow 1: (-\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0)\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2))\nRow 3: (0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb)\n\nSo the determinant is the determinant of this matrix. Calculating 3x3 determinants can be a bit tricky. Let me try expanding along the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * det of the minor matrix (without row 1, column 1), which is:\n\n| -\u03bb     1/sqrt(2) |\n|1/sqrt(2)   -\u03bb   |\n\nSo that's (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nThen, the next term is - (1/sqrt(2)) times the determinant of the minor when removing row 1, column 2. That minor is:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo minor is:\n\n[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]\n[0, -\u03bb]\n\nThe determinant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -\u03bb/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the second term is - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = (\u03bb (1/2)).\n\nWait, wait, the cofactor for the first row, second column is (-1)^(1+2) = -1, but since I'm expanding, the sign alternates. So the term is (-1)^(i+j) * a_ij * minor determinant. So for j=2, it's (-1)^(3) = -1, so the term is - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = (\u03bb/2).\n\nWait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The cofactor expansion is: sum over j=1 to n of (-1)^(i+j) * a_ij * M_ij, where M_ij is the minor determinant.\n\nSo for the first row (i=1), j=1: (-1)^(1+1)=1, so + a_11 * M_11.\n\nj=2: (-1)^(1+2)=-1, so - a_12 * M_12.\n\nj=3: (-1)^(1+3)=1, so + a_13 * M_13.\n\nSo for the first element (j=1), a_11 is -\u03bb, and M_11 is the determinant of the minor without row 1, column 1.\n\nWhich is:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 2 and 3.\n\nSo for row 2, columns 2 and 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3, columns 2 and 3: [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb]\n\nWait, no, wait. The minor when removing row 1 and column 1 is the submatrix:\n\nRow 2: [0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb]\n\nWait, no, the minor for a_ij is the determinant of the submatrix that remains after removing row i and column j. So for a_12, which is the element at row 1, column 2, the minor is the determinant of the matrix after removing row 1 and column 2.\n\nSo the minor is:\n\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)] --> removing column 2, becomes [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] --> removing column 2, becomes [0, 0]\n\nWait, no, row 2 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), removing column 2, the minor is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] for row 2, and row 3 is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], removing column 2, becomes [0, 0]?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me write the minor for a_12, which is the element at row 1, column 2.\n\nSo the minor is the submatrix:\n\nRow 2: columns 1 and 3: (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2))\nRow 3: columns 1 and 3: (0, 0)\n\nWait, that's not right because for row 3, the original is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So removing column 2, it's [0, 0]. So the minor is:\n\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 0]\n\nSo the determinant is (1/sqrt(2)*0) - (1/sqrt(2)*0) ) = 0.\n\nWait, that can't be correct. Because if I'm expanding the determinant, that would make the cofactor for a_12 zero, but that's probably not correct. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The minor for a_12 is the matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2.\n\nOriginal P - \u03bbI:\n\nRow 1: [-\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb]\n\nSo removing row 1 and column 2, the minor is:\n\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, -\u03bb]\n\nWait, no. Because in row 2, the elements are (1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)). Removing column 2, we have (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) for row 2.\n\nRow 3 is (0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb). Removing column 2, it's (0, -\u03bb).\n\nSo the minor matrix is:\n\n[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]\n[0, -\u03bb]\n\nSo the determinant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -\u03bb / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the cofactor for a_12 is (-1)^(1+2) * (-\u03bb / sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, a_ij is the element at (1,2), which is 1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the cofactor is (-1)^(3) * (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, no: the cofactor is (-1)^(i+j) multiplied by the minor's determinant. So i=1, j=2: (-1)^(3) = -1.\n\nSo the cofactor is (-1) * ( -\u03bb/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the cofactor is (-1)^(i+j) multiplied by the minor determinant. So the minor determinant is (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo cofactor is (-1)^(3) * (minor determinant) = (-1) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) = \u03bb/sqrt(2).\n\nBut wait, no. The cofactor for the element a_12 is (-1)^(1+2) multiplied by the minor determinant. So the minor determinant is the determinant I just calculated, which is -\u03bb/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the cofactor is (-1)^(3) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1)*(-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) )= \u03bb/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the term for a_12 in the determinant expansion is a_12 * cofactor, which is (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nWait, but the expansion is sum of a_ij * cofactor. So for j=1: a_11 * cofactor11.\n\nj=2: a_12 * cofactor12.\n\nj=3: a_13 * cofactor13.\n\nSo the first term is a_11 * cofactor11: (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nWait, no, wait. The cofactor for a_11 is (-1)^(1+1) * minor determinant. So minor determinant for a_11 is the determinant of the matrix without row 1 and column 1.\n\nWhich is:\n\nRow 2: [0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb]\n\nSo determinant is (0*(-\u03bb)) - (1/sqrt(2)*1/sqrt(2)) )= 0 - (1/2) )= -1/2.\n\nSo cofactor is (+1) * (-1/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo the term for j=1 is a_11 * cofactor = (-\u03bb) * (-1/2) )= \u03bb/2.\n\nThe second term (j=2) is a_12 * cofactor12.\n\na_12 is 1/sqrt(2), cofactor12 is \u03bb/sqrt(2) (as calculated before). So term is (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb/sqrt(2)) )= \u03bb/2.\n\nThe third term (j=3) is a_13 * cofactor13.\n\na_13 is 0, so the term is zero.\n\nSo the determinant is (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) + 0 = \u03bb.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the determinant of P-\u03bbI is equal to \u03bb? That would imply that \u03bb is an eigenvalue, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check the expansion again.\n\nWait, the determinant expansion along the first row would be:\n\na_11 * M_11 - a_12 * M_12 + a_13 * M_13.\n\nWait, no, the cofactor signs are handled in the cofactors. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cofactor signs. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the determinant using another method, like row operations or looking for patterns.\n\nLooking at matrix P, perhaps it's symmetric. Let me see: P's rows are:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nSo yes, P is symmetric. So it's diagonalizable, and its eigenvectors are orthogonal.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe I can find the eigenvalues by looking for vectors that satisfy (P - \u03bb I) v = 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that the matrix P has a particular structure. Let me see:\n\nP is a 3x3 matrix. Let's write it out:\n\nRow 1: 0, a, 0\nRow 2: a, 0, a\nRow 3: 0, a, 0\n\nWhere a = 1/sqrt(2).\n\nHmm, that looks familiar. It's a symmetric matrix, so we can find eigenvalues by looking for vectors that are symmetric or antisymmetric.\n\nLet me think about possible eigenvectors.\n\nSuppose v1 is [1, 0, 1]^T. Let me see what P does to this vector.\n\nP * v1 = [ (0)(1) + a*(0) + 0*(1), a*(1) + 0*(0) + a*(1), 0*(1) + a*(0) +0*(1) ]\n\nWait, no, wait. Matrix multiplication is row by column.\n\nWait, for v1 = [1; 0; 1], then P * v1:\n\nFirst element: 0*1 + a*0 + 0*1 = 0.\n\nSecond element: a*1 + 0*0 + a*1 = a (1 + 1) = 2a.\n\nThird element: 0*1 + a*0 + 0*1 = 0.\n\nSo P * v1 = [0, 2a, 0]^T. Hmm, that's 2a in the second component. So the result is [0, 2a, 0]^T. So that's not a scalar multiple of v1.\n\nWait, but maybe if I choose v1 as [1, 0, 1]^T, then P * v1 is [0, 2a, 0]^T. So that's (2a, 0, 0) if I transpose? No, [0, 2a, 0] is a column vector.\n\nHmm, perhaps this isn't an eigenvector. Let me think of another vector.\n\nWhat about v2 = [1, 0, -1]^T?\n\nP * v2 would be:\n\nFirst element: 0*1 + a*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSecond element: a*1 + 0*0 + a*(-1) = a(1 -1 )= 0.\n\nThird element: 0*1 + a*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSo P * v2 = [0,0,0]^T. Oh wait, that's zero vector. So v2 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the vector [1; 0; -1] is an eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Because when I multiply P by v2, I get zero.\n\nWait, but I should double-check.\n\nWait, let me compute it again.\n\nv2 is [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nP * v2:\n\nRow 1: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = (1/sqrt(2) - 1/sqrt(2)) )= 0.\n\nRow 3: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSo P*v2 is indeed [0;0;0], which is 0*v2. So v2 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nOkay, so one of the eigenvalues is 0. Now, what about the other eigenvalues?\n\nWell, since P is a symmetric matrix, it has three real eigenvalues, and they should be orthogonal.\n\nAnother approach: Let's assume that the eigenvalues are 0, a, and -a, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the trace and determinant.\n\nThe trace of P is the sum of the diagonal elements. P's diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So the trace is zero. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.\n\nThe determinant of P: I think it's zero because when you have a matrix with a non-trivial kernel, the determinant is zero. Alternatively, since one of the eigenvalues is zero, the determinant is zero.\n\nSo the eigenvalues must sum to zero, and one is zero. So the other two eigenvalues must sum to zero. Let's call them \u03bb and -\u03bb.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, \u03bb, -\u03bb.\n\nTo find \u03bb, perhaps I can look for another eigenvector.\n\nLet's consider another vector, maybe v3 = [0,1,0]^T.\n\nCompute P * v3:\n\nRow 1: 0*0 + a*1 + 0*0 = a.\n\nRow 2: a*0 + 0*1 + a*0 = 0.\n\nRow 3: 0*0 + a*1 + 0*0 = a.\n\nSo P*v3 = [a; 0; a].\n\nWhich is a*(1, 0, 1)^T. Hmm, but that's not a scalar multiple of v3, which is [0;1;0].\n\nWait, but maybe I can find another vector. Let's try v4 = [1,1,1]^T.\n\nCompute P*v4:\n\nRow 1: 0*1 + a*1 +0*1 = a.\n\nRow 2: a*1 + 0*1 + a*1 = a(1+1) = 2a.\n\nRow 3: 0*1 + a*1 +0*1 = a.\n\nSo P*v4 = [a; 2a; a] = a*(1, 2, 1)^T.\n\nHmm, not a multiple of v4, so that's not an eigenvector.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that P is a symmetric matrix, so eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n\nWe already have v2 = [1;0;-1], which is an eigenvector for eigenvalue 0. So any eigenvector for another eigenvalue must be orthogonal to v2.\n\nLet me think: Suppose another eigenvector is [x, y, z]. Then, it must satisfy x*1 + 0*y + (-1)*z = 0 \u2192 x - z = 0 \u2192 x = z.\n\nSo vectors orthogonal to v2 satisfy x = z.\n\nLet me try a vector where x = z, say v5 = [1, y, 1]^T.\n\nLet me see if P*v5 is a multiple of v5.\n\nCompute P * v5:\n\nRow 1: 0*1 + a*y +0*1 = a y.\n\nRow 2: a*1 + 0*y + a*1 = a(1+1) = 2a.\n\nRow 3: 0*1 + a*y + 0*1 = a y.\n\nSo P*v5 = [a y; 2a; a y ].\n\nWe want this to be \u03bb * v5 = \u03bb [1; y; 1].\n\nSo:\n\na y = \u03bb * 1 \u2192 \u03bb = a y.\n\n2a = \u03bb y \u2192 2a = (a y) * y \u2192 2a = a y\u00b2 \u2192 y\u00b2 = 2 \u2192 y = sqrt(2) or -sqrt(2).\n\nAnd from the third component: a y = \u03bb * 1 \u2192 same as the first component.\n\nSo, substituting y^2=2:\n\nSo, we have \u03bb = a y.\n\nSo, let's see if this holds.\n\nBut wait, the vector v5 is [1, y, 1], and we have:\n\nP v5 = [ a y, 2a, a y ].\n\nWe want this to be \u03bb [1, y, 1].\n\nSo:\n\na y = \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb = a y.\n\n2a = \u03bb y \u2192 2a = a y * y \u2192 2a = a y\u00b2 \u2192 y\u00b2=2 \u2192 y=\u00b1\u221a2.\n\nSo, if y = \u221a2, then \u03bb = a * sqrt(2) = (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) )= 1.\n\nSimilarly, if y = -\u221a2, \u03bb = a*(-sqrt(2)) = -1.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo when we measure the observable P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.\n\nNow, the question is to find the probability that the measurement yields 0.\n\nSo we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and compute the square of the amplitude of the state vector in that eigenvector.\n\nEarlier, we found that [1;0;-1] is an eigenvector for eigenvalue 0. But wait, let me check: when I multiplied P by [1;0;-1], I got [0;0;0], so that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the eigenvectors are unique up to a scalar multiple. So any scalar multiple of [1;0;-1] is also an eigenvector.\n\nBut the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T. Let's call this vector |\u03c8>.\n\nWe need to compute the projection of |\u03c8> onto the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nThe formula for the probability is |\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2, where v is the normalized eigenvector.\n\nBut first, we need to normalize the eigenvector. The vector [1;0;-1] has a norm of sqrt(1\u00b2 +0\u00b2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1].\n\nSo let me compute the inner product between this eigenvector and |\u03c8>.\n\n\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] \u00b7 [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nThe dot product is (1*(-1)) + (0*2) + (-1 * 1) )= (-1) + 0 + (-1) )= -2.\n\nSo \u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-2) )= -2/sqrt(2) )= -sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude.\n\nSo | -sqrt(2) |\u00b2 = (sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 2.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, wait! Wait, the eigenvector I used is [1;0;-1], which is of length sqrt(2), so when normalized, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [1;0;-1]. The inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * [1,0,-1] \u00b7 [-1,2,1].\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nMultiply by 1/sqrt(2): (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But that's a probability of 2, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. The state vector must be normalized. Let me check the state vector given in the problem. The state is (-1, 2, 1)^T. Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. So when computing probabilities, I need to consider the normalized state.\n\nAh, that's a crucial point I missed. So the state is not normalized. So I should normalize it first.\n\nSo the state |\u03c8> is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T, and its norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1)^T.\n\nSo let me correct the calculation.\n\nThe eigenvector for 0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1;0;-1].\n\nThe normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1;2;1].\n\nCompute the inner product between the normalized eigenvector and the normalized state.\n\n\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] \u00b7 (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\n= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) ) [ (1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ]\n\n= (1/sqrt(12)) ) [ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ) ]\n\n= (1/sqrt(12)) * (-2)\n\n= (-2)/sqrt(12) )= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 )= 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when you have an observable, like an operator, the possible results of a measurement are its eigenvalues. And the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is related to the eigenvectors. So the process probably involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P, then seeing how the state vector relates to them.\n\nWait, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector. And the operator P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down.\n\nP's first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, interesting. I think I should find the eigenvalues of P because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. The question asks for the probability of getting 0, so I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then calculate the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.\n\nFirst, maybe I should find the eigenvalues of P. To do that, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0. Let's write out P - \u03bbI.\n\nP - \u03bbI is:\n\nRow 1: (-\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0)\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2))\nRow 3: (0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb)\n\nSo the determinant is the determinant of this matrix. Calculating 3x3 determinants can be a bit tricky. Let me try expanding along the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * det of the minor matrix (without row 1, column 1), which is:\n\n| -\u03bb     1/sqrt(2) |\n|1/sqrt(2)   -\u03bb   |\n\nSo that's (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nThen, the next term is - (1/sqrt(2)) times the determinant of the minor when removing row 1, column 2. That minor is:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo minor is:\n\n[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]\n[0, -\u03bb]\n\nThe determinant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -\u03bb/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the second term is - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = (\u03bb (1/2)).\n\nWait, wait, the cofactor for the first row, second column is (-1)^(1+2) = -1, but since I'm expanding, the sign alternates. So the term is (-1)^(i+j) * a_ij * minor determinant. So for j=2, it's (-1)^(3) = -1, so the term is - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = (\u03bb/2).\n\nWait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The cofactor expansion is: sum over j=1 to n of (-1)^(i+j) * a_ij * M_ij, where M_ij is the minor determinant.\n\nSo for the first row (i=1), j=1: (-1)^(1+1)=1, so + a_11 * M_11.\n\nj=2: (-1)^(1+2)=-1, so - a_12 * M_12.\n\nj=3: (-1)^(1+3)=1, so + a_13 * M_13.\n\nSo for the first element (j=1), a_11 is -\u03bb, and M_11 is the determinant of the minor without row 1, column 1.\n\nWhich is:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 2 and 3.\n\nSo for row 2, columns 2 and 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3, columns 2 and 3: [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb]\n\nWait, no, wait. The minor when removing row 1 and column 1 is the submatrix:\n\nRow 2: [0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb]\n\nWait, no, the minor for a_ij is the determinant of the submatrix that remains after removing row i and column j. So for a_12, which is the element at row 1, column 2, the minor is the determinant of the matrix after removing row 1 and column 2.\n\nSo the minor is:\n\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)] --> removing column 2, becomes [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] --> removing column 2, becomes [0, 0]\n\nWait, no, row 2 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), removing column 2, the minor is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] for row 2, and row 3 is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], removing column 2, becomes [0, 0]?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me write the minor for a_12, which is the element at row 1, column 2.\n\nSo the minor is the submatrix:\n\nRow 2: columns 1 and 3: (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2))\nRow 3: columns 1 and 3: (0, 0)\n\nWait, that's not right because for row 3, the original is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So removing column 2, it's [0, 0]. So the minor is:\n\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 0]\n\nSo the determinant is (1/sqrt(2)*0) - (1/sqrt(2)*0) ) = 0.\n\nWait, that can't be correct. Because if I'm expanding the determinant, that would make the cofactor for a_12 zero, but that's probably not correct. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The minor for a_12 is the matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2.\n\nOriginal P - \u03bbI:\n\nRow 1: [-\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb]\n\nSo removing row 1 and column 2, the minor is:\n\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, -\u03bb]\n\nWait, no. Because in row 2, the elements are (1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)). Removing column 2, we have (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) for row 2.\n\nRow 3 is (0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb). Removing column 2, it's (0, -\u03bb).\n\nSo the minor matrix is:\n\n[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]\n[0, -\u03bb]\n\nSo the determinant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -\u03bb / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the cofactor for a_12 is (-1)^(1+2) * (-\u03bb / sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, a_ij is the element at (1,2), which is 1/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the cofactor is (-1)^(3) * (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, no: the cofactor is (-1)^(i+j) multiplied by the minor's determinant. So i=1, j=2: (-1)^(3) = -1.\n\nSo the cofactor is (-1) * ( -\u03bb/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the cofactor is (-1)^(i+j) multiplied by the minor determinant. So the minor determinant is (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo cofactor is (-1)^(3) * (minor determinant) = (-1) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) = \u03bb/sqrt(2).\n\nBut wait, no. The cofactor for the element a_12 is (-1)^(1+2) multiplied by the minor determinant. So the minor determinant is the determinant I just calculated, which is -\u03bb/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the cofactor is (-1)^(3) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1)*(-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) )= \u03bb/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the term for a_12 in the determinant expansion is a_12 * cofactor, which is (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nWait, but the expansion is sum of a_ij * cofactor. So for j=1: a_11 * cofactor11.\n\nj=2: a_12 * cofactor12.\n\nj=3: a_13 * cofactor13.\n\nSo the first term is a_11 * cofactor11: (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nWait, no, wait. The cofactor for a_11 is (-1)^(1+1) * minor determinant. So minor determinant for a_11 is the determinant of the matrix without row 1 and column 1.\n\nWhich is:\n\nRow 2: [0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb]\n\nSo determinant is (0*(-\u03bb)) - (1/sqrt(2)*1/sqrt(2)) )= 0 - (1/2) )= -1/2.\n\nSo cofactor is (+1) * (-1/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo the term for j=1 is a_11 * cofactor = (-\u03bb) * (-1/2) )= \u03bb/2.\n\nThe second term (j=2) is a_12 * cofactor12.\n\na_12 is 1/sqrt(2), cofactor12 is \u03bb/sqrt(2) (as calculated before). So term is (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb/sqrt(2)) )= \u03bb/2.\n\nThe third term (j=3) is a_13 * cofactor13.\n\na_13 is 0, so the term is zero.\n\nSo the determinant is (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) + 0 = \u03bb.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the determinant of P-\u03bbI is equal to \u03bb? That would imply that \u03bb is an eigenvalue, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check the expansion again.\n\nWait, the determinant expansion along the first row would be:\n\na_11 * M_11 - a_12 * M_12 + a_13 * M_13.\n\nWait, no, the cofactor signs are handled in the cofactors. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cofactor signs. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the determinant using another method, like row operations or looking for patterns.\n\nLooking at matrix P, perhaps it's symmetric. Let me see: P's rows are:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nSo yes, P is symmetric. So it's diagonalizable, and its eigenvectors are orthogonal.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe I can find the eigenvalues by looking for vectors that satisfy (P - \u03bb I) v = 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that the matrix P has a particular structure. Let me see:\n\nP is a 3x3 matrix. Let's write it out:\n\nRow 1: 0, a, 0\nRow 2: a, 0, a\nRow 3: 0, a, 0\n\nWhere a = 1/sqrt(2).\n\nHmm, that looks familiar. It's a symmetric matrix, so we can find eigenvalues by looking for vectors that are symmetric or antisymmetric.\n\nLet me think about possible eigenvectors.\n\nSuppose v1 is [1, 0, 1]^T. Let me see what P does to this vector.\n\nP * v1 = [ (0)(1) + a*(0) + 0*(1), a*(1) + 0*(0) + a*(1), 0*(1) + a*(0) +0*(1) ]\n\nWait, no, wait. Matrix multiplication is row by column.\n\nWait, for v1 = [1; 0; 1], then P * v1:\n\nFirst element: 0*1 + a*0 + 0*1 = 0.\n\nSecond element: a*1 + 0*0 + a*1 = a (1 + 1) = 2a.\n\nThird element: 0*1 + a*0 + 0*1 = 0.\n\nSo P * v1 = [0, 2a, 0]^T. Hmm, that's 2a in the second component. So the result is [0, 2a, 0]^T. So that's not a scalar multiple of v1.\n\nWait, but maybe if I choose v1 as [1, 0, 1]^T, then P * v1 is [0, 2a, 0]^T. So that's (2a, 0, 0) if I transpose? No, [0, 2a, 0] is a column vector.\n\nHmm, perhaps this isn't an eigenvector. Let me think of another vector.\n\nWhat about v2 = [1, 0, -1]^T?\n\nP * v2 would be:\n\nFirst element: 0*1 + a*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSecond element: a*1 + 0*0 + a*(-1) = a(1 -1 )= 0.\n\nThird element: 0*1 + a*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSo P * v2 = [0,0,0]^T. Oh wait, that's zero vector. So v2 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the vector [1; 0; -1] is an eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Because when I multiply P by v2, I get zero.\n\nWait, but I should double-check.\n\nWait, let me compute it again.\n\nv2 is [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nP * v2:\n\nRow 1: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = (1/sqrt(2) - 1/sqrt(2)) )= 0.\n\nRow 3: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSo P*v2 is indeed [0;0;0], which is 0*v2. So v2 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nOkay, so one of the eigenvalues is 0. Now, what about the other eigenvalues?\n\nWell, since P is a symmetric matrix, it has three real eigenvalues, and they should be orthogonal.\n\nAnother approach: Let's assume that the eigenvalues are 0, a, and -a, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the trace and determinant.\n\nThe trace of P is the sum of the diagonal elements. P's diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So the trace is zero. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.\n\nThe determinant of P: I think it's zero because when you have a matrix with a non-trivial kernel, the determinant is zero. Alternatively, since one of the eigenvalues is zero, the determinant is zero.\n\nSo the eigenvalues must sum to zero, and one is zero. So the other two eigenvalues must sum to zero. Let's call them \u03bb and -\u03bb.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, \u03bb, -\u03bb.\n\nTo find \u03bb, perhaps I can look for another eigenvector.\n\nLet's consider another vector, maybe v3 = [0,1,0]^T.\n\nCompute P * v3:\n\nRow 1: 0*0 + a*1 + 0*0 = a.\n\nRow 2: a*0 + 0*1 + a*0 = 0.\n\nRow 3: 0*0 + a*1 + 0*0 = a.\n\nSo P*v3 = [a; 0; a].\n\nWhich is a*(1, 0, 1)^T. Hmm, but that's not a scalar multiple of v3, which is [0;1;0].\n\nWait, but maybe I can find another vector. Let's try v4 = [1,1,1]^T.\n\nCompute P*v4:\n\nRow 1: 0*1 + a*1 +0*1 = a.\n\nRow 2: a*1 + 0*1 + a*1 = a(1+1) = 2a.\n\nRow 3: 0*1 + a*1 +0*1 = a.\n\nSo P*v4 = [a; 2a; a] = a*(1, 2, 1)^T.\n\nHmm, not a multiple of v4, so that's not an eigenvector.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that P is a symmetric matrix, so eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n\nWe already have v2 = [1;0;-1], which is an eigenvector for eigenvalue 0. So any eigenvector for another eigenvalue must be orthogonal to v2.\n\nLet me think: Suppose another eigenvector is [x, y, z]. Then, it must satisfy x*1 + 0*y + (-1)*z = 0 \u2192 x - z = 0 \u2192 x = z.\n\nSo vectors orthogonal to v2 satisfy x = z.\n\nLet me try a vector where x = z, say v5 = [1, y, 1]^T.\n\nLet me see if P*v5 is a multiple of v5.\n\nCompute P * v5:\n\nRow 1: 0*1 + a*y +0*1 = a y.\n\nRow 2: a*1 + 0*y + a*1 = a(1+1) = 2a.\n\nRow 3: 0*1 + a*y + 0*1 = a y.\n\nSo P*v5 = [a y; 2a; a y ].\n\nWe want this to be \u03bb * v5 = \u03bb [1; y; 1].\n\nSo:\n\na y = \u03bb * 1 \u2192 \u03bb = a y.\n\n2a = \u03bb y \u2192 2a = (a y) * y \u2192 2a = a y\u00b2 \u2192 y\u00b2 = 2 \u2192 y = sqrt(2) or -sqrt(2).\n\nAnd from the third component: a y = \u03bb * 1 \u2192 same as the first component.\n\nSo, substituting y^2=2:\n\nSo, we have \u03bb = a y.\n\nSo, let's see if this holds.\n\nBut wait, the vector v5 is [1, y, 1], and we have:\n\nP v5 = [ a y, 2a, a y ].\n\nWe want this to be \u03bb [1, y, 1].\n\nSo:\n\na y = \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb = a y.\n\n2a = \u03bb y \u2192 2a = a y * y \u2192 2a = a y\u00b2 \u2192 y\u00b2=2 \u2192 y=\u00b1\u221a2.\n\nSo, if y = \u221a2, then \u03bb = a * sqrt(2) = (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) )= 1.\n\nSimilarly, if y = -\u221a2, \u03bb = a*(-sqrt(2)) = -1.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo when we measure the observable P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.\n\nNow, the question is to find the probability that the measurement yields 0.\n\nSo we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and compute the square of the amplitude of the state vector in that eigenvector.\n\nEarlier, we found that [1;0;-1] is an eigenvector for eigenvalue 0. But wait, let me check: when I multiplied P by [1;0;-1], I got [0;0;0], so that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the eigenvectors are unique up to a scalar multiple. So any scalar multiple of [1;0;-1] is also an eigenvector.\n\nBut the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T. Let's call this vector |\u03c8>.\n\nWe need to compute the projection of |\u03c8> onto the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nThe formula for the probability is |\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2, where v is the normalized eigenvector.\n\nBut first, we need to normalize the eigenvector. The vector [1;0;-1] has a norm of sqrt(1\u00b2 +0\u00b2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2).\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1].\n\nSo let me compute the inner product between this eigenvector and |\u03c8>.\n\n\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] \u00b7 [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nThe dot product is (1*(-1)) + (0*2) + (-1 * 1) )= (-1) + 0 + (-1) )= -2.\n\nSo \u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-2) )= -2/sqrt(2) )= -sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude.\n\nSo | -sqrt(2) |\u00b2 = (sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 2.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, wait! Wait, the eigenvector I used is [1;0;-1], which is of length sqrt(2), so when normalized, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [1;0;-1]. The inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * [1,0,-1] \u00b7 [-1,2,1].\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nMultiply by 1/sqrt(2): (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But that's a probability of 2, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. The state vector must be normalized. Let me check the state vector given in the problem. The state is (-1, 2, 1)^T. Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. So when computing probabilities, I need to consider the normalized state.\n\nAh, that's a crucial point I missed. So the state is not normalized. So I should normalize it first.\n\nSo the state |\u03c8> is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T, and its norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1)^T.\n\nSo let me correct the calculation.\n\nThe eigenvector for 0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1;0;-1].\n\nThe normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1;2;1].\n\nCompute the inner product between the normalized eigenvector and the normalized state.\n\n\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] \u00b7 (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\n= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) ) [ (1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ]\n\n= (1/sqrt(12)) ) [ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ) ]\n\n= (1/sqrt(12)) * (-2)\n\n= (-2)/sqrt(12) )= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 )= 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/3.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the observable \\( P \\) and the given state vector \\( \\psi = (-1, 2, 1)^T \\). The observable \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \\( P \\)\nThe eigenvalues of \\( P \\) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\).

To normalize it, we compute its norm:\n\n\\[\n\\|v_0\\| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{v}_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Normalize the State Vector\nThe given state vector is \\( \\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\). Its norm is:\n\n\\[\n\\|\\psi\\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThe normalized state vector is:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{\\psi} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Probability of Measuring \\( 0 \\)\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \\( \\hat{\\psi} \\) onto \\( \\hat{v}_0 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector. Then there's an observable P, which is a matrix operator. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The question is asking for the probability that measuring this observable P will yield 0 at time t. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, okay. I remember from my quantum mechanics class that observables correspond to Hermitian matrices, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So the first thing I should do is find the eigenvalues of the matrix P because the possible results of measuring P will be these eigenvalues. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude associated with that eigenvalue.\n\nWait, but the matrix P might have 0 as one of its eigenvalues, and I need to find the probability of measuring 0. Alternatively, maybe 0 isn't an eigenvalue, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the observable P has eigenvalues, and when you measure, you get one of those. So the probability is calculated based on the projection of the state onto the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nSo, the steps I should take are:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues of P.\n2. For each eigenvalue, find its corresponding eigenvector.\n3. Compute the projection of the given state vector onto each eigenvector.\n4. The probability for each eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection.\n5. Specifically, find the probability for the eigenvalue 0.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to diagonalize P and express the state in terms of its eigenstates. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value, but since the question is about the probability of getting 0, I think I need to look for the eigenspace corresponding to 0 and then compute the probability.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute this without finding all eigenvectors. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix P is such that 0 is an eigenvalue, and the eigenvectors can be found easily.\n\nLet me first write down the matrix P. It's a 3x3 matrix.\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n]\n\nWait, let me write this correctly. Each row is as given. So row 1 is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], row 2 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and row 3 is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0].\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues of this matrix. To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (P - \u03bb I) and set it to zero.\n\nSo the matrix (P - \u03bb I) is:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ],\n[1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ]\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2   -\u03bb      1/\u221a2 |\n| 0      1/\u221a2   -\u03bb    |\n\nCalculating this determinant. Let's expand along the first row.\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ]) - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ]) + 0 * det(...)\n\nSo the first term is -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] = -\u03bb ( \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) )\n\nThe second term is - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)*0 ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation.\n\nWait, the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)*0 ] \n+ 0 * ... \n\nSo the first part is -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nThe second part is - (1/\u221a2) multiplied by the determinant of the submatrix after removing row 1 and column 2. The submatrix is:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, -\u03bb ]\n\nSo the determinant of this is (1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)*0 = -\u03bb / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the second term is - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb / sqrt(2)) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nThe third term is zero.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2.\n\nWhich is -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) ?\n\nWait, wait: -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2).\n\nThen, adding the second term which is + \u03bb/2.\n\nSo total determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2)) + (\u03bb/2) ) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is det = 0 \u2192 -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb^2 +1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb^2 ) = 0.\n\nSo the solutions are \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nAh, so the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo the problem asks for the probability of getting 0 when P is measured.\n\nSo I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb=0, and then compute the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is more than one-dimensional, but in this case, since the eigenvalues are distinct, each eigenspace is one-dimensional.\n\nWait, but let's see. For \u03bb=0, solving (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow 3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 same as row 1, so v2=0.\n\nSo the system reduces to v2=0 and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3. Let me write v1 as 'a', then v3 = -a, so the eigenvector is a*(1, 0, -1).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIf I set a=1, the vector is (1, 0, -1). Let's check if P times this vector equals 0.\n\nCompute P * (1,0,-1):\n\nRow 1: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = (1/sqrt(2)) - (1/sqrt(2)) ) = 0.\n\nRow 3: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSo yes, it's an eigenvector.\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is proportional to (1, 0, -1).\n\nWait, but wait, when I found the eigenvector, I got v1 = a, v3 = -a, and v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvector is a*(1, 0, -1). Let's normalize it.\n\nThe length squared is 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.\n\nNow, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote this as |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nWe need to find the projection of |\u03c8> onto the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, then square the magnitude to get the probability.\n\nThe eigenvector is |v0> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nThe inner product <v0 | \u03c8> is the conjugate transpose of |v0> multiplied by |\u03c8>.\n\nSo, compute <v0|\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) ) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/(sqrt(2)) ) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), so 2/(sqrt(2))=sqrt(2), but here it's -1/sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, no: 1/sqrt(2) is approximately 0.707, so 2/(sqrt(2)) is sqrt(2) (since sqrt(2) is about 1.414). So 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2), because (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nWait, 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) because sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's negative: (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nYes, because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So <v0|\u03c8> is -sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is the square of the magnitude of this amplitude. So | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's double-check the inner product.\n\nWait, the state vector is (-1, 2, 1), and the eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1.\n\nWhich is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2/sqrt(2)).\n\nBut 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), so this is -sqrt(2).\n\nSo the inner product is -sqrt(2), and the magnitude squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because probabilities can't be greater than 1. So I must have made a mistake in the normalization.\n\nWait, wait, did I normalize the eigenvector correctly?\n\nThe eigenvector is (1,0,-1). Its length squared is 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2, so the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nSo the amplitude is -sqrt(2), and the probability is (-sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nBut that's impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the state vector. The given state is (-1, 2, 1). Let me check if this is a normalized state.\n\nThe length squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the state vector has a length of sqrt(6). So it's not normalized.\n\nOh! That's a crucial point. So the state vector is not normalized. So when I compute the inner product, I need to consider that.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. But in this problem, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector. Then there's an observable P, which is a matrix operator. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The question is asking for the probability that measuring this observable P will yield 0 at time t. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, okay. I remember from my quantum mechanics class that observables correspond to Hermitian matrices, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So the first thing I should do is find the eigenvalues of the matrix P because the possible results of measuring P will be these eigenvalues. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude associated with that eigenvalue.\n\nWait, but the matrix P might have 0 as one of its eigenvalues, and I need to find the probability of measuring 0. Alternatively, maybe 0 isn't an eigenvalue, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the observable P has eigenvalues, and when you measure, you get one of those. So the probability is calculated based on the projection of the state onto the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nSo, the steps I should take are:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues of P.\n2. For each eigenvalue, find its corresponding eigenvector.\n3. Compute the projection of the given state vector onto each eigenvector.\n4. The probability for each eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection.\n5. Specifically, find the probability for the eigenvalue 0.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to diagonalize P and express the state in terms of its eigenstates. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value, but since the question is about the probability of getting 0, I think I need to look for the eigenspace corresponding to 0 and then compute the probability.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute this without finding all eigenvectors. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix P is such that 0 is an eigenvalue, and the eigenvectors can be found easily.\n\nLet me first write down the matrix P. It's a 3x3 matrix.\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],\n[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n]\n\nWait, let me write this correctly. Each row is as given. So row 1 is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], row 2 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and row 3 is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0].\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues of this matrix. To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (P - \u03bb I) and set it to zero.\n\nSo the matrix (P - \u03bb I) is:\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ],\n[1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb, 1/sqrt(2)],\n[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -\u03bb ]\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2   -\u03bb      1/\u221a2 |\n| 0      1/\u221a2   -\u03bb    |\n\nCalculating this determinant. Let's expand along the first row.\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ]) - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ]) + 0 * det(...)\n\nSo the first term is -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] = -\u03bb ( \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) )\n\nThe second term is - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)*0 ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation.\n\nWait, the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)*0 ] \n+ 0 * ... \n\nSo the first part is -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nThe second part is - (1/\u221a2) multiplied by the determinant of the submatrix after removing row 1 and column 2. The submatrix is:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, -\u03bb ]\n\nSo the determinant of this is (1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)*0 = -\u03bb / sqrt(2).\n\nSo the second term is - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb / sqrt(2)) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nThe third term is zero.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2.\n\nWhich is -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) ?\n\nWait, wait: -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb)(1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2).\n\nThen, adding the second term which is + \u03bb/2.\n\nSo total determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2)) + (\u03bb/2) ) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is det = 0 \u2192 -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb^2 +1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb^2 ) = 0.\n\nSo the solutions are \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nAh, so the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo the problem asks for the probability of getting 0 when P is measured.\n\nSo I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb=0, and then compute the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is more than one-dimensional, but in this case, since the eigenvalues are distinct, each eigenspace is one-dimensional.\n\nWait, but let's see. For \u03bb=0, solving (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow 3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 same as row 1, so v2=0.\n\nSo the system reduces to v2=0 and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, v3) with v1 = -v3. Let me write v1 as 'a', then v3 = -a, so the eigenvector is a*(1, 0, -1).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIf I set a=1, the vector is (1, 0, -1). Let's check if P times this vector equals 0.\n\nCompute P * (1,0,-1):\n\nRow 1: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = (1/sqrt(2)) - (1/sqrt(2)) ) = 0.\n\nRow 3: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSo yes, it's an eigenvector.\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is proportional to (1, 0, -1).\n\nWait, but wait, when I found the eigenvector, I got v1 = a, v3 = -a, and v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvector is a*(1, 0, -1). Let's normalize it.\n\nThe length squared is 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.\n\nNow, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote this as |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nWe need to find the projection of |\u03c8> onto the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, then square the magnitude to get the probability.\n\nThe eigenvector is |v0> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nThe inner product <v0 | \u03c8> is the conjugate transpose of |v0> multiplied by |\u03c8>.\n\nSo, compute <v0|\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) ) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/(sqrt(2)) ) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), so 2/(sqrt(2))=sqrt(2), but here it's -1/sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, no: 1/sqrt(2) is approximately 0.707, so 2/(sqrt(2)) is sqrt(2) (since sqrt(2) is about 1.414). So 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2), because (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nWait, 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) because sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's negative: (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nYes, because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So <v0|\u03c8> is -sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is the square of the magnitude of this amplitude. So | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's double-check the inner product.\n\nWait, the state vector is (-1, 2, 1), and the eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1.\n\nWhich is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2/sqrt(2)).\n\nBut 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), so this is -sqrt(2).\n\nSo the inner product is -sqrt(2), and the magnitude squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because probabilities can't be greater than 1. So I must have made a mistake in the normalization.\n\nWait, wait, did I normalize the eigenvector correctly?\n\nThe eigenvector is (1,0,-1). Its length squared is 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2, so the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nSo the amplitude is -sqrt(2), and the probability is (-sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nBut that's impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the state vector. The given state is (-1, 2, 1). Let me check if this is a normalized state.\n\nThe length squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the state vector has a length of sqrt(6). So it's not normalized.\n\nOh! That's a crucial point. So the state vector is not normalized. So when I compute the inner product, I need to consider that.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. But in this problem, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1). So perhaps I should normalize it before proceeding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the inner product and then divide by the norm squared of the state vector.\n\nWait, let's proceed correctly.\n\nThe general formula for the probability is |<v|\u03c8>|^2 divided by |\u03c8|^2, because the state vector might not be normalized.\n\nWait, no, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be a unit vector, but here the given state is (-1, 2, 1), which has a norm of sqrt(6). So perhaps the state is given as a non-normalized vector, and I need to normalize it first.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about normalization, so perhaps I should proceed by taking the given vector as is, but then probabilities will be based on the inner product squared divided by the norm squared.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state is already normalized, but let me check.\n\nWait, the norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1) = sqrt(6) \u2248 2.449. So the state is not normalized.\n\nSo to compute the probability correctly, I should normalize the state vector first.\n\nSo, let's compute the normalized state vector.\n\nThe norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1).\n\nSo |\u03c8_normalized> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nNow, the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is |v0> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nThe inner product is <v0 | \u03c8_normalized> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nSo that's [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ].\n\nAdding these together: (-2)/(sqrt(12)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(12) as 2*sqrt(3), so this becomes (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 1/3 is one of the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A) 2/3, B)1, C)1/3, D)sqrt(2/3).\n\nSo the answer should be option C) 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in normalization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the inner product without normalizing the state, but then the probability would be |<v0|\u03c8>|^2 divided by |\u03c8|^2, since the state is not normalized.\n\nWait, that's another approach.

So it's a 3x1 matrix, maybe something like \u03c8 = [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has its first row as [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row as [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row as [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So I should write that out:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to find the probability that measuring this observable P will yield 0. Right, in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability is related to the eigenvectors.\n\nWait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. So, in this case, P is the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues. The question is about the probability of getting 0, so I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the probability based on the state vector.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the expectation value of P is given by \u03c8\u2020 P \u03c8, but that's not directly the probability. Wait, no, the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because P is a Hermitian matrix, it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.\n\nLet me think about the matrix P. Let me write it out more clearly:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nWait, that looks symmetric. So P is a Hermitian matrix because it's equal to its transpose. So yes, it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues.\n\nNow, I'm trying to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's compute the characteristic equation, which is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo, the matrix P - \u03bb I would be:\n\nRow 1: -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb\n\nThe determinant of this 3x3 matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] + 0 [ ... ] \n\nWait, perhaps expanding the determinant along the first row would be easier.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ]) \n- (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] )\n+ 0 * det(...)\n\nSo, let's compute each minor.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] = -\u03bb * [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) * ( -\u03bb / \u221a2 ) ) = - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (\u03bb) / 2.\n\nWait, wait, let me recheck. The minor for the (1,2) element is the determinant of the submatrix when we remove row 1 and column 2. So that's:\n\nRow 2 and 3 of P - \u03bb I, columns 1 and 3. So the submatrix is:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, -\u03bb]\n\nWait, no. The (1,2) element is in row 1, column 2. So when we remove row 1 and column 2, the submatrix is:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo the submatrix is:\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n[0, -\u03bb]\n\nSo the determinant of this is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) = -\u03bb/(\u221a2).\n\nSo the minor is -\u03bb/(\u221a2), and since it's the (1,2) element, the cofactor is (-1)^(1+2) * minor = (-1)^3 * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(\u221a2).\n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) multiplied by \u03bb/(\u221a2). Wait, no, wait. The formula for the determinant expansion is sum_{j=1 to n} (-1)^{i+j} a_ij * M_ij, where M_ij is the minor.\n\nIn this case, the first row is i=1, j varies. So for j=2, a_12 is 1/\u221a2, and the minor is the determinant we just found, which is -\u03bb/(\u221a2). So the cofactor is (-1)^(1+2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (-1)^3 * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) )= (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(\u221a2).\n\nSo the term is a_12 * cofactor = (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo putting it all together, the determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) ) + (\u03bb/2) ) = 0.\n\nWait, no: the first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2), the second term is (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] ?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should write the matrix P and compute its trace and see if there's a pattern.\n\nThe trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.\n\nThe determinant of P is the product of the eigenvalues. Let me compute det(P). P is:\n\n0 1/\u221a2 0\n1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2\n0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nComputing det(P):\n\n0 * (0*0 - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2)) ) - (1/\u221a2) * ( (1/\u221a2)(0) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) + 0 * ... \n\nWait, expanding along the first row.\n\n= 0 * minor - (1/\u221a2) * minor + 0 * minor.\n\nThe minor for the (1,2) element is the determinant of the submatrix when we remove row 1 and column 2:\n\nSubmatrix:\n1/\u221a2 1/\u221a2\n0 0\n\nSo the determinant is (1/\u221a2 * 0) - (1/\u221a2 * 0) )= 0.\n\nSo the determinant is 0 - (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0 = 0.\n\nHmm, but the determinant of P is zero, so one of the eigenvalues is zero. So the eigenvalues are a, b, 0, and a + b + 0 = 0 (trace is zero), so a + b = 0. So the eigenvalues are sqrt(something), sqrt(something else), and 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues by assuming the eigenvectors. Let me think about possible eigenvectors.\n\nLooking at P, perhaps the eigenvectors are symmetric in some way. Let me try a vector [1, 0, 1]^T. Let's see what P does to it.\n\nP * [1; 0; 1] = first row: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*1 = 0.\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*1 = 2/\u221a2 = sqrt(2).\n\nThird row: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*1 = 0.\n\nSo P * [1;0;1] = [0; sqrt(2); 0]. Hmm, that's not a multiple of [1;0;1], so that's not an eigenvector.\n\nWait, maybe try [1, 0, -1]^T. Let's compute P * [1;0;-1].\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2 )= 0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSo P * [1;0;-1] = [0;0;0] = 0 * [1;0;-1], so that's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nAh, okay, so that's one eigenvector: v1 = [1;0;-1]. So that's for eigenvalue 0.\n\nNow, we can look for other eigenvectors. Let's try a vector where the first and third components are zero, like [0, a, 0]^T. Let's see what P does.\n\nP * [0; a; 0] = first component: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*a + 0*0 = a/\u221a2.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*a + (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*a + 0*0 = a/\u221a2.\n\nSo P * [0; a; 0] = [a/\u221a2; 0; a/\u221a2] = [1; 0; 1] * a/\u221a2.\n\nSo to be an eigenvector, [a;0;0] must be a scalar multiple of [1;0;1]. So the vector [0; a; 0] would require that a/\u221a2 = \u03bb * a, assuming a \u2260 0.\n\nWait, but wait, if I have [0; a; 0], then P * [0; a; 0] = [a/\u221a2; 0; a/\u221a2], which would need to be \u03bb times [0; a; 0]. But that's only possible if a/\u221a2 = 0, which would make a=0. So that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that the trace is zero, so sum of eigenvalues is zero. And the determinant is zero, so one eigenvalue is zero.\n\nSo the other eigenvalues must be \u03bb and -\u03bb, so that \u03bb + (-\u03bb) + 0 = 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb, -\u03bb, 0.\n\nNow, the trace is zero, which we have.\n\nThe determinant is \u03bb * (-\u03bb) * 0 = 0, which matches.\n\nNow, what is \u03bb? Let's find the other eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues can be found by noticing that P^2 has some pattern.\n\nLet me compute P squared.\n\nP^2 = P * P.\n\nLet me compute each element:\n\nFirst row of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0].\n\nSo (P^2)[1][1] = 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = (1/2).\n\nSimilarly, (P^2)[1][2] = 0* (1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) )= 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute each element.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by considering that P is a symmetric matrix and thus can be diagonalized, and perhaps its square is something familiar.\n\nWait, another idea: since the trace is zero, and one eigenvalue is zero, the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues would be the trace of P^2.\n\nLet me compute trace(P^2). P squared is P multiplied by P.\n\nCompute each diagonal element:\n\n(P^2)[1][1] = (0)(0) + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + (0)(0) ) = 1/2.\n\n(P^2)[2][2] = (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + (0)(0) + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.\n\n(P^2)[3][3] = (0)(0) + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + (0)(0) ) = 1/2.\n\nSo the trace of P^2 is 1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 2.\n\nThe trace of P^2 is equal to the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues. So if the eigenvalues are \u03bb, -\u03bb, 0, then their squares are \u03bb\u00b2, \u03bb\u00b2, 0. So sum is 2\u03bb\u00b2 = 2 \u21d2 \u03bb\u00b2 = 1 \u21d2 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 1, -1, 0.\n\nSo the possible measurement outcomes are 1, -1, and 0.\n\nNow, the state vector is given as \u03c8 = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, meaning that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1. Let me check that.\n\nSum = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized, but perhaps that's okay for this problem, or perhaps I should normalize it first.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state should be a unit vector. So perhaps the given vector is not normalized, so I need to normalize it before proceeding.\n\nSo the normalized state would be \u03c8_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1].\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the state is given as [-1,2,1], and I think the probabilities are based on the components of this vector in the eigenbasis of P. So perhaps I can proceed without normalizing, but the probabilities would be calculated based on the projections onto the eigenvectors.\n\nSo, for each eigenvalue, we have the corresponding eigenvector. We found that one eigenvector is [1; 0; -1], which corresponds to eigenvalue 0.\n\nNow, the other eigenvectors correspond to eigenvalues 1 and -1.\n\nWait, let's find the eigenvectors for eigenvalues 1 and -1.\n\nLet's start with eigenvalue 1. So solving (P - I) v = 0.\n\nP - I is:\n\n[-1, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n[1/\u221a2, -1, 1/\u221a2]\n[0, 1/\u221a2, -1]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n- v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v1 = (1/\u221a2) v2\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 - v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0\n\n(1/\u221a2) v2 - v3 = 0 \u2192 v3 = (1/\u221a2) v2\n\nFrom first equation: v1 = (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nFrom third equation: v3 = (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\n(1/\u221a2)( (1/\u221a2) v2 ) - v2 + (1/\u221a2)( (1/\u221a2) v2 ) ) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = 1/2.\n\nSo:\n\n(1/2) v2 - v2 + (1/2) v2 ) = 0.\n\nAdding them: (1/2 -1 + 1/2) v2 = (-0) v2 = 0. So any v2 is allowed, as long as v1 and v3 are as per above.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [1/\u221a2 v2, v2, 1/\u221a2 v2 ].\n\nLet me choose v2 = \u221a2 to make it simpler. Then v1 = (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 =1, v3= (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 =1.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [1, \u221a2, 1]. But wait, I should check that this works in the equations.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me do this again. If v2 is \u221a2, then v1 = (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 = 1. v3 = (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 =1.\n\nSo the vector is [1, \u221a2, 1].\n\nBut let me plug this into the second equation of (P-I)v=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2)*v1 - v2 + (1/\u221a2)*v3 = 0.\n\nSubstituting v1=1, v2=\u221a2, v3=1:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(1) - \u221a2 + (1/\u221a2)(1) = (2/\u221a2) - \u221a2.\n\nBut 2/\u221a2 = \u221a2, so \u221a2 - \u221a2 = 0. So yes, it works.\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=1 is [1, \u221a2, 1]. But perhaps we can normalize it.\n\nThe norm squared is 1^2 + (\u221a2)^2 + 1^2 =1 +2 +1=4. So the normalized eigenvector is [1, \u221a2, 1]/2.\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb=-1, the eigenvector would be [1, -\u221a2, 1]/2, perhaps. Let me check.\n\nWait, when we solve (P + I) v =0.\n\nP + I:\n\n[1, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n[1/\u221a2, 1, 1/\u221a2]\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 1]\n\nThe equations:\n\nv1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v1 = -(1/\u221a2) v2.\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0.\n\n(1/\u221a2) v2 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v3 = -(1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\n(1/\u221a2)( - (1/\u221a2) v2 ) + v2 + (1/\u221a2)( -(1/\u221a2) v2 ) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a2 v2 ) = - (1/2) v2.\n\nSimilarly, the third term is (1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a2 v2 ) = - (1/2) v2.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n- (1/2) v2 + v2 - (1/2) v2 = (-1/2 + 1 -1/2) v2 = ( (-1 + 2 -1)/2 ) v2 = (0/2) v2 = 0.\n\nSo any v2 is allowed. Let's choose v2 = \u221a2 again. Then v1= -(1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 = -1, and v3= -(1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 = -1.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ -1, \u221a2, -1 ].\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check. Let me compute P * v where v = [ -1, \u221a2, -1 ].\n\nP * v = first component: 0*(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(\u221a2) + 0*(-1) ) = (1/\u221a2 * \u221a2) =1.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)(-1) )= (-1/\u221a2) + (-1/\u221a2) )= -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThird component: 0*(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(\u221a2) + 0*(-1) )= (1/\u221a2 * \u221a2 )=1.\n\nSo P * v = [1, -\u221a2, 1].\n\nBut the expected result for eigenvalue -1 is -1 * v = [1, -\u221a2, 1]. Which matches. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are:\n\nFor \u03bb=1: [1, \u221a2, 1] (needs normalization).\n\nFor \u03bb=-1: [-1, \u221a2, -1 ] (also needs normalization).\n\nAnd for \u03bb=0: [1, 0, -1 ].\n\nNow, the state vector is \u03c8 = [-1, 2, 1]^T. But we need to express this in terms of the eigenvectors of P.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of \u03c8 with each eigenvector, and then square the absolute value to get the probability.\n\nBut first, I need to normalize the eigenvectors. Let's compute the normalization factors.\n\nFor \u03bb=1: The vector is [1, \u221a2, 1]. The norm squared is 1^2 + (\u221a2)^2 +1^2=1 +2 +1=4. So the normalized eigenvector is [1/2, \u221a2/2, 1/2 ].\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb=-1: the vector is [-1, \u221a2, -1]. Norm squared is (-1)^2 + (\u221a2)^2 + (-1)^2=1 +2 +1=4. Normalized to [-1/2, \u221a2/2, -1/2 ].\n\nAnd for \u03bb=0: the vector is [1, 0, -1]. Norm squared is 1 +0 +1=2. So normalized to [1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2 ].\n\nNow, the state \u03c8 is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me write this as a column vector: \u03c8 = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nBut wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. So let's compute the norm of \u03c8.\n\n||\u03c8||^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is \u03c8_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nBut for the purpose of finding probabilities, perhaps I can compute the inner products without normalization because the probabilities are proportional to the squares.\n\nWait, no, probabilities are based on the inner product with the eigenvectors, normalized. So I think I need to compute the inner product of \u03c8 with each eigenvector, then square the absolute value, and then divide by the norm of \u03c8 squared.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probabilities as the squared modulus of (eigenvector\u2020 \u03c8) divided by (\u03c8\u2020 \u03c8).\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me denote the eigenvectors as:\n\nv0 = [1/\u221a2; 0; -1/\u221a2 ] (for \u03bb=0).\n\nv1 = [1/2; \u221a2/2; 1/2 ] (for \u03bb=1).\n\nv_minus1 = [ -1/2; \u221a2/2; -1/2 ] (for \u03bb=-1).\n\nNow, the state \u03c8 is [-1; 2; 1]. Let's compute the inner product of \u03c8 with each eigenvector.\n\nFirst, the inner product with v0:\n\n\u27e8v0 | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) ) = (-1/\u221a2) + 0 + (-1/\u221a2) )= -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThe probability for eigenvalue 0 is |\u27e8v0 | \u03c8\u27e9|^2 = ( -\u221a2 )^2 = 2.\n\nBut wait, no, because \u03c8 is not normalized. So the actual probability is |\u27e8v0 | \u03c8\u27e9|^2 / ||\u03c8||^2.\n\nBecause the probabilities must sum to 1, considering \u03c8 is not a unit vector. Alternatively, perhaps I should normalize \u03c8 before computing the inner products.\n\nSo let me compute the inner products correctly.\n\nCompute each inner product:\n\na) v0 \u00b7 \u03c8 = (1/\u221a2)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) )= (-1/\u221a2) + 0 + (-1/\u221a2) )= (-2/\u221a2) = -\u221a2.\n\nb) v1 \u00b7 \u03c8 = (1/2)(-1) + (\u221a2/2)(2) + (1/2)(1) )= (-1/2) + (2\u221a2/2) + (1/2) )= ( (-1/2 + 1/2) ) + \u221a2 )= 0 + \u221a2 = \u221a2.\n\nc) v_minus1 \u00b7 \u03c8 = (-1/2)(-1) + (\u221a2/2)(2) + (-1/2)(1) )= (1/2) + (2\u221a2/2) + (-1/2) )= (1/2 -1/2) ) + \u221a2 )= 0 + \u221a2 = \u221a2.\n\nNow, the norm of \u03c8 is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(6).\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n\nP(0) = |v0 \u00b7 \u03c8|^2 / ||\u03c8||^2 = ( (\u221a2)^2 ) / 6 = 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nSimilarly, P(1) = |v1 \u00b7 \u03c8|^2 / 6 = ( (\u221a2)^2 ) /6 = 2/6 =1/3.\n\nAnd P(-1) = |v_minus1 \u00b7 \u03c8|^2 /6 = ( (\u221a2)^2 ) /6 = 2/6=1/3.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the probabilities are each 1/3. So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the inner products.\n\nFor v0 \u00b7 \u03c8:\n\n(1/\u221a2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/\u221a2)*1 = (-1 -1)/\u221a2 = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2. The absolute square is (\u221a2)^2 = 2. Divided by 6, gives 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nFor v1 \u00b7 \u03c8:\n\n(1/2)*(-1) + (\u221a2/2)*2 + (1/2)*1 = (-1/2) + (2\u221a2/2) + (1/2) )= (-1/2 +1/2) ) + \u221a2 = 0 + \u221a2 = \u221a2. Absolute square is 2. So 2/6=1/3.\n\nFor v_minus1 \u00b7 \u03c8:\n\n(-1/2)*(-1) + (\u221a2/2)*2 + (-1/2)*1 = (1/2) + (2\u221a2/2) + (-1/2) )= (1/2 -1/2) ) + \u221a2 = 0 + \u221a2 = \u221a2. Absolute square is 2. So 2/6=1/3.\n\nSo all three probabilities are 1/3 each. So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's like a vector in three-dimensional space. I think in quantum mechanics, this would be a state vector, probably a column vector in Dirac notation, right? So it's a 3x1 matrix, maybe something like \u03c8 = [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has its first row as [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row as [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row as [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So I should write that out:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to find the probability that measuring this observable P will yield 0. Right, in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability is related to the eigenvectors.\n\nWait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. So, in this case, P is the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues. The question is about the probability of getting 0, so I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the probability based on the state vector.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the expectation value of P is given by \u03c8\u2020 P \u03c8, but that's not directly the probability. Wait, no, the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because P is a Hermitian matrix, it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.\n\nLet me think about the matrix P. Let me write it out more clearly:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nWait, that looks symmetric. So P is a Hermitian matrix because it's equal to its transpose. So yes, it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues.\n\nNow, I'm trying to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's compute the characteristic equation, which is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo, the matrix P - \u03bb I would be:\n\nRow 1: -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb\n\nThe determinant of this 3x3 matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] + 0 [ ... ] \n\nWait, perhaps expanding the determinant along the first row would be easier.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ]) \n- (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] )\n+ 0 * det(...)\n\nSo, let's compute each minor.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] = -\u03bb * [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ) ] = - (1/\u221a2) * ( -\u03bb / \u221a2 ) ) = - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (\u03bb) / 2.\n\nWait, wait, let me recheck. The minor for the (1,2) element is the determinant of the submatrix when we remove row 1 and column 2. So that's:\n\nRow 2 and 3 of P - \u03bb I, columns 1 and 3. So the submatrix is:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, -\u03bb]\n\nWait, no. The (1,2) element is in row 1, column 2. So when we remove row 1 and column 2, the submatrix is:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo the submatrix is:\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n[0, -\u03bb]\n\nSo the determinant of this is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) = -\u03bb/(\u221a2).\n\nSo the minor is -\u03bb/(\u221a2), and since it's the (1,2) element, the cofactor is (-1)^(1+2) * minor = (-1)^3 * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(\u221a2).\n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) multiplied by \u03bb/(\u221a2). Wait, no, wait. The formula for the determinant expansion is sum_{j=1 to n} (-1)^{i+j} a_ij * M_ij, where M_ij is the minor.\n\nIn this case, the first row is i=1, j varies. So for j=2, a_12 is 1/\u221a2, and the minor is the determinant we just found, which is -\u03bb/(\u221a2). So the cofactor is (-1)^(1+2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = (-1)^3 * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) )= (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(\u221a2).\n\nSo the term is a_12 * cofactor = (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo putting it all together, the determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) ) + (\u03bb/2) ) = 0.\n\nWait, no: the first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2), the second term is (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] ?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should write the matrix P and compute its trace and see if there's a pattern.\n\nThe trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.\n\nThe determinant of P is the product of the eigenvalues. Let me compute det(P). P is:\n\n0 1/\u221a2 0\n1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2\n0 1/\u221a2 0\n\nComputing det(P):\n\n0 * (0*0 - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2)) ) - (1/\u221a2) * ( (1/\u221a2)(0) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) + 0 * ... \n\nWait, expanding along the first row.\n\n= 0 * minor - (1/\u221a2) * minor + 0 * minor.\n\nThe minor for the (1,2) element is the determinant of the submatrix when we remove row 1 and column 2:\n\nSubmatrix:\n1/\u221a2 1/\u221a2\n0 0\n\nSo the determinant is (1/\u221a2 * 0) - (1/\u221a2 * 0) )= 0.\n\nSo the determinant is 0 - (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0 = 0.\n\nHmm, but the determinant of P is zero, so one of the eigenvalues is zero. So the eigenvalues are a, b, 0, and a + b + 0 = 0 (trace is zero), so a + b = 0. So the eigenvalues are sqrt(something), sqrt(something else), and 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues by assuming the eigenvectors. Let me think about possible eigenvectors.\n\nLooking at P, perhaps the eigenvectors are symmetric in some way. Let me try a vector [1, 0, 1]^T. Let's see what P does to it.\n\nP * [1; 0; 1] = first row: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*1 = 0.\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*1 = 2/\u221a2 = sqrt(2).\n\nThird row: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*1 = 0.\n\nSo P * [1;0;1] = [0; sqrt(2); 0]. Hmm, that's not a multiple of [1;0;1], so that's not an eigenvector.\n\nWait, maybe try [1, 0, -1]^T. Let's compute P * [1;0;-1].\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2 )= 0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSo P * [1;0;-1] = [0;0;0] = 0 * [1;0;-1], so that's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nAh, okay, so that's one eigenvector: v1 = [1;0;-1]. So that's for eigenvalue 0.\n\nNow, we can look for other eigenvectors. Let's try a vector where the first and third components are zero, like [0, a, 0]^T. Let's see what P does.\n\nP * [0; a; 0] = first component: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*a + 0*0 = a/\u221a2.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*a + (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*a + 0*0 = a/\u221a2.\n\nSo P * [0; a; 0] = [a/\u221a2; 0; a/\u221a2] = [1; 0; 1] * a/\u221a2.\n\nSo to be an eigenvector, [a;0;0] must be a scalar multiple of [1;0;1]. So the vector [0; a; 0] would require that a/\u221a2 = \u03bb * a, assuming a \u2260 0.\n\nWait, but wait, if I have [0; a; 0], then P * [0; a; 0] = [a/\u221a2; 0; a/\u221a2], which would need to be \u03bb times [0; a; 0]. But that's only possible if a/\u221a2 = 0, which would make a=0. So that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that the trace is zero, so sum of eigenvalues is zero. And the determinant is zero, so one eigenvalue is zero.\n\nSo the other eigenvalues must be \u03bb and -\u03bb, so that \u03bb + (-\u03bb) + 0 = 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb, -\u03bb, 0.\n\nNow, the trace is zero, which we have.\n\nThe determinant is \u03bb * (-\u03bb) * 0 = 0, which matches.\n\nNow, what is \u03bb? Let's find the other eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues can be found by noticing that P^2 has some pattern.\n\nLet me compute P squared.\n\nP^2 = P * P.\n\nLet me compute each element:\n\nFirst row of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0].\n\nSo (P^2)[1][1] = 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = (1/2).\n\nSimilarly, (P^2)[1][2] = 0* (1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) )= 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute each element.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by considering that P is a symmetric matrix and thus can be diagonalized, and perhaps its square is something familiar.\n\nWait, another idea: since the trace is zero, and one eigenvalue is zero, the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues would be the trace of P^2.\n\nLet me compute trace(P^2). P squared is P multiplied by P.\n\nCompute each diagonal element:\n\n(P^2)[1][1] = (0)(0) + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + (0)(0) ) = 1/2.\n\n(P^2)[2][2] = (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + (0)(0) + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.\n\n(P^2)[3][3] = (0)(0) + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + (0)(0) ) = 1/2.\n\nSo the trace of P^2 is 1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 2.\n\nThe trace of P^2 is equal to the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues. So if the eigenvalues are \u03bb, -\u03bb, 0, then their squares are \u03bb\u00b2, \u03bb\u00b2, 0. So sum is 2\u03bb\u00b2 = 2 \u21d2 \u03bb\u00b2 = 1 \u21d2 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 1, -1, 0.\n\nSo the possible measurement outcomes are 1, -1, and 0.\n\nNow, the state vector is given as \u03c8 = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, meaning that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1. Let me check that.\n\nSum = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized, but perhaps that's okay for this problem, or perhaps I should normalize it first.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state should be a unit vector. So perhaps the given vector is not normalized, so I need to normalize it before proceeding.\n\nSo the normalized state would be \u03c8_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1].\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the state is given as [-1,2,1], and I think the probabilities are based on the components of this vector in the eigenbasis of P. So perhaps I can proceed without normalizing, but the probabilities would be calculated based on the projections onto the eigenvectors.\n\nSo, for each eigenvalue, we have the corresponding eigenvector. We found that one eigenvector is [1; 0; -1], which corresponds to eigenvalue 0.\n\nNow, the other eigenvectors correspond to eigenvalues 1 and -1.\n\nWait, let's find the eigenvectors for eigenvalues 1 and -1.\n\nLet's start with eigenvalue 1. So solving (P - I) v = 0.\n\nP - I is:\n\n[-1, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n[1/\u221a2, -1, 1/\u221a2]\n[0, 1/\u221a2, -1]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n- v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v1 = (1/\u221a2) v2\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 - v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0\n\n(1/\u221a2) v2 - v3 = 0 \u2192 v3 = (1/\u221a2) v2\n\nFrom first equation: v1 = (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nFrom third equation: v3 = (1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\n(1/\u221a2)( (1/\u221a2) v2 ) - v2 + (1/\u221a2)( (1/\u221a2) v2 ) ) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = 1/2.\n\nSo:\n\n(1/2) v2 - v2 + (1/2) v2 ) = 0.\n\nAdding them: (1/2 -1 + 1/2) v2 = (-0) v2 = 0. So any v2 is allowed, as long as v1 and v3 are as per above.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [1/\u221a2 v2, v2, 1/\u221a2 v2 ].\n\nLet me choose v2 = \u221a2 to make it simpler. Then v1 = (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 =1, v3= (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 =1.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [1, \u221a2, 1]. But wait, I should check that this works in the equations.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me do this again. If v2 is \u221a2, then v1 = (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 = 1. v3 = (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 =1.\n\nSo the vector is [1, \u221a2, 1].\n\nBut let me plug this into the second equation of (P-I)v=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2)*v1 - v2 + (1/\u221a2)*v3 = 0.\n\nSubstituting v1=1, v2=\u221a2, v3=1:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(1) - \u221a2 + (1/\u221a2)(1) = (2/\u221a2) - \u221a2.\n\nBut 2/\u221a2 = \u221a2, so \u221a2 - \u221a2 = 0. So yes, it works.\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=1 is [1, \u221a2, 1]. But perhaps we can normalize it.\n\nThe norm squared is 1^2 + (\u221a2)^2 + 1^2 =1 +2 +1=4. So the normalized eigenvector is [1, \u221a2, 1]/2.\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb=-1, the eigenvector would be [1, -\u221a2, 1]/2, perhaps. Let me check.\n\nWait, when we solve (P + I) v =0.\n\nP + I:\n\n[1, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n[1/\u221a2, 1, 1/\u221a2]\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 1]\n\nThe equations:\n\nv1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v1 = -(1/\u221a2) v2.\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0.\n\n(1/\u221a2) v2 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v3 = -(1/\u221a2) v2.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\n(1/\u221a2)( - (1/\u221a2) v2 ) + v2 + (1/\u221a2)( -(1/\u221a2) v2 ) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a2 v2 ) = - (1/2) v2.\n\nSimilarly, the third term is (1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a2 v2 ) = - (1/2) v2.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n- (1/2) v2 + v2 - (1/2) v2 = (-1/2 + 1 -1/2) v2 = ( (-1 + 2 -1)/2 ) v2 = (0/2) v2 = 0.\n\nSo any v2 is allowed. Let's choose v2 = \u221a2 again. Then v1= -(1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 = -1, and v3= -(1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 = -1.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ -1, \u221a2, -1 ].\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check. Let me compute P * v where v = [ -1, \u221a2, -1 ].\n\nP * v = first component: 0*(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(\u221a2) + 0*(-1) ) = (1/\u221a2 * \u221a2) =1.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)(-1) )= (-1/\u221a2) + (-1/\u221a2) )= -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThird component: 0*(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(\u221a2) + 0*(-1) )= (1/\u221a2 * \u221a2 )=1.\n\nSo P * v = [1, -\u221a2, 1].\n\nBut the expected result for eigenvalue -1 is -1 * v = [1, -\u221a2, 1]. Which matches. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are:\n\nFor \u03bb=1: [1, \u221a2, 1] (needs normalization).\n\nFor \u03bb=-1: [-1, \u221a2, -1 ] (also needs normalization).\n\nAnd for \u03bb=0: [1, 0, -1 ].\n\nNow, the state vector is \u03c8 = [-1, 2, 1]^T. But we need to express this in terms of the eigenvectors of P.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of \u03c8 with each eigenvector, and then square the absolute value to get the probability.\n\nBut first, I need to normalize the eigenvectors. Let's compute the normalization factors.\n\nFor \u03bb=1: The vector is [1, \u221a2, 1]. The norm squared is 1^2 + (\u221a2)^2 +1^2=1 +2 +1=4. So the normalized eigenvector is [1/2, \u221a2/2, 1/2 ].\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb=-1: the vector is [-1, \u221a2, -1]. Norm squared is (-1)^2 + (\u221a2)^2 + (-1)^2=1 +2 +1=4. Normalized to [-1/2, \u221a2/2, -1/2 ].\n\nAnd for \u03bb=0: the vector is [1, 0, -1]. Norm squared is 1 +0 +1=2. So normalized to [1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2 ].\n\nNow, the state \u03c8 is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me write this as a column vector: \u03c8 = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nBut wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. So let's compute the norm of \u03c8.\n\n||\u03c8||^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is \u03c8_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nBut for the purpose of finding probabilities, perhaps I can compute the inner products without normalization because the probabilities are proportional to the squares.\n\nWait, no, probabilities are based on the inner product with the eigenvectors, normalized. So I think I need to compute the inner product of \u03c8 with each eigenvector, then square the absolute value, and then divide by the norm of \u03c8 squared.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probabilities as the squared modulus of (eigenvector\u2020 \u03c8) divided by (\u03c8\u2020 \u03c8).\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me denote the eigenvectors as:\n\nv0 = [1/\u221a2; 0; -1/\u221a2 ] (for \u03bb=0).\n\nv1 = [1/2; \u221a2/2; 1/2 ] (for \u03bb=1).\n\nv_minus1 = [ -1/2; \u221a2/2; -1/2 ] (for \u03bb=-1).\n\nNow, the state \u03c8 is [-1; 2; 1]. Let's compute the inner product of \u03c8 with each eigenvector.\n\nFirst, the inner product with v0:\n\n\u27e8v0 | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) ) = (-1/\u221a2) + 0 + (-1/\u221a2) )= -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThe probability for eigenvalue 0 is |\u27e8v0 | \u03c8\u27e9|^2 = ( -\u221a2 )^2 = 2.\n\nBut wait, no, because \u03c8 is not normalized. So the actual probability is |\u27e8v0 | \u03c8\u27e9|^2 / ||\u03c8||^2.\n\nBecause the probabilities must sum to 1, considering \u03c8 is not a unit vector. Alternatively, perhaps I should normalize \u03c8 before computing the inner products.\n\nSo let me compute the inner products correctly.\n\nCompute each inner product:\n\na) v0 \u00b7 \u03c8 = (1/\u221a2)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) )= (-1/\u221a2) + 0 + (-1/\u221a2) )= (-2/\u221a2) = -\u221a2.\n\nb) v1 \u00b7 \u03c8 = (1/2)(-1) + (\u221a2/2)(2) + (1/2)(1) )= (-1/2) + (2\u221a2/2) + (1/2) )= ( (-1/2 + 1/2) ) + \u221a2 )= 0 + \u221a2 = \u221a2.\n\nc) v_minus1 \u00b7 \u03c8 = (-1/2)(-1) + (\u221a2/2)(2) + (-1/2)(1) )= (1/2) + (2\u221a2/2) + (-1/2) )= (1/2 -1/2) ) + \u221a2 )= 0 + \u221a2 = \u221a2.\n\nNow, the norm of \u03c8 is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(6).\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n\nP(0) = |v0 \u00b7 \u03c8|^2 / ||\u03c8||^2 = ( (\u221a2)^2 ) / 6 = 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nSimilarly, P(1) = |v1 \u00b7 \u03c8|^2 / 6 = ( (\u221a2)^2 ) /6 = 2/6 =1/3.\n\nAnd P(-1) = |v_minus1 \u00b7 \u03c8|^2 /6 = ( (\u221a2)^2 ) /6 = 2/6=1/3.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the probabilities are each 1/3. So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the inner products.\n\nFor v0 \u00b7 \u03c8:\n\n(1/\u221a2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/\u221a2)*1 = (-1 -1)/\u221a2 = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2. The absolute square is (\u221a2)^2 = 2. Divided by 6, gives 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nFor v1 \u00b7 \u03c8:\n\n(1/2)*(-1) + (\u221a2/2)*2 + (1/2)*1 = (-1/2) + (2\u221a2/2) + (1/2) )= (-1/2 +1/2) ) + \u221a2 = 0 + \u221a2 = \u221a2. Absolute square is 2. So 2/6=1/3.\n\nFor v_minus1 \u00b7 \u03c8:\n\n(-1/2)*(-1) + (\u221a2/2)*2 + (-1/2)*1 = (1/2) + (2\u221a2/2) + (-1/2) )= (1/2 -1/2) ) + \u221a2 = 0 + \u221a2 = \u221a2. Absolute square is 2. So 2/6=1/3.\n\nSo all three probabilities are 1/3 each. So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) and obtaining the eigenvalue \\( 0 \\) for the given state vector \\( \\psi = [-1, 2, 1]^T \\). The observable \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \\( P \\)\nThe eigenvalues of \\( P \\) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\). The eigenvalues are found to be \\( 1, -1, \\) and \\( 0 \\). The corresponding eigenvectors are:\n\n- For \\( \\lambda = 0 \\): \\( v_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\),\n- For \\( \\lambda = 1 \\): \\( v_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\),\n- For \\( \\lambda = -1 \\): \\( v_{-1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ \\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Inner Products and Probabilities\nThe state vector \\( \\psi = [-1, 2, 1]^T \\) is not normalized. Its norm is:\n\n\\[\n\\|\\psi\\|^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\n\\]\n\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is proportional to the squared magnitude of the inner product between \\( \\psi \\) and the eigenvector \\( v_0 \\). The inner product is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-1) + 0(2) + \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe squared magnitude is:\n\n\\[\n|\\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = (-\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2.\n\\]\n\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is then:\n\n\\[\nP(0) = \\frac{|\\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle|^2}{\\|\\psi\\|^2} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability of measuring \\( 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0. The state of the system is given as a column matrix, and P is a matrix operator. \n\nWait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So the first thing I need to do is find the eigenvalues of matrix P because the possible results of measuring P are its eigenvalues.\n\nLooking at matrix P, it's a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], the second row is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2], and the third row is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]. Let me write it out:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nI think I should find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation, det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nSo, let me set up the matrix (P - \u03bbI):\n\n[\n[-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb]\n]\n\nNow, the determinant of this matrix should be zero. Let's compute that determinant.\n\nThe determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. I'll go with expansion by the first row since it has a zero which might simplify things.\n\nSo, determinant = (-\u03bb) * det(minor of -\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2) * det(minor of 1/\u221a2) + 0 * det(...)\n\nThe minor for -\u03bb is the 2x2 matrix:\n[\n[-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2],\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb]\n]\n\nThe determinant of this minor is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nThe minor for the second element (1/\u221a2) is the 2x2 matrix:\n[\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, -\u03bb]\n]\n\nIts determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb / \u221a2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb / \u221a2) + 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)/2.\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/2.\n\nSo det = (-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2.\n\nCombine like terms: -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2 = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nSet this equal to zero: -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor out \u03bb: \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1) = 0.\n\nSo the solutions are \u03bb = 0, and -\u03bb\u00b2 +1=0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nWait, but wait, did I compute the determinant correctly? Let me double-check the expansion.\n\nWait, the expansion is (-\u03bb) * minor1 - (1/\u221a2) * minor2 + 0 * minor3.\n\nWait, the minor for the second element is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix where the second row and column are removed. Oh wait, no, the minor for the element in row 1, column 2 is the determinant of the matrix without row 1 and column 2.\n\nSo the minor matrix for element (1,2) is:\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo the minor matrix is:\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, -\u03bb]\n\nWhich gives determinant (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb / \u221a2.\n\nSo yes, the second term is correct.\n\nSo the determinant equation is:\n\n(-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2)( -\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = 0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0 \u2192 -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )=0.\n\nSo eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, but the observable is a Hermitian matrix, so eigenvalues should be real, which they are here.\n\nSo the possible measurement outcomes are 1, 0, and -1.\n\nBut the question asks for the probability of measuring 0.\n\nSo the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb=0, because the probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector component in the given state.\n\nWait, but let me think. The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1) as a column matrix. Let me write it as \u03c8 = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nI need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0. Because the probability is the square of the inner product of \u03c8 and the eigenvector.\n\nSo let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe solve (P - 0 * I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3) / \u221a2 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0.\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 same as first equation, v2=0.\n\nSo from v2=0 and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. Let me set v1 = a, then v3 = -a.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as a * [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nWe can normalize this vector. The length is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1].\n\nSo the eigenvector u0 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nNow, the state vector is \u03c8 = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nWe need to find the amplitude of u0 in \u03c8. The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of u0 and \u03c8.\n\nCompute <u0 | \u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.\n\nWhich is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that can't be right because inner product shouldn't be that big. Wait, did I compute it correctly?\n\nWait, u0 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nSo <u0|\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but that's a magnitude of sqrt(2), which when squared gives 2. But probabilities can't be greater than 1. That's impossible. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait. Oh no, wait. The state vector \u03c8 is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. Is that a normalized vector? Let's check its norm.\n\nThe norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So \u03c8 is not normalized. So perhaps I need to normalize it first.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually assumed to be normalized. So maybe the given \u03c8 isn't normalized. If that's the case, perhaps I should normalize it before proceeding.\n\nSo first, let's normalize \u03c8. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is \u03c8_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". It doesn't mention normalization. So perhaps I need to proceed without normalizing, but then the probabilities would be calculated correctly regardless, because the inner product would account for the normalization.\n\nWait, but when you calculate the probability, you take the inner product squared, and if the state is not normalized, the probability would be (|<u|\u03c8>|^2) / (||\u03c8||^2) ) * (u's probability). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the state is given as a non-normalized vector, so when calculating probabilities, you have to normalize it.\n\nWait, let's think. The state vector in quantum mechanics must be normalized because it's a probability amplitude. So if the given vector isn't normalized, perhaps the question assumes it's normalized, or perhaps the calculation proceeds without considering normalization. Hmm, but in this problem, maybe we can proceed by not normalizing, but the probability would be the squared inner product, but perhaps it's wrong. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector calculation.\n\nWait, let me recheck the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe have P v = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nRow 3: (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 same as row 1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. So yes, that's correct. So the eigenvector is along the direction (1, 0, -1).\n\nBut when I compute the inner product between this eigenvector (unnormalized) and the state \u03c8, I get:\n\n(1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.\n\nBut wait, the inner product is -2, but the probability is the square of the absolute value. So | -2 |^2 = 4.\n\nBut the state vector \u03c8 has a norm squared of (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2=6. So the probability would be 4/6 = 2/3.\n\nWait, but that's an option. Let me look at the options.\n\nOption A is 2/3. So the probability is 2/3.\n\nWait, but wait. I think I might have missed normalization steps. Let me go through it again.\n\nThe eigenvector u0 is (1,0,-1). But it's not normalized. The normalized u0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThe state \u03c8 is [-1; 2; 1], which has a norm squared of 6. So to compute the probability, I need to take the inner product of \u03c8 and u0, then square it, then divide by the norm squared of \u03c8.\n\nWait, no. The correct formula is:\n\nProbability = |<u0 | \u03c8> |^2 / ||\u03c8||^2.\n\nBecause the state \u03c8 might not be normalized.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0. The state of the system is given as a column matrix, and P is a matrix operator. \n\nWait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So the first thing I need to do is find the eigenvalues of matrix P because the possible results of measuring P are its eigenvalues.\n\nLooking at matrix P, it's a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], the second row is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2], and the third row is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]. Let me write it out:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nI think I should find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation, det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nSo, let me set up the matrix (P - \u03bbI):\n\n[\n[-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb]\n]\n\nNow, the determinant of this matrix should be zero. Let's compute that determinant.\n\nThe determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. I'll go with expansion by the first row since it has a zero which might simplify things.\n\nSo, determinant = (-\u03bb) * det(minor of -\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2) * det(minor of 1/\u221a2) + 0 * det(...)\n\nThe minor for -\u03bb is the 2x2 matrix:\n[\n[-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2],\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb]\n]\n\nThe determinant of this minor is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nThe minor for the second element (1/\u221a2) is the 2x2 matrix:\n[\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, -\u03bb]\n]\n\nIts determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb / \u221a2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb / \u221a2) + 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)/2.\n\nSecond term: -(1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/2.\n\nSo det = (-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2.\n\nCombine like terms: -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2 = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nSet this equal to zero: -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor out \u03bb: \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1) = 0.\n\nSo the solutions are \u03bb = 0, and -\u03bb\u00b2 +1=0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nWait, but wait, did I compute the determinant correctly? Let me double-check the expansion.\n\nWait, the expansion is (-\u03bb) * minor1 - (1/\u221a2) * minor2 + 0 * minor3.\n\nWait, the minor for the second element is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix where the second row and column are removed. Oh wait, no, the minor for the element in row 1, column 2 is the determinant of the matrix without row 1 and column 2.\n\nSo the minor matrix for element (1,2) is:\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo the minor matrix is:\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, -\u03bb]\n\nWhich gives determinant (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb / \u221a2.\n\nSo yes, the second term is correct.\n\nSo the determinant equation is:\n\n(-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2)( -\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = 0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0 \u2192 -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )=0.\n\nSo eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, but the observable is a Hermitian matrix, so eigenvalues should be real, which they are here.\n\nSo the possible measurement outcomes are 1, 0, and -1.\n\nBut the question asks for the probability of measuring 0.\n\nSo the next step is to find the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb=0, because the probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector component in the given state.\n\nWait, but let me think. The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1) as a column matrix. Let me write it as \u03c8 = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nI need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0. Because the probability is the square of the inner product of \u03c8 and the eigenvector.\n\nSo let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe solve (P - 0 * I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\n(1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3) / \u221a2 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0.\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 same as first equation, v2=0.\n\nSo from v2=0 and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. Let me set v1 = a, then v3 = -a.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as a * [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nWe can normalize this vector. The length is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1].\n\nSo the eigenvector u0 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nNow, the state vector is \u03c8 = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nWe need to find the amplitude of u0 in \u03c8. The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of u0 and \u03c8.\n\nCompute <u0 | \u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.\n\nWhich is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that can't be right because inner product shouldn't be that big. Wait, did I compute it correctly?\n\nWait, u0 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nSo <u0|\u03c8> is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but that's a magnitude of sqrt(2), which when squared gives 2. But probabilities can't be greater than 1. That's impossible. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait. Oh no, wait. The state vector \u03c8 is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. Is that a normalized vector? Let's check its norm.\n\nThe norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So \u03c8 is not normalized. So perhaps I need to normalize it first.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually assumed to be normalized. So maybe the given \u03c8 isn't normalized. If that's the case, perhaps I should normalize it before proceeding.\n\nSo first, let's normalize \u03c8. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is \u03c8_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". It doesn't mention normalization. So perhaps I need to proceed without normalizing, but then the probabilities would be calculated correctly regardless, because the inner product would account for the normalization.\n\nWait, but when you calculate the probability, you take the inner product squared, and if the state is not normalized, the probability would be (|<u|\u03c8>|^2) / (||\u03c8||^2) ) * (u's probability). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the state is given as a non-normalized vector, so when calculating probabilities, you have to normalize it.\n\nWait, let's think. The state vector in quantum mechanics must be normalized because it's a probability amplitude. So if the given vector isn't normalized, perhaps the question assumes it's normalized, or perhaps the calculation proceeds without considering normalization. Hmm, but in this problem, maybe we can proceed by not normalizing, but the probability would be the squared inner product, but perhaps it's wrong. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector calculation.\n\nWait, let me recheck the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe have P v = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nRow 3: (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 same as row 1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. So yes, that's correct. So the eigenvector is along the direction (1, 0, -1).\n\nBut when I compute the inner product between this eigenvector (unnormalized) and the state \u03c8, I get:\n\n(1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2.\n\nBut wait, the inner product is -2, but the probability is the square of the absolute value. So | -2 |^2 = 4.\n\nBut the state vector \u03c8 has a norm squared of (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2=6. So the probability would be 4/6 = 2/3.\n\nWait, but that's an option. Let me look at the options.\n\nOption A is 2/3. So the probability is 2/3.\n\nWait, but wait. I think I might have missed normalization steps. Let me go through it again.\n\nThe eigenvector u0 is (1,0,-1). But it's not normalized. The normalized u0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThe state \u03c8 is [-1; 2; 1], which has a norm squared of 6. So to compute the probability, I need to take the inner product of \u03c8 and u0, then square it, then divide by the norm squared of \u03c8.\n\nWait, no. The correct formula is:\n\nProbability = |<u0 | \u03c8> |^2 / ||\u03c8||^2.\n\nBecause the state \u03c8 might not be normalized. So let me compute <u0 | \u03c8>.\n\nu0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\n\u03c8 is (-1, 2, 1).\n\nInner product:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nSo |<u0 | \u03c8>|^2 is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nThe norm squared of \u03c8 is 6.\n\nSo probability is 2 /6 = 1/3.\n\nHmm, that's option C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I might have made a mistake because the inner product was -sqrt(2), but then when normalized, it's 2/6=1/3.\n\nSo the correct probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but why did I get confused earlier? Because I forgot to normalize the state. So the correct approach is to compute the inner product of the eigenvector (normalized) and the state (which may not be normalized), then take the square, and then divide by the state's norm squared to get the probability.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to normalize the state first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first normalize \u03c8. Let me try that.\n\n\u03c8 has components (-1, 2, 1). Its norm is sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nNow, the inner product between u0 (normalized) and this normalized \u03c8 is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*( -1/sqrt(6) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).\n\nWhich is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ].\n\nSo that's (-1 -1) / (sqrt(12)) ) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo calculate the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) and obtaining the value \\( 0 \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \\( P \\)\nThe observable \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalues of \\( P \\) are found by solving the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has its first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The question is asking for the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0 at time t.\n\nHmm, okay. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of that operator. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is calculated by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I get this right. So, the state vector is given, and the observable is given by matrix P. I need to find the probability that a measurement of P gives 0.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused about the matrix P. Let me write it out properly.\n\nSo P is a 3x3 matrix:\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. That doesn't look symmetric. Because the (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) is also 1/sqrt(2), which is symmetric. The (2,3) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (3,2) is also 1/sqrt(2), so that's symmetric. So P is a Hermitian matrix, which makes sense because observables are Hermitian.\n\nBut wait, wait. Oh wait, no. Because in row 2, the middle element is 0. So the matrix is symmetric, yes. So P is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real.\n\nSo the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So the possible measured values could be 0, or other values.\n\nBut the question is asking for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P, find which eigenvalue is 0, and then compute the projection of the given state onto that eigenvector.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to look for the eigenvectors of P, especially the one corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Because if I can find that, then the probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state and the eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute P multiplied by the state vector and see if that gives 0, but wait, no. Because if the state is an eigenvector, then P acting on it would give the eigenvalue times the state. But in this case, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), which is a vector. Let me check if that's an eigenvector.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should first find the eigenvalues of P. Let me think about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value and see, but no, the question is about the probability of getting a specific outcome, which is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the eigenvalues of P. Let me try that.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\n[ 0           1/sqrt(2)      0        ]\n[1/sqrt(2)     0           1/sqrt(2) ]\n[ 0           1/sqrt(2)      0        ]\n\nHmm. Let me compute the eigenvalues of this matrix.\n\nThe eigenvalues \u03bb satisfy det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\n[ -\u03bb          1/sqrt(2)      0        ]\n[1/sqrt(2)    -\u03bb          1/sqrt(2) ]\n[ 0          1/sqrt(2)     -\u03bb        ]\n\nComputing the determinant of this matrix.\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's expand along the first row.\n\nSo, det = -\u03bb * det of the minor:\n[ -\u03bb       1/sqrt(2) ]\n[1/sqrt(2)  -\u03bb      ]\n\nMinus (1/sqrt(2)) * det of the minor:\n[1/sqrt(2)  1/sqrt(2) ]\n[ 0         -\u03bb       ]\n\nPlus 0 * det(...), which is zero.\n\nSo first term: -\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2)) (-\u03bb) - (0)(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] = - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ] = (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I do the minors correctly.\n\nWait, the minor for the (1,2) element is the determinant of the matrix that remains when row 1 and column 2 are removed. So the minor for element (1,2) is the 2x2 matrix:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo for the element at (1,2), which is 1/sqrt(2), the minor matrix is:\n\n[1/sqrt(2)   1/sqrt(2) ]\n[ 0          -\u03bb       ]\n\nSo the determinant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ) = (-\u03bb)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but when calculating the determinant, the sign alternates as per the position. The sign for element (i,j) is (-1)^(i+j). So for (1,2), it's (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1. So the second term is (element) * (-1)^(i+j) * det(minor).\n\nSo the second term in the expansion is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1)^(1+2) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ].\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = (\u03bb) / (2).\n\nSo the determinant equation becomes:\n\ndet = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ] + (\u03bb/2) + 0.\n\nWait, no: the first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2), the second term is (\u03bb/2), so:\n\ndet = -\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo setting the determinant to zero: -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor that: \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0.\n\nSo solutions are \u03bb = 0, or -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 =0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo the question is, what is the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.\n\nSo, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). But wait, I need to normalize it, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors. Let me check the norm.\n\nThe norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of the elements. So (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nWait, but maybe the question doesn't require normalization because the observable's probabilities are based on the projections. Alternatively, perhaps the given state is not normalized, so I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, the state is given as a column vector, but in quantum mechanics, the state should be normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first. Let me compute the norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1).\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't require normalization, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the observable's matrix is such that the probabilities can be found without worrying about normalization, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, the probability is the squared magnitude of the projection onto the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo first, I need to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue of P.\n\nWe found the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nLet's find the eigenvectors for each.\n\nStarting with \u03bb=0.\n\nSo (P - 0 I) x = 0 \u2192 P x = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\n[ 0          1/sqrt(2)      0        ]\n[1/sqrt(2)    0           1/sqrt(2) ]\n[ 0          1/sqrt(2)      0        ]\n\nSo, the system is:\n\nEquation 1: 0*x1 + (1/sqrt(2)) x2 + 0 x3 = 0 \u2192 x2 = 0.\n\nEquation 2: (1/sqrt(2)) x1 + 0 x2 + (1/sqrt(2)) x3 = 0 \u2192 x1 + x3 = 0.\n\nEquation 3: 0 x1 + (1/sqrt(2)) x2 + 0 x3 = 0 \u2192 x2=0.\n\nSo from equation 1 and 3, x2=0.\n\nEquation 2: x1 + x3 = 0 \u2192 x3 = -x1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form x1*(1, 0, -1).\n\nSo, the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1).\n\nBut wait, let me check. Wait, the first row says x2=0, the third row also says x2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are any vector where x2=0 and x3 = -x1.\n\nSo the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1). Let me normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but perhaps I can just use the non-normalized eigenvector for the projection, since the inner product squared will take care of normalization.\n\nWait, but let me think: the projection of the state vector onto the eigenvector is (\u03c8 \u00b7 v) where v is the eigenvector. But if v is not normalized, then the inner product is (\u03c8 \u00b7 v), and the probability is |(\u03c8 \u00b7 v)|^2 divided by (v \u00b7 v), because the eigenvector isn't necessarily normalized.\n\nWait, no, I think that's not correct. Because the standard approach is to take the eigenvectors as orthonormal, but perhaps in this problem, the eigenvectors are not necessarily normalized. So perhaps it's better to normalize them first.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to proceed without worrying about normalization because when we calculate the probability, we can take the inner product, square its magnitude, and that's the probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state is already normalized, but I need to confirm.\n\nWait, the given state is (-1, 2, 1). Its norm is sqrt(6), so to normalize, we'd have to divide by sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1).\n\nBut when calculating the probability, the formula is |<v | \u03c8>|\u00b2, where v is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\nBut wait, the eigenvector v we found is (1, 0, -1). So let me compute the inner product between v and \u03c8.\n\nWait, no, the inner product is \u03c8\u2020 v, where \u03c8 is a column vector and v is another column vector. So \u03c8 is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, and v is [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nSo the inner product is (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nBut wait, the state \u03c8 is the given vector, but perhaps it's not normalized. So if the actual state is \u03c8_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, then the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) ) ] = (1/sqrt(6))* (-2) = -2/sqrt(6).\n\nSo the probability is | -2/sqrt(6) |^2 = (4)/(6) )= 2/3.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option A is 2/3.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that the eigenvector v is correctly normalized. Because if v isn't normalized, then the inner product's magnitude squared might not directly give the probability.\n\nWait, the eigenvector v is (1, 0, -1), which has a norm of sqrt(2). So to make it a unit vector, we should use (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, if we take the inner product between \u03c8 and this normalized v, then:\n\n\u03c8_normalized = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nv_normalized = [ 1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\nSo inner product = ( -1/sqrt(6) )*(1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWhich is (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)).\n\nThat's (-1 -1) / (sqrt(12)) ) \u2192 (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/3).\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation. Hmm. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me retrace.\n\nThe eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (1, 0, -1), but to use it in the inner product, it should be normalized. Because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, any scalar multiple can be used, but when calculating probabilities, we should use the normalized vectors.\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector v is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThe state \u03c8 is ( -1, 2, 1 ), but it's not normalized. Its norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) (-1, 2, 1).\n\nSo the inner product is \u03c8_normalized \u00b7 v.\n\nWhich is ( (-1)/sqrt(6) )*(1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo that's [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ].\n\nWhich is (-2)/(sqrt(12)) ) \u2192 sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so it's (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe magnitude squared is (1/3). So the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but earlier when I didn't normalize v, I got 2/3. So which is correct?\n\nAh, I think I see the confusion. The eigenvector v isn't normalized in the first approach, so when I compute the inner product, I have to account for that.\n\nWait, let me think again. The general formula for the probability is |<v | \u03c8>|^2, where v is the normalized eigenvector, and \u03c8 is the state vector (possibly not normalized).\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compute (v\u2020 P \u03c8) where P is the projection operator onto the eigenspace. But perhaps it's easier to compute it as (v\u2020 \u03c8) (v\u2020 \u03c8)\u2020, but I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The projection operator onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0 is |v><v|, where v is the normalized eigenvector. So the probability is \u03c8\u2020 |v><v| \u03c8.\n\nWhich is equal to (\u03c8\u2020 v) (v\u2020 \u03c8) ) = | \u03c8\u2020 v |^2.\n\nSo if v is normalized, then yes, the probability is | \u03c8\u2020 v |\u00b2.\n\nSo in this case, if \u03c8 is the given vector (-1, 2, 1), and v is the normalized eigenvector (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)), then \u03c8 is not normalized. So the inner product is:\n\n\u03c8\u2020 v = (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + 2 * 0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/sqrt(2) ) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that can't be right because sqrt(2) is about 1.414, and the inner product is a scalar. Then the probability would be | -sqrt(2) |^2 = 2.\n\nBut that's impossible because probabilities can't be greater than 1. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, \u03c8 is the vector (-1, 2, 1), which is not normalized. So when I take the inner product with v, which is normalized, I get:\n\n\u03c8\u2020 v = (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + 2 * 0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) ) = (-2)/sqrt(2) ) = -sqrt(2).\n\nBut wait, that's correct, but the probability is |\u03c8\u2020 v|^2, which would be (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. Which is impossible, as probabilities can't exceed 1.\n\nAh, I see the mistake now. Because the state \u03c8 is not normalized, the inner product's square gives the probability only if the state is normalized. So, the correct approach is to normalize the state \u03c8 first.\n\nSo, \u03c8_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) (-1, 2, 1).\n\nThen, \u03c8_normalized\u2020 v = [ (-1/sqrt(6)), (2/sqrt(6)), (1/sqrt(6)) ] \u00b7 [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].\n\nWhich is ( (-1/sqrt(6))(1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nThird term: (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) = same as first term.\n\nSo sum is [ (-1) + (-1) ]/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. Which is option C.\n\nWait, but earlier when I didn't normalize v, I got 2/3. So I must have made a mistake in that approach.\n\nWait, perhaps because when I didn't normalize the eigenvector, the inner product included both the state's and the eigenvector's normalization. So perhaps the correct approach is to normalize both.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the probability is 1/3, so the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the eigenvectors.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are any vectors of the form (a, 0, -a), so the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). So any vector in this eigenspace can be written as a scalar multiple of (1,0,-1).\n\nSo, the projection of the state \u03c8 onto this eigenspace is given by the inner product between \u03c8 and the eigenvector, divided by the norm squared of the eigenvector.\n\nWait, the formula is: probability = | <v | \u03c8> |^2 / <v|v>.\n\nBecause if v is not normalized, the formula is:\n\nprobability = ( | <v | \u03c8> |^2 ) / ( <v|v> )\n\nBecause v is a basis vector for the eigenspace, but not necessarily normalized.\n\nSo, using this approach.\n\nv is (1,0,-1).\n\nCompute <v | \u03c8> = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ) = -1 +0 -1 = -2.\n\nThen, <v | v> = (1)^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2.\n\nSo the probability is | -2 |^2 / 2 = 4/2 = 2. Which again can't be right, as probability can't be more than 1. So I must have made a mistake in this approach.\n\nAh, I think the confusion comes from whether the state is normalized or not. So, the correct approach is to normalize both the state and the eigenvector.\n\nSo, the state \u03c8 is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so normalized \u03c8 is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nThe eigenvector v is (1,0,-1), norm sqrt(2), so normalized v is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThen, the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)) ].\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) ) ] \u2192 (1/sqrt(6)) * (-2/sqrt(2)) ) \u2192 (-2)/(sqrt(12)) ) \u2192 (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has its first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The question is asking for the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0 at time t.\n\nHmm, okay. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of that operator. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is calculated by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I get this right. So, the state vector is given, and the observable is given by matrix P. I need to find the probability that a measurement of P gives 0.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused about the matrix P. Let me write it out properly.\n\nSo P is a 3x3 matrix:\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. That doesn't look symmetric. Because the (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) is also 1/sqrt(2), which is symmetric. The (2,3) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (3,2) is also 1/sqrt(2), so that's symmetric. So P is a Hermitian matrix, which makes sense because observables are Hermitian.\n\nBut wait, wait. Oh wait, no. Because in row 2, the middle element is 0. So the matrix is symmetric, yes. So P is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real.\n\nSo the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So the possible measured values could be 0, or other values.\n\nBut the question is asking for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P, find which eigenvalue is 0, and then compute the projection of the given state onto that eigenvector.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to look for the eigenvectors of P, especially the one corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Because if I can find that, then the probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state and the eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute P multiplied by the state vector and see if that gives 0, but wait, no. Because if the state is an eigenvector, then P acting on it would give the eigenvalue times the state. But in this case, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), which is a vector. Let me check if that's an eigenvector.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should first find the eigenvalues of P. Let me think about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value and see, but no, the question is about the probability of getting a specific outcome, which is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the eigenvalues of P. Let me try that.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\n[ 0           1/sqrt(2)      0        ]\n[1/sqrt(2)     0           1/sqrt(2) ]\n[ 0           1/sqrt(2)      0        ]\n\nHmm. Let me compute the eigenvalues of this matrix.\n\nThe eigenvalues \u03bb satisfy det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P - \u03bb I is:\n\n[ -\u03bb          1/sqrt(2)      0        ]\n[1/sqrt(2)    -\u03bb          1/sqrt(2) ]\n[ 0          1/sqrt(2)     -\u03bb        ]\n\nComputing the determinant of this matrix.\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's expand along the first row.\n\nSo, det = -\u03bb * det of the minor:\n[ -\u03bb       1/sqrt(2) ]\n[1/sqrt(2)  -\u03bb      ]\n\nMinus (1/sqrt(2)) * det of the minor:\n[1/sqrt(2)  1/sqrt(2) ]\n[ 0         -\u03bb       ]\n\nPlus 0 * det(...), which is zero.\n\nSo first term: -\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2)) (-\u03bb) - (0)(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] = - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ] = (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I do the minors correctly.\n\nWait, the minor for the (1,2) element is the determinant of the matrix that remains when row 1 and column 2 are removed. So the minor for element (1,2) is the 2x2 matrix:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo for the element at (1,2), which is 1/sqrt(2), the minor matrix is:\n\n[1/sqrt(2)   1/sqrt(2) ]\n[ 0          -\u03bb       ]\n\nSo the determinant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ) = (-\u03bb)/sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but when calculating the determinant, the sign alternates as per the position. The sign for element (i,j) is (-1)^(i+j). So for (1,2), it's (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1. So the second term is (element) * (-1)^(i+j) * det(minor).\n\nSo the second term in the expansion is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1)^(1+2) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ].\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = (\u03bb) / (2).\n\nSo the determinant equation becomes:\n\ndet = -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ] + (\u03bb/2) + 0.\n\nWait, no: the first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2), the second term is (\u03bb/2), so:\n\ndet = -\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo setting the determinant to zero: -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor that: \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0.\n\nSo solutions are \u03bb = 0, or -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 =0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo the question is, what is the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.\n\nSo, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). But wait, I need to normalize it, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors. Let me check the norm.\n\nThe norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of the elements. So (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nWait, but maybe the question doesn't require normalization because the observable's probabilities are based on the projections. Alternatively, perhaps the given state is not normalized, so I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, the state is given as a column vector, but in quantum mechanics, the state should be normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first. Let me compute the norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1).\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't require normalization, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the observable's matrix is such that the probabilities can be found without worrying about normalization, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, the probability is the squared magnitude of the projection onto the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo first, I need to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue of P.\n\nWe found the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nLet's find the eigenvectors for each.\n\nStarting with \u03bb=0.\n\nSo (P - 0 I) x = 0 \u2192 P x = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\n[ 0          1/sqrt(2)      0        ]\n[1/sqrt(2)    0           1/sqrt(2) ]\n[ 0          1/sqrt(2)      0        ]\n\nSo, the system is:\n\nEquation 1: 0*x1 + (1/sqrt(2)) x2 + 0 x3 = 0 \u2192 x2 = 0.\n\nEquation 2: (1/sqrt(2)) x1 + 0 x2 + (1/sqrt(2)) x3 = 0 \u2192 x1 + x3 = 0.\n\nEquation 3: 0 x1 + (1/sqrt(2)) x2 + 0 x3 = 0 \u2192 x2=0.\n\nSo from equation 1 and 3, x2=0.\n\nEquation 2: x1 + x3 = 0 \u2192 x3 = -x1.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form x1*(1, 0, -1).\n\nSo, the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1).\n\nBut wait, let me check. Wait, the first row says x2=0, the third row also says x2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are any vector where x2=0 and x3 = -x1.\n\nSo the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1). Let me normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but perhaps I can just use the non-normalized eigenvector for the projection, since the inner product squared will take care of normalization.\n\nWait, but let me think: the projection of the state vector onto the eigenvector is (\u03c8 \u00b7 v) where v is the eigenvector. But if v is not normalized, then the inner product is (\u03c8 \u00b7 v), and the probability is |(\u03c8 \u00b7 v)|^2 divided by (v \u00b7 v), because the eigenvector isn't necessarily normalized.\n\nWait, no, I think that's not correct. Because the standard approach is to take the eigenvectors as orthonormal, but perhaps in this problem, the eigenvectors are not necessarily normalized. So perhaps it's better to normalize them first.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to proceed without worrying about normalization because when we calculate the probability, we can take the inner product, square its magnitude, and that's the probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state is already normalized, but I need to confirm.\n\nWait, the given state is (-1, 2, 1). Its norm is sqrt(6), so to normalize, we'd have to divide by sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1).\n\nBut when calculating the probability, the formula is |<v | \u03c8>|\u00b2, where v is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\nBut wait, the eigenvector v we found is (1, 0, -1). So let me compute the inner product between v and \u03c8.\n\nWait, no, the inner product is \u03c8\u2020 v, where \u03c8 is a column vector and v is another column vector. So \u03c8 is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, and v is [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nSo the inner product is (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nBut wait, the state \u03c8 is the given vector, but perhaps it's not normalized. So if the actual state is \u03c8_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, then the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) ) ] = (1/sqrt(6))* (-2) = -2/sqrt(6).\n\nSo the probability is | -2/sqrt(6) |^2 = (4)/(6) )= 2/3.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option A is 2/3.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that the eigenvector v is correctly normalized. Because if v isn't normalized, then the inner product's magnitude squared might not directly give the probability.\n\nWait, the eigenvector v is (1, 0, -1), which has a norm of sqrt(2). So to make it a unit vector, we should use (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, if we take the inner product between \u03c8 and this normalized v, then:\n\n\u03c8_normalized = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nv_normalized = [ 1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\nSo inner product = ( -1/sqrt(6) )*(1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWhich is (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)).\n\nThat's (-1 -1) / (sqrt(12)) ) \u2192 (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/3).\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation. Hmm. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me retrace.\n\nThe eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (1, 0, -1), but to use it in the inner product, it should be normalized. Because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, any scalar multiple can be used, but when calculating probabilities, we should use the normalized vectors.\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector v is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThe state \u03c8 is ( -1, 2, 1 ), but it's not normalized. Its norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) (-1, 2, 1).\n\nSo the inner product is \u03c8_normalized \u00b7 v.\n\nWhich is ( (-1)/sqrt(6) )*(1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo that's [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ].\n\nWhich is (-2)/(sqrt(12)) ) \u2192 sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so it's (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe magnitude squared is (1/3). So the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but earlier when I didn't normalize v, I got 2/3. So which is correct?\n\nAh, I think I see the confusion. The eigenvector v isn't normalized in the first approach, so when I compute the inner product, I have to account for that.\n\nWait, let me think again. The general formula for the probability is |<v | \u03c8>|^2, where v is the normalized eigenvector, and \u03c8 is the state vector (possibly not normalized).\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compute (v\u2020 P \u03c8) where P is the projection operator onto the eigenspace. But perhaps it's easier to compute it as (v\u2020 \u03c8) (v\u2020 \u03c8)\u2020, but I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The projection operator onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0 is |v><v|, where v is the normalized eigenvector. So the probability is \u03c8\u2020 |v><v| \u03c8.\n\nWhich is equal to (\u03c8\u2020 v) (v\u2020 \u03c8) ) = | \u03c8\u2020 v |^2.\n\nSo if v is normalized, then yes, the probability is | \u03c8\u2020 v |\u00b2.\n\nSo in this case, if \u03c8 is the given vector (-1, 2, 1), and v is the normalized eigenvector (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)), then \u03c8 is not normalized. So the inner product is:\n\n\u03c8\u2020 v = (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + 2 * 0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/sqrt(2) ) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that can't be right because sqrt(2) is about 1.414, and the inner product is a scalar. Then the probability would be | -sqrt(2) |^2 = 2.\n\nBut that's impossible because probabilities can't be greater than 1. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, \u03c8 is the vector (-1, 2, 1), which is not normalized. So when I take the inner product with v, which is normalized, I get:\n\n\u03c8\u2020 v = (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + 2 * 0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) ) = (-2)/sqrt(2) ) = -sqrt(2).\n\nBut wait, that's correct, but the probability is |\u03c8\u2020 v|^2, which would be (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. Which is impossible, as probabilities can't exceed 1.\n\nAh, I see the mistake now. Because the state \u03c8 is not normalized, the inner product's square gives the probability only if the state is normalized. So, the correct approach is to normalize the state \u03c8 first.\n\nSo, \u03c8_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) (-1, 2, 1).\n\nThen, \u03c8_normalized\u2020 v = [ (-1/sqrt(6)), (2/sqrt(6)), (1/sqrt(6)) ] \u00b7 [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].\n\nWhich is ( (-1/sqrt(6))(1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nThird term: (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) = same as first term.\n\nSo sum is [ (-1) + (-1) ]/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. Which is option C.\n\nWait, but earlier when I didn't normalize v, I got 2/3. So I must have made a mistake in that approach.\n\nWait, perhaps because when I didn't normalize the eigenvector, the inner product included both the state's and the eigenvector's normalization. So perhaps the correct approach is to normalize both.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the probability is 1/3, so the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the eigenvectors.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are any vectors of the form (a, 0, -a), so the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). So any vector in this eigenspace can be written as a scalar multiple of (1,0,-1).\n\nSo, the projection of the state \u03c8 onto this eigenspace is given by the inner product between \u03c8 and the eigenvector, divided by the norm squared of the eigenvector.\n\nWait, the formula is: probability = | <v | \u03c8> |^2 / <v|v>.\n\nBecause if v is not normalized, the formula is:\n\nprobability = ( | <v | \u03c8> |^2 ) / ( <v|v> )\n\nBecause v is a basis vector for the eigenspace, but not necessarily normalized.\n\nSo, using this approach.\n\nv is (1,0,-1).\n\nCompute <v | \u03c8> = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ) = -1 +0 -1 = -2.\n\nThen, <v | v> = (1)^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2.\n\nSo the probability is | -2 |^2 / 2 = 4/2 = 2. Which again can't be right, as probability can't be more than 1. So I must have made a mistake in this approach.\n\nAh, I think the confusion comes from whether the state is normalized or not. So, the correct approach is to normalize both the state and the eigenvector.\n\nSo, the state \u03c8 is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so normalized \u03c8 is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].\n\nThe eigenvector v is (1,0,-1), norm sqrt(2), so normalized v is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThen, the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)) ].\n\nWhich is (1/sqrt(6)) [ (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) ) ] \u2192 (1/sqrt(6)) * (-2/sqrt(2)) ) \u2192 (-2)/(sqrt(12)) ) \u2192 (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) and obtaining the value \\( 0 \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n### Key Information\n1. **State Vector**: The state of the system is given as \\( \\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.\n\nThe question says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, I think that's a vector in a three-dimensional space. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually represented as column vectors, and their components are complex numbers. But in this case, all the components are real. Oh well, maybe it's a real vector space.\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So, let me write that down to visualize it better.\n\nP matrix:\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nWait, so P is a 3x3 matrix. Observables are Hermitian operators, right? So I should check if this matrix is Hermitian. Because for a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements are real here, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let me transpose P and see if it's the same.\n\nTransposing P would swap the rows and columns. So, the first column becomes the first row: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0. Which matches the original first row. Second column becomes second row: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2. Wait, original second row is (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2), which is the same as the second column. Third column becomes third row: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0. So yes, P is equal to its transpose, hence Hermitian. Good, that makes sense because observables are Hermitian.\n\nNow, the question is to find the probability that measuring P will yield 0. So, I think I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P, find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the probability of the state vector being in that eigenvector's subspace.\n\nAlternatively, wait, maybe P is a projection operator? Because the matrix looks a bit like it's projecting onto a certain subspace. Let me think: the sum of the squares of each row should be 1 if it's a projection matrix. Let me check each row.\n\nFirst row: (0)^2 + (1/\u221a2)^2 + 0^2 = 1/2. Hmm, that's not 1. Second row: (1/\u221a2)^2 + 0 + (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2 +1/2=1. Third row same as first: 1/2. Oh, so each row's squared sum is either 1 or 1/2. So it's not a projection matrix. Maybe it's a different kind of operator.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of eigenvalues. So, the possible outcomes of a measurement of P are its eigenvalues. So, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me try to compute them.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo, let's write out the matrix (P - \u03bb I):\n\nRow 1: [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0]\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb]\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\n| -\u03bb       1/\u221a2      0      |\n|1/\u221a2     -\u03bb      1/\u221a2   |\n|0        1/\u221a2    -\u03bb      |\n\nHmm, calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. Let's expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] ) - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] ) + 0 * something.\n\nSo, expanding each minor:\n\nFirst minor (for -\u03bb):\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2 |\n|1/\u221a2   -\u03bb     |\n\nDeterminant is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nSecond minor (for 1/\u221a2):\n\n|1/\u221a2    1/\u221a2|\n|0       -\u03bb    |\n\nDeterminant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = (-\u03bb)/\u221a2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2) * ( (-\u03bb)/\u221a2 ) + 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 0.5) = -\u03bb^3 + 0.5\u03bb.\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb)/(2).\n\nSo, combining:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb^3 + 0.5\u03bb) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (0.5\u03bb + 0.5\u03bb) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo, the characteristic equation is:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor this:\n\n\u03bb (-\u03bb^2 + 1) = 0.\n\nSo, \u03bb = 0, or -\u03bb^2 + 1=0 \u2192 \u03bb^2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the probability of measuring 0. So, that's one of the eigenvalues.\n\nNow, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb=0, then compute the projection of the given state onto that eigenvector. The square of the norm of that projection will be the probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is multi-dimensional, so the probability is the sum of the squares of the projections onto each eigenvector in that space.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo, solving (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo, the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0 \u2192 0 x + (1/\u221a2)y + 0 z = 0 \u2192 y = 0.\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2 x + 0 y + 1/\u221a2 z = 0 \u2192 x + z =0.\n\nRow 3: 0 x + 1/\u221a2 y + 0 z =0 \u2192 y=0.\n\nSo, from row 1 and 3, y must be 0. Then, from row 2: x + z =0 \u2192 x = -z.\n\nSo, the eigenvectors are of the form (x, 0, z) where x = -z.\n\nSo, we can write the eigenvectors as any scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1). Because x = -z, let\u2019s take z=1, x=-1 \u2192 (-1, 0, 1) is an eigenvector, but any multiple is fine.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the eigenvectors are normalized. Let me compute the norm of (1, 0, -1). The norm squared is 1\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + (-1)^2 = 2 \u2192 so the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.\n\nNow, the given state is the column vector (-1, 2, 1). Let me represent this as a vector v = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector is usually a unit vector. Let me check the norm of v. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So, norm is sqrt(6), so the vector is not normalized. Hmm, but maybe in this problem, it's not necessary to normalize, because the probabilities would adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, but when computing probabilities, perhaps we should normalize the state first. Let me think.\n\nThe probability of measuring 0 is the square of the norm of the projection of the state onto the eigenspace of 0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, it's just the square of the inner product of the state with the eigenvector.\n\nWait, more precisely, the probability is |<u|v>|^2, where u is the unit eigenvector and v is the state vector.\n\nSo, let's compute <u|v>.\n\nu is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nv is (-1, 2, 1).\n\nSo, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2/sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, so the inner product is -sqrt(2).\n\nBut wait, the probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product.\n\nSo, | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nBut wait, the state vector v has a norm squared of 6. So, the probability is (2) / (6) )= 1/3.\n\nWait, because in quantum mechanics, the probabilities are normalized by the state's norm. So, the probability is (inner product squared) divided by the norm squared of the state.\n\nWait, but wait, in standard QM, the state is supposed to be a unit vector. So, perhaps in this problem, the vector is not normalized, and the probabilities are computed accordingly.\n\nWait, let me think again. The state vector v is given as [-1, 2, 1]. Its norm is sqrt(6). So, the normalized state would be v_normalized = v / sqrt(6).\n\nThe eigenvector u is already normalized. So, the inner product between u and v_normalized is [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 ] / sqrt(6).\n\nWait, let me compute this:\n\nInner product = [ (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) ] / sqrt(6) = [ (-2/sqrt(2)) ] / sqrt(6) = [ -sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(6).\n\nBecause 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2).\n\nSo, inner product is (-sqrt(2)) / sqrt(6) = (-sqrt(2) * sqrt(6)) ) / (6) ) ? Wait, wait, sqrt(6)=sqrt(2*3)=sqrt(2)*sqrt(3). So, sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) is 1/sqrt(3).\n\nWait, sqrt(6) is sqrt(2)*sqrt(3). So,\n\n(-sqrt(2)) / sqrt(6) = (-sqrt(2)) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the inner product is -1/sqrt(3). The absolute value squared is (1/3).\n\nSo, the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.\n\nThe question says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, I think that's a vector in a three-dimensional space. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually represented as column vectors, and their components are complex numbers. But in this case, all the components are real. Oh well, maybe it's a real vector space.\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So, let me write that down to visualize it better.\n\nP matrix:\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nWait, so P is a 3x3 matrix. Observables are Hermitian operators, right? So I should check if this matrix is Hermitian. Because for a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements are real here, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let me transpose P and see if it's the same.\n\nTransposing P would swap the rows and columns. So, the first column becomes the first row: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0. Which matches the original first row. Second column becomes second row: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2. Wait, original second row is (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2), which is the same as the second column. Third column becomes third row: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0. So yes, P is equal to its transpose, hence Hermitian. Good, that makes sense because observables are Hermitian.\n\nNow, the question is to find the probability that measuring P will yield 0. So, I think I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P, find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the probability of the state vector being in that eigenvector's subspace.\n\nAlternatively, wait, maybe P is a projection operator? Because the matrix looks a bit like it's projecting onto a certain subspace. Let me think: the sum of the squares of each row should be 1 if it's a projection matrix. Let me check each row.\n\nFirst row: (0)^2 + (1/\u221a2)^2 + 0^2 = 1/2. Hmm, that's not 1. Second row: (1/\u221a2)^2 + 0 + (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2 +1/2=1. Third row same as first: 1/2. Oh, so each row's squared sum is either 1 or 1/2. So it's not a projection matrix. Maybe it's a different kind of operator.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of eigenvalues. So, the possible outcomes of a measurement of P are its eigenvalues. So, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me try to compute them.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo, let's write out the matrix (P - \u03bb I):\n\nRow 1: [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0]\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2]\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb]\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\n| -\u03bb       1/\u221a2      0      |\n|1/\u221a2     -\u03bb      1/\u221a2   |\n|0        1/\u221a2    -\u03bb      |\n\nHmm, calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. Let's expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * det( [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] ) - (1/\u221a2) * det( [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ] ) + 0 * something.\n\nSo, expanding each minor:\n\nFirst minor (for -\u03bb):\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2 |\n|1/\u221a2   -\u03bb     |\n\nDeterminant is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nSecond minor (for 1/\u221a2):\n\n|1/\u221a2    1/\u221a2|\n|0       -\u03bb    |\n\nDeterminant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = (-\u03bb)/\u221a2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2) * ( (-\u03bb)/\u221a2 ) + 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 0.5) = -\u03bb^3 + 0.5\u03bb.\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb)/(2).\n\nSo, combining:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb^3 + 0.5\u03bb) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (0.5\u03bb + 0.5\u03bb) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo, the characteristic equation is:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor this:\n\n\u03bb (-\u03bb^2 + 1) = 0.\n\nSo, \u03bb = 0, or -\u03bb^2 + 1=0 \u2192 \u03bb^2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the probability of measuring 0. So, that's one of the eigenvalues.\n\nNow, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb=0, then compute the projection of the given state onto that eigenvector. The square of the norm of that projection will be the probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is multi-dimensional, so the probability is the sum of the squares of the projections onto each eigenvector in that space.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo, solving (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo, the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0 \u2192 0 x + (1/\u221a2)y + 0 z = 0 \u2192 y = 0.\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2 x + 0 y + 1/\u221a2 z = 0 \u2192 x + z =0.\n\nRow 3: 0 x + 1/\u221a2 y + 0 z =0 \u2192 y=0.\n\nSo, from row 1 and 3, y must be 0. Then, from row 2: x + z =0 \u2192 x = -z.\n\nSo, the eigenvectors are of the form (x, 0, z) where x = -z.\n\nSo, we can write the eigenvectors as any scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1). Because x = -z, let\u2019s take z=1, x=-1 \u2192 (-1, 0, 1) is an eigenvector, but any multiple is fine.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the eigenvectors are normalized. Let me compute the norm of (1, 0, -1). The norm squared is 1\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + (-1)^2 = 2 \u2192 so the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.\n\nNow, the given state is the column vector (-1, 2, 1). Let me represent this as a vector v = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector is usually a unit vector. Let me check the norm of v. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So, norm is sqrt(6), so the vector is not normalized. Hmm, but maybe in this problem, it's not necessary to normalize, because the probabilities would adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, but when computing probabilities, perhaps we should normalize the state first. Let me think.\n\nThe probability of measuring 0 is the square of the norm of the projection of the state onto the eigenspace of 0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, it's just the square of the inner product of the state with the eigenvector.\n\nWait, more precisely, the probability is |<u|v>|^2, where u is the unit eigenvector and v is the state vector.\n\nSo, let's compute <u|v>.\n\nu is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nv is (-1, 2, 1).\n\nSo, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2/sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, so the inner product is -sqrt(2).\n\nBut wait, the probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product.\n\nSo, | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nBut wait, the state vector v has a norm squared of 6. So, the probability is (2) / (6) )= 1/3.\n\nWait, because in quantum mechanics, the probabilities are normalized by the state's norm. So, the probability is (inner product squared) divided by the norm squared of the state.\n\nWait, but wait, in standard QM, the state is supposed to be a unit vector. So, perhaps in this problem, the vector is not normalized, and the probabilities are computed accordingly.\n\nWait, let me think again. The state vector v is given as [-1, 2, 1]. Its norm is sqrt(6). So, the normalized state would be v_normalized = v / sqrt(6).\n\nThe eigenvector u is already normalized. So, the inner product between u and v_normalized is [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 ] / sqrt(6).\n\nWait, let me compute this:\n\nInner product = [ (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) ] / sqrt(6) = [ (-2/sqrt(2)) ] / sqrt(6) = [ -sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(6).\n\nBecause 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2).\n\nSo, inner product is (-sqrt(2)) / sqrt(6) = (-sqrt(2) * sqrt(6)) ) / (6) ) ? Wait, wait, sqrt(6)=sqrt(2*3)=sqrt(2)*sqrt(3). So, sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) is 1/sqrt(3).\n\nWait, sqrt(6) is sqrt(2)*sqrt(3). So,\n\n(-sqrt(2)) / sqrt(6) = (-sqrt(2)) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the inner product is -1/sqrt(3). The absolute value squared is (1/3).\n\nSo, the probability is 1/3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 1/3.

Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors, meaning their length (or norm) is 1. But let me check the norm here. The state is (-1, 2, 1), so the norm squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh wait, that's 6, which is not 1. That's a problem because state vectors must be normalized. Maybe I should normalize it first.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability of measuring a particular value, which is 0 in this case. The observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down matrix P to understand it better. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P looks like this:\n\n0       1/\u221a2      0\n1/\u221a2    0        1/\u221a2\n0       1/\u221a2      0\n\nI think that's a symmetric matrix, which makes sense for an observable because observables are Hermitian.\n\nThe general approach for finding the probability of measuring a particular value (eigenvalue) is to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to that eigenvalue, then project the state onto those eigenvectors and sum the squares of their magnitudes.\n\nWait, but the eigenvalue in question is 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. The probability will be the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the projections of the state vector onto each of these eigenvectors.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value or perhaps look for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute P multiplied by the state, but I'm not sure if that directly gives me the probability. Hmm, maybe I should find the eigenvalues of P first.\n\nLet me think: the eigenvalues of P can be found by solving det(P - \u03bbI) = 0. But given the structure of P, maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLooking at P, it's a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:\n\nRow 1: 0  1/\u221a2  0\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2 0  1/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0  1/\u221a2 0\n\nWait, I notice that each diagonal element is 0, and the off-diagonal elements have 1/sqrt(2) in a symmetric pattern. Hmm, maybe the eigenvalues can be found by considering the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by guessing eigenvectors. Let's see:\n\nSuppose I have an eigenvector v = (a, b, c). Then, Pv should equal \u03bbv.\n\nSo for the first component: 0*a + (1/\u221a2)*b + 0*c = \u03bb a \u2192 (b)/(\u221a2) = \u03bb a.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*a + 0*b + (1/\u221a2)*c = \u03bb b \u2192 (a + c)/\u221a2 = \u03bb b.\n\nThird component: 0*a + (1/\u221a2)*b + 0*c = \u03bb c \u2192 (b)/(\u221a2) = \u03bb c.\n\nHmm, so from first and third equations:\n\nFrom first: b = \u03bb a \u221a2.\n\nFrom third: b = \u03bb c \u221a2.\n\nSo, \u03bb a \u221a2 = \u03bb c \u221a2 \u2192 \u03bb a = \u03bb c. If \u03bb is not zero, then a = c.\n\nIf \u03bb is zero, then from first equation, 0 = 0 * a, which is always true, so maybe \u03bb=0 is an eigenvalue.\n\nWait, let's check for \u03bb=0.\n\nIf \u03bb=0, then from first equation: b/(\u221a2) =0 \u2192 b=0.\n\nSimilarly, third equation gives same result.\n\nSecond equation: (a + c)/\u221a2 = 0 \u2192 a + c =0 \u2192 c= -a.\n\nSo the eigenvectors when \u03bb=0 would be vectors where b=0 and c= -a. So the eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a) = a*(1,0,-1). So any vector in the direction (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me substitute this into P and see.\n\nLet me take a vector v = (1, 0, -1). Let's compute Pv.\n\nPv = [0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1), \n       (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1), \n       0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1)]\n\nCalculating each component:\n\nFirst component: 0 +0 +0=0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(1) + (1/\u221a2)(-1) = (1 -1)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0 +0 +0=0.\n\nSo Pv = (0, 0, 0) = 0 * v. So yes, v is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb=0 is an eigenvalue of P, with eigenvectors in the direction (1,0,-1) and any scalar multiples.\n\nBut wait, since the matrix P is 3x3, and we have a 3-dimensional space, there should be three eigenvalues (with multiplicity). So the other eigenvalues must satisfy the characteristic equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the trace and other properties.\n\nThe trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of the eigenvalues is zero.\n\nThe determinant of P would be the product of the eigenvalues. Hmm, but perhaps I don't need to find all eigenvalues right now.\n\nBut for the problem at hand, I'm interested in the probability of measuring 0. So I need to find the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then project the given state onto that eigenspace, and the square of the norm of that projection gives the probability.\n\nWait, but what is the eigenspace? The eigenvector I found is (1,0,-1). But wait, is that the only eigenvector for \u03bb=0, or are there others?\n\nWait, let me check the matrix P again. Let me try another vector. Suppose I have v=(0,1,0). Let me compute Pv.\n\nPv would be:\n\nFirst component: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSo Pv = (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2).\n\nIf I multiply v by \u03bb, for v to be an eigenvector, we need Pv = \u03bb v.\n\nSo (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2) = \u03bb (0,1,0).\n\nBut the second component is 0, which would require \u03bb=0, but then the first and third components would have to be zero, which they aren't. So v=(0,1,0) is not an eigenvector for any \u03bb except possibly 0, but that doesn't work here.\n\nSo perhaps the only eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is the one we found, (1,0,-1). But wait, perhaps there are more eigenvectors. Let me check another vector.\n\nWhat about v=(1,1,-1)? Let's compute Pv.\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*(-1) = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1 -1)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*(-1) = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSo Pv = (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2).\n\nIf this equals \u03bb v, then:\n\n1/\u221a2 = \u03bb * 1 \u2192 \u03bb=1/\u221a2.\n\n0 = \u03bb *1 \u2192 \u03bb=0. Contradiction. So this vector isn't an eigenvector.\n\nHmm, maybe the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps there are other eigenvectors.\n\nWait, another approach: the trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. Suppose that P has eigenvalues 0, a, -a. Then the trace would be 0 + a + (-a) =0, which fits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P has eigenvalues 1, -1, 0. Let me check: perhaps it's a symmetric matrix with eigenvalues 1, -1, 0.\n\nWait, perhaps P is a projection operator. Because P squared would equal P if it's a projection. Let me compute P squared to see.\n\nCompute P^2:\n\nFirst row of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0].\n\nMultiplying P by P:\n\nEach element (i,j) is the dot product of row i of first P and column j of second P.\n\nSo, (P^2)_{1,1} = 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = (1/2).\n\nSimilarly, (P^2)_{1,2} = 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute each element.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P^2 is equal to (1/2) * I, where I is the identity matrix. Let me check.\n\nWait, let's compute (P^2)_{1,1}:\n\nRow 1 of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0].\n\nColumn 1 of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0].\n\nDot product: (0)(0) + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + (0)(0) = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, (P^2)_{2,2}:\n\nRow 2 of P is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2].\n\nColumn 2 of P is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2].\n\nDot product: (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.\n\nWait, that's 1, not 1/2. So P^2 is not equal to (1/2) I. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute P^2 more carefully.\n\nLet me compute each element:\n\nRow 1 of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0].\n\nColumn 1 of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0].\n\nSo (P^2)_{1,1} = 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, (P^2)_{1,2} = 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\n(P^2)_{1,3} = 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nWait, that's row 1, column 3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the correct way to compute (P^2)_{i,j} is the dot product of row i of P and column j of P.\n\nSo for (P^2)_{1,1}:\n\nRow 1 of P: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nColumn 1 of P: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nSo 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, (P^2)_{1,2}:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] multiplied by column 2 of P: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2].\n\nSo 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nWait, but that's (P^2)_{1,2} = 0.\n\nHmm, but I'm getting some non-zero elements, so P^2 isn't the identity. So maybe it's not a projection operator. Hmm, but perhaps I can proceed differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation. Let's try that.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nP - \u03bb I is:\n\n[ -\u03bb    1/\u221a2    0    ]\n\n[1/\u221a2   -\u03bb    1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 0     1/\u221a2   -\u03bb  ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix should be zero.\n\nCalculating the determinant:\n\n-\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] - (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ].\n\nWait, perhaps expanding along the first row.\n\nSo determinant = (-\u03bb) * det [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ]  - (1/\u221a2) * det [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 * something.\n\nWait, more accurately, the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ] \n+ 0 * [ ... ]\n\nSo:\n\n= -\u03bb [ \u03bb^2 - (1/2) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) - 0 ]\n+ 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2).\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2).\n\nBecause (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo combining terms:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2 )=0.\n\nSo the solutions are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb= -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nTherefore, the possible outcomes of a measurement are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nBut the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So the eigenspace corresponding to \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, as earlier. So the probability is the square of the norm of the projection of the state onto this eigenspace.\n\nWait, but I should make sure the eigenvectors are orthonormal. So for \u03bb=0, the eigenvector is (1,0,-1). Let me normalize it.\n\nThe norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, the state vector given is (-1, 2, 1). But wait, earlier I noticed that the state vector has a norm squared of (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2=6. So to get a unit vector, we'd have to divide by sqrt(6). But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.\n\nWait, because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be a unit vector. But the given state here is (-1, 2, 1), which has a norm squared of 6. So perhaps the actual state vector is (-1,2,1) divided by sqrt(6). But I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = 1/sqrt(6) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nThe eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is |v0> = 1/sqrt(2) [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nThe probability is | <v0 | \u03c8> |\u00b2.\n\nCompute the inner product:\n\n<v0 | \u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2))(1) * (-1)/sqrt(6) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) * (2)/sqrt(6) + (1/sqrt(2))(-1) * (1)/sqrt(6).\n\nWait, more accurately:\n\nIt's the sum of the products of the corresponding components.\n\nSo:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + (0) * (2/sqrt(6)) + ( (-1/sqrt(2)) ) * (1/sqrt(6)).\n\nSo:\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\n= [ (-1) / sqrt(12) ) ] + [ (-1) / sqrt(12) ) ]\n\n= [ (-2) / (2*sqrt(3)) ) ] because sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3).\n\n= (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption C is 1/3.\n\nSo the correct answer should be C.\n",

So yes, v is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb=0 is an eigenvalue of P, with eigenvectors in the direction (1,0,-1) and any scalar multiples.\n\nBut wait, since the matrix P is 3x3, and we have a 3-dimensional space, there should be three eigenvalues (with multiplicity). So the other eigenvalues must satisfy the characteristic equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the trace and other properties.\n\nThe trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of the eigenvalues is zero.\n\nThe determinant of P would be the product of the eigenvalues. Hmm, but perhaps I don't need to find all eigenvalues right now.\n\nBut for the problem at hand, I'm interested in the probability of measuring 0. So I need to find the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then project the given state onto that eigenspace, and the square of the norm of that projection gives the probability.\n\nWait, but what is the eigenspace? The eigenvector I found is (1,0,-1). But wait, is that the only eigenvector for \u03bb=0, or are there others?\n\nWait, let me check the matrix P again. Let me try another vector. Suppose I have v=(0,1,0). Let me compute Pv.\n\nPv would be:\n\nFirst component: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSo Pv = (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2).\n\nIf I multiply v by \u03bb, for v to be an eigenvector, we need Pv = \u03bb v.\n\nSo (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2) = \u03bb (0,1,0).\n\nBut the second component is 0, which would require \u03bb=0, but then the first and third components would have to be zero, which they aren't. So v=(0,1,0) is not an eigenvector for any \u03bb except possibly 0, but that doesn't work here.\n\nSo perhaps the only eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is the one we found, (1,0,-1). But wait, perhaps there are more eigenvectors. Let me check another vector.\n\nWhat about v=(1,1,-1)? Let's compute Pv.\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*(-1) = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1 -1)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*(-1) = 1/\u221a2.\n\nSo Pv = (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2).\n\nIf this equals \u03bb v, then:\n\n1/\u221a2 = \u03bb * 1 \u2192 \u03bb=1/\u221a2.\n\n0 = \u03bb *1 \u2192 \u03bb=0. Contradiction. So this vector isn't an eigenvector.\n\nHmm, maybe the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps there are other eigenvectors.\n\nWait, another approach: the trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. Suppose that P has eigenvalues 0, a, -a. Then the trace would be 0 + a + (-a) =0, which fits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P has eigenvalues 1, -1, 0. Let me check: perhaps it's a symmetric matrix with eigenvalues 1, -1, 0.\n\nWait, perhaps P is a projection operator. Because P squared would equal P if it's a projection. Let me compute P squared to see.\n\nCompute P^2:\n\nFirst row of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0].\n\nMultiplying P by P:\n\nEach element (i,j) is the dot product of row i of first P and column j of second P.\n\nSo, (P^2)_{1,1} = 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = (1/2).\n\nSimilarly, (P^2)_{1,2} = 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute each element.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P^2 is equal to (1/2) * I, where I is the identity matrix. Let me check.\n\nWait, let's compute (P^2)_{1,1}:\n\nRow 1 of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0].\n\nColumn 1 of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0].\n\nDot product: (0)(0) + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + (0)(0) = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, (P^2)_{2,2}:\n\nRow 2 of P is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2].\n\nColumn 2 of P is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2].\n\nDot product: (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.\n\nWait, that's 1, not 1/2. So P^2 is not equal to (1/2) I. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute P^2 more carefully.\n\nLet me compute each element:\n\nRow 1 of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0].\n\nColumn 1 of P is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0].\n\nSo (P^2)_{1,1} = 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, (P^2)_{1,2} = 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\n(P^2)_{1,3} = 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nWait, that's row 1, column 3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the correct way to compute (P^2)_{i,j} is the dot product of row i of P and column j of P.\n\nSo for (P^2)_{1,1}:\n\nRow 1 of P: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nColumn 1 of P: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0.\n\nSo 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, (P^2)_{1,2}:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] multiplied by column 2 of P: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2].\n\nSo 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nWait, but that's (P^2)_{1,2} = 0.\n\nHmm, but I'm getting some non-zero elements, so P^2 isn't the identity. So maybe it's not a projection operator. Hmm, but perhaps I can proceed differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation. Let's try that.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nP - \u03bb I is:\n\n[ -\u03bb    1/\u221a2    0    ]\n\n[1/\u221a2   -\u03bb    1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 0     1/\u221a2   -\u03bb  ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix should be zero.\n\nCalculating the determinant:\n\n-\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] - (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ].\n\nWait, perhaps expanding along the first row.\n\nSo determinant = (-\u03bb) * det [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ]  - (1/\u221a2) * det [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 * something.\n\nWait, more accurately, the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ] \n+ 0 * [ ... ]\n\nSo:\n\n= -\u03bb [ \u03bb^2 - (1/2) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) - 0 ]\n+ 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2).\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2).\n\nBecause (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo combining terms:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2 )=0.\n\nSo the solutions are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, \u03bb= -1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nTherefore, the possible outcomes of a measurement are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nBut the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So the eigenspace corresponding to \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, as earlier. So the probability is the square of the norm of the projection of the state onto this eigenspace.\n\nWait, but I should make sure the eigenvectors are orthonormal. So for \u03bb=0, the eigenvector is (1,0,-1). Let me normalize it.\n\nThe norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, the state vector given is (-1, 2, 1). But wait, earlier I noticed that the state vector has a norm squared of (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2=6. So to get a unit vector, we'd have to divide by sqrt(6). But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.\n\nWait, because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be a unit vector. But the given state here is (-1, 2, 1), which has a norm squared of 6. So perhaps the actual state vector is (-1,2,1) divided by sqrt(6). But I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = 1/sqrt(6) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nThe eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is |v0> = 1/sqrt(2) [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nThe probability is | <v0 | \u03c8> |\u00b2.\n\nCompute the inner product:\n\n<v0 | \u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2))(1) * (-1)/sqrt(6) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) * (2)/sqrt(6) + (1/sqrt(2))(-1) * (1)/sqrt(6).\n\nWait, more accurately:\n\nIt's the sum of the products of the corresponding components.\n\nSo:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + (0) * (2/sqrt(6)) + ( (-1/sqrt(2)) ) * (1/sqrt(6)).\n\nSo:\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]\n\n= [ (-1) / sqrt(12) ) ] + [ (-1) / sqrt(12) ) ]\n\n= [ (-2) / (2*sqrt(3)) ) ] because sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3).\n\n= (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption C is 1/3.\n\nSo the correct answer should be C.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) to yield 0, given the state of the system as the column vector \\((-1, 2, 1)\\). The observable \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Eigenvalues of \\( P \\):**  \n   The eigenvalues of \\( P \\) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \\(\\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0\\).

Solving this, the eigenvectors are of the form \\((1, 0, -1)\\), normalized to \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)\\).\n\n3. **State Vector Normalization:**  \n   The given state vector \\((-1, 2, 1)\\) has a norm squared of \\((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 6\\). Thus, the normalized state is:\n   \\[\n   |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Projection onto the Eigenspace of \\(\\lambda = 0\\):**  \n   The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the projection of \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) onto the eigenspace of \\(\\lambda = 0\\). The normalized eigenvector for \\(\\lambda = 0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   |v_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n   \\]\n   The inner product is:\n   \\[\n   \\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n   \\]\n   Calculating:\n   \\[\n   \\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{6}} + 0 + \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\right) = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n   \\]\n   The absolute value squared is:\n   \\[\n   |\\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Probability of Measuring 0:**  \n   The probability of measuring 0 is therefore \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability of measuring 0 is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting 0 as the outcome. \n\nThe state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, that's a 3x1 vector. And the observable P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). \n\nWait, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues (which correspond to possible measurement outcomes) are real. Let me check if P is Hermitian. To be Hermitian, the matrix must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements here are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let me see: \n\nP's first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. The first column of P should be the same as the first row of P^T, which would be the first column of the original matrix. Wait, let me write out the matrix P:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo the transpose of P would have columns as rows. So the first column of P^T is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], which is the same as the first row of P. So it seems symmetric. Wait, but the element at (2,3) is 1/\u221a2, and (3,2) is also 1/\u221a2. So yes, the matrix is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So that's good because it's an observable.\n\nNow, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components should be 1. Let me check that.\n\nCompute (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the state vector is not normalized. That's a problem. So I think I should normalize it first. \n\nThe norm is sqrt(6), so each component should be divided by sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector would be ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ). Because when you take the inner product, you have to use the normalized state for probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people don't normalize, but I think in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be unit vectors. So the given state isn't a unit vector, so maybe I need to normalize it before proceeding.\n\nSo, the state vector |\u03c8> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T divided by sqrt(6). So |\u03c8> = 1/sqrt(6) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nNow, the observable P has eigenvalues, and the possible measurement outcomes are its eigenvalues. We're interested in the probability that the measurement yields 0.\n\nWait, but how do I find the probability of getting 0? I think that when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P has 0 as an eigenvalue, and I can find the eigenvectors corresponding to 0. Then, the probability would be the square of the amplitude of the projection of |\u03c8> onto that eigenvector.\n\nSo let's find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:\n\n[ 0         1/\u221a2       0        ]\n\n[1/\u221a2      0         1/\u221a2     ]\n\n[ 0         1/\u221a2       0        ]\n\nHmm, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) =0.\n\nLet me write out P - \u03bbI:\n\n[ -\u03bb       1/\u221a2       0        ]\n\n[1/\u221a2     -\u03bb        1/\u221a2     ]\n\n[ 0        1/\u221a2      -\u03bb       ]\n\nCalculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix:\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] \n    - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] \n    + 0 * [ ... ] \n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute using expansion by minors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can notice some symmetry or properties of the matrix. Let me consider that this matrix is a tridiagonal matrix with -\u03bb on the diagonal and 1/\u221a2 on the off-diagonal.\n\nWait, but for a 3x3 matrix, the determinant calculation is manageable.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] \n   - (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] \n   + 0 [ ... ]\n\nSo that's:\n\n-\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ] \n   - (1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2 ) ] \n   + 0 \n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/(\u221a2)) * (1/\u221a2) )\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2)\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * ( (1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb) ) = - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) )= (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2) )=0\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb=0 and \u03bb=\u00b11.\n\nAh, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1. So the question is about the probability of measuring 0.\n\nSo the next step is to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, then compute the projection of |\u03c8> onto this eigenvector.\n\nSo we need to find the eigenvectors for P when \u03bb=0.\n\nSo when \u03bb=0, the matrix P - 0*I = P.\n\nSo the system of equations is P |v> = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow 3: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 same as row 1, so v2=0.\n\nSo from row 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) where v1 is any scalar.\n\nSo, the eigenspace is one-dimensional (since the equations give two constraints, but one is dependent). So the eigenvector can be written as v1*(1, 0, -1). To make it a unit vector, we'd divide by sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, the eigenvector |v0> corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, the state vector |\u03c8> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6). Let me compute the inner product between |\u03c8> and |v0> to find the amplitude.\n\nThe inner product is \u03c8\u2020 v0.\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]\n\nv0 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ]\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n( -1/sqrt(6) * 1/sqrt(2) ) + (2/sqrt(6) * 0 ) + (1/sqrt(6) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )\n\nWhich is [ -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ] + 0 + [ -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ]\n\nCombine terms: [ -2 ] / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )\n\nSimplify denominator: sqrt(6*2) = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, -2/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = -1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe amplitude is -1/sqrt(3). The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude. So | -1/sqrt(3) |^2 = 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I did the inner product correctly.\n\nWait, |\u03c8> is ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6), and |v0> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n( (-1)/sqrt(6) )*(1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6) )*(0) + (1/sqrt(6) )*( (-1)/sqrt(2) )\n\nWhich is [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\nSo that's two terms of (-1)/(sqrt(12)) each.\n\nWait, sqrt(6)*sqrt(2) is sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3). So each term is (-1)/(2 sqrt(3)), so two terms give (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo yes, the inner product is (-1)/sqrt(3). The square of the absolute value is (1/3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting 0 as the outcome. \n\nThe state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, that's a 3x1 vector. And the observable P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). \n\nWait, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues (which correspond to possible measurement outcomes) are real. Let me check if P is Hermitian. To be Hermitian, the matrix must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements here are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let me see: \n\nP's first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. The first column of P should be the same as the first row of P^T, which would be the first column of the original matrix. Wait, let me write out the matrix P:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo the transpose of P would have columns as rows. So the first column of P^T is [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], which is the same as the first row of P. So it seems symmetric. Wait, but the element at (2,3) is 1/\u221a2, and (3,2) is also 1/\u221a2. So yes, the matrix is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So that's good because it's an observable.\n\nNow, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components should be 1. Let me check that.\n\nCompute (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the state vector is not normalized. That's a problem. So I think I should normalize it first. \n\nThe norm is sqrt(6), so each component should be divided by sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector would be ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ). Because when you take the inner product, you have to use the normalized state for probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people don't normalize, but I think in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be unit vectors. So the given state isn't a unit vector, so maybe I need to normalize it before proceeding.\n\nSo, the state vector |\u03c8> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T divided by sqrt(6). So |\u03c8> = 1/sqrt(6) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nNow, the observable P has eigenvalues, and the possible measurement outcomes are its eigenvalues. We're interested in the probability that the measurement yields 0.\n\nWait, but how do I find the probability of getting 0? I think that when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P has 0 as an eigenvalue, and I can find the eigenvectors corresponding to 0. Then, the probability would be the square of the amplitude of the projection of |\u03c8> onto that eigenvector.\n\nSo let's find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:\n\n[ 0         1/\u221a2       0        ]\n\n[1/\u221a2      0         1/\u221a2     ]\n\n[ 0         1/\u221a2       0        ]\n\nHmm, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) =0.\n\nLet me write out P - \u03bbI:\n\n[ -\u03bb       1/\u221a2       0        ]\n\n[1/\u221a2     -\u03bb        1/\u221a2     ]\n\n[ 0        1/\u221a2      -\u03bb       ]\n\nCalculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix:\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] \n    - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] \n    + 0 * [ ... ] \n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute using expansion by minors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can notice some symmetry or properties of the matrix. Let me consider that this matrix is a tridiagonal matrix with -\u03bb on the diagonal and 1/\u221a2 on the off-diagonal.\n\nWait, but for a 3x3 matrix, the determinant calculation is manageable.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] \n   - (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] \n   + 0 [ ... ]\n\nSo that's:\n\n-\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ] \n   - (1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2 ) ] \n   + 0 \n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/(\u221a2)) * (1/\u221a2) )\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2)\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) * ( (1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb) ) = - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) )= (\u03bb)/(2)\n\nThird term is zero.\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 )=0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2) )=0\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb=0 and \u03bb=\u00b11.\n\nAh, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1. So the question is about the probability of measuring 0.\n\nSo the next step is to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, then compute the projection of |\u03c8> onto this eigenvector.\n\nSo we need to find the eigenvectors for P when \u03bb=0.\n\nSo when \u03bb=0, the matrix P - 0*I = P.\n\nSo the system of equations is P |v> = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u2192 v1 = -v3.\n\nRow 3: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 same as row 1, so v2=0.\n\nSo from row 1 and 3, v2=0. From row 2, v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) where v1 is any scalar.\n\nSo, the eigenspace is one-dimensional (since the equations give two constraints, but one is dependent). So the eigenvector can be written as v1*(1, 0, -1). To make it a unit vector, we'd divide by sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, the eigenvector |v0> corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, the state vector |\u03c8> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6). Let me compute the inner product between |\u03c8> and |v0> to find the amplitude.\n\nThe inner product is \u03c8\u2020 v0.\n\nSo \u03c8\u2020 is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]\n\nv0 is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ]\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n( -1/sqrt(6) * 1/sqrt(2) ) + (2/sqrt(6) * 0 ) + (1/sqrt(6) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )\n\nWhich is [ -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ] + 0 + [ -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ]\n\nCombine terms: [ -2 ] / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )\n\nSimplify denominator: sqrt(6*2) = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, -2/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = -1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe amplitude is -1/sqrt(3). The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude. So | -1/sqrt(3) |^2 = 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I did the inner product correctly.\n\nWait, |\u03c8> is ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6), and |v0> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n( (-1)/sqrt(6) )*(1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6) )*(0) + (1/sqrt(6) )*( (-1)/sqrt(2) )\n\nWhich is [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\nSo that's two terms of (-1)/(sqrt(12)) each.\n\nWait, sqrt(6)*sqrt(2) is sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3). So each term is (-1)/(2 sqrt(3)), so two terms give (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo yes, the inner product is (-1)/sqrt(3). The square of the absolute value is (1/3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable is represented by matrix operator P, which has specific elements. I need to calculate the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0.\n\nHmm, right. So in quantum mechanics, when you have an observable, like an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state of the system.\n\nWait, but wait. How do I approach this? Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix P. Because the observable P is given, and I want to find the probability of measuring 0. So zero must be one of the eigenvalues of P.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me look at the matrix P. It's a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So, it's a symmetric matrix because P_ij = P_ji. That's good because symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, which should make things easier.\n\nSo, the first step is to find the eigenvalues of P. Since I'm looking for when the measurement yields 0, I'm interested in whether 0 is an eigenvalue of P. If it is, then the eigenvector corresponding to 0 will be important because the probability is the square of the inner product of the state vector and the eigenvector.\n\nWait, but maybe I can find the eigenvalues of P. Let me try to compute them. The characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nLet me write out P - \u03bbI:\n\n[ -\u03bb        1/sqrt(2)        0      ]\n[1/sqrt(2)  -\u03bb          1/sqrt(2) ]\n[ 0        1/sqrt(2)     -\u03bb      ]\n\nHmm, calculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix. That might get a bit messy, but let's try.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] \n- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ] \n+ 0 * [ ... ] \n\nWait, because the third column's first element is zero, that term will be zero, so I can ignore the third term in the expansion.\n\nSo expanding along the first row:\n\n= -\u03bb * [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ] \n- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] \n+ 0\n\nSo:\n\n= -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb / sqrt(2))\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2)\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nSo the characteristic equation is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0. Multiply both sides by -1: \u03bb^3 - \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 -1) =0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. That's good because one of them is 0, which is what we're interested in.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0. Because the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the norm of the component of the state vector in the direction of this eigenvector.\n\nSo let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0. We'll solve (P - 0 I) v = 0, i.e., P v = 0.\n\nSo, the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1. 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0\n2. (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0\n3. 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2=0\n\nSo from equation 1 and 3, v2 must be 0.\n\nEquation 2: v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. Let's choose v1 = 1, then the vector is [1, 0, -1]^T. But wait, we should normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. The eigenvector for \u03bb=0 must satisfy P v =0.\n\nLet me plug in the vector [1,0,-1]^T into P:\n\nP * [1; 0; -1] = ?\n\nRow 1: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = (1/sqrt(2)) - (1/sqrt(2)) = 0\nRow 3: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0\n\nYes, so [1;0;-1] is indeed in the null space of P. So the normalized vector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nNow, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote it as |\u03c8> = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nWe need to find the component of |\u03c8> in the direction of the eigenvector |v> corresponding to \u03bb=0. The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of |\u03c8> and |v>.\n\nSo compute the inner product: <v|\u03c8> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] \u00b7 [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), so 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2). So 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2), so 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) \u2192 2 = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) \u2192 yes, correct.\n\nWait, no: 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) * 2 / 2 = sqrt(2). So, 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2). So -2/sqrt(2) is -sqrt(2).\n\nSo the inner product is -sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because probabilities can't be more than 1. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recalculate the inner product.\n\n|v> is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\n|\u03c8> is [-1, 2, 1].\n\nSo inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nAdding these: (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). Because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), so 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) \u2192 2 = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) \u2192 correct.\n\nSo the inner product is -sqrt(2), but wait, that's a magnitude of sqrt(2), but the probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But that's greater than 1, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.\n\nHmm, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in normalization. Let me check the eigenvector again.\n\nWait, the eigenvector I found was [1, 0, -1], which when normalized would be [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)], because the norm is sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the state vector is [-1, 2, 1]. Let me compute the inner product again.\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). So the absolute value is sqrt(2), and the square is 2. But this can't be correct because probabilities can't be over 100%. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector calculation. Let me check.\n\nWe found that for \u03bb=0, the equations are:\n\nv2 = 0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0.\n\nSo any vector where v2=0 and v3 = -v1 is an eigenvector.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form [a, 0, -a]^T, where a is any scalar. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but when I compute the inner product, I get a value whose square is 2. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product.\n\nWait, let me compute it again.\n\nInner product: (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.\n\nSo that's (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). So the magnitude is sqrt(2), so square is 2. But this is impossible because the state vector is not normalized.\n\nWait a second! Oh, wait, the state vector given is [-1, 2, 1]. I should check if it's normalized.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. That's a problem because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually assumed to be normalized. But in this problem, maybe it's given as is.\n\nSo the inner product is -sqrt(2), and the square is 2. But since the state vector isn't normalized, perhaps I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, no. Because the inner product is (v|\u03c8), and the probability is |v|\u03c8>|^2 divided by the norm of \u03c8 squared?\n\nWait, no. Because the state vector |\u03c8> might not be normalized. In quantum mechanics, the probabilities are given by |<v|\u03c8>|^2 / <\u03c8|\u03c8>, because the state vector must have a norm of 1. So if the state isn't normalized, you have to normalize it first.\n\nWait, let me think. The state vector is given as |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state is |\u03c8> / sqrt(6).\n\nSo the correct inner product is <v| (\u03c8 / sqrt(6)) ), because the state must be normalized.\n\nSo the inner product is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] \u00b7 [ -1; 2; 1 ] / sqrt(6).\n\nSo compute this:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nSo the inner product is (-sqrt(2)) / sqrt(6).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (sqrt(2)/sqrt(6))^2 = (2)/(6) = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the correct probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nBut let me make sure I did everything correctly.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find eigenvalues of P. Found 0, 1, -1.\n\n2. For \u03bb=0, find eigenvector [1,0,-1]^T, normalized to [1/sqrt(2),0,-1/sqrt(2)].\n\n3. Compute inner product with state vector [-1,2,1], which is not normalized. The inner product is -sqrt(2).\n\n4. Since the state vector's norm is sqrt(6), the actual inner product is (-sqrt(2))/sqrt(6).\n\n5. Square the absolute value: (sqrt(2)/sqrt(6))^2 = 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable is represented by matrix operator P, which has specific elements. I need to calculate the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0.\n\nHmm, right. So in quantum mechanics, when you have an observable, like an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state of the system.\n\nWait, but wait. How do I approach this? Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix P. Because the observable P is given, and I want to find the probability of measuring 0. So zero must be one of the eigenvalues of P.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me look at the matrix P. It's a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So, it's a symmetric matrix because P_ij = P_ji. That's good because symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, which should make things easier.\n\nSo, the first step is to find the eigenvalues of P. Since I'm looking for when the measurement yields 0, I'm interested in whether 0 is an eigenvalue of P. If it is, then the eigenvector corresponding to 0 will be important because the probability is the square of the inner product of the state vector and the eigenvector.\n\nWait, but maybe I can find the eigenvalues of P. Let me try to compute them. The characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nLet me write out P - \u03bbI:\n\n[ -\u03bb        1/sqrt(2)        0      ]\n[1/sqrt(2)  -\u03bb          1/sqrt(2) ]\n[ 0        1/sqrt(2)     -\u03bb      ]\n\nHmm, calculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix. That might get a bit messy, but let's try.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] \n- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ] \n+ 0 * [ ... ] \n\nWait, because the third column's first element is zero, that term will be zero, so I can ignore the third term in the expansion.\n\nSo expanding along the first row:\n\n= -\u03bb * [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ] \n- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] \n+ 0\n\nSo:\n\n= -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb / sqrt(2))\n= -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2)\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nSo the characteristic equation is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0. Multiply both sides by -1: \u03bb^3 - \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 -1) =0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. That's good because one of them is 0, which is what we're interested in.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0. Because the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the norm of the component of the state vector in the direction of this eigenvector.\n\nSo let's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0. We'll solve (P - 0 I) v = 0, i.e., P v = 0.\n\nSo, the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1. 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0\n2. (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0\n3. 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 v2=0\n\nSo from equation 1 and 3, v2 must be 0.\n\nEquation 2: v1 + v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nSo the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. Let's choose v1 = 1, then the vector is [1, 0, -1]^T. But wait, we should normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. The eigenvector for \u03bb=0 must satisfy P v =0.\n\nLet me plug in the vector [1,0,-1]^T into P:\n\nP * [1; 0; -1] = ?\n\nRow 1: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = (1/sqrt(2)) - (1/sqrt(2)) = 0\nRow 3: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0\n\nYes, so [1;0;-1] is indeed in the null space of P. So the normalized vector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.\n\nNow, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote it as |\u03c8> = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nWe need to find the component of |\u03c8> in the direction of the eigenvector |v> corresponding to \u03bb=0. The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of |\u03c8> and |v>.\n\nSo compute the inner product: <v|\u03c8> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] \u00b7 [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), so 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2). So 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2), so 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) \u2192 2 = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) \u2192 yes, correct.\n\nWait, no: 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) * 2 / 2 = sqrt(2). So, 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2). So -2/sqrt(2) is -sqrt(2).\n\nSo the inner product is -sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because probabilities can't be more than 1. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recalculate the inner product.\n\n|v> is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].\n\n|\u03c8> is [-1, 2, 1].\n\nSo inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nAdding these: (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). Because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), so 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) \u2192 2 = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) \u2192 correct.\n\nSo the inner product is -sqrt(2), but wait, that's a magnitude of sqrt(2), but the probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But that's greater than 1, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.\n\nHmm, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in normalization. Let me check the eigenvector again.\n\nWait, the eigenvector I found was [1, 0, -1], which when normalized would be [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)], because the norm is sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the state vector is [-1, 2, 1]. Let me compute the inner product again.\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). So the absolute value is sqrt(2), and the square is 2. But this can't be correct because probabilities can't be over 100%. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector calculation. Let me check.\n\nWe found that for \u03bb=0, the equations are:\n\nv2 = 0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0.\n\nSo any vector where v2=0 and v3 = -v1 is an eigenvector.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form [a, 0, -a]^T, where a is any scalar. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional.\n\nSo the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but when I compute the inner product, I get a value whose square is 2. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product.\n\nWait, let me compute it again.\n\nInner product: (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.\n\nSo that's (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). So the magnitude is sqrt(2), so square is 2. But this is impossible because the state vector is not normalized.\n\nWait a second! Oh, wait, the state vector given is [-1, 2, 1]. I should check if it's normalized.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. That's a problem because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually assumed to be normalized. But in this problem, maybe it's given as is.\n\nSo the inner product is -sqrt(2), and the square is 2. But since the state vector isn't normalized, perhaps I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, no. Because the inner product is (v|\u03c8), and the probability is |v|\u03c8>|^2 divided by the norm of \u03c8 squared?\n\nWait, no. Because the state vector |\u03c8> might not be normalized. In quantum mechanics, the probabilities are given by |<v|\u03c8>|^2 / <\u03c8|\u03c8>, because the state vector must have a norm of 1. So if the state isn't normalized, you have to normalize it first.\n\nWait, let me think. The state vector is given as |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state is |\u03c8> / sqrt(6).\n\nSo the correct inner product is <v| (\u03c8 / sqrt(6)) ), because the state must be normalized.\n\nSo the inner product is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] \u00b7 [ -1; 2; 1 ] / sqrt(6).\n\nSo compute this:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nSo the inner product is (-sqrt(2)) / sqrt(6).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (sqrt(2)/sqrt(6))^2 = (2)/(6) = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the correct probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nBut let me make sure I did everything correctly.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find eigenvalues of P. Found 0, 1, -1.\n\n2. For \u03bb=0, find eigenvector [1,0,-1]^T, normalized to [1/sqrt(2),0,-1/sqrt(2)].\n\n3. Compute inner product with state vector [-1,2,1], which is not normalized. The inner product is -sqrt(2).\n\n4. Since the state vector's norm is sqrt(6), the actual inner product is (-sqrt(2))/sqrt(6).\n\n5. Square the absolute value: (sqrt(2)/sqrt(6))^2 = 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the probability of measuring 0 for the observable represented by the matrix operator \\( P \\), given the state vector \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\).

The inner product between \\( \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{norm}} \\) and \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{norm}} | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-1) + 0(2) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(1) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product:\n\n\\[\nP(0) = \\left| \\langle \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{norm}} | \\psi \\rangle \\right|^2 = \\left| -\\sqrt{2} \\right|^2 = 2\n\\]\n\nHowever, the state vector \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) is not normalized. Its norm is:\n\n\\[\n\\|\\psi\\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nThe normalized state is \\( |\\psi\\rangle / \\sqrt{6} \\). The corrected inner product is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{norm}} | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{-\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{6}}\n\\]\n\nThe probability is now:\n\n\\[\nP(0) = \\left| \\frac{-\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{6}} \\right|^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{6}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability of measuring 0 is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Answer: C**",
