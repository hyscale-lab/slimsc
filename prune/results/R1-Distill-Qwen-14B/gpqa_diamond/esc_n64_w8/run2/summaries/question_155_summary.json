      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x.\n\nFirst, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula \u0394P_z = sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.\n\nThe given state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). I think this is a three-component vector, which probably corresponds to a three-level system. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because P_z is diagonal in its eigenbasis.\n\nWait, looking at the matrices provided:\n\nP_x matrix:\nRow 1: 0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: \u0127/\u221a2, 0, \u0127/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0\n\nP_y matrix:\nRow 1: 0, -i\u0127/\u221a2, 0\nRow 2: i\u0127/\u221a2, 0, -i\u0127/\u221a2\nRow 3: 0, i\u0127/\u221a2, 0\n\nP_z matrix:\nRow 1: \u0127, 0, 0\nRow 2: 0, 0, 0\nRow 3: 0, 0, -\u0127\n\nSo P_z is a diagonal matrix, with eigenvalues \u0127, 0, and -\u0127. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which are orthogonal.\n\nThe state vector given is |\u03c8> = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. I should check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components.\n\n(-1/2)^2 = 1/4. (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Sum is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, to find \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I need to compute \u27e8\u03c8| P_z |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nSince P_z is diagonal, it's straightforward. The matrix P_z has elements [ [\u0127, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0,0,-\u0127] ].\n\nSo when I multiply P_z with |\u03c8>, I get a new vector where each component is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.\n\nLet's compute P_z |\u03c8>:\n\nFirst component: \u0127 * (-1/2) = -\u0127/2\nSecond component: 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0\nThird component: (-\u0127) * (-1/2) = \u0127/2\n\nSo P_z |\u03c8> = [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ]^T.\n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8| P_z |\u03c8\u27e9 is the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8> multiplied by this vector.\n\nWait, |\u03c8> is real, so the conjugate doesn't change anything. So the inner product is:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (-1/2)(\u0127/2)\n= ( \u0127/4 ) + 0 + ( - \u0127/4 )\n= 0.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero. That's interesting.\n\nNow, I need to find \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So P_z\u00b2 will have [ \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2 ] on the diagonal.\n\nSo, P_z\u00b2 |\u03c8> would be [ (\u0127\u00b2)(-1/2), 0*(1/sqrt(2)), (\u0127\u00b2)(-1/2) ]^T = [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ]^T.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no: P_z squared is diagonal with (\u0127)^2, 0^2, and (-\u0127)^2, so [ \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2 ].\n\nWait no, wait: (\u0127)^2 is \u0127\u00b2, (0)^2 is 0, (-\u0127)^2 is also \u0127\u00b2. So the diagonal elements are \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo when I compute P_z\u00b2 |\u03c8>, each component is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.\n\nSo first component: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = - \u0127\u00b2 / 2\nSecond component: 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0\nThird component: \u0127\u00b2 * (-1/2) = - \u0127\u00b2 / 2\n\nSo P_z\u00b2 |\u03c8> is [ - \u0127\u00b2/2, 0, - \u0127\u00b2/2 ]^T.\n\nThen, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the inner product of |\u03c8> with this vector.\n\nAgain, |\u03c8> is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n(-1/2) * (- \u0127\u00b2/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + (-1/2) * (- \u0127\u00b2/2 )\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/2)(1/2) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/4) \u0127\u00b2\nThird term: same as first term, 1/4 \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo sum is (1/4 + 1/4 ) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 ). Since \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero, \u0394P_z is sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2 ) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nLooking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2), which matches.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, \u0394P_z. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula \u0394A = sqrt(\u27e8A\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8A\u27e9\u00b2), where A is the operator. So, in this case, I'll need to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z\u27e9, then find their difference and take the square root.\n\nThe system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). So, this is the state |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nFirst, I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9. That's the expectation value of P_z in the state |\u03c8\u27e9. To find this, I can use the formula \u27e8\u03c8| P_z |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nWait, but wait. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the given state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z? Or is it not? Hmm. No, the problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state |\u03c8\u27e9 is written in that basis. That simplifies things because if the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, then the components of |\u03c8\u27e9 directly relate to the eigenvalues.\n\nWait, no. Wait. The state |\u03c8\u27e9 is an eigenstate of P_x, not necessarily of P_z. So, in the P_z basis, |\u03c8\u27e9 is a superposition of P_z eigenstates. Therefore, when I compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I can't just take one component, I have to do the matrix multiplication.\n\nSo, let's write down the state |\u03c8\u27e9 as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Let me denote this as a vector [a, b, c]^T, where a = -1/2, b = 1/\u221a2, c = -1/2.\n\nThe matrix P_z is given as:\nRow 1: [\u0127, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, -\u0127]\n\nSo, P_z is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues \u0127, 0, -\u0127 along the diagonal. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors, so each basis vector corresponds to one of these eigenvalues.\n\nNow, the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is computed as \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Let's compute this.\n\nBreaking it down: \u03c8\u2020 is the row vector [a*, b*, c*], which, since all the elements are real, is just [-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2].\n\nSo, \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8 = [a*, b*, c*] * P_z * [a; b; c].\n\nMultiplying this out, since P_z is diagonal, it's just a* * (\u0127 a) + b* * (0 * b) + c* * (-\u0127 c).\n\nBecause P_z has non-zero elements only on the diagonal, the off-diagonal terms in the matrix multiplication will be zero.\n\nSo, substituting the values:\n\na = -1/2, so a* = -1/2\nb = 1/\u221a2, so b* = 1/\u221a2\nc = -1/2, so c* = -1/2\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (-1/2)(\u0127 * (-1/2)) + (1/\u221a2)(0 * (1/\u221a2)) + (-1/2)(-\u0127 * (-1/2))\n\nWait, let me compute each term carefully.\n\nFirst term: a* * (P_z's (1,1) element) * a\nWhich is (-1/2) * \u0127 * (-1/2) = (1/4) \u0127.\n\nSecond term: b* * (P_z's (2,2) element) * b\nWhich is (1/\u221a2) * 0 * (1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nThird term: c* * (P_z's (3,3) element) * c\nWhich is (-1/2) * (-\u0127) * (-1/2) = (-1/2)(-\u0127)(-1/2) = (-1/2)(\u0127/2) )= -\u0127/4.\n\nWait wait, let me recalculate that third term.\n\nWait, P_z's (3,3) element is -\u0127. So,\n\nc* is (-1/2), and c is (-1/2).\n\nSo, c* * (P_z (3,3)) * c = (-1/2) * (-\u0127) * (-1/2) = [(-1/2) * (-\u0127)] * (-1/2) = (\u0127/2) * (-1/2) )= -\u0127/4.\n\nSo, adding all the terms:\n\n(1/4) \u0127 + 0 + (-1/4) \u0127 = 0.\n\nSo, \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.\n\nNow, I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal with elements (\u0127)^2, 0^2, (-\u0127)^2. So, P_z^2 is:\n\n[ (\u0127)^2, 0, 0 ]\n[ 0, 0, 0 ]\n[ 0, 0, (\u0127)^2 ]\n\nWait no, wait. ( -\u0127 ) squared is (\u0127)^2, so yes, the third diagonal element is (\u0127)^2.\n\nSo, P_z\u00b2 is a diagonal matrix with entries \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is \u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 \u03c8.\n\nAgain, since P_z\u00b2 is diagonal, the computation simplifies.\n\nSo, \u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 \u03c8 = a^2 * \u0127\u00b2 + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * \u0127\u00b2.\n\nBecause the diagonal elements are \u0127\u00b2 for the first and third components, zero for the second.\n\nSo,\n\na = -1/2 \u2192 a\u00b2 = (1/4)\nb = 1/\u221a2 \u2192 b\u00b2 = (1/2)\nc = -1/2 \u2192 c\u00b2 = (1/4)\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/4) \u0127\u00b2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/4 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nNow, the variance is \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 = (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = (\u0127) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, that's option B: \u0127 / sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = 0. So that part is correct.\n\n\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9: let me compute each component again.\n\na\u00b2 = ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4.\n\nc\u00b2 = same as a\u00b2, 1/4.\n\nb\u00b2 = (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo,\n\n1/4 * \u0127\u00b2 + 1/2 * 0 + 1/4 * \u0127\u00b2 = (1/4 +1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = 1/2 \u0127\u00b2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the variance is 1/2 \u0127\u00b2, so the square root is (\u0127)/\u221a2.\n\nSo, the uncertainty is \u0127/\u221a2.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, \u0394P_z. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula \u0394A = sqrt(\u27e8A\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8A\u27e9\u00b2), where A is the operator. So, in this case, I'll need to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z\u27e9, then find their difference and take the square root.\n\nThe system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). So, this is the state |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nFirst, I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9. That's the expectation value of P_z in the state |\u03c8\u27e9. To find this, I can use the formula \u27e8\u03c8| P_z |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nWait, but wait. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the given state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z? Or is it not? Hmm. No, the problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state |\u03c8\u27e9 is written in that basis. That simplifies things because if the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, then the components of |\u03c8\u27e9 directly relate to the eigenvalues.\n\nWait, no. Wait. The state |\u03c8\u27e9 is an eigenstate of P_x, not necessarily of P_z. So, in the P_z basis, |\u03c8\u27e9 is a superposition of P_z eigenstates. Therefore, when I compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I can't just take one component, I have to do the matrix multiplication.\n\nSo, let's write down the state |\u03c8\u27e9 as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Let me denote this as a vector [a, b, c]^T, where a = -1/2, b = 1/\u221a2, c = -1/2.\n\nThe matrix P_z is given as:\nRow 1: [\u0127, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, -\u0127]\n\nSo, P_z is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues \u0127, 0, -\u0127 along the diagonal. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors, so each basis vector corresponds to one of these eigenvalues.\n\nNow, the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is computed as \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Let's compute this.\n\nBreaking it down: \u03c8\u2020 is the row vector [a*, b*, c*], which, since all the elements are real, is just [-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2].\n\nSo, \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8 = [a*, b*, c*] * P_z * [a; b; c].\n\nMultiplying this out, since P_z is diagonal, it's just a* * (\u0127 a) + b* * (0 * b) + c* * (-\u0127 c).\n\nBecause P_z has non-zero elements only on the diagonal, the off-diagonal terms in the matrix multiplication will be zero.\n\nSo, substituting the values:\n\na = -1/2, so a* = -1/2\nb = 1/\u221a2, so b* = 1/\u221a2\nc = -1/2, so c* = -1/2\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (-1/2)(\u0127 * (-1/2)) + (1/\u221a2)(0 * (1/\u221a2)) + (-1/2)(-\u0127 * (-1/2))\n\nWait, let me compute each term carefully.\n\nFirst term: a* * (P_z's (1,1) element) * a\nWhich is (-1/2) * \u0127 * (-1/2) = (1/4) \u0127.\n\nSecond term: b* * (P_z's (2,2) element) * b\nWhich is (1/\u221a2) * 0 * (1/\u221a2) = 0.\n\nThird term: c* * (P_z's (3,3) element) * c\nWhich is (-1/2) * (-\u0127) * (-1/2) = (-1/2)(-\u0127)(-1/2) = (-1/2)(\u0127/2) )= -\u0127/4.\n\nWait wait, let me recalculate that third term.\n\nWait, P_z's (3,3) element is -\u0127.

Hmm, let me read it carefully.\n\nThe question involves an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a given matrix form. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which makes sense because usually, you'd work in the eigenbasis of an operator when dealing with its matrix representation.\n\nThe system is found in the eigenstate of Px corresponding to the eigenvalue -\u0127.

So each component of the vector corresponds to the amplitude in the respective eigenstate.\n\nSo the state is a linear combination of |+z\u27e9, |0z\u27e9, and |-z\u27e9, where |+z\u27e9 has eigenvalue \u0127, |0z\u27e9 has 0, and |-z\u27e9 has -\u0127.\n\nSo the state is:\n\n\u03c8 = (-1/2) |+z\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) |0z\u27e9 + (-1/2) |-z\u27e9.\n\nWait, but wait, the components of the vector are (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). So the first component is for |+z\u27e9, second for |0z\u27e9, third for |-z\u27e9.\n\nNow, to compute \u27e8Pz\u27e9, which is \u27e8\u03c8| Pz |\u03c8\u27e9. Since Pz is diagonal in this basis, this should be straightforward. Because in the eigenbasis, Pz acts as multiplying each component by its eigenvalue.\n\nSo, the expectation value \u27e8Pz\u27e9 is the sum over the components squared multiplied by their eigenvalues.\n\nWait, the state is |\u03c8> = a|+z> + b|0z> + c|\u2212z>, where a= -1/2, b=1/\u221a2, c=-1/2.\n\nThen, \u27e8Pz\u27e9 = |a|\u00b2 * \u0127 + |b|\u00b2 * 0 + |c|\u00b2 * (-\u0127).\n\nSo let me compute each squared magnitude.\n\n|a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n|b|^2 = (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2.\n|c|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSo \u27e8Pz\u27e9 = (1/4)*\u0127 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-\u0127) = (1/4 -1/4) \u0127 = 0. So the expectation of Pz is zero.\n\nNow, I need \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9. Since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is just the square of the eigenvalues on the diagonal.\n\nSo, Pz\u00b2 for |+z> is (\u0127)^2, for |0z> it's 0, and for |-z> it's (\u0127)^2.\n\nSo \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 is |a|^2*(\u0127^2) + |b|^2*(0) + |c|^2*(\u0127^2).\n\nSo:\n\n(1/4) * \u0127\u00b2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* \u0127\u00b2 = (1/4 +1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty is sqrt( \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8Pz\u27e9\u00b2 ). Since \u27e8Pz\u27e9 is zero, this is sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = sqrt(1/2) * \u0127 = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2), option C is \u0127/2.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the state. The state is (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Are those the correct components? Let me confirm.\n\nThe vector is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ].\n\nSo |a|\u00b2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, same for |c|\u00b2.\n\n|b|\u00b2 is (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the calculations above are correct.\n\nSo the uncertainty \u0394Pz is sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = (\u0127\u221a(1/2)) ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2), which is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty. Hmm, let me read it carefully.\n\nThe question involves an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a given matrix form. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which makes sense because usually, you'd work in the eigenbasis of an operator when dealing with its matrix representation.\n\nThe system is found in the eigenstate of Px corresponding to the eigenvalue -\u0127. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty \u0394Pz of the operator Pz.\n\nWait, the uncertainty is given by the standard deviation, right? So the formula is \u0394Pz = sqrt( <Pz\u00b2> - <Pz>\u00b2 ). But since Pz is an observable, and the state is given, I can compute the expectation values.\n\nFirst, I think I need to compute the expectation value of Pz, \u27e8Pz\u27e9, and the expectation value of Pz squared, \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9. Then, plug them into the uncertainty formula.\n\nThe state is |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. Wait, let me check the vector. The first element is -1/2, second is 1/\u221a2, third is -1/2. So the vector is (-1/2, \u221a2/2, -1/2). Because 1/\u221a2 is \u221a2/2, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the given vector is (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2), but I should express everything in the same basis.\n\nWait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which means that the matrix for Pz is diagonal in this basis. Looking at the Pz matrix:\n\nPz has first row (\u0127, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-\u0127). So the diagonal entries are \u0127, 0, -\u0127. So the eigenstates of Pz are the basis vectors. So the state |\u03c8> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of Pz.\n\nWait, but the given state is in the basis of Pz's eigenvectors. So each component of the vector corresponds to the amplitude in the respective eigenstate.\n\nSo the state is a linear combination of |+z\u27e9, |0z\u27e9, and |-z\u27e9, where |+z\u27e9 has eigenvalue \u0127, |0z\u27e9 has 0, and |-z\u27e9 has -\u0127.\n\nSo the state is:\n\n\u03c8 = (-1/2) |+z\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) |0z\u27e9 + (-1/2) |-z\u27e9.\n\nWait, but wait, the components of the vector are (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2).

So the expectation of Pz is zero.\n\nNow, I need \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9. Since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is just the square of the eigenvalues on the diagonal.\n\nSo, Pz\u00b2 for |+z> is (\u0127)^2, for |0z> it's 0, and for |-z> it's (\u0127)^2.\n\nSo \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 is |a|^2*(\u0127^2) + |b|^2*(0) + |c|^2*(\u0127^2).\n\nSo:\n\n(1/4) * \u0127\u00b2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* \u0127\u00b2 = (1/4 +1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty is sqrt( \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8Pz\u27e9\u00b2 ).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Alright, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nFirst, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, is calculated using the formula \u0394P_z = sqrt\u27e8\u03c8|P_z\u00b2|\u03c8\u27e9 - (\u27e8\u03c8|P_z|\u03c8\u27e9)^2. So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.\n\nWait, the state \u03c8 is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Oh, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. That probably means the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because in that basis, the matrix representation of P_z is diagonal.\n\nLooking at the matrix for P_z, it's a 3x3 matrix with elements:\nFirst row: (\u0127, 0, 0)\nSecond row: (0, 0, 0)\nThird row: (0, 0, -\u0127)\nSo the eigenvalues are \u0127, 0, and -\u0127, corresponding to the basis vectors.\n\nBut wait, the state given is a column vector with three components. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component of the vector represents the amplitude in each eigenstate. So the state can be written as a linear combination of these eigenstates.\n\nSo the state \u03c8 is a combination of the eigenstates |+> (corresponding to +\u0127), |0> (0), and |-> (-\u0127). The components are:\n- The first component is -1/2, so the amplitude for |+> is -1/2.\n- The second component is 1/sqrt(2), which is the amplitude for |0>.\n- The third component is -1/2, the amplitude for |->.\n\nBut wait, let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.\n\nCalculating: (-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Okay, it's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is simply the sum of each component multiplied by its corresponding eigenvalue. Because in this basis, P_z is diagonal.\n\nSo let's compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9.\n\nThe components are a= -1/2 (for |+>, eigenvalue \u0127),\nb=1/sqrt(2) (for |0>, eigenvalue 0),\nc= -1/2 (for |->, eigenvalue -\u0127).\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = a*\u0127 + b*0 + c*(-\u0127) = (-1/2)\u0127 + 0 + (1/2)\u0127. Because c is -1/2, so when multiplied by -\u0127, it's (1/2)\u0127.\n\nWait, wait: a is -1/2, so a*\u0127 = (-1/2)\u0127. c is -1/2, so c*(-\u0127) = (1/2)\u0127. So adding them: (-1/2 + 1/2) \u0127 = 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero.\n\nThat's interesting. So the average of P_z is zero. Now, for the expectation value of P_z squared, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9.\n\nSince P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So |+> has eigenvalue (\u0127)^2, |0> is 0, |-> is (-\u0127)^2= \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = |a|^2 * (\u0127)^2 + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (\u0127)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n|a|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2.\n|b|^2 is (1/2) because (1/sqrt(2))^2 is 1/2. So (1/2)*0=0.\n|c|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So (1/4)* \u0127\u00b2.\n\nAdding them together: (1/4 + 0 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is the square root of \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - (\u27e8P_z\u27e9)^2. Since \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = (\u0127) * sqrt(1/2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. The formula is sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - (\u27e8P_z\u27e9)^2). Since \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero, it's just sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9), which is sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). So the uncertainty is \u0127/sqrt(2), which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. So the state is a combination of |+> and |->, each with amplitude -1/2, but in the calculation of \u27e8P_z\u27e9, their contributions cancel out. So the average is zero, and the variance is based on their squares.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the uncertainty is \u0127/sqrt(2), which is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Alright, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nFirst, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, is calculated using the formula \u0394P_z = sqrt\u27e8\u03c8|P_z\u00b2|\u03c8\u27e9 - (\u27e8\u03c8|P_z|\u03c8\u27e9)^2. So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.\n\nWait, the state \u03c8 is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Oh, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. That probably means the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because in that basis, the matrix representation of P_z is diagonal.\n\nLooking at the matrix for P_z, it's a 3x3 matrix with elements:\nFirst row: (\u0127, 0, 0)\nSecond row: (0, 0, 0)\nThird row: (0, 0, -\u0127)\nSo the eigenvalues are \u0127, 0, and -\u0127, corresponding to the basis vectors.\n\nBut wait, the state given is a column vector with three components. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component of the vector represents the amplitude in each eigenstate. So the state can be written as a linear combination of these eigenstates.\n\nSo the state \u03c8 is a combination of the eigenstates |+> (corresponding to +\u0127), |0> (0), and |-> (-\u0127). The components are:\n- The first component is -1/2, so the amplitude for |+> is -1/2.\n- The second component is 1/sqrt(2), which is the amplitude for |0>.\n- The third component is -1/2, the amplitude for |->.\n\nBut wait, let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.\n\nCalculating: (-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Okay, it's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is simply the sum of each component multiplied by its corresponding eigenvalue. Because in this basis, P_z is diagonal.\n\nSo let's compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9.\n\nThe components are a= -1/2 (for |+>, eigenvalue \u0127),\nb=1/sqrt(2) (for |0>, eigenvalue 0),\nc= -1/2 (for |->, eigenvalue -\u0127).\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = a*\u0127 + b*0 + c*(-\u0127) = (-1/2)\u0127 + 0 + (1/2)\u0127. Because c is -1/2, so when multiplied by -\u0127, it's (1/2)\u0127.\n\nWait, wait: a is -1/2, so a*\u0127 = (-1/2)\u0127. c is -1/2, so c*(-\u0127) = (1/2)\u0127. So adding them: (-1/2 + 1/2) \u0127 = 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero.\n\nThat's interesting. So the average of P_z is zero. Now, for the expectation value of P_z squared, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9.\n\nSince P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So |+> has eigenvalue (\u0127)^2, |0> is 0, |-> is (-\u0127)^2= \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = |a|^2 * (\u0127)^2 + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (\u0127)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n|a|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2.\n|b|^2 is (1/2) because (1/sqrt(2))^2 is 1/2. So (1/2)*0=0.\n|c|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So (1/4)* \u0127\u00b2.\n\nAdding them together: (1/4 + 0 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is the square root of \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - (\u27e8P_z\u27e9)^2. Since \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = (\u0127) * sqrt(1/2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. The formula is sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - (\u27e8P_z\u27e9)^2). Since \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero, it's just sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9), which is sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). So the uncertainty is \u0127/sqrt(2), which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. So the state is a combination of |+> and |->, each with amplitude -1/2, but in the calculation of \u27e8P_z\u27e9, their contributions cancel out. So the average is zero, and the variance is based on their squares.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the uncertainty is \u0127/sqrt(2), which is option B.\n\n\nTo calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - (\\langle P_z \\rangle)^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle$\nThe given state is expressed as a column vector:\n\n\\[\n\\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nSince the basis vectors are the eigenstates of $P_z$, the matrix representation of $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\\hbar$, $0$, and $-\\hbar$. The state $\\psi$ is a linear combination of these eigenstates, with coefficients corresponding to the components of $\\psi$.\n\nThe expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(0) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(-\\hbar).\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar + \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$\nThe operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\\hbar^2$.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.\n\nThe problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given state. The state is provided as a column vector, and the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in matrix form. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means we're working in the eigenbasis of P_z. Hmm, but wait, the state is given as an eigenstate of P_x, right? Because it says the system is found in the eigenstate of P_x corresponding to eigenvalue -\u0127.\n\nSo, the uncertainty in P_z, \u0394P_z, is calculated using the formula \u0394P_z = sqrt( <P_z\u00b2> - <P_z>\u00b2 ). I remember that formula from my notes. So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.\n\nWait, but the state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. That should make things easier because in that basis, the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z. So maybe I can directly compute the expectation values without getting into more complicated transformations.\n\nThe given state vector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that as a column vector:\n\n\u03c8 = [ -1/2 ]\n        [1/\u221a2 ]\n        [ -1/2 ]\n\nI need to compute <P_z> and <P_z\u00b2>.\n\nFirst, let me write down the matrix for P_z. The problem says that the P_z matrix has the first row as (\u0127, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-\u0127). So P_z is a diagonal matrix:\n\nP_z = \u0127 * [[1, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, -1]]\n\nSo, when we have a state vector in this basis, the expectation value of P_z is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nWait, because the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So each component of \u03c8 corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z.\n\nLet me see. The eigenvectors of P_z are the basis vectors, so the components of \u03c8 are the expansion coefficients in terms of these eigenvectors. So the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements of P_z, which are \u0127, 0, and -\u0127 for the first, second, and third basis vectors respectively.\n\nSo the expectation value <P_z> would be the sum over |c_i|^2 * \u03bb_i, where c_i are the coefficients and \u03bb_i are the eigenvalues.\n\nSo the coefficients are c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/sqrt(2), c3 = -1/2.\n\nCalculating |c1|\u00b2: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Multiply by eigenvalue \u0127: (1/4) * \u0127 = \u0127/4.\n\n|c2|\u00b2: (1/sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 1/2. Multiply by eigenvalue 0: 0.\n\n|c3|\u00b2: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Multiply by eigenvalue -\u0127: (1/4)*(-\u0127) = -\u0127/4.\n\nSo <P_z> = \u0127/4 + 0 - \u0127/4 = 0. That's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.\n\nNow for <P_z\u00b2>, since P_z is diagonal, P_z\u00b2 is just the square of each eigenvalue on the diagonal.\n\nSo P_z\u00b2 matrix would be:\n\n\u0127\u00b2 * [[1, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 1]]\n\nBecause (-\u0127)^2 is \u0127\u00b2, and 0\u00b2 is 0.\n\nSo the expectation value <P_z\u00b2> is the sum of |c_i|\u00b2 multiplied by (\u03bb_i)^2.\n\nSo:\n\n|c1|\u00b2 * (\u0127)^2 = (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2.\n\n|c2|\u00b2 * 0^2 = 0.\n\n|c3|\u00b2 * (-\u0127)^2 = (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2.\n\nAdding them up: (1/4 + 0 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo now, \u0394P_z = sqrt( <P_z\u00b2> - <P_z>\u00b2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = \u0127 * sqrt(1/2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I compute this correctly? Because when I calculate <P_z>, I got zero, which makes the uncertainty just the square root of <P_z\u00b2>.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the uncertainty is \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nLooking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.\n",

So the answer should be B.\n\n\nTo calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle$\nThe given state vector is:\n\n\\[\n\\psi = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe operator $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\\hbar$, $0$, and $-\\hbar$ corresponding to the three basis vectors. Since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\sum_i |c_i|^2 \\lambda_i,\n\\]\n\nwhere $c_i$ are the coefficients of the state vector and $\\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The coefficients are $c_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}$, $c_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, and $c_3 = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Their squared magnitudes are:\n\n\\[\n|c_1|^2 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}, \\quad |c_2|^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad |c_3|^2 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\\lambda_1 = \\hbar$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$, and $\\lambda_3 = -\\hbar$. Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\hbar + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot (-\\hbar) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$\nThe operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with eigenvalues $\\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\\hbar^2$. Using the same coefficients and eigenvalues:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_i |c_i|^2 \\lambda_i^2.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the squared eigenvalues $\\lambda_1^2 = \\hbar^2$, $\\lambda_2^2 = 0$, and $\\lambda_3^2 = \\hbar^2$:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\hbar^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\hbar^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute $\\Delta P_z$\nUsing the formula for uncertainty:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$ and $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. \n\nAlright, first, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula \u0394P = sqrt(\u27e8P\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P\u27e9\u00b2). So I'll need to compute both the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.\n\nWait, but wait. The state of the system is given as a column vector, and it's an eigenstate of P_x. So, the state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ]. I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 in this state.\n\nWait, but wait again. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, that means the state vector is already expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. Oh, that's helpful because it simplifies the computation of expectation values.\n\nSo, let's write down the matrix for P_z. The P_z matrix is given as:\n\n[[\u0127, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, -\u0127]]\n\nSo, the eigenvalues of P_z are \u0127, 0, and -\u0127. The basis vectors are the standard basis vectors, I think. So, the state vector is a combination of these eigenstates.\n\nWait, the state vector is given as ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ). Let me note that the components correspond to the eigenstates of P_z. So, the first component is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue \u0127, the second component is for 0, and the third for -\u0127.\n\nWait, no. Wait a second. Because the matrix P_z has eigenvectors as the basis. So, the first basis vector is [1,0,0], which corresponds to eigenvalue \u0127. The second is [0,1,0], eigenvalue 0. The third is [0,0,1], eigenvalue -\u0127.\n\nSo, the state |\u03c8\u27e9 is a linear combination of these three. Therefore, the components in the vector are the coefficients for each eigenstate.\n\nSo, let me write |\u03c8\u27e9 as:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = (-1/2)|\u0127\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2)|0\u27e9 + (-1/2)|-\u0127\u27e9.\n\nWait, but I should check if the vector given is normalized. Let's compute the norm: ( (-1/2)^2 + (1/\u221a2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 ) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1. So yes, it's normalized.\n\nNow, to find the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9, since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component contributes its eigenvalue multiplied by the square of its amplitude.\n\nSo, \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = |a|^2 * \u0127 + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-\u0127), where a, b, c are the components of the state.\n\nSo, a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2.\n\nCompute |a|^2: (1/2)^2 = 1/4. |c|^2 is also 1/4. |b|^2 is (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo, \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (1/4) * \u0127 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-\u0127) = (1/4 - 1/4) \u0127 = 0.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero. Now, what about \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9?\n\nSince P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is just the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So, the eigenvalues are \u0127, 0, -\u0127. Squared, they become \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is |a|^2 * (\u0127^2) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (\u0127^2).\n\nWhich is (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*\u0127\u00b2 = (1/4 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt( \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9^2 ). Since \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero, this becomes sqrt( (1/2) \u0127\u00b2 ) = sqrt(1/2) * \u0127 = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is \u0127/sqrt(2). So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculations.\n\nSo, |\u03c8\u27e9 is ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 )\n\nCompute \u27e8P_z\u27e9: sum ( |component|^2 * eigenvalue )\n\nSo, first component: (-1/2)^2 * \u0127 = 1/4 \u0127.\n\nSecond component: (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 = 0.\n\nThird component: (-1/2)^2 * (-\u0127) = 1/4 * (-\u0127) = -1/4 \u0127.\n\nSum: 1/4 \u0127 -1/4 \u0127 = 0. Correct.\n\n\u27e8P_z^2\u27e9: same components but eigenvalues squared.\n\nEach component's eigenvalue squared is \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo, (1/4) \u0127\u00b2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/4 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = 1/2 \u0127\u00b2.\n\nSo, \u0394P_z is sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).

Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like \u0394P_z, is calculated using the formula \u0394P_z = sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.\n\nWait, but the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Oh right, because the state is given as a column vector, which is the eigenstate of P_x. But since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That might make things easier because the basis states are |+\u27e9, |0\u27e9, |\u2212\u27e9 for P_z, I suppose.\n\nThe given state vector is (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Let me write this as a column vector: [ -1/2; 1/\u221a2; -1/2 ].\n\nNow, since the state is already in the P_z eigenbasis, calculating \u27e8P_z\u27e9 should be straightforward. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of P_z are... Let me look at the P_z matrix given. The first diagonal element is \u210f, the second is 0, and the third is -\u210f. So the eigenvalues are \u210f, 0, and -\u210f for the three basis states, respectively.\n\nSo the state is a vector with components (a, b, c) where a is the amplitude for the \u210f eigenstate, b for 0, and c for -\u210f.\n\nIn our case, a = -1/2, b = 1/\u221a2, c = -1/2.\n\nBut wait, the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of these amplitudes. So let's calculate |a|\u00b2, |b|\u00b2, |c|\u00b2.\n\n|a|\u00b2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4\n|b|\u00b2 = (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2\n|c|\u00b2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nSo the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is the sum of each probability multiplied by its eigenvalue.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (1/4)*\u210f + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-\u210f)\nSimplify that: (1/4 - 1/4) \u210f + 0 = 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the average value is zero.\n\nNow, I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal in its eigenbasis, P_z squared will have the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P_z squared are (\u210f)^2, 0^2, and (-\u210f)^2, which are \u210f\u00b2, 0, and \u210f\u00b2 respectively.\n\nSo the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is |a|\u00b2*(\u210f\u00b2) + |b|\u00b2*(0) + |c|\u00b2*(\u210f\u00b2).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/4)*\u210f\u00b2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*\u210f\u00b2 = (1/4 + 1/4) \u210f\u00b2 = (1/2) \u210f\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2) \u210f\u00b2.\n\nNow, putting it all into the uncertainty formula:\n\n\u0394P_z = sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2) = sqrt( (1/2 \u210f\u00b2) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2) \u210f\u00b2 ) = (\u210f) * sqrt(1/2) = \u210f / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I did that right. Because the state is in an eigenstate of P_x, which doesn't commute with P_z, so there's definitely some uncertainty. But I think the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, another thought: when the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, the expectation value of P_z is zero, but the expectation of P_z squared is (\u210f\u00b2)(1/4 + 1/4) = \u210f\u00b2/2. So the uncertainty is sqrt(\u210f\u00b2/2) = \u210f / sqrt(2). So that would be option B.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option B is \u210f/\u221a2. So that should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about this: because the state is an eigenstate of P_x, the uncertainty in P_z would be maximum? Or not necessarily. Hmm, but in this case, the uncertainty calculation gives us \u210f/\u221a2.\n\nWait, let me think about the state again. The state is given as (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Let me check if this vector is normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.\n\nSo yeah, the calculations seem correct. So the uncertainty in P_z is \u210f/\u221a2, which is option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like \u0394P_z, is calculated using the formula \u0394P_z = sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.\n\nWait, but the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Oh right, because the state is given as a column vector, which is the eigenstate of P_x. But since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That might make things easier because the basis states are |+\u27e9, |0\u27e9, |\u2212\u27e9 for P_z, I suppose.\n\nThe given state vector is (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Let me write this as a column vector: [ -1/2; 1/\u221a2; -1/2 ].\n\nNow, since the state is already in the P_z eigenbasis, calculating \u27e8P_z\u27e9 should be straightforward. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of P_z are... Let me look at the P_z matrix given. The first diagonal element is \u210f, the second is 0, and the third is -\u210f. So the eigenvalues are \u210f, 0, and -\u210f for the three basis states, respectively.\n\nSo the state is a vector with components (a, b, c) where a is the amplitude for the \u210f eigenstate, b for 0, and c for -\u210f.\n\nIn our case, a = -1/2, b = 1/\u221a2, c = -1/2.\n\nBut wait, the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of these amplitudes. So let's calculate |a|\u00b2, |b|\u00b2, |c|\u00b2.\n\n|a|\u00b2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4\n|b|\u00b2 = (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2\n|c|\u00b2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nSo the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is the sum of each probability multiplied by its eigenvalue.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (1/4)*\u210f + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-\u210f)\nSimplify that: (1/4 - 1/4) \u210f + 0 = 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the average value is zero.\n\nNow, I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the expectation values, right? Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the uncertainty. Oh right, the uncertainty \u0394Pz is the square root of the expectation of Pz squared minus the square of the expectation of Pz. So, mathematically, \u0394Pz = sqrt(\u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8Pz\u27e9\u00b2).\n\nThe state of the system is given as a column vector. Let me write that down. The state vector is (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). I think this is a three-component vector since the matrices are 3x3.\n\nThe operator Pz is given. Let me write its matrix form. The first row is (\u210f, 0, 0), the second is (0, 0, 0), and the third is (0, 0, -\u210f). So Pz is a diagonal matrix with entries \u210f, 0, -\u210f along the diagonal.\n\nWait, no, wait. The problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the state vector is already expressed in that basis, right? So I can compute the expectation values directly using this state.\n\nSo to find \u27e8Pz\u27e9, I need to calculate the state multiplied by Pz, then take the inner product. Alternatively, since the state is in the eigenbasis of Pz, the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each state.\n\nWait, the state is a column vector, so let me denote it as |\u03c8\u27e9 = [a, b, c]^T, where a=-1/2, b=1/\u221a2, c=-1/2. The eigenvalues of Pz are \u210f, 0, -\u210f for the respective basis states. So the expectation value \u27e8Pz\u27e9 is a\u00b2 * \u210f + b\u00b2 * 0 + c\u00b2 * (-\u210f). Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation is the sum of |amplitude|\u00b2 times eigenvalue.\n\nWait, but let me check. So the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of Pz. So |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|e1\u27e9 + b|e2\u27e9 + c|e3\u27e9, where |e1\u27e9, |e2\u27e9, |e3\u27e9 are the eigenvectors of Pz. So when you take \u27e8Pz\u27e9, it's a\u00b2 * (\u210f) + b\u00b2 * 0 + c\u00b2 * (-\u210f). Because |e2\u27e9 has eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: a is -1/2, so a squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, c is -1/2, so c squared is also 1/4. b is 1/sqrt(2), so b squared is (1/2).\n\nSo \u27e8Pz\u27e9 = (1/4)*\u210f + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-\u210f) = [ (1/4 - 1/4) ] * \u210f = 0. Oh, that's interesting. So the expectation of Pz is zero.\n\nNow, what about \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9? Well, since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So the eigenvalues of Pz squared would be \u210f\u00b2, 0, and (\u210f)^2 again. Wait, no. Let me see: Pz is diag(\u210f, 0, -\u210f). So Pz squared is diag(\u210f\u00b2, 0, \u210f\u00b2). So when calculating \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9, it's a\u00b2 * \u210f\u00b2 + b\u00b2 * 0 + c\u00b2 * \u210f\u00b2.\n\nSo a squared is 1/4, c squared is 1/4. So \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/4)*\u210f\u00b2 + 0 + (1/4)*\u210f\u00b2 = (1/4 + 1/4) * \u210f\u00b2 = (1/2) \u210f\u00b2.\n\nSo putting it all together, the uncertainty \u0394Pz is sqrt(\u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8Pz\u27e9\u00b2) = sqrt( (1/2 \u210f\u00b2) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) \u210f = (\u210f) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The state is (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Are these normalized? Let's check the sum of squares: (-1/2)^2 + (1/\u221a2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Oh wait, no: 1/4 + 1/2 is 3/4 plus another 1/4 is 1. So yes, the state is normalized. Good, so our probabilities are correct.\n\nSo \u27e8Pz\u27e9 is zero, and \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2)\u210f\u00b2. So the variance is (1/2)\u210f\u00b2, so the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2) \u210f, which is \u210f/sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B.\n",

The eigenvalues of Pz are \u210f, 0, -\u210f for the respective basis states. So the expectation value \u27e8Pz\u27e9 is a\u00b2 * \u210f + b\u00b2 * 0 + c\u00b2 * (-\u210f). Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation is the sum of |amplitude|\u00b2 times eigenvalue.\n\nWait, but let me check. So the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of Pz. So |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|e1\u27e9 + b|e2\u27e9 + c|e3\u27e9, where |e1\u27e9, |e2\u27e9, |e3\u27e9 are the eigenvectors of Pz. So when you take \u27e8Pz\u27e9, it's a\u00b2 * (\u210f) + b\u00b2 * 0 + c\u00b2 * (-\u210f). Because |e2\u27e9 has eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: a is -1/2, so a squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, c is -1/2, so c squared is also 1/4. b is 1/sqrt(2), so b squared is (1/2).\n\nSo \u27e8Pz\u27e9 = (1/4)*\u210f + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-\u210f) = [ (1/4 - 1/4) ] * \u210f = 0. Oh, that's interesting. So the expectation of Pz is zero.\n\nNow, what about \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9? Well, since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So the eigenvalues of Pz squared would be \u210f\u00b2, 0, and (\u210f)^2 again. Wait, no. Let me see: Pz is diag(\u210f, 0, -\u210f). So Pz squared is diag(\u210f\u00b2, 0, \u210f\u00b2). So when calculating \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9, it's a\u00b2 * \u210f\u00b2 + b\u00b2 * 0 + c\u00b2 * \u210f\u00b2.\n\nSo a squared is 1/4, c squared is 1/4. So \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/4)*\u210f\u00b2 + 0 + (1/4)*\u210f\u00b2 = (1/4 + 1/4) * \u210f\u00b2 = (1/2) \u210f\u00b2.\n\nSo putting it all together, the uncertainty \u0394Pz is sqrt(\u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8Pz\u27e9\u00b2) = sqrt( (1/2 \u210f\u00b2) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) \u210f = (\u210f) / sqrt(2).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The state is (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Are these normalized? Let's check the sum of squares: (-1/2)^2 + (1/\u221a2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Oh wait, no: 1/4 + 1/2 is 3/4 plus another 1/4 is 1. So yes, the state is normalized. Good, so our probabilities are correct.\n\nSo \u27e8Pz\u27e9 is zero, and \u27e8Pz\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2)\u210f\u00b2. So the variance is (1/2)\u210f\u00b2, so the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2) \u210f, which is \u210f/sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle$\nThe state of the system is given as the column vector:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\\hbar$, $0$, and $-\\hbar$, corresponding to the basis states. Since the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\hbar + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 \\cdot 0 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\cdot (-\\hbar).\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n- $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$,\n- $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$,\n- $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSubstituting these values:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\hbar + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot (-\\hbar) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThus, $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$.\n\n### Step 2: Compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$\nThe operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which has eigenvalues $\\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\\hbar^2$. Using the same state $|\\psi\\rangle$, the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\hbar^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 \\cdot 0 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\hbar^2.\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n- $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$,\n- $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$,\n- $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSubstituting these values:\n\n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\hbar^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\hbar^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\hbar^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute $\\Delta P_z$\nThe uncertainty is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\hbar^2$ and $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\hbar^2 - 0} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} \\hbar = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nAnswer: B",
